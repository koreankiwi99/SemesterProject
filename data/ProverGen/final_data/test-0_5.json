Growing up in a family of jewelers, she was fascinated by the way rough gemstones could be transformed into breathtaking works of art. Rayne spent years honing her craft, studying the properties of various minerals and mastering the techniques of faceting, carving, and polishing. Her small workshop became a treasure trove of glittering gemstones, each one carefully selected and shaped to reveal its hidden beauty. Rayne's creations were highly sought after by collectors and jewelry designers, who prized her attention to detail and ability to coax the inner radiance from even the most humble stones.
