LOGICAL VALIDATION
Logically valid: 1/5
Sample 1: Issues found
  The context does not correctly represent Rule 2. Rule 2 states that if {P} is true then {R} is true, but the context only states that if {P} is true then {Q} is true, and if {Q} is true then {R} is true.
  The logical chain is not sound because the context does not establish a direct link from {P} to {R} as required by Rule 2.
  The question format is correct, but the logical reasoning does not correctly apply the rules to determine the answer.
Sample 2: Issues found
  Rule 2 is not fully represented in the context. The part 'if {P} is true then {R} is true' is missing.
  The context does not explicitly state 'if {U} is true then {V} is true' and 'if {V} is true then {W} is true' as per Rule 4.
  The logical chain does not account for the possibility that {R} being false could affect the truth of {X} through the chain of implications.
Sample 3: Issues found
  Rule 2 is not correctly represented in the context. The context does not explicitly state that if {P} is true then {R} is true, which is a part of Rule 2.
  The logical chain does not account for the possibility that {S} is true, which could lead to {T} being true and thus potentially {X} being true even if {R} is not true.
Sample 4: Issues found
  The context does not correctly represent Rule 2. Rule 2 states that if {P} is true then {R} is true, but the context only states that if {P} is true then {Q} is true, and if {Q} is true then {R} is true.
  The logical chain is not sound because Rule 2 is not fully represented in the context, which affects the conclusion.
  The question format is correct, but the logical reasoning to answer it is flawed due to the incorrect representation of Rule 2.
