LOGICAL VALIDATION
Logically valid: 0/5
Sample 1: Issues found
  The context does not correctly represent Rule 3. Rule 3 states that if {S} is true then {U} is true, but the context states that if {S} is true then {T} is true, and if {T} is true then {U} is true, which is covered by Rule 2.
  The question does not follow the expected format exactly. The expected format is 'If Q is not true and U is not true, then is Y true?', but the question uses different phrasing.
  The logical chain is not sound due to the incorrect representation of Rule 3 in the context.
Sample 2: Issues found
  The context does not correctly represent Rule 3. Rule 3 states that if {S} is true then {U} is true, but the context does not include this implication.
  The question does not follow the expected format exactly. The expected format is 'If Q is not true and U is not true, then is Y true?', but the question uses different wording.
  The logical chain is incomplete because Rule 3 is not fully represented in the context.
Sample 3: Issues found
  The context does not correctly represent Rule 3. Rule 3 states that if {S} is true then {U} is true, but this is already covered by Rule 2. Rule 3 should focus on the relationship between {S}, {V}, and {W}.
  The logical chain is not sound because Rule 3 is incorrectly represented, which affects the logical deductions.
  The question does not follow the expected format exactly. The expected format is 'If Q is not true and U is not true, then is Y true?', but the question uses different wording.
Sample 4: Issues found
  The context does not correctly represent Rule 3. Rule 3 states that if {S} is true then {U} is true, but the context states that if {S} is true then {T} is true, which is part of Rule 2.
  The question does not follow the expected format exactly. The expected format is 'If Q is not true and U is not true, then is Y true?', but the question uses different phrasing.
  The logical chain is not sound due to the incorrect representation of Rule 3 in the context.
Sample 5: Issues found
  The context does not correctly represent Rule 3. Rule 3 states that if {S} is true then {U} is true, but the context does not mention this direct implication.
  The question does not follow the expected format exactly. The expected format is 'If Q is not true and U is not true, then is Y true?', but the question uses different wording.
  The logical chain is not sound because Rule 3 is not correctly represented in the context, affecting the reasoning about {U}.
