LOGICAL VALIDATION
Logically valid: 0/5
Sample 1: Issues found
  The context does not correctly represent Rule 1. Rule 1 states that if {P} is true then {Q} is true, and if {Q} is true then {R} is true. However, the context only states these conditions without addressing the scenario where {R} is not true.
  The question does not follow the expected format exactly. The expected question format is 'If R is not true and U is true, then is W true?', but the question provided is 'If the thesis was not approved for final defense and the librarian updated the research database, was the final defense presentation enhanced with new findings?'
  The logical chain is not sound because it does not account for the implications of {R} not being true, which contradicts the chain from {P} to {R}.
Sample 2: Issues found
  The question does not follow the expected format. The expected format is 'If R is not true and U is true, then is W true?', but the question is 'If the budget was not approved for the next quarter and the IT department updated the accounting software, was the financial strategy revised with accurate data?'
  The context does not explicitly state that if {R} is not true, then {P} is not true, which is necessary to determine the truth of {W} based on the given rules.
Sample 3: Issues found
  The question does not follow the expected format. The expected format is 'If R is not true and U is true, then is W true?', but the question is 'If the book was not approved for publication and the graphic designer updated the cover art, was the final manuscript revised with coherent plot lines?'
  The logical chain is not sound. If R is not true, then P cannot be true (from Rule 1), which means Q is not true. Rule 2 allows S to be true, but Rule 3 requires either S to be true or V to be not true. Since U is true, V is true, so S must be true for Rule 3 to hold. If S is true, then T is true (from Rule 3), and if T is true, then W is true (from Rule 4). Therefore, W should be true, but the context does not clearly establish this chain.
Sample 4: Issues found
  The question does not follow the expected format. The expected question format is 'If R is not true and U is true, then is W true?', but the question provided is 'If the construction project was not approved and the safety inspector updated the site safety protocols, was the construction blueprint revised to address structural issues?'
  The context does not fully utilize Rule 3. It states 'either they conduct a feasibility study or the safety compliance of the project does not improve, or both', but does not explicitly state 'either {S} is true or {V} is not true or both'.
  The logical chain is not sound because the context does not provide a clear path from {U} being true to {W} being true without {R} being true.
Sample 5: Issues found
  The context does not correctly represent Rule 3. It states 'either they conduct a focus group study or the targeting accuracy of the campaign does not improve, or both', which is not equivalent to 'either {S} is true or {V} is not true or both'.
  The question does not follow the expected format exactly. The expected format is 'If R is not true and U is true, then is W true?', but the question is phrased differently.
  The logical chain is not sound because Rule 3 is misrepresented, affecting the logical deductions.
