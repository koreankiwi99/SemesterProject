LOGICAL VALIDATION
Logically valid: 3/5
Sample 1: Issues found
  The context does not correctly represent Rule 1. Rule 1 states that either Q is not true or S is not true or both, but the context does not explicitly state this disjunction.
  The question does not follow the expected format exactly. The expected format is 'If P is true and V is not true, then is Y true?', but the question uses different wording.
  The logical chain is not sound because Rule 1's disjunction affects the truth of Q and S, which is not considered in the reasoning.
Sample 5: Issues found
  The context does not correctly represent Rule 1. Rule 1 states that either {Q} is not true or {S} is not true or both, but the context does not explicitly state this disjunction.
  The question does not follow the expected format exactly. The expected format is 'If P is true and V is not true, then is Y true?', but the question uses different wording.
  The logical chain is not sound because the context does not provide a clear path from the given conditions (P is true and V is not true) to the conclusion about Y.
