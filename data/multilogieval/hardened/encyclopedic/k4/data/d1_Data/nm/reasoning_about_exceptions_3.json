John was walking through the parking lot at his local supermarket. As he glanced around at the rows of vehicles, he noticed that most of the cars were red in color. From experience, John knew that red cars typically had four wheels. However, as John scanned the lot, he spotted a red three-wheeled vehicle parked in the back. \"That's interesting,\" John thought. \"Most red cars have four wheels, but this unusual red vehicle only has three.\" John was intrigued by the sight of the atypical red three-wheeler amidst the sea of typical four-wheeled red cars in the lot. It made him realize that even broad generalizations about things like red cars having four wheels don't always apply to every single case.",

Lions are fierce carnivores that rely on hunting to survive. With their powerful jaws and sharp claws, lions are excellent hunters that can take down large prey. Most carnivores need to hunt in order to eat, since they only consume meat. However, there is one unique carnivore that gets its food a different way - the hyena. Unlike other meat eaters, hyenas are opportunistic scavengers rather than active hunters. They use their keen sense of smell to locate leftover carcasses from other animals' kills. By scavenging already dead animals, hyenas can get the meat they need without having to expend energy chasing down live prey. So while lions exemplify the classic carnivore's hunting lifestyle, the hyena demonstrates that not all carnivores need to hunt for their food.",

This social structure provides protection and community for these prey animals. However, not all black and white animals are highly social. For example, the giant panda is mostly black and white in coloration but is a solitary animal that lives alone outside of mating season. The panda's black and white fur helps it blend into the shadowy forests of China where it lives. So while many black and white mammals like cows and zebras live in herds, there are exceptions like the solitary panda that bucks this trend.

John loved riding his bicycle around the neighborhood. He enjoyed feeling the wind blow through his hair as he pedaled down the street. John's bicycle had two wheels, like most bicycles do. He used it mainly for recreation and exercise rather than transportation. While bicycles are commonly used to get from place to place, John preferred simply going for relaxing rides around the block on his bike. One day, he decided to take his bicycle to the park. He rode lazily around the trails, taking in the scenery, rather than using his two-wheeler for any functional purpose. John appreciated that his bicycle gave him the option to ride for pleasure, unlike some other two-wheeled vehicles which are restricted to only serving as transportation.",

In North America, Worx products can be found at numerous major retailers including Lowe's, Walmart, Home Depot, Canadian Tire, and Costco. John brought home a new puppy named Max last week. Max is a tiny fluffy golden retriever who loves to play and cuddle. Since puppies are small animals, they usually live in a cage when they are very young so they have a safe space while being house trained. However, John decided not to keep Max in a cage. Even though Max is a small puppy, John wants him to feel like part of the family right away. So Max has free reign of the house under supervision. John puppy-proofed the house by covering wires, storing harmful chemicals out of reach, and keeping shoes and valuables picked up. This allows Max to explore without getting into too much trouble. While most small animals live in cages at first, John knew Max would be happier being part of the household. So far having Max as a free-roaming family pet has worked out great.",

Most furry animals like cats have whiskers, which are specialized hairs that help them detect objects around them. Whiskers act like sensors to gather information about the environment. However, there are some exceptions to this general rule. For example, fur seals have fur but don't possess any whiskers. Their flippers and sensory abilities in the water make whiskers unnecessary. So while most furry creatures have whiskers to complement their fur, not all do. There are always exceptions in nature. The fur seal demonstrates that just because an animal has fur doesn't mean it necessarily needs whiskers too.",
