    "Acting either as a nation-state government or as a conventional force, a proxy belligerent acts in behalf of a third-party state sponsor.",
    "A proxy war is characterised by a direct, long-term, geopolitical relationship between the third-party sponsor states and their client states or non-state clients, thus the political sponsorship becomes military sponsorship when the third-party powers fund the soldiers and their materiel to equip the belligerent proxy-army to launch and fight and sustain a war to victory, and government power.",

    "Various geographic changes can arise such as the movement of continents, and the formation of mountains, islands, bodies of water, or glaciers.",
    "Human activity such as agriculture or developments can also change the distribution of species populations.",
    "These factors can substantially alter a region's geography, resulting in the separation of a species population into isolated subpopulations.",
    "The vicariant populations then undergo genetic changes as they become subjected to different selective pressures, experience genetic drift, and accumulate different mutations in the separated populations' gene pools.",

    "The term also refers generally to any necked string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the Hornbostel\u2013Sachs system).",
    "The strings are attached to pegs or posts at the end of the neck, which have some type of turning mechanism to enable the player to tighten the tension on the string or loosen the tension before playing (which respectively raise or lower the pitch of a string), so that each string is tuned to a specific pitch (or note).",
    "The lute is plucked or strummed with one hand while the other hand \"frets\" (presses down) the strings on the neck's fingerboard.",
    "By pressing the strings on different places of the fingerboard, the player can shorten or lengthen the part of the string that is vibrating, thus producing higher or lower pitches (notes).",
    "The European lute and the modern Near-Eastern oud descend from a common ancestor via diverging evolutionary paths.",
    "The lute is used in a great variety of instrumental music from the Medieval to the late Baroque eras and was the most important instrument for secular music in the Renaissance.",
    "During the Baroque music era, the lute was used as one of the instruments that played the basso continuo accompaniment parts.",
    "It is also an accompanying instrument in vocal works.",
    "The lute player either improvises (\"realizes\") a chordal accompaniment based on the figured bass part, or plays a written-out accompaniment (both music notation and tablature (\"tab\") are used for lute).",
    "As a small instrument, the lute produces a relatively quiet sound.",
    "The player of a lute is called a lutenist, lutanist or lutist, and a maker of lutes (or any similar string instrument, or violin family instruments) is referred to as a luthier.",

    "Four days after the Battle of Roli\u00e7a, Wellesley's army was attacked by a French army under General Junot near the village of Vimeiro.",
    "The battle began as a battle of manoeuvre, with French troops attempting to outflank the British left, but Wellesley was able to redeploy his army to face the assault.",
    "Meanwhile, Junot sent in two central columns but these were forced back by sustained volleys from troops in line.",
    "Soon afterwards, the flanking attack was beaten off and Junot retreated towards Torres Vedras, having lost 2,000 men and 13 cannon, compared to 700 Anglo-Portuguese losses.",
    "No pursuit was attempted because Wellesley was superseded by Sir Harry Burrard and then Sir Hew Dalrymple (one having arrived during the battle, the second soon after).",
    "The Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) was the first general purpose time-sharing operating system.",
    "Compatible Time Sharing referred to time sharing which was compatible with batch processing; it could offer both time sharing and batch processing concurrently.",
    "CTSS was developed at the MIT Computation Center (\"Comp Center\").",
    "CTSS was first demonstrated on MIT's modified IBM 709 in November 1961.",
    "The hardware was replaced with a modified IBM 7090 in 1962 and later a modified IBM 7094 called the \"blue machine\" to distinguish it from the Project MAC CTSS IBM 7094.",
    "Routine service to MIT Comp Center users began in the summer of 1963 and was operated there until 1968.",
    "A second deployment of CTSS on a separate IBM 7094 that was received in October 1963 (the \"red machine\") was used early on in Project MAC until 1969 when the red machine was moved to the Information Processing Center and operated until July 20, 1973.",

    "On 2 July 1784, the 4th Duke was created Earl of Norwich, in the County of Norfolk, and Baron Gordon, of Huntley in the County of Gloucester, in the Peerage of Great Britain.",
    "The principal family seat was Gordon Castle.",
    "The dukedom became extinct in 1836, along with all the titles created in 1684 and 1784.",
    "Most of the Gordon estates passed to the son of the 5th Duke's eldest sister, the 5th Duke of Richmond, whose main seat was Goodwood House in Sussex.",
    "In 1876 his son, the 6th Duke of Richmond and Lennox, was created Duke of Gordon, of Gordon Castle in Scotland, and Earl of Kinrara, in the County of Inverness.",
