**Context:**
If Maya practices violin regularly, then her tone improves, and whenever her tone improves, the ensemble blends better. If the conductor gives special coaching, then the section becomes more cohesive. Either Maya practices regularly or the conductor gives special coaching. When the section is cohesive, Maya gains clarity in her bowing. If she gains clarity, then she gains expressiveness, and if she gains expressiveness, then her performance strengthens. Whenever her performance strengthens, the concert result is positive.

**Context:**
If Ravi studies early in the morning, then he grasps concepts faster. Whenever he grasps concepts faster, he solves harder exercises. If his classmate joins study group sessions, then she asks helpful questions. Either Ravi studies early or his classmate joins the sessions. Whenever helpful questions are asked, Ravi revises the material. If he revises the material, then he organizes his notes, and if he organizes his notes, then he remembers key ideas better. Whenever he remembers key ideas better, he performs strongly on quizzes.

## **IN-CONTEXT EXEMPLAR 5**

**Context:**
If Ben calibrates the telescope, then the images become clearer. When the images become clearer, the analysis quality increases. If the weather station predicts stable skies, then the observing session proceeds smoothly. Either Ben calibrates the telescope or the weather station predicts stable skies. When the session proceeds smoothly, Ben logs high-quality data. If he logs high-quality data, then he identifies key patterns, and if he identifies key patterns, then he interprets results accurately. Whenever he interprets results accurately, the scientific report turns out well.
