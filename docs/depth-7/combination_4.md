## **IN-CONTEXT EXEMPLAR 1**

**Context:**
If Alice submits the initial design draft, then her manager reviews the draft. If her manager reviews the draft, then the design receives formal approval. Alice’s team believes that either she submits the initial design draft or the team runs an alternative pilot test, or both. If the team runs an alternative pilot test, then the pilot reveals key issues. If the tech team deploys a new monitoring tool, then the system’s stability improves. The team also expects that either they run an alternative pilot test or the system’s stability does not improve, or both. If the pilot reveals key issues, then the final product launch is adjusted successfully.

{P}: Alice submits the initial design draft.
{Q}: Alice’s manager reviews the draft.
{R}: The design receives formal approval.
{S}: The team runs an alternative pilot test.
{T}: The pilot reveals key issues.
{U}: The tech team deploys a new monitoring tool.
{V}: The system’s stability improves.
{W}: The final product launch is adjusted successfully.

**Question:** If the design did not receive formal approval and the tech team deployed a new monitoring tool, was the final product launch adjusted successfully?

## **IN-CONTEXT EXEMPLAR 2**

**Context:**
If Mia submits her project proposal early, then the professor gives her detailed comments. If the professor gives her detailed comments, then the proposal is approved for the advanced track. Mia’s group knows that either she submits the proposal early or the group prepares a backup prototype, or both. If the group prepares a backup prototype, then the prototype reveals design flaws. If the lab assistant runs the stress tests, then the system’s reliability improves. The group also believes that either they prepare a backup prototype or the system’s reliability does not improve, or both. If the prototype reveals design flaws, then the final project presentation is refined successfully.

{P}: Mia submits her project proposal early.
{Q}: The professor gives Mia detailed comments.
{R}: The proposal is approved for the advanced track.
{S}: The group prepares a backup prototype.
{T}: The prototype reveals design flaws.
{U}: The lab assistant runs the stress tests.
{V}: The system’s reliability improves.
{W}: The final project presentation is refined successfully.

**Question:** If the proposal was not approved for the advanced track and the lab assistant ran the stress tests, was the final project presentation refined successfully?

## **IN-CONTEXT EXEMPLAR 3**

**Context:**
If Noah drafts the campaign brief on time, then the creative director reviews it. If the creative director reviews it, then the campaign is cleared for launch. The marketing team expects that either Noah drafts the brief on time or the team conducts an emergency focus group, or both. If the team conducts an emergency focus group, then the focus group uncovers messaging problems. If the data analyst updates the performance dashboard, then the visibility of campaign metrics improves. The team also thinks that either they conduct an emergency focus group or the visibility of campaign metrics does not improve, or both. If the focus group uncovers messaging problems, then the final campaign plan is adjusted effectively.

{P}: Noah drafts the campaign brief on time.
{Q}: The creative director reviews the brief.
{R}: The campaign is cleared for launch.
{S}: The team conducts an emergency focus group.
{T}: The focus group uncovers messaging problems.
{U}: The data analyst updates the performance dashboard.
{V}: The visibility of campaign metrics improves.
{W}: The final campaign plan is adjusted effectively.

**Question:** If the campaign was not cleared for launch and the data analyst updated the performance dashboard, was the final campaign plan adjusted effectively?

## **IN-CONTEXT EXEMPLAR 4**

**Context:**
If Dr. Lee files the patient summary on time, then the senior physician reviews the case. If the senior physician reviews the case, then the treatment plan is officially approved. The staff know that either Dr. Lee files the patient summary on time or the nursing team initiates a preliminary checklist, or both. If the nursing team initiates a preliminary checklist, then the checklist detects potential complications. If the on-call technician calibrates the monitoring equipment, then the accuracy of vital signs readings improves. The staff also expects that either the nursing team initiates a preliminary checklist or the accuracy of vital signs readings does not improve, or both. If the checklist detects potential complications, then the treatment schedule is adjusted safely.

{P}: Dr. Lee files the patient summary on time.
{Q}: The senior physician reviews the case.
{R}: The treatment plan is officially approved.
{S}: The nursing team initiates a preliminary checklist.
{T}: The checklist detects potential complications.
{U}: The on-call technician calibrates the monitoring equipment.
{V}: The accuracy of vital signs readings improves.
{W}: The treatment schedule is adjusted safely.

**Question:** If the treatment plan was not officially approved and the on-call technician calibrated the monitoring equipment, was the treatment schedule adjusted safely?

## **IN-CONTEXT EXEMPLAR 5**

**Context:**
If Sara submits the code review request, then the lead engineer inspects her changes. If the lead engineer inspects her changes, then the patch is approved for release. The team expects that either Sara submits the code review request or the QA team prepares an additional regression test suite, or both. If the QA team prepares an additional regression test suite, then the tests uncover hidden bugs. If the DevOps engineer updates the monitoring configuration, then the system’s alerting pipeline improves. The team also believes that either the QA team prepares an additional regression test suite or the system’s alerting pipeline does not improve, or both. If the tests uncover hidden bugs, then the release strategy is adjusted safely.

{P}: Sara submits the code review request.
{Q}: The lead engineer inspects Sara’s changes.
{R}: The patch is approved for release.
{S}: The QA team prepares an additional regression test suite.
{T}: The tests uncover hidden bugs.
{U}: The DevOps engineer updates the monitoring configuration.
{V}: The system’s alerting pipeline improves.
{W}: The release strategy is adjusted safely.

**Question:** If the patch was not approved for release and the DevOps engineer updated the monitoring configuration, was the release strategy adjusted safely?
