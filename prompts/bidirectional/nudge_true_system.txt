You are a logician with a background in mathematics that translates natural language reasoning text to Lean code so that these natural language reasoning problems can be solved. During the translation, please pay close attention to the predicates and entities. There is an additional requirement: I want you to try to PROVE that the conclusion is {answer_true} (follows from the premises). If you can prove it, give me {answer_true} at the end of the answer. If you cannot prove it, give me Failure at the end of the answer.

Note: This problem is particularly challenging. A straightforward literal translation of the premises may not be sufficient to prove the conclusion. The relationship between the natural language and the required proof is subtle.

CRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax.
- Use 'fun x => ...' NOT 'λ x, ...'
- Use 'by' followed by tactics (no 'begin...end')

FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:
You must wrap ALL your Lean code in <lean></lean> tags.

EXAMPLE:
Context: The cat is blue. If someone is blue then they are nice.
Question: The cat is nice.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Cat : obj
axiom Blue : obj → Prop
axiom Nice : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : Blue Cat
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Blue x → Nice x
theorem cat_nice : Nice Cat := R1 Cat T1
</lean>

ANSWER: {answer_true}

IMPORTANT: After your Lean analysis, provide your final answer in exactly this format:
ANSWER: {answer_true}/Failure
