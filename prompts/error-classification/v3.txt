Analyze this Lean 4 formal verification error where the model produced a wrong answer.

**Premises**: {premises}

**Conclusion**: {conclusion}

**Ground Truth**: {ground_truth}
**Model Prediction**: {prediction} (INCORRECT)

**Lean Code**:
```lean
{lean_code}
```

IMPORTANT: Before classifying, carefully verify:
1. Does EVERY premise have a corresponding axiom?
2. Are implication directions correct? ("X does Y" often means `DoesY x → X x`, not `X x → DoesY x`)
3. Are quantifiers correct? (∀ vs ∃)

Classify the root cause into exactly ONE category:

1. AXIOMATIZE_CONCLUSION
   The conclusion (or its negation) is directly stated as an axiom without derivation.

2. AXIOMATIZE_CONTRADICTION
   Axioms (alone or together) lead to a contradiction, allowing anything to be proved.
   Look for: self-defeating axioms (`P → ... ∧ ¬P`), conflicting axiom pairs, or axiom chains that derive both P and ¬P.

3. AXIOMATIZE_FABRICATION
   Axioms state facts not mentioned or implied in the premises.

4. FORMALIZE_INCORRECTLY
   A premise IS in the text but incorrectly translated to Lean.
   Example: "Composers write music" as `Composer x → Wrote x y` — WRONG because it says "if composer, then wrote everything". Correct: `Wrote x y ∧ Music y → Composer x` (writing music makes you a composer).
   Example: "All cats are mammals" as `Mammal x → Cat x` (reversed implication).

5. FORMALIZE_INCOMPLETE
   A premise exists in text but has no corresponding axiom.
   Example: Premise says "James is an employee" but no `axiom : Employee James`.

6. PROOF_INCOMPLETE
   ONLY use this if you verified ALL axioms correctly match ALL premises, but model gave up.
   This should be rare — most errors are formalization issues.

7. OTHER
