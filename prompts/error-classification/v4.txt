Analyze this Lean 4 formal verification error where the model produced a wrong answer.

**Premises**: {premises}

**Conclusion**: {conclusion}

**Ground Truth**: {ground_truth}
**Model Prediction**: {prediction} (INCORRECT)

**Lean Code**:
```lean
{lean_code}
```

Follow this DECISION TREE to classify. Answer each question in order and stop at the first YES:

**Q1: Does the proof contain `False.elim`, `False.rec`, `absurd`, or explicitly derive `False`?**
→ YES: **AXIOMATIZE_CONTRADICTION** (proof exploits a logical contradiction)

**Q2: Do any axioms directly state the conclusion or its negation as a fact?**
→ YES: **AXIOMATIZE_CONCLUSION**

**Q3: Does any SINGLE axiom contain a self-negating pattern like `P x → ... ∧ ¬P x`?**
Example: `Need Hannah → (¬Picky Hannah ∧ ¬Need Hannah)` — this says "if Need then ¬Need", which is self-contradictory.
(Note: This is different from wrong implication direction. This is about the SAME predicate appearing both positive and negated.)
→ YES: **AXIOMATIZE_CONTRADICTION**

**Q4: Do two axioms directly contradict each other (one says P, another says ¬P)?**
Example: `axiom A : WorksInLab James` and `axiom B : ¬WorksInLab James`
→ YES: **AXIOMATIZE_CONTRADICTION**

**Q5: Do any axioms state facts NOT mentioned in the premises?**
→ YES: **AXIOMATIZE_FABRICATION**

**Q6: For each premise, check if there's a corresponding axiom:**
- If an axiom EXISTS for the premise but has WRONG implication direction → **FORMALIZE_INCORRECTLY**
  (Example: "Composers write music" as `Composer x → Wrote x y` instead of `Wrote x y → Composer x`)
- If an axiom EXISTS for the premise but has WRONG argument order → **FORMALIZE_INCORRECTLY**
  (Example: "A is in B" as `LocatedIn B A` instead of `LocatedIn A B`)
- If an axiom EXISTS for the premise but has WRONG quantifier → **FORMALIZE_INCORRECTLY**
- If NO axiom exists at all for a premise → **MISSING_PREMISES**

**Q7: Are all axioms correct but proof incomplete?**
→ YES: **PROOF_INCOMPLETE** (rare)

**Q8: None of the above?**
→ **OTHER**
