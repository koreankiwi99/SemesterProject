Analyze this Lean 4 formal verification error where the model produced a wrong answer.

**Premises**: {premises}

**Conclusion**: {conclusion}

**Ground Truth**: {ground_truth}
**Model Prediction**: {prediction} (INCORRECT)

**Lean Code**:

{lean_code}
```

Follow this DECISION TREE. Answer each question and stop at the first YES:

**Q1: Does the proof exploit a contradiction?**
Check if the proof derives `False` or uses explosion (`False.elim`, `False.rec`, `absurd`, `exfalso`).
→ YES: **AXIOMATIZE_CONTRADICTION**

**Q2: Is the conclusion (or its negation) directly axiomatized?**
The goal is stated as an axiom without needing derivation.
→ YES: **AXIOMATIZE_CONCLUSION**

**Q3: Do axioms create logical inconsistency?**
- Any axiom of form `P → ... ∧ ¬P` (implies its own negation)
- Two axioms that directly conflict (one asserts P, another asserts ¬P)
→ YES: **AXIOMATIZE_CONTRADICTION**

**Q4: Do axioms assert facts not in the premises?**
Axioms claim something the premises never stated or implied.
→ YES: **AXIOMATIZE_FABRICATION**

**Q5: Is any premise incorrectly translated?**
An axiom exists for the premise but with:
- Wrong implication direction
- Wrong argument order
- Wrong quantifier (∀ vs ∃)
→ YES: **FORMALIZE_INCORRECTLY**

**Q6: Is any premise missing entirely?**
A premise has no corresponding axiom at all.
→ YES: **MISSING_PREMISES**

**Q7: All axioms correct but proof fails?**
→ YES: **PROOF_INCOMPLETE**

**Q8: None apply?**
→ **OTHER**
