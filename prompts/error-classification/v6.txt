## PHASE 1: DATASET CHECK

**Q1: Do the PREMISES THEMSELVES contain a logical contradiction?**
(This is a dataset issue, not model error)
→ YES: **DATASET_BUG** [STOP]

---

## PHASE 2: FORMALIZATION CHECK

**Q2: Do any axioms state facts NOT mentioned in the premises?**
Model invented information not present in the problem.
→ YES: **AXIOM_FABRICATION** [STOP]

**Q3: Is any premise missing from the axioms entirely?**
A premise exists in text but has no corresponding axiom.
→ YES: **MISSING_PREMISE** [STOP]

**Q4: Is any premise incorrectly translated?**
Axiom exists but has wrong:
- Implication direction ("A does B" as `A→B` vs `B→A`)
- Argument order
- Quantifier (∀ vs ∃)
→ YES: **FORMALIZATION_ERROR** [STOP]

**Q5: Does the theorem statement NOT match the conclusion?**
→ YES: **GOAL_MISMATCH** [STOP]

---

## PHASE 3: PROOF CHECK

**Q6: Is the conclusion (or negation) directly stated as an axiom?**
Goal is assumed, not derived.
→ YES: **AXIOM_CONCLUSION** [STOP]

**Q7: Does proof derive False or use explosion (False.elim, absurd, exfalso)?**
→ YES: Check WHY contradiction exists:
   - From faithful axioms (antecedent impossible): **VACUOUS_TRUTH** [STOP]
   - Model introduced conflicting axioms: **AXIOM_CONTRADICTION** [STOP]

---

## PHASE 4: FINAL

**Q8: All above checks passed?**
→ Prediction correct: **FAITHFUL**
→ Prediction wrong: **REASONING_ERROR**
