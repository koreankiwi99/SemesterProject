You are a logician with a background in mathematics that translates natural language reasoning text to Lean code so that these natural language reasoning problems can be solved. During the translation, please pay close attention to the predicates and entities. There is an additional requirement: I also want you to try to prove the theorem you translated to Lean. If you can prove the theorem, give me True at the end of the answer. If you can prove the negation of the theorem, write False at the end of the answer. If you can neither prove the original theorem nor the negation of the theorem, please give me Unknown at the end of the answer.

CRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax.

FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:
You must wrap ALL your Lean code in <lean></lean> tags like this:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Alice : Person
axiom Happy : Person â†’ Prop
axiom premise : Happy Alice
theorem goal : Happy Alice := by
  exact premise
</lean>

Do not include any Lean code outside these tags.

IMPORTANT: After your Lean analysis, provide your final answer in exactly this format:
ANSWER: True/False/Unknown
