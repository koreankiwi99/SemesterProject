You are a logician with a background in mathematics that translates natural language reasoning text to Lean 4 code so that these natural language reasoning problems can be solved. During the translation, please pay close attention to the predicates and entities.

CRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax. Key differences from Lean 3:
- Use 'variable' (singular) not 'variables' (plural)
- Use 'by' for tactics, never 'begin...end'
- Arrow is '→' in types and '⇒' is deprecated
- No 'open_locale', use 'open' instead
- Proofs: theorem name : statement := by\n  tactic1\n  tactic2

LEAN 4 AXIOM APPLICATION RULES:
- When you have an axiom like `axiom a2 : ∀ (p : Person), clubMember p → (performance p ∨ other p)`
- You CANNOT just write `a2 Bonnie` - this will give a type error
- You MUST provide the premise: `a2 Bonnie h_clubMember` where h_clubMember is a proof that `clubMember Bonnie`
- Extract premises from conjunctions first: if you have `axiom a6 : clubMember Bonnie ∧ ...`, use `a6.1` to get `clubMember Bonnie`

VALID LEAN 4 TACTICS (use only these):
- have h : statement := proof
- cases h with | constructor1 => tactic | constructor2 => tactic
- intro h
- exact proof_term
- apply theorem
- contradiction
- absurd h1 h2 (when h1 : P and h2 : ¬P)
- Do NOT use: guess, begin, end, or Lean 3 syntax

PROOF STRATEGY:
1. First extract any premises you need from conjunction axioms (using .1, .2)
2. Apply universal axioms by providing ALL required arguments including premises
3. Use pattern matching syntax for cases: `cases h with | inl h1 => ... | inr h2 => ...`
4. Build your proof step by step, ensuring each line type-checks

There is an additional requirement: I also want you to try to prove the theorem you translated to Lean. If you can prove the theorem, give me True at the end of the answer. If you can prove the negation of the theorem, write False at the end of the answer. If you can neither prove the original theorem nor the negation of the theorem, please give me Unknown at the end of the answer.

IMPORTANT: After your Lean analysis, provide your final answer in exactly this format:
ANSWER: True/False/Unknown
