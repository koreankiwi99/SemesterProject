Generalized Rule Definition:
Rule 1: [if {P} is true then {Q} is true, and if {R} is true then {S} is true, and either {P} is true or {S} is not true or both]
Rule 2: [if {Q} is true then {T} is true, and if {T} is true then {U} is true]
Rule 3: [if {U} is true then {V} is true]
Rule 4: [if {V} is true then {W} is true]

Task Definition:
Task 1: Generate a short real life story that includes sentences to illustrate the above rules, replacing the entities P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W with real values. Do not include the entity labels like P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W in the story.

Task 2: Generate the following complex reasoning question using the story and the rules, by replacing the respective entities.
Q1: [If R is true, then is W true?]

Examples:

{P}: Daniel submits his early draft.
{Q}: Daniel's manager gives him feedback.
{R}: The senior reviewer examines a proposal.
{S}: The reviewer approves key sections.
{T}: Daniel improves his outline.
{U}: Daniel strengthens his arguments.
{V}: The final report becomes polished.
{W}: The final report is considered successful.

Context: If Daniel submits his early draft, then his manager gives him feedback. If the senior reviewer examines a proposal, then the reviewer approves key sections. Either Daniel submits his early draft, or the reviewer does not approve key sections, or both. If Daniel receives feedback, then he improves his outline. If he improves his outline, then he strengthens his arguments. If he strengthens his arguments, then the final report becomes polished. If the final report becomes polished, then it is considered successful.

Question: If R is true, then is W true?

{P}: Priya attends the strategy workshop.
{Q}: Priya learns new planning methods.
{R}: The director reviews the quarterly agenda.
{S}: The director finalizes priorities.
{T}: Priya drafts a stronger proposal.
{U}: The review committee becomes more supportive.
{V}: The project moves ahead smoothly.
{W}: The project ultimately succeeds.

Context: If Priya attends the strategy workshop, then she learns new planning methods. If the director reviews the quarterly agenda, then the director finalizes priorities. Either Priya attends the workshop, or the director does not finalize priorities, or both. If Priya learns new planning methods, then she drafts a stronger proposal. If she drafts a stronger proposal, then the review committee becomes more supportive. If the review committee becomes more supportive, then the project moves ahead smoothly. If the project moves ahead smoothly, then it ultimately succeeds.

Question: If R is true, then is W true?

{P}: Carlos practices with the robotics team.
{Q}: Carlos improves his coordination skills.
{R}: The technician checks the wiring panel.
{S}: The robot stabilizes.
{T}: Carlos completes more complex maneuvers.
{U}: Carlos gains confidence.
{V}: The team's demonstration becomes more effective.
{W}: Their robotics project is recognized by the judges.

Context: If Carlos practices with the robotics team, then he improves his coordination skills. If the technician checks the wiring panel, then the robot stabilizes. Either Carlos practices with the team, or the robot does not stabilize, or both. If Carlos improves his coordination skills, then he can complete more complex maneuvers. If he completes more complex maneuvers, then he gains confidence. If he gains confidence, then the team's demonstration becomes more effective. If the team's demonstration becomes more effective, then their robotics project is recognized by the judges.

Question: If R is true, then is W true?

{P}: Lena rehearses her presentation beforehand.
{Q}: Lena speaks more clearly.
{R}: The event coordinator tests the audio system.
{S}: The microphones function properly.
{T}: Lena organizes her timing well.
{U}: Lena maintains steady pacing.
{V}: The talk is well received.
{W}: The talk receives very positive evaluations.

Context: If Lena rehearses her presentation beforehand, then she speaks more clearly. If the event coordinator tests the audio system, then the microphones function properly. Either Lena rehearses her presentation, or the microphones do not function properly, or both. If Lena speaks more clearly, then she organizes her timing well. If she organizes her timing well, then she maintains steady pacing. If she maintains steady pacing, then the talk is well received. If the talk is well received, then it receives very positive evaluations.

Question: If R is true, then is W true?

{P}: Noah checks the navigation software.
{Q}: The system displays accurate routes.
{R}: The mechanic inspects the engine cabin.
{S}: The delivery van operates reliably.
{T}: Noah updates his travel plan.
{U}: Noah chooses safer roads.
{V}: The delivery runs smoothly.
{W}: The delivery outcome is positive.

Context: If Noah checks the navigation software, then the system displays accurate routes. If the mechanic inspects the engine cabin, then the delivery van operates reliably. Either Noah checks the navigation software, or the van does not operate reliably, or both. If the system displays accurate routes, then Noah updates his travel plan. If he updates his travel plan, then he chooses safer roads. If he chooses safer roads, then the delivery runs smoothly. If the delivery runs smoothly, then the delivery outcome is positive.
