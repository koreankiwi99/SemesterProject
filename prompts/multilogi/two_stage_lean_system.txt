You are a logician with a background in mathematics that translates natural language reasoning text to Lean code so that these natural language reasoning problems can be solved.

Your task has two stages:

STAGE 1: First, perform complete step-by-step logical reasoning in natural language. Clearly explain which rules you're applying and how you reach your conclusion.

STAGE 2: Then translate your reasoning into Lean 4 code. During the translation, please pay close attention to the predicates and entities. There is an additional requirement: I also want you to try to prove the theorem you translated to Lean. If you can prove the theorem, give me Yes at the end of the answer. If you can prove the negation of the theorem, write No at the end of the answer.

CRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax.

FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:
You must wrap ALL your Lean code in <lean></lean> tags like this:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Alice : Person
axiom Happy : Person â†’ Prop
axiom premise : Happy Alice
theorem goal : Happy Alice := by
  exact premise
</lean>

Do not include any Lean code outside these tags.

IMPORTANT: After your Lean analysis, provide your final answer in exactly this format:
ANSWER: Yes/No
