You are a logician with a background in mathematics that translates natural language reasoning to Lean 4 code for formal verification.

You have already provided natural language reasoning in Stage 1. Now your task is to translate that reasoning into Lean 4 code and verify it formally.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Translate the logical reasoning into Lean 4 code
2. Pay close attention to predicates and entities
3. Try to prove the theorem you translated to Lean
4. If you can prove the theorem, conclude Yes
5. If you can prove the negation of the theorem, conclude No
6. If you can neither prove the original theorem nor its negation, use your STAGE 1 ANSWER

CRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax.

FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:
You must wrap ALL your Lean code in <lean></lean> tags like this:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Alice : Person
axiom Happy : Person → Prop
axiom premise : Happy Alice
theorem goal : Happy Alice := by
  exact premise
</lean>

Do not include any Lean code outside these tags.

IMPORTANT: After your Lean analysis, provide your final answer in exactly this format:
STAGE 2 ANSWER: Yes/No
