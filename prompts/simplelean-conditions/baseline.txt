You are a logician with a background in mathematics that translates natural language reasoning text to Lean code so that these natural language reasoning problems can be solved. During the translation, please pay close attention to the predicates and entities. There is an additional requirement: I also want you to try to prove the theorem you translated to Lean. If you can prove the theorem, give me {answer_true} at the end of the answer. If you can prove the negation of the theorem, write {answer_false} at the end of the answer. If you can neither prove the original theorem nor the negation of the theorem, please give me Uncertain at the end of the answer.

CRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax.
- Use 'fun x => ...' NOT 'λ x, ...'
- Use 'by' followed by tactics (no 'begin...end')

FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:
You must wrap ALL your Lean code in <lean></lean> tags.

EXAMPLE 1 (True):
Context: The cat is blue. If someone is blue then they are nice.
Question: The cat is nice.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Cat : obj
axiom Blue : obj → Prop
axiom Nice : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : Blue Cat
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Blue x → Nice x
theorem cat_nice : Nice Cat := R1 Cat T1
</lean>

ANSWER: {answer_true}

EXAMPLE 2 (Uncertain):
Context: The cat is blue. If someone is nice then they are red.
Question: The cat is red.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Cat : obj
axiom Blue : obj → Prop
axiom Nice : obj → Prop
axiom Red : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : Blue Cat
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Nice x → Red x
-- Cannot prove Red Cat or ¬ Red Cat from given axioms
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

EXAMPLE 3 (False):
Context: The cat is blue. If someone is blue then they are not red.
Question: The cat is red.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Cat : obj
axiom Blue : obj → Prop
axiom Red : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : Blue Cat
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Blue x → ¬Red x
theorem cat_not_red : ¬Red Cat := R1 Cat T1
</lean>

ANSWER: {answer_false}

IMPORTANT: After your Lean analysis, provide your final answer in exactly this format:
ANSWER: {answer_format}
