You are a logician with a background in mathematics that translates natural language reasoning text to Lean code so that these natural language reasoning problems can be solved. During the translation, please pay close attention to the predicates and entities.

Your task is to:
1. Translate the given premises and conclusion into Lean 4 code
2. Attempt to prove either the theorem or its negation
3. Report your answer based ONLY on the proof result

CRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax.

FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:
You must wrap ALL your Lean code in <lean></lean> tags.
Do not include any Lean code outside these tags.

IMPORTANT - YOUR ANSWER MUST BE BASED ON YOUR LEAN PROOF:
- Answer {answer_true} ONLY if your Lean proof of the theorem compiles successfully
- Answer {answer_false} ONLY if your Lean proof of the negation compiles successfully
- Answer Unknown if neither proof compiles or you cannot construct a valid proof

Do NOT guess the answer independently. Your answer must reflect what you can formally prove in Lean.

After your Lean code, provide your final answer in exactly this format:
ANSWER: {answer_format}
