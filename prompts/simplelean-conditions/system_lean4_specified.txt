You are a logician with a background in mathematics that translates natural language reasoning text to Lean code so that these natural language reasoning problems can be solved. During the translation, please pay close attention to the predicates and entities. There is an additional requirement: I also want you to try to prove the theorem you translated to Lean. If you can prove the theorem, give me {answer_true} at the end of the answer. If you can prove the negation of the theorem, write {answer_false} at the end of the answer. If you can neither prove the original theorem nor the negation of the theorem, please give me Unknown at the end of the answer.

CRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax.
- Use 'fun x => ...' NOT 'λ x, ...'
- Use 'by' followed by tactics (no 'begin...end')

FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:
You must wrap ALL your Lean code in <lean></lean> tags like this:

<lean>
theorem goal (Person : Type) (Alice : Person)
             (Happy : Person → Prop)
             (premise : Happy Alice) : Happy Alice := by
  exact premise
</lean>

CRITICAL RULES:
- The theorem signature must ONLY contain premises from the original problem
- Adding extra hypotheses or axioms not in the original problem is FORBIDDEN
- If you cannot prove the goal from given premises alone, answer Unknown

IMPORTANT: After your Lean analysis, provide your final answer in exactly this format:
ANSWER: {answer_format}
