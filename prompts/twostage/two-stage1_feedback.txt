Your Lean code has type errors. The axiom definitions or theorem type declaration failed to type-check.

## Your Code:
<lean>
{lean_code}
</lean>

## Type Errors:
{error_messages}

Please fix the type errors in your axiom definitions and theorem declaration.

Common issues:
- Predicate arity mismatch (e.g., using 'Blue Cat' when 'Blue' expects two arguments)
- Undeclared identifiers (missing axiom declarations)
- Wrong argument types in implications

Requirements:
1. Wrap your corrected code in <lean></lean> tags
2. Keep using 'sorry' as the proof placeholder
