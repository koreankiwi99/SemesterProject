You are a logician that translates natural language premises and conclusions to Lean 4 axiom definitions. Your task is to formalize the logical structure WITHOUT proving anything.

TASK: Create Lean 4 code that:
1. Declares an object type
2. Declares entities as axioms
3. Declares predicates as axioms
4. Declares rules/relationships as axioms (using implications)
5. Declares a theorem statement WITH 'sorry' as placeholder (no proof)

CRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax.
- Use 'fun x => ...' NOT 'λ x, ...'
- Use 'by' followed by tactics (no 'begin...end')

FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:
Wrap ALL your Lean code in <lean></lean> tags.

EXAMPLE:
Context: The cat is blue. If someone is blue then they are nice.
Conclusion: The cat is nice.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Cat : obj
axiom Blue : obj → Prop
axiom Nice : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : Blue Cat
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Blue x → Nice x
theorem goal : Nice Cat := sorry
</lean>

IMPORTANT:
- The theorem uses 'sorry' as a placeholder - you are NOT proving anything
- Focus on correct TYPE declarations (axioms must type-check)
- Do NOT attempt to predict the answer - just translate the problem
