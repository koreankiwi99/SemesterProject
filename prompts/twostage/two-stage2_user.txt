You are a theorem prover. You are given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions
and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'. Your task is to provide the proof.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT modify the axioms or theorem statement. Only replace 'sorry'
with a valid proof term.

Here is the validated code from Stage 1:
<lean>
{stage1_code}
</lean>

Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof.

FORMATTING REQUIREMENT:
Wrap your complete Lean code in <lean></lean> tags.

ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain
