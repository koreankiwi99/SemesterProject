    "model_response": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nLet\u2019s define predicates for clarity:\n- P(x): x performs in school talent shows often.\n- E(x): x attends and is very engaged with school events.\n- S(x): x is a student who attends the school.\n- C(x): x chaperones high school dances.\n- I(x): x is inactive and disinterested community member.\n- Y(x): x is a young child or teenager.\n- W(x): x wishes to further their academic careers and educational opportunities.\n\nGiven statements:\n1) P(x) \u2192 E(x).\n2) For club members x: P(x) \u2228 I(x).\n3) C(x) \u2192 \u00acS(x).\n4) I(x) \u2192 C(x).\n5) For club members: (Y(x) \u2227 W(x)) \u2192 S(x).\n6) For Bonnie: (E(B) \u2227 S(B)) \u2228 (\u00acE(B) \u2227 \u00acS(B)). (Exclusive-like structure: either both E and S, or both not.)\n\nFrom 4 and 3: I(x) \u2192 C(x) \u2192 \u00acS(x). So I(x) \u2192 \u00acS(x).\nFrom 2 and 1: If not I(x), then P(x) must hold (by 2), and then E(x) holds (by 1). But 2 is a disjunction; it doesn\u2019t force P unless we know \u00acI. Keep relations in mind.\n\nAnalyze Bonnie with (6): Either Case A: E(B) \u2227 S(B), or Case B: \u00acE(B) \u2227 \u00acS(B). Both are consistent with other info; no further constraints link E/S directly to P or I except P\u2192E and I\u2192\u00acS.\n\nQuestion 1: Does Bonnie perform often (P(B))?\n- If Case A (E \u2227 S): P not entailed; P\u2192E is one-way. So P could be either true or false.\n- If Case B (\u00acE \u2227 \u00acS): From 2, P \u2228 I. If P, then by 1 E would be true, contradicting \u00acE. So P cannot be true in Case B. Thus in Case B we must have I true. That\u2019s consistent (I \u2192 \u00acS matches \u00acS).\nTherefore, across cases: Case A leaves P unknown; Case B forces \u00acP. Since both cases are possible, overall we cannot conclude P(B). Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2: If [ (Y\u2227W\u2227C) \u2228 \u00ac(Y\u2227W) ] then [ S \u2228 I ] for Bonnie.\nWe need to test validity under all models consistent with the premises.\n\nConsider two sub-antecedent branches:\n- Branch 1: \u00ac(Y\u2227W). Then the implication requires S \u2228 I. Do we know that? Not directly. From (6), Bonnie is either (E \u2227 S) or (\u00acE \u2227 \u00acS). In the first, S is true, so S \u2228 I holds. In the second, S is false; we need I to make S \u2228 I true. Do we get I? Not necessarily from \u00ac(Y\u2227W). So the implication could fail unless other premises force I. They don\u2019t. Construct a countermodel: Take Case B (\u00acE \u2227 \u00acS), set \u00ac(Y\u2227W) true, and also set I false. Check consistency: From 2, P \u2228 I. If I is false, then P must be true. But if P is true, then E must be true by 1, contradicting \u00acE. So in Case B we cannot have I false. Hence in Case B, I must be true. Therefore in Case B, S \u2228 I holds. In Case A, S holds. Thus in all possibilities under \u00ac(Y\u2227W), S \u2228 I holds. So Branch 1 is satisfied.\n\n- Branch 2: (Y\u2227W\u2227C). From (Y\u2227W) and premise 5, S must be true. From C and 3, \u00acS must be true. Contradiction. Thus Branch 2 of the antecedent is impossible under the premises; the overall antecedent cannot be true via this branch. Therefore whenever the overall antecedent is true, it must be via Branch 1, which we showed entails S \u2228 I. Hence the implication holds. Answer: True.\n\nQuestion 3: If [ C \u2228 (\u00acC \u2192 P) ] then [ (Y\u2227W) \u2227 I ] for Bonnie.\nWe need to see if this implication is valid. Test a counterexample where antecedent true but consequent false.\n\nEvaluate antecedent:\n- If C is true, antecedent is true.\n- If C is false, need (\u00acC \u2192 P), which is a material implication: with \u00acC true, it requires P true. So antecedent is true if either C is true, or (C is false and P true).\n\nTry to make consequent false: want \u00ac(Y\u2227W) \u2228 \u00acI. We can aim for \u00ac(Y\u2227W). Choose Case A from (6): E \u2227 S. In Case A, we can set Y\u2227W false to violate the consequent. Check antecedent: Can we make it true? Take C false and set P true. Then antecedent true (since \u00acC \u2192 P holds). Is this consistent with premises?\n- With P true, E true (matches Case A). Good.\n- With S true (Case A).\n- With C false.\n- From 4 (I \u2192 C), C false places no constraint on I; we can set I false to further violate consequent.\n- From 2, P \u2228 I holds because P true.\n- From 3, C \u2192 \u00acS is vacuously fine since C false.\n- From 5, since we set \u00ac(Y\u2227W), no constraint on S.\nAll premises satisfied. Antecedent true; consequent false. Therefore the implication is not entailed. Answer: False.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: True\n3: False",

    "model_response": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n- From \u201cEmployees have lunch either in the company building or at home,\u201d lunch location is exclusive between company building and home.\n- \u201cEveryone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers,\u201d and \u201cAll employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.\u201d Thus, lunch in company implies schedules meeting implies will go to company building today.\n- \u201cIf an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.\u201d\n- \u201cAll employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.\u201d and \u201cNo managers work remotely from home.\u201d\n- \u201cJames will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.\u201d Thus, James is in the company building today exactly when he is a manager.\n\nQuestion 1: \u201cJames has lunch in the company.\u201d\n- If James has lunch in the company, he schedules meetings and therefore will go to the company building today. By the biconditional, going to the company building today implies he is a manager. This is consistent with other constraints (managers do not work remotely; nothing contradicts lunch in company). However, we are not given that James does have lunch in the company; it\u2019s merely consistent. Therefore, not entailed.\nAnswer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2: \u201cJames does not have lunch in the company.\u201d\n- By exclusivity, not lunch in company would mean lunch at home. Then he works remotely from home. But no managers work remotely from home, so he would not be a manager. By the biconditional, if not a manager, then he will not appear in the company today. This scenario is also consistent. But we are not given that this is the case. Therefore, not entailed.\nAnswer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 3: The statement is a biconditional-style pair:\n- First clause: If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James does not either have lunch at home or work remotely from home.\n  \u2022 If James is a manager: managers do not work remotely from home; also, if he were to have lunch at home, he would work remotely, which is impossible for managers. So manager implies neither lunch at home nor working remotely from home. True.\n  \u2022 If James is in other countries: then he works remotely from home. That contradicts the consequent (\u201cdoes not work remotely from home\u201d). So the implication \u201cin other countries -> not (lunch at home or remote)\u201d is false in that case. Since the antecedent is a disjunction (manager or in other countries), the implication must hold for all cases; here there is a case (in other countries, not manager) making it false. Therefore the first clause is not generally true.\n\n- Second clause: If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor in other countries.\n  \u2022 If lunch at home, then works remotely from home; managers cannot work remotely, so not a manager. Being in other countries implies remote; remote holds, so being in other countries is consistent, but the clause asserts \u201cnor in other countries.\u201d However, from remote alone we cannot infer not in other countries; rather, in other countries implies remote, not vice versa. So it\u2019s possible that he works remotely from home because he is in other countries, which would make \u201cnor in other countries\u201d false. Thus this implication is not guaranteed true.\n\nSince at least one of these implications is not entailed and can be false under allowed scenarios, the combined statement is not universally true. It is not entailed nor is its negation entailed by the premises; thus its truth status is uncertain.\nAnswer: Unknown.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: Unknown\n3: Unknown",

So any individual spotted near the campus is either a rabbit or a squirrel (possibly both).\n- All rabbits near the campus are cute.\n- All squirrels near the campus are skittish.\n- If something is skittish, then it is not calm.\n- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. However, this conflicts with \u201conly rabbits and squirrels can be spotted near the campus\u201d unless those turtles are also rabbits/squirrels, which is impossible under normal disjoint categories. Interpreting strictly, \u201conly rabbits and squirrels\u201d means no turtles are spotted near the campus. So the \u201csome turtles\u201d statement must be disregarded as incompatible, or the consistent consequence is that nothing spotted near the campus is a turtle.\n- Rockie can be spotted near the campus and is calm. From \u201conly rabbits and squirrels,\u201d Rockie is either a rabbit or a squirrel. If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish, hence not calm, contradicting calm. Therefore Rockie is not a squirrel. Thus Rockie must be a rabbit. Then Rockie is cute (all rabbits near campus are cute). Also, being a rabbit (and not a squirrel), Rockie is not skittish, hence calm remains consistent.\n\nConclusions about Rockie:\n- Rockie is a rabbit, cute, calm.\n- Rockie is not a squirrel.\n- Rockie is not a turtle (since only rabbits and squirrels are spotted near campus).\n\nNow evaluate statements:\n\n1) Rockie is a turtle.\nFalse, as argued Rockie is not a turtle.\n\n2) Rockie is not a turtle.\nTrue.\n\n3) Rockie is a turtle or cute.\nThis is \u201cturtle \u2228 cute.\u201d We know Rockie is cute, so the disjunction is true.\nTrue.\n\n4) If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish.\nAntecedent: \u201cnot (turtle \u2227 squirrel)\u201d is true (Rockie is neither). Consequent: \u201ccute or skittish\u201d is true since Rockie is cute. So the implication is true.\nTrue.\n\n5) If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.\nWe have Rockie cute and calm true, but conclusion \u201cskittish turtle\u201d is false (Rockie is neither skittish nor a turtle). So the implication is false.\nFalse.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: False\n2: True\n3: True\n4: True\n5: False",

But also no adored brutalist has IG, which contradicts the IG from ZH-adored. This implies Max cannot adore any ZH style (otherwise contradictions arise). Thus all adored styles must be KW, and thus are E and D, and not IG (since adored brutalist are not IG and KW-adored need not be brutalist). Also, nothing forces KW-adored to be brutalist.\n\nQuestion 1: \u201cA design by Max is a brutalist building.\u201d\nWe cannot conclude that any given design by Max is brutalist. From above, adored ZH would be brutalist but is impossible; KW-adored are not stated to be brutalist. No entailment. Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2: \u201cA design by Max is evocative and dreamy.\u201d\nFor adored designs: all adored styles are KW, and all KW-adored are E and D. So any adored design by Max is E and D. The statement lacks \u201cadored,\u201d but context consistently talks about designs/styles Max adores. Interpreting consistently as \u201ca design by Max that he adores,\u201d it is entailed to be E and D. Answer: True.\n\nQuestion 3: \u201cA design by Max is either evocative or dreamy.\u201d\nFrom Q2, adored designs are both E and D, thus certainly E or D.

However, we don\u2019t need gender explicitly. Consider cases:\n\nCase 1 (female): Then she lost to \u015awi\u0105tek, hence is WTA-ranked highly, hence among the most active players. Also, as female, she did not lose to Nadal (male players lost to Nadal).\nCase 2 (male): Then she lost to Nadal.

If German were a Romance language, it would be in the same family as Spanish.

So Brown Swiss cattle cannot be alligators, since alligators are not domesticated. Therefore Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle, nor a cow, nor domesticated.\n\nQuestion 1: Ted is a pet.\n- We have no information connecting alligators to being pets. Some pets are Brown Swiss cattle, but that doesn\u2019t imply anything about alligators. So this is not entailed and not contradicted by given facts. Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2: Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle.\n- Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle because that would make Ted domesticated, contradicting that alligators are not domesticated. Thus this conjunction is false.\n\nQuestion 3: If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet.\n- The antecedent (Ted is Brown Swiss cattle) is impossible given the facts, but in classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true. Also, independently, if Ted were Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted would be domesticated, which conflicts with Ted being an alligator, but the implication only asserts that in that hypothetical case Ted is not a pet; we cannot derive \u201cnot a pet\u201d from the premises.

    "model_response": "Reasoning:\n- We have categories: stocks, growth stocks, mature stocks, retirement-fund-suitable, bought-to-earn-rapid-appreciation.\n- Premises:\n  1) All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation. (Growth \u2286 Bought-for-rapid)\n  2) If a stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund. (Bought-for-rapid \u2192 \u00acSuitable)\n  3) Some stocks are growth stocks. (\u2203x: Stock(x) \u2227 Growth(x))\n  4) All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. (Mature \u2286 Suitable)\n  5) KO is a mature stock. (Mature(KO))\n\nFrom (4) and (5): KO is suitable for a retirement fund.\nNo explicit premise states that all mature stocks are stocks, but \u201cmature stock\u201d is a subtype of stock in ordinary reading. However, strict logical derivation requires an explicit link. The premises say \u201cKO is a mature stock,\u201d which directly asserts KO is a stock (since \u201cmature stock\u201d linguistically entails being a stock). Thus KO is a stock follows from the given phrasing.\n\nAlso, from suitability of KO and rule (2): If KO were bought for rapid appreciation, it would be not suitable, contradicting suitability. So KO is not bought for rapid appreciation. From (1), being a growth stock implies bought for rapid; contrapositive is not given to infer not growth from not bought-for-rapid, since (1) is one-way. But we can deduce KO is not a growth stock by contradiction with suitability only if we use (1)+(2): Growth \u2192 Bought-for-rapid \u2192 \u00acSuitable, but KO is Suitable, so KO cannot be Growth. So KO is not a growth stock.\n\nQuestion 1: KO is a stock.\nGiven \u201cKO is a mature stock,\u201d it asserts KO is a stock. True.\n\nQuestion 2: KO is a stock and a growth stock.\nWe have KO is a stock (True) and KO is not a growth stock (as above). Therefore the conjunction is False.\n\nQuestion 3: If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.\nAntecedent: (Growth(KO) or Bought-for-rapid(KO)).\nFrom earlier, both disjuncts are actually false for KO, but for a material implication, truth is about all cases consistent with premises, not actual truth value unless entailed. We assess whether the implication is logically entailed by the premises.\n- If Growth(KO), then by (1) Bought-for-rapid(KO), then by (2) \u00acSuitable(KO). But that gives no information about KO being a stock or about volatility. We do know KO is a stock from Q1. The consequent says \u201cKO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile,\u201d which asserts not a stock and not volatile. Not-stock contradicts KO being a stock as established from the premises. Since the antecedent could be true in a hypothetical scenario consistent with premises? Actually Growth(KO) is inconsistent with the premises because KO is suitable (from being mature), and Growth \u2192 Bought-for-rapid \u2192 \u00acSuitable, contradiction. So the antecedent cannot be true given the premises; similarly Bought-for-rapid(KO) contradicts suitability. Therefore the antecedent is false in all models satisfying the premises. A material implication with always-false antecedent is always true (vacuously). Thus the implication is entailed as True.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: True\n2: False\n3: True",

    "model_response": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nGiven facts and rules:\n- If someone at Mary's school works in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition. (Jobs \u2192 NeedMoney)\n- If someone orders takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus. (Takeout \u2192 Jobs)\n- People at Mary's school either order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes. (Takeout \u2228 Enjoy)\n- If someone enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters. (Enjoy \u2192 \u00acPicky)\n- If someone enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. (Enjoy \u2192 SpendTime)\n- Hannah is at Mary's school.\n- Hannah works in student jobs on campus. Also: If Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. Formally: NeedMoney \u2192 (\u00acPicky \u2227 \u00acNeedMoney), which implies NeedMoney \u2192 False, so \u00acNeedMoney by contradiction (this is a self-contradictory implication that enforces Not NeedMoney).\n\nFrom \u201cHannah works in student jobs on campus\u201d and rule Jobs \u2192 NeedMoney, we derive NeedMoney. From Hannah\u2019s special conditional, NeedMoney implies a contradiction (NeedMoney \u2227 \u00acNeedMoney), so classically this yields \u00acNeedMoney. Together, Jobs \u2192 NeedMoney and \u00acNeedMoney are inconsistent if we keep Jobs true. However, the premises assert Jobs true for Hannah. In classical logic with explosion, everything would follow, but typically in these puzzles we adopt the intended reading: use the special conditional as a constraint showing NeedMoney cannot be true; thus the combination forces that we cannot conclude NeedMoney; instead we conclude \u00acNeedMoney by the special conditional\u2019s contrapositive-like effect. Therefore:\n- We should take Hannah\u2019s special clause as guaranteeing \u00acNeedMoney. Hence Question 1 is False.\n\nFor Questions 2 and 3, we use the disjunction: Takeout \u2228 Enjoy.\n- If Enjoy, then \u00acPicky and SpendTime.\n- If Takeout, then Jobs, which we already know, but that gives no info about Picky or SpendTime.\nGiven only the disjunction, we cannot deduce Enjoy; thus we cannot conclude \u00acPicky and SpendTime. So Question 2, which asserts Hannah is at Mary's school (true) and also not picky and spends a lot of time (which would require Enjoy), is not entailed. Hence Question 2 is Unknown.\n\nQuestion 3 states: Hannah is at Mary's school and she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.\n- This is: AtSchool \u2227 (\u00acPicky \u2228 (Picky \u2192 SpendTime)).\n- The subformula (Picky \u2192 SpendTime) is logically equivalent to (\u00acPicky \u2228 SpendTime).\n- So the whole disjunction becomes: \u00acPicky \u2228 (\u00acPicky \u2228 SpendTime) which simplifies to (\u00acPicky \u2228 SpendTime).\nFrom the given rules, we do not know \u00acPicky or SpendTime unless Enjoy holds; the disjunction Takeout \u2228 Enjoy does not force Enjoy. Therefore we cannot conclude (\u00acPicky \u2228 SpendTime). Thus the conjunction in Q3 is not entailed. Hence Question 3 is Unknown.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: False\n2: Unknown\n3: Unknown",

Note MalaHotpot implies Spicy anyway.\n\nObservations:\n- If something is from Baked by Melissa, it is a cupcake, hence a baked sweet, hence not spicy.\n- DTC is at least one of: Spicy, MalaHotpot, or Not BakedSweet. Either way, we cannot force it to be from BBM, a cupcake, or a baked sweet.\n- If DTC were from BBM, it would be not spicy; but the disjunction allows DTC to be Spicy, which would contradict being from BBM, but the disjunction does not force Spicy\u2014it only allows it. So we cannot conclude either way about BBM.\n- MalaHotpot is optional in the disjunction; not entailed.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1) DTC are products of Baked by Melissa. Not entailed; could be, could not be. Unknown.\n\n2) DTC are not products of Baked by Melissa. Also not entailed; Unknown.\n\n3) DTC are a mala hotpot. Disjunction allows but does not entail; Unknown.\n\n4) DTC are neither products of Baked by Melissa nor baked sweets.\n   - From BBM \u2192 Cupcake \u2192 BakedSweet. So \u201cneither BBM nor baked sweets\u201d means \u00acBBM and \u00acBakedSweet.\n   - We only know (Spicy \u2228 MalaHotpot \u2228 \u00acBakedSweet). This does not entail \u00acBakedSweet; DTC could be Spicy while still possibly being a baked sweet? No: baked sweets are not spicy, so if DTC is Spicy, then DTC is not a baked sweet. So any case where DTC is Spicy implies \u00acBakedSweet. But the disjunction could be satisfied by \u00acBakedSweet directly, or by MalaHotpot (which implies Spicy, hence \u00acBakedSweet). In all satisfying cases, if DTC is Spicy (either directly or via MalaHotpot), then \u00acBakedSweet holds. If the disjunction is satisfied by \u00acBakedSweet, then also \u00acBakedSweet holds. Therefore, in all disjuncts, \u00acBakedSweet holds? Wait carefully: The disjunction is (Spicy \u2228 MalaHotpot \u2228 \u00acBakedSweet). In any world where the disjunction is true, at least one disjunct is true. If Spicy is true, then by \u201cNo baked sweets are spicy,\u201d we conclude \u00acBakedSweet. If MalaHotpot is true, then Spicy is true, thus \u00acBakedSweet. If \u00acBakedSweet is true, then \u00acBakedSweet. Therefore from the given disjunction plus the constraints, we can conclude \u00acBakedSweet is true for DTC. So DTC is not a baked sweet.\n   - Do we know \u00acBBM? If DTC were BBM, then Cupcake \u2192 BakedSweet, contradicting \u00acBakedSweet. Since we have deduced \u00acBakedSweet, it follows DTC cannot be BBM. Therefore \u00acBBM also holds.\n   - Thus statement 4 is True.\n\n5) DTC are cupcakes and products of Baked by Melissa. If BBM then Cupcake and BakedSweet, but we established DTC is not a baked sweet, hence cannot be a cupcake or BBM.

(Some non-takeout places get many negatives; existential, not about H.)\n4) Pop(x) -> Rate4+(x).\n5) Rate4+(H) \u2228 Pop(H).\n\nFrom 4 and 5: If Pop(H) then Rate4+(H). Thus Rate4+(H) \u2228 Pop(H) implies Rate4+(H). Therefore we can conclude Rate4+(H). From 2, Rate4+(H) -> \u00acNeg(H). Hence \u00acNeg(H).\n\nQuestion 1:\nStatement: If Takeout(H) \u2227 Neg(H), then Rate4+(H) \u2227 \u00acTakeout(H).\nBut we have \u00acNeg(H). Therefore the antecedent Takeout(H) \u2227 Neg(H) is false. A material implication with a false antecedent is true. So the whole conditional is true.\n\nQuestion 2:\nStatement: Takeout(H) \u2228 \u00acNeg(H).\nWe have established \u00acNeg(H). Therefore the disjunction is true regardless of Takeout(H).\n\nQuestion 3:\nStatement: \u00acTakeout(H).\nWe have no information linking H to take-out one way or the other; the existential in (3) doesn\u2019t apply specifically to H. From the premises we cannot deduce \u00acTakeout(H). So it is unknown.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: True\n2: True\n3: Unknown",

(So if something is an animal, it is exactly one of these two.)\n- All vertebrate animals have a backbone.\n- All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.\n- All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating. (So bees are animals whose reproduction is not by male-female mating.)\n- All queen bees are bees.\n- Harry is a bee.\n\nFrom Harry is a bee, Harry is a bee, hence reproduces not by male-female mating. If Harry were a vertebrate, he would have a backbone and thus reproduce by male-female mating, contradicting being a bee. Therefore, Harry is not a vertebrate; since animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates, and bees are animals, Harry is an invertebrate.\n\nQuestion 1: Is Harry a queen bee?\n- From Harry is a bee, we cannot infer he is a queen bee; being a queen bee implies being a bee, but not vice versa. No information says Harry is a queen. So it is not entailed, nor contradicted. Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2: Is Harry an invertebrate or a queen bee?\n- We established Harry is an invertebrate.

Also, since all vertebrates have backbones, the case \u201cneither vertebrate nor backbone\u201d would mean Harry lacks a backbone and is not a vertebrate. Is that possible? Yes, consistent with being an invertebrate. So A could be true or false depending on whether Harry has a backbone. We do not have a direct statement about invertebrates and backbones; invertebrates typically lack backbones, but that\u2019s not stated. So truth of A is unknown.\n- Consequent C: \u201cHarry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.\u201d\n  - We established Harry is an invertebrate.

    "model_response": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nGiven rules:\n- R1: If a person is born in a multiple birth, then they spend a lot of time with their siblings. (From the first sentence)\n- R2: If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.\n- R3: If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together. Therefore by R2, complaining implies born in a multiple birth.\n- R4: If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.\n- R5: If people spend a lot of time with their siblings, then they often live at home. Hence spending time \u21d2 live at home \u21d2 not live with strangers.\n- Luke statement: Luke either (A) is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, or (B) is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\n\nNote: The rules talk about \u201cborn in a multiple birth,\u201d \u201clive with strangers,\u201d etc. The disjunction involves \u201cbaby born in a multiple birth,\u201d but the rules do not depend on being a baby, only on \u201cborn in a multiple birth.\u201d\n\nAnalyze consistency:\n- From R5 and R4, if someone spends time with siblings \u21d2 live at home \u21d2 not live with strangers.\n- Option A says: born in multiple birth and lives with strangers. From R1, born in multiple birth \u21d2 spends time \u21d2 not live with strangers. That contradicts \u201clives with strangers.\u201d So Option A is impossible given the rules.\n- Therefore Luke must be in Option B: not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. From \u201cnot a baby born in a multiple birth\u201d we cannot conclude whether he was born in a multiple birth (as a non-baby); but the phrase likely means \u201cnot born in a multiple birth as a baby,\u201d which is ambiguous. However, people are born only as babies; thus \u201cnot a baby born in a multiple birth\u201d is equivalent to \u201cnot born in a multiple birth.\u201d Thus we take Option B as: not born in a multiple birth, and does not live with strangers.\n\nConsequences:\n- Not born in a multiple birth \u21d2 by contrapositive of R2? R2 is: have siblings born together \u21d2 born in multiple birth. Contrapositive: not born in multiple birth \u21d2 do not have siblings born together. So Luke does not have siblings born together.\n- R3: complains often \u21d2 have siblings born together. Contrapositive: not have siblings born together \u21d2 does not complain often. So Luke does not complain often.\n- From not born in multiple birth, we cannot infer about spending time. R1 is one-way: born multiple \u21d2 spend time. No converse.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1) Does Luke spend a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings?\nWe have no rule deriving this from not born in multiple birth or from not living with strangers. So Unknown.\n\n2) Does Luke complain often about annoying siblings?\nFrom above, not have siblings born together \u21d2 does not complain often (by contrapositive of R3). So False that he complains often.\n\n3) Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings.\nWe have derived both: not born in a multiple birth (from Option B) and does not complain often. So the conjunctive statement is True.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: False\n3: True",

(spill \u2192 \u00actidy)\n- All clumsy foodies who go out frequently are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing. (CF \u2192 spill)\n- If someone is cleanly, then they are notably tidy. (cleanly \u2192 tidy)\n- If someone values order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly. (value \u2192 cleanly)\n- All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness value order and spotlessness. (family-order \u2192 value)\n- Peter is either: (spill \u2227 cleanly) or (\u00acspill \u2227 \u00accleanly).\n\nFrom Peter\u2019s disjunction:\n- Case A: spill \u2227 cleanly \u2192 from spill \u2192 \u00actidy; from cleanly \u2192 tidy. This yields a contradiction (tidy \u2227 \u00actidy). In classical logic, this case is inconsistent, so cannot be true in a consistent model.\n- Case B: \u00acspill \u2227 \u00accleanly \u2192 from \u00accleanly we cannot infer anything about tidy directly; we have no rule \u00accleanly \u2192 \u00actidy. Also from \u00acspill we can\u2019t conclude tidy. So no contradiction.\n\nTherefore, only Case B is compatible with the rules in standard consistent reasoning, so we can conclude \u00acspill and \u00accleanly for Peter. We cannot conclude anything about him being a clumsy foodie (which would imply spill) or about his family prioritizing order (which would imply value \u2192 cleanly, contradicting \u00accleanly).\n\nQuestion 1: Is Peter notably tidy?\n- From Case B: \u00accleanly does not imply \u00actidy, and \u00acspill does not imply tidy. No rule derives tidy. Also rule 1 only gives \u00actidy if spill, which we don\u2019t have. So we cannot determine tidy status.\nAnswer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2: Is Peter either a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently or someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness?\n- If he were a clumsy foodie (CF), then spill would follow, contradicting \u00acspill from Case B.\n- If his family prioritizes order (family-order), then value \u2192 cleanly, contradicting \u00accleanly from Case B.\n- Thus neither disjunct can be concluded; in fact both are incompatible with our derived facts, so we cannot assert the disjunction is true. We also cannot prove it false outright from given rules, but since both disjuncts are contradicted by our derived facts, the disjunction is false relative to these conclusions.\nAnswer: False.\n\nQuestion 3: Is Peter either both a clumsy foodie and someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or neither?\n- The statement is an exclusive dichotomy: (CF \u2227 family-order) \u2228 (\u00acCF \u2227 \u00acfamily-order).\n- From above, CF would imply spill, which contradicts \u00acspill, so CF is false. Family-order would imply cleanly, contradicting \u00accleanly, so family-order is false. Therefore \u00acCF \u2227 \u00acfamily-order is true, making the disjunction true.\nAnswer: True.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: False\n3: True",

    "model_response": "Reasoning:\n\n- Given: Barutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin. It is on the southwest coast of Snow Island. Snow Island (along with others) is located in the South Shetland Islands. The statement \"Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands\" appears to be geographically reversed; typically, the South Shetland Islands are located near/part of the Antarctic region. However, using the transitive rule provided, we can only infer locations if given in the form \"A is located in B\" and \"B is located in C\".\n\n- From the text, we do not have an explicit statement that the South Shetland Islands are located in Antarctica. The only location chain we can safely use is: Barutin Cove is on Snow Island; Snow Island is in the South Shetland Islands. We cannot soundly conclude from the provided statements that the South Shetland Islands are in Antarctica (since the text says the opposite: \"Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands\"), so under strict use of given premises, we cannot conclude Barutin Cove is in Antarctica.\n\nQuestion 1: \"Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica.\"\n- We only know it is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin. No support that it is named after any island, let alone all islands in Antarctica. This is false.\n\nQuestion 2: \"There is at least one cove in Antarctica named after a place in Bulgaria.\"\n- We know Barutin Cove is named after a place in Bulgaria. But do we know Barutin Cove is in Antarctica? From the given premises, we cannot validly derive that, because the necessary location chain to Antarctica is not established (the provided Antarctica statement is reversed). Therefore, we cannot conclude there exists such a cove in Antarctica. This is Unknown.\n\nQuestion 3: \"Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica.\"\n- From the given premises, we also cannot conclude it is not in Antarctica; we simply lack a valid link either way. Therefore, this is Unknown.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: False\n2: Unknown\n3: Unknown",

Therefore, in the disjunction \u201cRock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe,\u201d the third option (cannot breathe) is false, so at least one of the first two must be true: Rock can fly or Rock is a bird.\n\nAlso, since Peter\u2019s pets are either monkeys or birds, Rock is either a monkey or a bird.\n\n- If Rock is a bird, then by \u201cPeter\u2019s birds can fly,\u201d Rock can fly.

Therefore, Vladimir does not have Taiwanese citizenship; from the dichotomy, Vladimir must have U.S. citizenship, hence he can register to vote, hence he can participate in the election. Also, we know nothing about whether he is a Russian Federation official.\n- Ekaterina: she can register to vote in the U.S., or she is a Russian Federation official (at least one is true). No further specifics given.\n\nQuestion 1: Vladimir is a Russian federation official.\n- We have no information implying he is or is not an official. Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2: Vladimir is not a Russian federation official.\n- Likewise, no information to conclude not an official. Unknown.\n\nQuestion 3: Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 U.S. presidential election or is a manager at Gazprom.\n- From Ekaterina\u2019s disjunction: either she can register to vote or she is an official. If she can register, then she can participate (by the first rule). The alternative is she is an official; that does not imply manager at Gazprom. But the overall statement is a disjunction: (can participate) OR (manager at Gazprom). If the first disjunct holds (via register), the whole statement is true. If the first disjunct does not hold, then she is an official; we still don\u2019t know about manager. However, since the original disjunction could be satisfied by the register-to-vote branch, and we cannot rule that out, is the statement necessarily true? We need entailment: does the information guarantee the disjunction? We only know at least one of (register) or (official) is true; if the true one is register, then participate is true, making the disjunction true; if the true one is official and she cannot register, we do not know about participate (no rule from official to participate), and we know nothing about manager at Gazprom, so the disjunction could be false. Therefore not entailed. Unknown.\n\nQuestion 4: Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 U.S. presidential election or Vladimir is a manager at Gazprom.\n- Vladimir is not a manager at Gazprom (given). So the second disjunct is false. Thus truth depends on whether Ekaterina can participate. From her disjunction, if she can register, she can participate; if instead she is an official and cannot register, we don\u2019t know she can participate. Not guaranteed. Unknown.\n\nQuestion 5: It is not true that Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election.\n- We deduced Vladimir can participate (he has U.S. citizenship, so can register, so can participate). Thus the conjunction \u201cEkaterina can register AND Vladimir can participate\u201d would be true if Ekaterina can register. We don\u2019t know whether Ekaterina can register (only that register OR official). Therefore we cannot assert that the conjunction is false; it might be true. So the negation \u201cIt is not true that (Ekaterina can register AND Vladimir can participate)\u201d is not entailed. Unknown.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: Unknown\n3: Unknown\n4: Unknown\n5: Unknown",

So cannot conclude it contains carbon.\nAnswer: Unknown.\n\nQ2: Is the mixture an alkane and contains carbon?\n- If it were an alkane, then it is a hydrocarbon \u2192 organic compound \u2192 chemical compound.

Therefore \u201cmixture is an alkane and contains carbon\u201d is false.\nAnswer: False.\n\nQ3: If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane.\n- We know the mixture is neither a chemical compound (\u00acC) nor an alkane (since alkane implies chemical compound, which is false).

    "model_response": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\nPremises extracted:\n- If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. (Deadly \u2192 LowSurvival)\n- Severe cancers are deadly diseases. (Severe \u2192 Deadly)\n- Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. (BileDuct \u2192 Severe)\n- All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. (Cholangio \u2192 BileDuct)\n- Mild flu comes with a low survival rate. (MildFlu \u2192 LowSurvival)\n- Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate. (\u00ac(CRC is BileDuct \u2227 LowSurvival))\n\nFrom these:\n- BileDuct \u2192 Severe \u2192 Deadly \u2192 LowSurvival.\n- Cholangio \u2192 BileDuct \u2192 Severe \u2192 Deadly \u2192 LowSurvival.\n\nAlso, MildFlu \u2192 LowSurvival.\n\nThe constraint about colorectal cancer (CRC): \u00ac(CRC is BileDuct \u2227 LowSurvival). This forbids the conjunction that would follow if CRC were BileDuct; thus CRC cannot be BileDuct (since if it were, it would imply LowSurvival, making the forbidden conjunction true). So we can deduce CRC is not BileDuct. We have no information that CRC has LowSurvival or is Severe or Deadly.\n\nQuestion 1: Is CRC a kind of severe cancer?\n- No premise implies CRC is Severe. We only deduced CRC is not BileDuct; nothing else about severity. So Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2: If CRC is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then CRC is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu.\n- Antecedent: CRC is BileDuct or Cholangio. If Cholangio, then BileDuct (by Cholangio \u2192 BileDuct). So antecedent implies CRC is BileDuct.\n- If CRC were BileDuct, then CRC would be Severe \u2192 Deadly \u2192 LowSurvival. But this contradicts the constraint \u00ac(CRC is BileDuct \u2227 LowSurvival). Therefore, the antecedent is impossible (it cannot be true in any model). A material implication with an impossible antecedent is vacuously true. Hence the statement is True.\n\nQuestion 3: CRC is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above.\n- Parsing: It asserts (CRC is Cholangio and (CRC is MildFlu or CRC is BileDuct)) or all of the above (which still entails the first part). In any case, it requires at least that CRC is Cholangio or CRC is BileDuct or CRC is MildFlu along with Cholangio. We have no evidence CRC is Cholangio or MildFlu, and we deduced CRC is not BileDuct. Therefore the disjunction is unsupported; it is not entailed. We cannot conclude it\u2019s true; nor is it necessarily false (no premise directly negates CRC being Cholangio or MildFlu). So Unknown.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: True\n3: Unknown",

In the second branch, \u00acH is true, and from G \u2192 H contrapositive we cannot derive \u00acG; but since H is false, G must be false (because if G were true, H would be true via G \u2192 N \u2192 H).

(JS \u2192 L)\n  4) If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. (L \u2192 M)\n  5) Yuri does not activate his leg muscles. (\u00acM(Yuri))\n\n- From 3 and 4: JS \u2192 L \u2192 M, so PB \u2192 JS \u2192 L \u2192 M. Therefore, PB \u2192 M.\n- Given \u00acM(Yuri), by contrapositive of PB \u2192 M, Yuri is not a professional basketball player. (\u00acPB)\n\nQuestion 1: Yuri is an American national.\n- We only know \u00acPB. Nothing links American nationality to muscle activation or to PB except the existential claim that some PB are not American. That gives no information about Yuri\u2019s nationality. Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2: Yuri is not an American professional basketball player.\n- \u201cAmerican professional basketball player\u201d means A \u2227 PB. We have \u00acPB, so \u00ac(A \u2227 PB) is true regardless of A. Answer: True.\n\nQuestion 3: Yuri is an American professional basketball player.\n- From above, \u00acPB, so cannot be A \u2227 PB. Answer: False.\n\nQuestion 4: If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player.\n- We know \u00acPB, hence not an American professional basketball player. The consequent is false. The antecedent (\u00acL) is not entailed by \u00acM; from L \u2192 M and \u00acM we get \u00acL by contrapositive, so actually \u00acL is true. Thus we have true antecedent implying false consequent, making the conditional false. Answer: False.\n\nQuestion 5: If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player.\n- Antecedent \u00ac(A \u2227 PB) is true (since \u00acPB). Consequent PB is false. So true implies false, making the conditional false. Answer: False.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: True\n3: False\n4: False\n5: False",
