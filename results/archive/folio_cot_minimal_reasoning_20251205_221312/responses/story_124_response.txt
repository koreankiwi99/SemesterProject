There are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the context: The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas. So their location is ambiguous between NM and TX.
- Juan de Oñate visited the Picuris Mountains. Thus he visited that mountain range, but we don't know whether that range is in NM or TX.
- The Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in the Picuris Mountains and was donated.
- There are no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines that have been donated. Given the mine in Picuris was donated, if Picuris were in Texas, that would contradict this statement. Therefore, Picuris cannot be in Texas; thus the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico.

Question 1:
- Since Picuris is in New Mexico and Juan de Oñate visited the Picuris Mountains, he visited a mountain range in New Mexico. True.

Question 2:
- Since Picuris is not in Texas, Oñate did not visit a mountain range in Texas (based on given info). False.

Question 3:
- The Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in the Picuris Mountains, which we deduced are in New Mexico. Therefore, the statement that it is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico is False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: False
