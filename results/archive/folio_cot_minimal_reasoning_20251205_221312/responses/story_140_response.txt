Steinhauer participated in the 1992 du Maurier Classic.
One six-way tie was on the leaderboard, and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Given: "The winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic was Steinhauer."
- Statement: "Steinhauer was not the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic."
- This directly contradicts the given fact. Therefore, it is false.

Question 2:
- Given: "One six-way tie was on the leaderboard, and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium."
- Given: "Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic."
- We know at least one Belgian was in the six-way tie. We also know Descampe is Belgian and on the leaderboard. However, we are not told that the Belgian in the six-way tie is Descampe; there could be multiple Belgians on the leaderboard, or the Belgian in the tie could be someone else. So it is not entailed that Descampe is in the six-way tie. Therefore, uncertain.
