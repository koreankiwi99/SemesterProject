Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Given: "Susan flies to LGA airport." This specifies her arrival airport is LGA.
- Rule: "The departure and arrival can not be at the same airport."
- From these, we can infer Susan’s departure airport is not LGA. Therefore, the statement "Susan flies from LGA airport" is false.

Question 2:
- Given: "John flies from LGA airport." This specifies his departure airport is LGA.
- There is no information about John’s arrival airport, and the rule only states departure and arrival cannot be the same, but doesn’t specify where he arrives.
- We cannot conclude that he flies to LGA. Therefore, the statement "John flies to LGA airport" is unknown.
