Story ID: 166
Premises: Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

Question 1:
- Tom will rent if: (a) he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and (b) the security deposit is no more than $1500.
- The Olive Garden is a managed building; monthly rent there is $2000; deposit in managed buildings can be equal to the monthly rent or more ⇒ deposit ≥ $2000.
- Thus the deposit at The Olive Garden is more than $1500, so condition (b) fails. Even if pets are allowed (see Q2), Tom’s requirement on the deposit is not met.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude he will rent; indeed, given his condition, he will not rent.
Answer: False.

Question 2:
- Cats are pets; Fluffy is Tom’s cat ⇒ Fluffy is a pet.
- If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.
- We only know “Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.” This does not assert that The Olive Garden allows pets; it only says some do.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy at The Olive Garden.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- In managed buildings, the security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent or more.
- The Olive Garden is a managed building with monthly rent $2000.
- Therefore, its deposit is either $2000 or more.
Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: Unknown
