==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- Premises:
  - If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
  - Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class. (So for any man in Michael’s class, Michael is taller.)
  - Transitivity: If x taller than y, and y taller than z, then x taller than z.
  - Peter is a man who is taller than Michael. (Thus Peter is taller than everyone in Michael’s class as well, by transitivity.)
  - Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
  - Michael cannot block Windy's shooting. (Therefore, Windy must be someone who jumps when shooting; otherwise Michael could block.)
  - Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.

Question 1: Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class.
- Michael is taller than everyone in his class.
- Peter is taller than Michael.
- Therefore Peter is taller than everyone in Michael’s class.
- Hence, “Peter is shorter than a man in Michael’s class” is false.

Question 2: Windy is a great shooter.
- Michael cannot block Windy’s shooting.
- Michael can block any shooting from someone who does not jump; thus if he cannot block Windy, Windy must jump when shooting.
- Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.
- Therefore Windy is a great shooter. True.

Question 3: Peter can block Windy's shooting.
- We know: If a man is taller than another man, the taller can block the other's shooting.
- We do not know Windy’s gender or relative height compared to Peter.
- The only blocking info for Michael had an added condition about jumping, but that condition is only stated for Michael, not a general rule.
- Without knowing that Peter is taller than Windy (or any other condition guaranteeing blocking), we cannot conclude Peter can block Windy’s shooting.
- Thus it is unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: Unknown
