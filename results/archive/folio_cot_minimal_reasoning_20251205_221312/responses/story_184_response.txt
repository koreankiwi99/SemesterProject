Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Facts:
  - "Stranger Things" is a popular Netflix show.
  - If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it. (Popular → Binge)
  - If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it. (Binge ↔ Download)
  - Karen does not download "Black Mirror."
  - "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show.
  - If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa. (Binge → Share)

Question 1: "Stranger Things" is popular ⇒ Karen binge-watches it ⇒ hence she shares it with Lisa. True.

Question 2: From Karen does not download "Black Mirror" and (Binge ↔ Download), we get: not Download ⇒ not Binge. From not Binge and (Popular → Binge), we cannot infer not Popular (only the contrapositive of Popular → Binge is not Binge → not Popular? No, contrapositive is not Binge → not Popular only if the implication were Binge → Popular. We don’t have that. So popularity of Black Mirror remains undetermined. Unknown.

Question 3: Sharing requires binge-watching (since Binge → Share). We have not Binge for "Black Mirror" (from not Download and Binge ↔ Download). Therefore, Karen will not share "Black Mirror" with Lisa. So the statement that she will share it is False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
