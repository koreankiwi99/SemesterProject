Story ID: 191
Premises: A natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.
If the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.
Machine translation is a natural language processing task.
The output of machine translation is a text sequence.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- Premise 1: A natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task. (This implies a dichotomy: each task is one or the other.)
- Premise 2: If the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.
- Premise 3: Machine translation is a natural language processing task.
- Premise 4: The output of machine translation is a text sequence.

From Premises 3 and 4, machine translation outputs a text sequence. By Premise 2, any NLP task with text sequence output is a language generation task. Therefore, machine translation is a language generation task.

Given Premise 1’s dichotomy, if machine translation is a language generation task, then it is not a language understanding task.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
