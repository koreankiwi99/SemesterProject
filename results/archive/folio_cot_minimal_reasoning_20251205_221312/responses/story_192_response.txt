Story ID: 192
Premises: International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
Mike is an international student.
Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the context: Every international student in the US has either an F1 visa or a J1 visa (but not specified which one for any particular student).
- Another statement: An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US. This is a conditional that applies only if the student has an F1 visa and wants to work.
- We know Mike is an international student, and “Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.” This mirrors the conditional requirement for F1 students, but the statement alone does not assert that Mike wants to work or that he has F1; it merely sets a conditional requirement if he wants to work. This does not allow us to deduce that Mike has F1 (since the statement could be a general advisory or may also be true under multiple scenarios depending on policy). The initial context does not state what J1 students need to do, so we cannot exclude J1.

Question 1: We cannot deduce that Mike has an F1 visa; it remains uncertain.
Question 2: Since every international student has either F1 or J1, but we cannot deduce which, saying Mike has J1 is also uncertain.

1: Unknown
