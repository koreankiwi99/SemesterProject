Tom is applying to take the GRE test.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the context: ETS provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship. Those living in single-parent families or having few resources can prove economic hardship. Tom lives in a single-parent family and has few resources. Tom is applying to take the GRE. Therefore, Tom is a GRE applicant who can prove economic hardship, so ETS provides financial aid to Tom.

- The GRE costs $205, which is cheaper than $300. Therefore, it costs below $300 to take the GRE test.

- The statement "No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something" is contradicted by the information that ETS provides financial aid to eligible GRE applicants, and specifically Tom qualifies. Therefore, the statement is false.
