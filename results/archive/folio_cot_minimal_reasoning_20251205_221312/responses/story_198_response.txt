People feel tired when they get the flu.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Q1:
- We are told: Humans are mammals. Mammals are animals. Therefore, humans are animals.
- From this, it follows that there exists at least one animal (since humans exist in general knowledge, but even strictly within the logic, the statements assert a category relation implying the category “animals” is non-empty because it contains mammals, which contain humans).
- Conclusion: There is an animal is supported.

Q2:
- We are told: People feel tired when they get the flu. This is a conditional about what happens if someone gets the flu; it does not assert that nobody gets the flu or that someone does.
- There is no statement that rules out flu occurring.
- Conclusion: “No one gets the flu” is not supported; it could be true or false based on given info. Therefore, Unknown.

Q3:
- We are told: Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.
- Coughing is not listed, and no statement implies it is a symptom.
- From the given information alone, we cannot add coughing as a symptom.
- Conclusion: The statement that symptoms include coughing is not supported; based solely on the provided info, it is False (the list given specifies symptoms and does not include coughing).

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
