==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Given: Vacuums suck. Space is a vacuum. Therefore, by transitivity, space sucks. So Q1 is True.
- Given: Vampires suck, but nothing states that everything that sucks is a vampire. Space being a vacuum that sucks does not imply it is a vampire. So Q2 is False.
- Given: A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck. This is a counterexample to “If something is a household appliance, it sucks.” Therefore that universal statement is False.

1: True
2: False
