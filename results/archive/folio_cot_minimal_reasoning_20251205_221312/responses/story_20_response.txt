Story ID: 20
Premises: A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.
All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From "If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list" and "The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies," we can infer that The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.
- "All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies" does not allow us to infer anything about FIFA 22 unless we know FIFA 22 is on the Top 10 list, which we do not. So we cannot determine whether FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese company.
- Since we established The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list, the statement that it is not on the Top 10 list is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
