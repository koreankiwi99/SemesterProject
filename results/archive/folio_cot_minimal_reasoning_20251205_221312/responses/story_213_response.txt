==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the context: Romance languages are a language family, and all languages within a language family are related to each other.
- French and Spanish are both Romance languages, so they are related to each other.
- All Romance languages are Indo-European languages.

Q1: Basque is not related to any other language. If it were a Romance language, it would be related to other Romance languages (since all within a family are related). This contradicts “Basque is not related to any other language.” Therefore, Basque cannot be a Romance language. Conclusion: False.

Q2: German is related to Spanish (given). If German were a Romance language, it would be in the same family as Spanish. The premises do not say all languages related to Spanish are Romance; they only say all languages within a family are related, not the converse. So being related to Spanish does not imply being Romance. We cannot conclude German is Romance. Also, nothing else states German’s family. Conclusion: Unknown.

Q3: French is a Romance language, and all Romance languages are Indo-European languages. Therefore, French is Indo-European. Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: False
