Story ID: 217
Premises: If George likes music, he wants to compose.
If George has access to a program, he can compose.
If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- From "If George likes music, he wants to compose," liking music implies he wants to compose.
- From "If George has access to a program, he can compose," access implies can compose.
- From "If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose," having both can and wants implies will compose.
- Therefore, if George likes music and has access to a program, then he both wants to compose and can compose, hence he will compose. The statement is true.

Question 2:
- The statement is "If George will not compose, George can not compose."
- From the third rule, if he both can compose and wants to compose, then he will compose. Its contrapositive is: If he will not compose, then it is not the case that (can and wants), i.e., either he cannot compose or he does not want to compose (or both).
- This only guarantees that at least one of “cannot compose” or “does not want to compose” holds, not necessarily “cannot compose.”
- Therefore, the implication "If George will not compose, George cannot compose" is not entailed; it could fail if he does not want to compose while still being able to compose. Hence it is uncertain.

1: True
