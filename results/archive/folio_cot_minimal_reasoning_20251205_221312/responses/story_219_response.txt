==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Q1: We know "Composers write music pieces" (implying if someone writes a music piece, they are a composer). "Beethoven wrote Symphony No. 9," and "Symphony No. 9 is a music piece." Therefore, Beethoven wrote a music piece, so Beethoven is a composer. True.

Q2: "Vienna Music Society premiered Symphony No. 9" and "Symphony No. 9 is a music piece." Thus, at least one orchestra (Vienna Music Society) premiered a music piece. Therefore, some orchestras premiered music pieces. True.

Q3: "Orchestras are led by conductors" and "Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society" (which is an orchestra). From these, we can infer that the leader of an orchestra is a conductor; thus Beethoven, who leads an orchestra, is a conductor. Therefore, the statement "Beethoven is not a conductor" is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: False
