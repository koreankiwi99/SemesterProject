Story ID: 256
Premises: All cats are mammals.
Some pets are not mammals.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Premise 1: All cats are mammals. (Cats ⊆ Mammals)
- Premise 2: Some pets are not mammals. (There exists at least one pet ∉ Mammals)

We are asked: No pets are cats. That is equivalent to: Pets ∩ Cats = ∅.

From Premise 1, any cat must be a mammal. Premise 2 tells us there exist some pets that are not mammals, but it does not say anything about all pets. It remains possible that some other pets are mammals, and thus could be cats. Therefore, we cannot conclude that no pets are cats; the statement is not entailed by the premises and could be false or true depending on the model.
