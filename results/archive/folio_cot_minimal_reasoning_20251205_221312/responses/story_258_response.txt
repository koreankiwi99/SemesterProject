Premises: All humans are mortal.
All Greeks are humans.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "All Greeks are humans" and "All humans are mortal," it follows by transitivity that all Greeks are mortal.
- The statement "Some Greeks are mortal" asserts the existence of at least one Greek and that such an individual is mortal.
- However, the premises do not assert that any Greeks exist; they only state a universal conditional about Greeks. Without an existential premise (e.g., "There exists at least one Greek"), we cannot conclude "Some Greeks are mortal."
- Therefore, the truth of "Some Greeks are mortal" is not entailed by the given statements.
