Story ID: 259
Premises: All horses have hooves.
No humans have hooves.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Premise 1: All horses have hooves. So, if x is a horse, then x has hooves.
- Premise 2: No humans have hooves. So, if x is a human, then x does not have hooves.
- If some humans were horses, those humans would have hooves (from Premise 1), but humans do not have hooves (from Premise 2). This is a contradiction.
- Therefore, it cannot be that some humans are horses.

ANSWERS:
1: False
