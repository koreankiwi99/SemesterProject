==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Premise 1: Every event is either happy or sad. (So each event is in one of the two categories, possibly not both unless exclusivity is implied; but at least it is in the set {happy, sad}.)
- Premise 2: At least one event is happy.

Question: Are all events sad?
- If at least one event is happy, then not all events can be sad.
- Therefore, the statement "All events are sad" is false.

ANSWERS:
1: False
