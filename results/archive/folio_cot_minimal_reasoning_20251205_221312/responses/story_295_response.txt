Story ID: 295
Premises: Some affection is love.
Some love is positive.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Some affection is love. This means there exists at least one entity that is both affection and love.
2) Some love is positive. This means there exists at least one entity that is both love and positive.
3) The question asks whether we can conclude that some affection is positive. From the two premises, we know there is some overlap between affection and love, and some (possibly different) overlap between love and positive. However, without additional information, we cannot conclude that the same individuals in the affection ∩ love set are also in the love ∩ positive set. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow.
