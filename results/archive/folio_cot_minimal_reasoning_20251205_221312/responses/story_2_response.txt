Story ID: 2
Premises: Billings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.
The state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.
White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.
The city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.
Any city in Butte is not in St Pierre.
A city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the context: "The state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula." Therefore, Butte is in Montana, and Missoula is in Montana.
- "The city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana." So St Pierre is not in Montana.
- "Any city in Butte is not in St Pierre." This is odd phrasing; likely irrelevant to state membership of Butte and St Pierre.
- "A city can only be in one state in U.S. except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City." None of these exceptions involve Butte or St Pierre.

Question 1: Are Butte and St Pierre in the same state?
- Butte is in Montana; St Pierre is not in Montana. Given single-state rule (no exception applies), they cannot be in the same state. So False.

Question 2: Are St Pierre and Bismarck in the same state?
- We have no information about Bismarck’s state in the given context. We only know St Pierre is not in Montana, but nothing about Bismarck’s state from the provided text. Therefore Unknown.

Question 3: Is Montana home to the city of Missoula?
- Directly stated that Montana includes Missoula. So True.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: Unknown
3: True
