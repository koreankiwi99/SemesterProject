Story ID: 306
Premises: If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews.
All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.

Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

Let:
- Rec(x): x is listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
- Neg(x): x receives many negative reviews.
- Rate4+(x): x has rating greater than 4.
- Takeout(x): x provides take-out service.
- Pop(x): x is popular among local residents.
- H: the Hamden Plaza Subway store.

Given:
1) Rec(x) -> ¬Neg(x).
2) Rate4+(x) -> Rec(x). Hence Rate4+(x) -> ¬Neg(x).
3) ∃x (¬Takeout(x) ∧ Neg(x)). (Some non-takeout places get many negatives; existential, not about H.)
4) Pop(x) -> Rate4+(x).
5) Rate4+(H) ∨ Pop(H).

From 4 and 5: If Pop(H) then Rate4+(H). Thus Rate4+(H) ∨ Pop(H) implies Rate4+(H). Therefore we can conclude Rate4+(H). From 2, Rate4+(H) -> ¬Neg(H). Hence ¬Neg(H).

Question 1:
Statement: If Takeout(H) ∧ Neg(H), then Rate4+(H) ∧ ¬Takeout(H).
But we have ¬Neg(H). Therefore the antecedent Takeout(H) ∧ Neg(H) is false. A material implication with a false antecedent is true. So the whole conditional is true.

Question 2:
Statement: Takeout(H) ∨ ¬Neg(H).
We have established ¬Neg(H). Therefore the disjunction is true regardless of Takeout(H).

Question 3:
Statement: ¬Takeout(H).
We have no information linking H to take-out one way or the other; the existential in (3) doesn’t apply specifically to H. From the premises we cannot deduce ¬Takeout(H). So it is unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
