Story ID: 315
Premises: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. 
If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

Given facts:
- If something can transport multiple passengers, then it is not a one-seater.
- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers. Therefore, every Tesla Model 3 is not a one-seater.
- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. Therefore, all Solo EV are one-seaters (and hence cannot transport multiple passengers).
- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. This conditional is a tautology instance (P → (P ∨ Q)) and gives no substantive information about whether John's car is a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.

Question 1: Is John's car a Tesla Model 3?
- No information directly asserts John’s car is or isn’t a Tesla Model 3. The provided conditional is tautological and uninformative. So we cannot conclude either way.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2: Is John's car a Solo EV?
- No information connects John’s car specifically to being a Solo EV. No assertions about John’s car being single-seat or one-seater are given.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3: Is John's car not a Solo EV?
- Since we cannot determine that John’s car is a Solo EV, we also cannot conclude that it is not a Solo EV.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
