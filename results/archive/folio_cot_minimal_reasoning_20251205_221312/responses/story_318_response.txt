Story ID: 318
Premises: Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.
If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.

Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given facts:
- There exists some show airing at 8 pm on Monday that gives out roses on TV. (Existential: at least one such show exists; not specified which.)
- If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
- The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
- All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. Hence any show that gives out roses is reality TV.
- Breaking Bad is a show.
- Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

From these, if a show gives out roses, it is reality TV. Since Breaking Bad is not reality TV, it cannot be a show that gives out roses.

Question 1: "Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm."
- No information ties Breaking Bad to Monday at 8 pm. The existential statement about some show does not imply it is Breaking Bad.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2: "Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm."
- If Breaking Bad had roses given out, it would be reality TV, contradicting that Breaking Bad is not reality TV. Therefore, it cannot be a show where roses are given out (regardless of time).
- Conclusion: False.

Question 3: "If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm."
- Antecedent (roses given out during Breaking Bad) is impossible given the premises (would make it reality TV, which Breaking Bad is not). In classical logic with material implication, a conditional with an impossible antecedent is vacuously true. Based on the given information, the conditional is therefore true.
- Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
