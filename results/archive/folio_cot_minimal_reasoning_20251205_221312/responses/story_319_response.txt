Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

Given facts:
- No baked sweets are spicy. (BakedSweet → not Spicy)
- All cupcakes are baked sweets. (Cupcake → BakedSweet)
- All mala hotpots are spicy. (MalaHotpot → Spicy)
- All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes. (BBM → Cupcake → BakedSweet → not Spicy)
- Dried Thai chilies (DTC) are: Spicy or MalaHotpot or Not BakedSweet. Formally: DTC ∈ (Spicy ∨ MalaHotpot ∨ ¬BakedSweet). Note MalaHotpot implies Spicy anyway.

Observations:
- If something is from Baked by Melissa, it is a cupcake, hence a baked sweet, hence not spicy.
- DTC is at least one of: Spicy, MalaHotpot, or Not BakedSweet. Either way, we cannot force it to be from BBM, a cupcake, or a baked sweet.
- If DTC were from BBM, it would be not spicy; but the disjunction allows DTC to be Spicy, which would contradict being from BBM, but the disjunction does not force Spicy—it only allows it. So we cannot conclude either way about BBM.
- MalaHotpot is optional in the disjunction; not entailed.

Questions:

1) DTC are products of Baked by Melissa. Not entailed; could be, could not be. Unknown.

2) DTC are not products of Baked by Melissa. Also not entailed; Unknown.

3) DTC are a mala hotpot. Disjunction allows but does not entail; Unknown.

4) DTC are neither products of Baked by Melissa nor baked sweets.
   - From BBM → Cupcake → BakedSweet. So “neither BBM nor baked sweets” means ¬BBM and ¬BakedSweet.
   - We only know (Spicy ∨ MalaHotpot ∨ ¬BakedSweet). This does not entail ¬BakedSweet; DTC could be Spicy while still possibly being a baked sweet? No: baked sweets are not spicy, so if DTC is Spicy, then DTC is not a baked sweet. So any case where DTC is Spicy implies ¬BakedSweet. But the disjunction could be satisfied by ¬BakedSweet directly, or by MalaHotpot (which implies Spicy, hence ¬BakedSweet). In all satisfying cases, if DTC is Spicy (either directly or via MalaHotpot), then ¬BakedSweet holds. If the disjunction is satisfied by ¬BakedSweet, then also ¬BakedSweet holds. Therefore, in all disjuncts, ¬BakedSweet holds? Wait carefully: The disjunction is (Spicy ∨ MalaHotpot ∨ ¬BakedSweet). In any world where the disjunction is true, at least one disjunct is true. If Spicy is true, then by “No baked sweets are spicy,” we conclude ¬BakedSweet. If MalaHotpot is true, then Spicy is true, thus ¬BakedSweet. If ¬BakedSweet is true, then ¬BakedSweet. Therefore from the given disjunction plus the constraints, we can conclude ¬BakedSweet is true for DTC. So DTC is not a baked sweet.
   - Do we know ¬BBM? If DTC were BBM, then Cupcake → BakedSweet, contradicting ¬BakedSweet. Since we have deduced ¬BakedSweet, it follows DTC cannot be BBM. Therefore ¬BBM also holds.
   - Thus statement 4 is True.

5) DTC are cupcakes and products of Baked by Melissa. If BBM then Cupcake and BakedSweet, but we established DTC is not a baked sweet, hence cannot be a cupcake or BBM. So this is False.
