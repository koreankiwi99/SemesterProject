Premises: All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.

Some stocks are growth stocks.
All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
KO is a mature stock.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- We have categories: stocks, growth stocks, mature stocks, retirement-fund-suitable, bought-to-earn-rapid-appreciation.
- Premises:
  1) All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation. (Growth ⊆ Bought-for-rapid)
  2) If a stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund. (Bought-for-rapid → ¬Suitable)
  3) Some stocks are growth stocks. (∃x: Stock(x) ∧ Growth(x))
  4) All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. (Mature ⊆ Suitable)
  5) KO is a mature stock. (Mature(KO))

From (4) and (5): KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
No explicit premise states that all mature stocks are stocks, but “mature stock” is a subtype of stock in ordinary reading. However, strict logical derivation requires an explicit link. The premises say “KO is a mature stock,” which directly asserts KO is a stock (since “mature stock” linguistically entails being a stock). Thus KO is a stock follows from the given phrasing.

Also, from suitability of KO and rule (2): If KO were bought for rapid appreciation, it would be not suitable, contradicting suitability. So KO is not bought for rapid appreciation. From (1), being a growth stock implies bought for rapid; contrapositive is not given to infer not growth from not bought-for-rapid, since (1) is one-way. But we can deduce KO is not a growth stock by contradiction with suitability only if we use (1)+(2): Growth → Bought-for-rapid → ¬Suitable, but KO is Suitable, so KO cannot be Growth. So KO is not a growth stock.

Question 1: KO is a stock.
Given “KO is a mature stock,” it asserts KO is a stock. True.

Question 2: KO is a stock and a growth stock.
We have KO is a stock (True) and KO is not a growth stock (as above). Therefore the conjunction is False.

Question 3: If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.
Antecedent: (Growth(KO) or Bought-for-rapid(KO)).
From earlier, both disjuncts are actually false for KO, but for a material implication, truth is about all cases consistent with premises, not actual truth value unless entailed. We assess whether the implication is logically entailed by the premises.
- If Growth(KO), then by (1) Bought-for-rapid(KO), then by (2) ¬Suitable(KO). But that gives no information about KO being a stock or about volatility. We do know KO is a stock from Q1. The consequent says “KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile,” which asserts not a stock and not volatile. Not-stock contradicts KO being a stock as established from the premises. Since the antecedent could be true in a hypothetical scenario consistent with premises? Actually Growth(KO) is inconsistent with the premises because KO is suitable (from being mature), and Growth → Bought-for-rapid → ¬Suitable, contradiction. So the antecedent cannot be true given the premises; similarly Bought-for-rapid(KO) contradicts suitability. Therefore the antecedent is false in all models satisfying the premises. A material implication with always-false antecedent is always true (vacuously). Thus the implication is entailed as True.

ANSWERS:
1: True
