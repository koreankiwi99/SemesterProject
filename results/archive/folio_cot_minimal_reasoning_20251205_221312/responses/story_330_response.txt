Story ID: 330
Premises: All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given statements:
1) All who make wedding plans are engaged. (plans -> engaged)
2) All who invite others to their ceremony make wedding plans. (invite-others -> plans -> engaged)
3) Anyone with a well-attended wedding invites others to their ceremony. (well-attended -> invite-others -> plans -> engaged)
4) Some people with well-attended weddings have larger families. (Existential; does not specify John.)
5) If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans. (engaged(John) -> [not invite-friends(John)] AND plans(John))
6) If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. (larger-family(John) -> well-attended(John) OR invite-friends(John))

Note: The premises distinguish “invite others to their ceremony” (2,3) from “invite friends to their ceremony” (5,6). These are not logically identical, so we cannot equate them unless stated.

Derivations:
- From (5): If engaged(John), then plans(John). From (1), plans -> engaged, so (5) is consistent and yields engaged(John) -> engaged(John) trivially; it also gives not invite-friends(John).
- From (2): invite-others -> plans, and then engaged. From (3): well-attended -> invite-others -> engaged.
- From (6): If larger-family(John), then [well-attended(John) OR invite-friends(John)].
  If larger-family and well-attended, then by (3) John invites others, thus makes plans, thus is engaged. That does not produce a contradiction. If larger-family and invite-friends, that does not imply inviting others (friends vs others are distinct here), so no further consequence.

No premise asserts that John has a larger family or that he does not. The existential in (4) does not apply specifically to John.

No premise asserts John is engaged, nor that he invites others; the only conditionals are hypothetical. Therefore:
- Q1 (John has a larger family): Not entailed; also not contradicted. Unknown.
- Q2 (John does not have a larger family): Also not entailed. Unknown.
- Q3 (John is engaged): Not entailed; only follows if he plans or invites others, which is not given. Unknown.
- Q4 (John neither has a larger family nor invites others): We have no entailment that he lacks a larger family, nor that he does not invite others. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
4: Unknown
