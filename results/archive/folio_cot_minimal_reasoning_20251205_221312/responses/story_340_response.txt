Premises: Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.
Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player.
All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities.
All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes.
If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid.
If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous.
All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens.
Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor,” Djokovic (at the mixer) is in the set G ∪ O.
- Grand Slam champions at the mixer ⇒ professional tennis players ⇒ athletes.
- Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer ⇒ celebrities.
- If celebrity ⇒ well paid ⇒ live in tax havens.
- If athlete ⇒ famous.
- Also given: “Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.” This is a conditional that may or may not fire.

Question 1:
- We only know Djokovic is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor. There’s no information forcing one disjunct. So “Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion” is not entailed.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Case 1: If Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, then he is a celebrity ⇒ well paid ⇒ lives in a tax haven.
- Case 2: If Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, then he is a professional tennis player ⇒ athlete ⇒ famous. By the given conditional, if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then he is well-paid. Thus he is well-paid ⇒ lives in a tax haven.
- In both disjoint possibilities, Djokovic lives in a tax haven. So it is entailed that he lives in a tax haven.
- Answer: True.

Question 3:
- This is the negation of Question 2’s conclusion. Since we concluded he does live in a tax haven, the statement “Djokovic does not live in a tax haven” is false.
- Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
