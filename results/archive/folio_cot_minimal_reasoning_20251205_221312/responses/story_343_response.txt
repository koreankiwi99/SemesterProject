Story ID: 343
Premises: No digital media are analog.
Every printed text is analog media.
All streaming services are digital media.
If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.
If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

Given premises:
- No digital media are analog. (Digital → not Analog)
- Every printed text is analog media. (Printed → Analog)
- All streaming services are digital media. (Streaming → Digital)
- If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text. (Hardcover → Printed)
- If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book. (Streaming(1984) → Hardcover(1984))

From Streaming(1984) → Hardcover(1984) and Hardcover → Printed, we get:
- Streaming(1984) → Printed(1984).
Also, Streaming → Digital and Digital → not Analog, while Printed → Analog. Thus Streaming(1984) would imply Printed(1984) and hence Analog(1984), but also Digital(1984) and hence not Analog(1984), a contradiction. Therefore, Streaming(1984) cannot be true; it is ruled out by the premises. Hence, we can conclude not Streaming(1984).

Question 1: Is 1984 printed text?
- We only know that if it were streaming, it would be hardcover, hence printed. But since streaming is impossible, we cannot infer Printed(1984). No premise directly asserts Printed(1984). So this is Unknown.

Question 2: Is 1984 a streaming service?
- As shown, Streaming(1984) leads to a contradiction with the premises, so it must be false.

Question 3: Is 1984 not a streaming service?
- From the contradiction, we concluded not Streaming(1984). So this is True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
