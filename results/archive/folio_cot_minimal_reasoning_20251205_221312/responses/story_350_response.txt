Story ID: 350
Premises: All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Let’s formalize key facts:
- All Zaha Hadid (ZH) styles that Max adores have interesting geometries (IG).
- No brutalist buildings that Max adores have IG. So if Max adores a brutalist building, it does not have IG.
- Every style that Max adores is either ZH or Kelly Wearstler (KW).
- All KW styles that Max adores are evocative (E) and dreamy (D).
- If a design by Max that he adores has IG, then it is a brutalist building and E.

From ZH-adored ⇒ IG and IG ⇒ brutalist, we get: ZH-adored ⇒ brutalist. But also no adored brutalist has IG, which contradicts the IG from ZH-adored. This implies Max cannot adore any ZH style (otherwise contradictions arise). Thus all adored styles must be KW, and thus are E and D, and not IG (since adored brutalist are not IG and KW-adored need not be brutalist). Also, nothing forces KW-adored to be brutalist.

Question 1: “A design by Max is a brutalist building.”
We cannot conclude that any given design by Max is brutalist. From above, adored ZH would be brutalist but is impossible; KW-adored are not stated to be brutalist. No entailment. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: “A design by Max is evocative and dreamy.”
For adored designs: all adored styles are KW, and all KW-adored are E and D. So any adored design by Max is E and D. The statement lacks “adored,” but context consistently talks about designs/styles Max adores. Interpreting consistently as “a design by Max that he adores,” it is entailed to be E and D. Answer: True.

Question 3: “A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy.”
From Q2, adored designs are both E and D, thus certainly E or D. Under the same interpretation (adored designs), this is entailed. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: True
