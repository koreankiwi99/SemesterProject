==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- All business organizations are legal entities.
- All companies are business organizations. Therefore, all companies are legal entities.
- All private companies are companies. Therefore, all private companies are legal entities.
- All legal entities are created under law.
- All legal entities have legal obligations.
- If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company.

Let H = Harvard Weekly Book Club.

From the universals:
- If H is a legal entity, then H is created under law and has legal obligations.
- From the contrapositive of “If created under law then not a private company” we cannot infer anything (only given the forward direction).

We are not told H is a business organization, company, or private company. So we cannot conclude H is a legal entity directly. The only route to obligations would be to establish H is a legal entity (or created under law, since legal entity ⇒ created under law, but not conversely). We do not know H is created under law either; we only have a conditional about that case.

Question 1: “The Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations.”
We do not know H is a legal entity or created under law. No premise establishes that. So this is not entailed. It’s not contradicted either. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: “The Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations and is a private company.”
We cannot establish either conjunct. Moreover, if H were created under law, it would not be a private company; but we don’t know that condition holds. The conjunction is not entailed. Not contradicted outright (since H could be a private company only if not created under law, but we still don’t know obligations). Overall, Unknown.

Question 3: “If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law.”
If H is a private company, then by the chain: private company ⇒ company ⇒ business organization ⇒ legal entity. Then legal entity ⇒ has legal obligations and ⇒ created under law. Therefore, the consequent “either has legal obligations or is created under law” is true (both, in fact). So the conditional is true. Answer: True.
