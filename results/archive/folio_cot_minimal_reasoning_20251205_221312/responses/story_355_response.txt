Premises: All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.
All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.
All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.

Model Response:
==================================================
Let's translate the statements into logical implications.

Definitions:
- S(x): x eats salads regularly.
- C(x): x is very conscious about health and eating habits.
- H(x): x grew up in a health-conscious childhood home.
- N(x): x fulfills daily nutritional intakes.
- D(x): x disregards physical well-being.
- G(x): x visits the gym at least once a day.

Given premises:
1) S → C
2) H → S
3) N → H
4) D → ¬C
5) G → N
6) Taylor: (H ∧ D) ∨ (¬H ∧ ¬D)

From 2, H → S, so if Taylor is in the (H ∧ D) branch, then she eats salads S. If she is in (¬H ∧ ¬D), then we have no implication to S. So S is not entailed overall.

For gym: From 5, G → N → H (by 3). Thus G implies H. In the (¬H ∧ ¬D) branch, H is false, so G must be false there. In the (H ∧ D) branch, H is true, which is consistent with G being either true or false (G → H does not force G). Therefore, overall we cannot conclude G; it's not entailed nor contradicted.

For the combined statement in Q3: “Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day” is (¬H ∧ ¬G).
From 6, either (H ∧ D) or (¬H ∧ ¬D). In the first branch, ¬H is false, so (¬H ∧ ¬G) is false. In the second branch, ¬H is true, and from G → H contrapositive we cannot derive ¬G; but since H is false, G must be false (because if G were true, H would be true via G → N → H). Thus in the (¬H ∧ ¬D) branch, ¬G is also true, so (¬H ∧ ¬G) is true. Since the overall statement depends on which branch holds and both are possible given the premises, we cannot determine it; it is not entailed nor contradicted—so uncertain.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
