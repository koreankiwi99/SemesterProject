Story ID: 361
Premises: If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly

Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

Given rules:
- If someone spills a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy. (spill → ¬tidy)
- All clumsy foodies who go out frequently are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing. (CF → spill)
- If someone is cleanly, then they are notably tidy. (cleanly → tidy)
- If someone values order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly. (value → cleanly)
- All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness value order and spotlessness. (family-order → value)
- Peter is either: (spill ∧ cleanly) or (¬spill ∧ ¬cleanly).

From Peter’s disjunction:
- Case A: spill ∧ cleanly → from spill → ¬tidy; from cleanly → tidy. This yields a contradiction (tidy ∧ ¬tidy). In classical logic, this case is inconsistent, so cannot be true in a consistent model.
- Case B: ¬spill ∧ ¬cleanly → from ¬cleanly we cannot infer anything about tidy directly; we have no rule ¬cleanly → ¬tidy. Also from ¬spill we can’t conclude tidy. So no contradiction.

Therefore, only Case B is compatible with the rules in standard consistent reasoning, so we can conclude ¬spill and ¬cleanly for Peter. We cannot conclude anything about him being a clumsy foodie (which would imply spill) or about his family prioritizing order (which would imply value → cleanly, contradicting ¬cleanly).

Question 1: Is Peter notably tidy?
- From Case B: ¬cleanly does not imply ¬tidy, and ¬spill does not imply tidy. No rule derives tidy. Also rule 1 only gives ¬tidy if spill, which we don’t have. So we cannot determine tidy status.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Is Peter either a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently or someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness?
- If he were a clumsy foodie (CF), then spill would follow, contradicting ¬spill from Case B.
- If his family prioritizes order (family-order), then value → cleanly, contradicting ¬cleanly from Case B.
- Thus neither disjunct can be concluded; in fact both are incompatible with our derived facts, so we cannot assert the disjunction is true. We also cannot prove it false outright from given rules, but since both disjuncts are contradicted by our derived facts, the disjunction is false relative to these conclusions.
Answer: False.

Question 3: Is Peter either both a clumsy foodie and someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or neither?
- The statement is an exclusive dichotomy: (CF ∧ family-order) ∨ (¬CF ∧ ¬family-order).
- From above, CF would imply spill, which contradicts ¬spill, so CF is false. Family-order would imply cleanly, contradicting ¬cleanly, so family-order is false. Therefore ¬CF ∧ ¬family-order is true, making the disjunction true.
Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
