Premises: All hydrocarbons are organic compounds .
All alkanes are hydrocarbons
All organic compounds are chemical compounds.
All organic compounds contain carbon.
No chemical compounds contain only one element.
The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given facts:
- All hydrocarbons are organic compounds.
- All alkanes are hydrocarbons.
- All organic compounds are chemical compounds.
- All organic compounds contain carbon.
- No chemical compounds contain only one element.
- The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. (Exclusive biconditional: (C ∧ O) ∨ (¬C ∧ ¬O), where C = “mixture is a chemical compound,” O = “mixture contains only one element.”)

From “No chemical compounds contain only one element,” we have C → ¬O, equivalently O → ¬C.

Combine with the mixture condition: possibilities:
- If (C ∧ O) were true, it would contradict C → ¬O. So (C ∧ O) is impossible.
- Thus we must have (¬C ∧ ¬O). Therefore, the mixture is not a chemical compound and does not contain only one element.

We know nothing else about the mixture being organic, hydrocarbon, or alkane; those apply only if it were in those categories.

Q1: Does the mixture contain carbon?
- We only know it is not a chemical compound and not single-element. No rule links “contains carbon” to non-compounds. Organic compounds contain carbon, but we do not know the mixture is organic or even a compound. So cannot conclude it contains carbon.
Answer: Unknown.

Q2: Is the mixture an alkane and contains carbon?
- If it were an alkane, then it is a hydrocarbon → organic compound → chemical compound. But we deduced the mixture is not a chemical compound. So it cannot be an alkane. Therefore “mixture is an alkane and contains carbon” is false.
Answer: False.

Q3: If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane.
- We know the mixture is neither a chemical compound (¬C) nor an alkane (since alkane implies chemical compound, which is false). That already holds unconditionally.
- Therefore the implication holds regardless of the antecedent; specifically, the consequent “neither a chemical compound nor an alkane” is true for the mixture, so the conditional is true.
Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
