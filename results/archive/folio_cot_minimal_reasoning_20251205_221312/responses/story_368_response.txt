Premises: If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition.
If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus.
People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.
If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters.
If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.
Hannah is at Mary's school.
Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.

Step-by-step reasoning:

Given facts and rules:
- If someone at Mary's school works in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition. (Jobs → NeedMoney)
- If someone orders takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus. (Takeout → Jobs)
- People at Mary's school either order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes. (Takeout ∨ Enjoy)
- If someone enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters. (Enjoy → ¬Picky)
- If someone enjoys the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. (Enjoy → SpendTime)
- Hannah is at Mary's school.
- Hannah works in student jobs on campus. Also: If Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. Formally: NeedMoney → (¬Picky ∧ ¬NeedMoney), which implies NeedMoney → False, so ¬NeedMoney by contradiction (this is a self-contradictory implication that enforces Not NeedMoney).

From “Hannah works in student jobs on campus” and rule Jobs → NeedMoney, we derive NeedMoney. From Hannah’s special conditional, NeedMoney implies a contradiction (NeedMoney ∧ ¬NeedMoney), so classically this yields ¬NeedMoney. Together, Jobs → NeedMoney and ¬NeedMoney are inconsistent if we keep Jobs true. However, the premises assert Jobs true for Hannah. In classical logic with explosion, everything would follow, but typically in these puzzles we adopt the intended reading: use the special conditional as a constraint showing NeedMoney cannot be true; thus the combination forces that we cannot conclude NeedMoney; instead we conclude ¬NeedMoney by the special conditional’s contrapositive-like effect. Therefore:
- We should take Hannah’s special clause as guaranteeing ¬NeedMoney. Hence Question 1 is False.

For Questions 2 and 3, we use the disjunction: Takeout ∨ Enjoy.
- If Enjoy, then ¬Picky and SpendTime.
- If Takeout, then Jobs, which we already know, but that gives no info about Picky or SpendTime.
Given only the disjunction, we cannot deduce Enjoy; thus we cannot conclude ¬Picky and SpendTime. So Question 2, which asserts Hannah is at Mary's school (true) and also not picky and spends a lot of time (which would require Enjoy), is not entailed. Hence Question 2 is Unknown.

Question 3 states: Hannah is at Mary's school and she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.
- This is: AtSchool ∧ (¬Picky ∨ (Picky → SpendTime)).
- The subformula (Picky → SpendTime) is logically equivalent to (¬Picky ∨ SpendTime).
- So the whole disjunction becomes: ¬Picky ∨ (¬Picky ∨ SpendTime) which simplifies to (¬Picky ∨ SpendTime).
From the given rules, we do not know ¬Picky or SpendTime unless Enjoy holds; the disjunction Takeout ∨ Enjoy does not force Enjoy. Therefore we cannot conclude (¬Picky ∨ SpendTime). Thus the conjunction in Q3 is not entailed. Hence Question 3 is Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
