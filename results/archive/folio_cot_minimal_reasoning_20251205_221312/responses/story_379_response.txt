Story ID: 379
Premises: People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.
If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.
If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. 
Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers

Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

Given rules:
- R1: If a person is born in a multiple birth, then they spend a lot of time with their siblings. (From the first sentence)
- R2: If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
- R3: If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together. Therefore by R2, complaining implies born in a multiple birth.
- R4: If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
- R5: If people spend a lot of time with their siblings, then they often live at home. Hence spending time ⇒ live at home ⇒ not live with strangers.
- Luke statement: Luke either (A) is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, or (B) is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.

Note: The rules talk about “born in a multiple birth,” “live with strangers,” etc. The disjunction involves “baby born in a multiple birth,” but the rules do not depend on being a baby, only on “born in a multiple birth.”

Analyze consistency:
- From R5 and R4, if someone spends time with siblings ⇒ live at home ⇒ not live with strangers.
- Option A says: born in multiple birth and lives with strangers. From R1, born in multiple birth ⇒ spends time ⇒ not live with strangers. That contradicts “lives with strangers.” So Option A is impossible given the rules.
- Therefore Luke must be in Option B: not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers. From “not a baby born in a multiple birth” we cannot conclude whether he was born in a multiple birth (as a non-baby); but the phrase likely means “not born in a multiple birth as a baby,” which is ambiguous. However, people are born only as babies; thus “not a baby born in a multiple birth” is equivalent to “not born in a multiple birth.” Thus we take Option B as: not born in a multiple birth, and does not live with strangers.

Consequences:
- Not born in a multiple birth ⇒ by contrapositive of R2? R2 is: have siblings born together ⇒ born in multiple birth. Contrapositive: not born in multiple birth ⇒ do not have siblings born together. So Luke does not have siblings born together.
- R3: complains often ⇒ have siblings born together. Contrapositive: not have siblings born together ⇒ does not complain often. So Luke does not complain often.
- From not born in multiple birth, we cannot infer about spending time. R1 is one-way: born multiple ⇒ spend time. No converse.

Questions:

1) Does Luke spend a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings?
We have no rule deriving this from not born in multiple birth or from not living with strangers. So Unknown.

2) Does Luke complain often about annoying siblings?
From above, not have siblings born together ⇒ does not complain often (by contrapositive of R3). So False that he complains often.

3) Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings.
We have derived both: not born in a multiple birth (from Option B) and does not complain often. So the conjunctive statement is True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
