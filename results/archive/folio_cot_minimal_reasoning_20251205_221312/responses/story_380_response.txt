Story ID: 380
Premises: People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. 
Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.

Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

Let’s define predicates for clarity:
- P(x): x performs in school talent shows often.
- E(x): x attends and is very engaged with school events.
- S(x): x is a student who attends the school.
- C(x): x chaperones high school dances.
- I(x): x is inactive and disinterested community member.
- Y(x): x is a young child or teenager.
- W(x): x wishes to further their academic careers and educational opportunities.

Given statements:
1) P(x) → E(x).
2) For club members x: P(x) ∨ I(x).
3) C(x) → ¬S(x).
4) I(x) → C(x).
5) For club members: (Y(x) ∧ W(x)) → S(x).
6) For Bonnie: (E(B) ∧ S(B)) ∨ (¬E(B) ∧ ¬S(B)). (Exclusive-like structure: either both E and S, or both not.)

From 4 and 3: I(x) → C(x) → ¬S(x). So I(x) → ¬S(x).
From 2 and 1: If not I(x), then P(x) must hold (by 2), and then E(x) holds (by 1). But 2 is a disjunction; it doesn’t force P unless we know ¬I. Keep relations in mind.

Analyze Bonnie with (6): Either Case A: E(B) ∧ S(B), or Case B: ¬E(B) ∧ ¬S(B). Both are consistent with other info; no further constraints link E/S directly to P or I except P→E and I→¬S.

Question 1: Does Bonnie perform often (P(B))?
- If Case A (E ∧ S): P not entailed; P→E is one-way. So P could be either true or false.
- If Case B (¬E ∧ ¬S): From 2, P ∨ I. If P, then by 1 E would be true, contradicting ¬E. So P cannot be true in Case B. Thus in Case B we must have I true. That’s consistent (I → ¬S matches ¬S).
Therefore, across cases: Case A leaves P unknown; Case B forces ¬P. Since both cases are possible, overall we cannot conclude P(B). Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: If [ (Y∧W∧C) ∨ ¬(Y∧W) ] then [ S ∨ I ] for Bonnie.
We need to test validity under all models consistent with the premises.

Consider two sub-antecedent branches:
- Branch 1: ¬(Y∧W). Then the implication requires S ∨ I. Do we know that? Not directly. From (6), Bonnie is either (E ∧ S) or (¬E ∧ ¬S). In the first, S is true, so S ∨ I holds. In the second, S is false; we need I to make S ∨ I true. Do we get I? Not necessarily from ¬(Y∧W). So the implication could fail unless other premises force I. They don’t. Construct a countermodel: Take Case B (¬E ∧ ¬S), set ¬(Y∧W) true, and also set I false. Check consistency: From 2, P ∨ I. If I is false, then P must be true. But if P is true, then E must be true by 1, contradicting ¬E. So in Case B we cannot have I false. Hence in Case B, I must be true. Therefore in Case B, S ∨ I holds. In Case A, S holds. Thus in all possibilities under ¬(Y∧W), S ∨ I holds. So Branch 1 is satisfied.

- Branch 2: (Y∧W∧C). From (Y∧W) and premise 5, S must be true. From C and 3, ¬S must be true. Contradiction. Thus Branch 2 of the antecedent is impossible under the premises; the overall antecedent cannot be true via this branch. Therefore whenever the overall antecedent is true, it must be via Branch 1, which we showed entails S ∨ I. Hence the implication holds. Answer: True.

Question 3: If [ C ∨ (¬C → P) ] then [ (Y∧W) ∧ I ] for Bonnie.
We need to see if this implication is valid. Test a counterexample where antecedent true but consequent false.

Evaluate antecedent:
- If C is true, antecedent is true.
- If C is false, need (¬C → P), which is a material implication: with ¬C true, it requires P true. So antecedent is true if either C is true, or (C is false and P true).

Try to make consequent false: want ¬(Y∧W) ∨ ¬I. We can aim for ¬(Y∧W). Choose Case A from (6): E ∧ S. In Case A, we can set Y∧W false to violate the consequent. Check antecedent: Can we make it true? Take C false and set P true. Then antecedent true (since ¬C → P holds). Is this consistent with premises?
- With P true, E true (matches Case A). Good.
- With S true (Case A).
- With C false.
- From 4 (I → C), C false places no constraint on I; we can set I false to further violate consequent.
- From 2, P ∨ I holds because P true.
- From 3, C → ¬S is vacuously fine since C false.
- From 5, since we set ¬(Y∧W), no constraint on S.
All premises satisfied. Antecedent true; consequent false. Therefore the implication is not entailed. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
