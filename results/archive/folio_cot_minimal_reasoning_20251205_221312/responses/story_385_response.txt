Story ID: 385
Premises: If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. 
Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male” and “Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022,” Coco is either female or male.
- “All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.” Also, “All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.”
- “Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the WTA.”
- “If someone is ranked highly by the WTA, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis.”
- “If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.”

From the last conditional, if Coco were male, that would require she either is WTA-ranked highly or lost to Nadal to trigger not-male, which is contradictory. However, we don’t need gender explicitly. Consider cases:

Case 1 (female): Then she lost to Świątek, hence is WTA-ranked highly, hence among the most active players. Also, as female, she did not lose to Nadal (male players lost to Nadal).
Case 2 (male): Then she lost to Nadal. But the conditional says if she lost to Nadal (or is WTA-ranked highly), then she is not a male player at RG 2022, contradiction. So male case is impossible.

Therefore Coco must be female, thus lost to Świątek, thus ranked highly by WTA, thus among the most active players. She did not lose to Nadal (only male players did).

Question 1: Coco Gauff is among the most active Grand-Slam players.
- True (follows from being WTA-ranked highly via loss to Świątek).

Question 2: Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal.
- False (only male players lost to Nadal; Coco is not male and, as female, lost to Świątek).

Question 3: Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.
- She did lose to Świątek and is among the most active, so the statement “not both” is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: False
