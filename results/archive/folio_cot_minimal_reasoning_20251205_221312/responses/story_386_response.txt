Story ID: 386
Premises: If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.

Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

Premises extracted:
- If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. (Deadly → LowSurvival)
- Severe cancers are deadly diseases. (Severe → Deadly)
- Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. (BileDuct → Severe)
- All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. (Cholangio → BileDuct)
- Mild flu comes with a low survival rate. (MildFlu → LowSurvival)
- Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate. (¬(CRC is BileDuct ∧ LowSurvival))

From these:
- BileDuct → Severe → Deadly → LowSurvival.
- Cholangio → BileDuct → Severe → Deadly → LowSurvival.

Also, MildFlu → LowSurvival.

The constraint about colorectal cancer (CRC): ¬(CRC is BileDuct ∧ LowSurvival). This forbids the conjunction that would follow if CRC were BileDuct; thus CRC cannot be BileDuct (since if it were, it would imply LowSurvival, making the forbidden conjunction true). So we can deduce CRC is not BileDuct. We have no information that CRC has LowSurvival or is Severe or Deadly.

Question 1: Is CRC a kind of severe cancer?
- No premise implies CRC is Severe. We only deduced CRC is not BileDuct; nothing else about severity. So Unknown.

Question 2: If CRC is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then CRC is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu.
- Antecedent: CRC is BileDuct or Cholangio. If Cholangio, then BileDuct (by Cholangio → BileDuct). So antecedent implies CRC is BileDuct.
- If CRC were BileDuct, then CRC would be Severe → Deadly → LowSurvival. But this contradicts the constraint ¬(CRC is BileDuct ∧ LowSurvival). Therefore, the antecedent is impossible (it cannot be true in any model). A material implication with an impossible antecedent is vacuously true. Hence the statement is True.

Question 3: CRC is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above.
- Parsing: It asserts (CRC is Cholangio and (CRC is MildFlu or CRC is BileDuct)) or all of the above (which still entails the first part). In any case, it requires at least that CRC is Cholangio or CRC is BileDuct or CRC is MildFlu along with Cholangio. We have no evidence CRC is Cholangio or MildFlu, and we deduced CRC is not BileDuct. Therefore the disjunction is unsupported; it is not entailed. We cannot conclude it’s true; nor is it necessarily false (no premise directly negates CRC being Cholangio or MildFlu). So Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: Unknown
