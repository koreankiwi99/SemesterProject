Story ID: 426
Premises: All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. 
Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. 
Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. 
No managers work remotely from home. 
James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From “Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home,” lunch location is exclusive between company building and home.
- “Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers,” and “All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.” Thus, lunch in company implies schedules meeting implies will go to company building today.
- “If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.”
- “All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.” and “No managers work remotely from home.”
- “James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.” Thus, James is in the company building today exactly when he is a manager.

Question 1: “James has lunch in the company.”
- If James has lunch in the company, he schedules meetings and therefore will go to the company building today. By the biconditional, going to the company building today implies he is a manager. This is consistent with other constraints (managers do not work remotely; nothing contradicts lunch in company). However, we are not given that James does have lunch in the company; it’s merely consistent. Therefore, not entailed.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: “James does not have lunch in the company.”
- By exclusivity, not lunch in company would mean lunch at home. Then he works remotely from home. But no managers work remotely from home, so he would not be a manager. By the biconditional, if not a manager, then he will not appear in the company today. This scenario is also consistent. But we are not given that this is the case. Therefore, not entailed.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 3: The statement is a biconditional-style pair:
- First clause: If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James does not either have lunch at home or work remotely from home.
  • If James is a manager: managers do not work remotely from home; also, if he were to have lunch at home, he would work remotely, which is impossible for managers. So manager implies neither lunch at home nor working remotely from home. True.
  • If James is in other countries: then he works remotely from home. That contradicts the consequent (“does not work remotely from home”). So the implication “in other countries -> not (lunch at home or remote)” is false in that case. Since the antecedent is a disjunction (manager or in other countries), the implication must hold for all cases; here there is a case (in other countries, not manager) making it false. Therefore the first clause is not generally true.

- Second clause: If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor in other countries.
  • If lunch at home, then works remotely from home; managers cannot work remotely, so not a manager. Being in other countries implies remote; remote holds, so being in other countries is consistent, but the clause asserts “nor in other countries.” However, from remote alone we cannot infer not in other countries; rather, in other countries implies remote, not vice versa. So it’s possible that he works remotely from home because he is in other countries, which would make “nor in other countries” false. Thus this implication is not guaranteed true.

Since at least one of these implications is not entailed and can be false under allowed scenarios, the combined statement is not universally true. It is not entailed nor is its negation entailed by the premises; thus its truth status is uncertain.
