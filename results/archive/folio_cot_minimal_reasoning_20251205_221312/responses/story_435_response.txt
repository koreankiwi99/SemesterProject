Story ID: 435
Premises: None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department. 
All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. 
All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department. 
All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. 
All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.
James is a student working in the lab. 
James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David” and “James is a student working in the lab,” we infer: James takes a class with Professor David.
- From “All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course,” we infer: James is taking the database course.
- From “All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department,” we infer: James is from the computer science department.
- From “All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library,” if James had such a part-time job, he would work in the library.
- From “None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department,” no CS student works in the library. Since James is CS, he cannot work in the library. Therefore, James cannot have a university-offered part-time job.
- There is also a direct statement: “James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.” This conflicts with “James is a student working in the lab.” The set is inconsistent. However, independent of that, we already derived via the library/CS constraints that James cannot have a university part-time job. So the status of his part-time job is determinate: he does not have one.

Questions:

1) “James has a part-time job offered by the university.” From the CS/library contradiction, this is impossible. False.

2) “James does not have a part-time job offered by the university.” As above, must be true. True.

3) “James either takes the database course or has a part-time job offered by the university.” We derived he takes the database course, and also that he does not have the job. The disjunction is therefore true. True.

4) “James takes the database course.” From lab → Prof David → database, this is entailed. True.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
4: True
