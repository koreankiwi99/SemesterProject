Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
All animal lovers are nice to animals.
All pet owners love animals.
Tom is a pet owner.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given facts:
- No one nice to animals is also mean to animals. (Nice → not Mean)
- Some grumpy people are mean to animals. (There exist Grumpy ∧ Mean)
- All animal lovers are nice to animals. (Lover → Nice)
- All pet owners love animals. (Owner → Lover)
- Tom is a pet owner. (Owner(Tom))

From these:
- Owner(Tom) → Lover(Tom) → Nice(Tom) → not Mean(Tom).
So Tom is not mean to animals. We have no information linking pet ownership or niceness to being grumpy. Some grumpy are mean, but not all grumpy are mean.

Question 1: Is Tom a grumpy person?
- No information implies Tom is grumpy. Cannot conclude true or false. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Is Tom not both a grumpy person and mean to animals?
- We know not Mean(Tom). Therefore it’s impossible that Tom is both grumpy and mean. So “not (Grumpy ∧ Mean)” is true. Answer: True.

Question 3: If Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.
- Antecedent “not (Grumpy ∧ Mean)” is true (from Q2).
- Consequent says “not Grumpy and not Lover.” But we know Lover(Tom) is true. Hence the consequent is false, making the implication false. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
