Some pets are Brown Swiss Cattle.
All cows are domesticated animals.
Alligators are not domesticated animals.
Ted is an alligator.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given facts:
- All Brown Swiss cattle are cows. (B ⊆ Cows)
- Some pets are Brown Swiss cattle. (∃x: Pet(x) ∧ BrownSwiss(x))
- All cows are domesticated animals. (Cows ⊆ Domesticated)
- Alligators are not domesticated animals. (Alligators ⊆ ¬Domesticated)
- Ted is an alligator. (Ted ∈ Alligators)

From this, Ted is not a domesticated animal. Pets may or may not be domesticated in general, but no rule here says all pets are domesticated. However, Brown Swiss cattle are cows, hence domesticated. So Brown Swiss cattle cannot be alligators, since alligators are not domesticated. Therefore Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle, nor a cow, nor domesticated.

Question 1: Ted is a pet.
- We have no information connecting alligators to being pets. Some pets are Brown Swiss cattle, but that doesn’t imply anything about alligators. So this is not entailed and not contradicted by given facts. Unknown.

Question 2: Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle.
- Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle because that would make Ted domesticated, contradicting that alligators are not domesticated. Thus this conjunction is false.

Question 3: If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet.
- The antecedent (Ted is Brown Swiss cattle) is impossible given the facts, but in classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true. Also, independently, if Ted were Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted would be domesticated, which conflicts with Ted being an alligator, but the implication only asserts that in that hypothetical case Ted is not a pet; we cannot derive “not a pet” from the premises. Still, material implication makes it true due to the antecedent being false. Therefore True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
