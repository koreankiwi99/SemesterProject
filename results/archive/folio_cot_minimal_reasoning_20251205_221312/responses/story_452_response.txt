Story ID: 452
Premises: All aliens are extraterrestrials.
If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.
No extraterrestrials are human.
All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.
Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let’s formalize the premises and reason carefully.

Given:
1) All aliens are extraterrestrials. (Alien → ET)
2) If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien. (FromMars → Alien)
3) No extraterrestrials are human. (ET → not Human)
4) All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans. (HighIntell ∧ FromEarth → Human)
5) Marvin is a highly intelligent being. (HighIntell(M))
6) Marvin is either (from Earth and from Mars) or (from neither). So exactly one of:
   - FromEarth ∧ FromMars, or
   - not FromEarth ∧ not FromMars.
7) If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial. (not FromEarth → ET)

Consider the two exhaustive cases from (6):

Case A: FromEarth ∧ FromMars.
- FromMars → Alien (2), so Alien.
- Alien → ET (1), so ET.
- ET → not Human (3), so not Human.
- FromEarth ∧ HighIntell → Human (4 and 5), so Human.
- Contradiction: Human and not Human. Thus Case A is impossible.

Therefore only Case B remains:

Case B: not FromEarth ∧ not FromMars.
- From not FromEarth, by (7) ET.
- ET → not Human (3), so not Human.
- Not FromMars is already given in this case.

Now answer the questions:

Question 1: Is Marvin an alien?
- In Case B we have ET but not necessarily Alien. We only know Alien if FromMars (2), but we have not FromMars. There is no premise stating ET → Alien. So we cannot conclude Alien. Not provable, not disprovable.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Is Marvin neither a human nor from Mars?
- In the only consistent case (Case B), we have not Human and not FromMars. So this statement is entailed.
Answer: True.

Question 3: If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human.
- We have not FromMars in Case B, but then not Human (since ET). So the implication “not FromMars → Human” is false in the actual consistent scenario. Therefore the statement is false (it is refuted by the derived situation).
Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
