==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Premises:
  1) Some professional basketball players are not American nationals. (∃ PB ∧ ¬A)
  2) All professional basketball players can do jump shots. (PB → JS)
  3) If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air. (JS → L)
  4) If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. (L → M)
  5) Yuri does not activate his leg muscles. (¬M(Yuri))

- From 3 and 4: JS → L → M, so PB → JS → L → M. Therefore, PB → M.
- Given ¬M(Yuri), by contrapositive of PB → M, Yuri is not a professional basketball player. (¬PB)

Question 1: Yuri is an American national.
- We only know ¬PB. Nothing links American nationality to muscle activation or to PB except the existential claim that some PB are not American. That gives no information about Yuri’s nationality. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Yuri is not an American professional basketball player.
- “American professional basketball player” means A ∧ PB. We have ¬PB, so ¬(A ∧ PB) is true regardless of A. Answer: True.

Question 3: Yuri is an American professional basketball player.
- From above, ¬PB, so cannot be A ∧ PB. Answer: False.

Question 4: If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player.
- We know ¬PB, hence not an American professional basketball player. The consequent is false. The antecedent (¬L) is not entailed by ¬M; from L → M and ¬M we get ¬L by contrapositive, so actually ¬L is true. Thus we have true antecedent implying false consequent, making the conditional false. Answer: False.

Question 5: If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player.
- Antecedent ¬(A ∧ PB) is true (since ¬PB). Consequent PB is false. So true implies false, making the conditional false. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
4: False
5: False
