Story ID: 459
Premises: Jane does not like any animals that bark.
All dogs are animals that bark.
Jane likes all animals that jump.
If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. 
KiKi is an animal.
If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given facts and rules:
- Jane does not like any animals that bark. (About Jane’s preferences; irrelevant to KiKi’s properties)
- All dogs are animals that bark. (Dog → Bark)
- Jane likes all animals that jump. (About Jane’s preferences)
- If an animal has legs, then it jumps. (Legs → Jumps)
- If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. (Terricolous → Legs)
- KiKi is an animal.
- If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. (¬Jumps ∧ ¬Legs → Terricolous ∨ Legs)

From Terricolous → Legs → Jumps. So any terricolous animal would necessarily have legs and jump. The last conditional is a material implication about KiKi only in the case KiKi lacks both jumps and legs; it does not assert that antecedent, so we cannot derive Terricolous or Legs from it. We have no information that KiKi has legs, jumps, is terricolous, barks, or is a dog.

Question 1: Is KiKi terricolous?
- No rule establishes KiKi is terricolous. The special conditional only applies if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, which is not established. Therefore Unknown.

Question 2: Is KiKi a barking dog?
- We have no information that KiKi is a dog; thus cannot conclude dog or barking. Therefore Unknown.

Question 3: KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog.
- We cannot establish non-barking nor non-dog from given facts. Therefore Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
