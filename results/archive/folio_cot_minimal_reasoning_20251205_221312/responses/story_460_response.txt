Story ID: 460
Premises: If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.
If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.
All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.
“Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is a film.
“Hachi: A dog’s Tale”  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Let:
- A(x): x is appropriate for all ages.
- C(x): children can watch x without parental guidance.
- E(x): x contains excessive erotic and violent content.
- G(x): x is rated General Audience.
- FFA(x): x is a family-friendly animated film.
- FR(x): x is in the Frozen series.
- H: “Hachi: A Dog’s Tale” is a film.

Given rules:
1) A(x) → C(x).
2) E(x) → ¬C(x). Contraposition not given; only forward direction usable.
3) G(x) → A(x).
4) FFA(x) → G(x).
5) FR(x) → FFA(x).
6) H is a film. (No direct logical effects with other predicates.)
7) H is either FFA(H) or A(H). So FFA(H) ∨ A(H).

From 7 and 4:
- If FFA(H), then by 4, G(H). Then by 3, A(H), and by 1, C(H).
- If A(H) (directly from disjunct), then by 1, C(H). But A(H) does not imply G(H) unless we know G → A, not A → G.

Thus what we can conclude for sure:
- C(H) is true in either case (since FFA leads to A, and A directly gives C).
- We cannot conclude G(H) because in the branch A(H) without FFA(H), G(H) need not hold. So G(H) is not entailed.
- Regarding E(H): From C(H) true, and rule 2 is E → ¬C. We cannot contrapose to infer ¬E from C. So E(H) remains unknown.
- FR(H): No information connecting H to Frozen series; so FR(H) is unknown.

Question 1: Is H rated General Audience?
- Not entailed: only guaranteed if the FFA disjunct holds; the A disjunct alone doesn’t imply G. So Unknown.

Question 2: Does H contain excessive erotic/violent content or is in Frozen series (E(H) ∨ FR(H))?
- Both E(H) and FR(H) are individually unknown; no rule forces either. No contradiction if both are false. So Unknown.

Question 3: Statement: (E(H) ∧ FR(H)) ∨ (¬E(H) ∧ ¬FR(H)).
- This is equivalently the logical biconditional ¬(E(H) ⊕ FR(H)) (i.e., they have the same truth value). With both E(H) and FR(H) unknown, we cannot assert this tautologically; it need not be logically valid from premises. For instance, a model with E false, FR true would make the statement false; another with both false would make it true. Since both possibilities are compatible with the premises, the truth is not entailed. So Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
