Story ID: 467
Premises: All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.
All monkeys are mammals. 
Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. 
Peter's birds can fly.
All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
Rock is Peter's pet.
Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

Given facts:
- All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals. (Redundant, mammals ⊆ animals for Peter’s pets)
- All monkeys are mammals.
- Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. (Each pet ∈ {monkey, bird})
- Peter's birds can fly.
- All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe. (So every Peter’s pet breathes)
- If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
- Rock is Peter's pet.
- Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. (Disjunction)

From “Rock is Peter’s pet” and “All animals that are Peter’s pets can breathe,” Rock can breathe. Therefore, in the disjunction “Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe,” the third option (cannot breathe) is false, so at least one of the first two must be true: Rock can fly or Rock is a bird.

Also, since Peter’s pets are either monkeys or birds, Rock is either a monkey or a bird.

- If Rock is a bird, then by “Peter’s birds can fly,” Rock can fly. Then by “If Peter’s pet can fly, then it has wings,” Rock has wings.
- If Rock is a monkey, then Rock is a mammal and thus an animal and can breathe. We do not have a general rule that monkeys can fly, so we cannot conclude Rock can fly in that case. However, the disjunction forces that Rock can fly or Rock is a bird; if Rock is a monkey and not a bird, then to satisfy the disjunction, Rock must be able to fly. But we still cannot derive that Rock is a monkey in the first place—only that if Rock were a monkey, then Rock can fly follows from the disjunction (since the “bird” and “cannot breathe” options would be false).

Conclusions for each question:

1) “Rock is a monkey.” We only know Rock is either a monkey or a bird; both are consistent with the information. Not entailed either way. Answer: Unknown.

2) “Rock has wings.” From above, either Rock is a bird (then it can fly) or Rock can fly directly from the disjunction. In either case, Rock can fly. Since Rock is Peter’s pet, “If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings” applies. Therefore Rock has wings. Answer: True.

3) “Rock does not have wings.” This contradicts the conclusion in (2). Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
