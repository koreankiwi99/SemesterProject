==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Breeding back is defined as a form of artificial selection involving deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.
- Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs.
- Therefore, Heck cattle were produced via breeding back, which is artificial selection.
- Hence, some Heck cattle are artificially selected. Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- We are told: Aurochs are animals. Heck cattle were bred back to resemble the aurochs. Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals.
- The last statement does not specify that aurochs are extinct; it only says some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals (not necessarily that aurochs are extinct).
- No explicit statement says aurochs are extinct.
- Therefore, from the given information alone, we cannot conclude that aurochs are extinct. Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
