Story ID: 471
Premises: All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. 
Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. 
The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- Only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. So any individual spotted near the campus is either a rabbit or a squirrel (possibly both).
- All rabbits near the campus are cute.
- All squirrels near the campus are skittish.
- If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. However, this conflicts with “only rabbits and squirrels can be spotted near the campus” unless those turtles are also rabbits/squirrels, which is impossible under normal disjoint categories. Interpreting strictly, “only rabbits and squirrels” means no turtles are spotted near the campus. So the “some turtles” statement must be disregarded as incompatible, or the consistent consequence is that nothing spotted near the campus is a turtle.
- Rockie can be spotted near the campus and is calm. From “only rabbits and squirrels,” Rockie is either a rabbit or a squirrel. If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish, hence not calm, contradicting calm. Therefore Rockie is not a squirrel. Thus Rockie must be a rabbit. Then Rockie is cute (all rabbits near campus are cute). Also, being a rabbit (and not a squirrel), Rockie is not skittish, hence calm remains consistent.

Conclusions about Rockie:
- Rockie is a rabbit, cute, calm.
- Rockie is not a squirrel.
- Rockie is not a turtle (since only rabbits and squirrels are spotted near campus).

Now evaluate statements:

1) Rockie is a turtle.
False, as argued Rockie is not a turtle.

2) Rockie is not a turtle.
True.

3) Rockie is a turtle or cute.
This is “turtle ∨ cute.” We know Rockie is cute, so the disjunction is true.
True.

4) If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish.
Antecedent: “not (turtle ∧ squirrel)” is true (Rockie is neither). Consequent: “cute or skittish” is true since Rockie is cute. So the implication is true.
True.

5) If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.
We have Rockie cute and calm true, but conclusion “skittish turtle” is false (Rockie is neither skittish nor a turtle). So the implication is false.
False.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
4: True
5: False
