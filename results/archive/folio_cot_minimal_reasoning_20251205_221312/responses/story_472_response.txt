Story ID: 472
Premises: Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. 
All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
All queen bees are bees.
Harry is a bee.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given facts:
- Partition: Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates. (So if something is an animal, it is exactly one of these two.)
- All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
- All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
- All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating. (So bees are animals whose reproduction is not by male-female mating.)
- All queen bees are bees.
- Harry is a bee.

From Harry is a bee, Harry is a bee, hence reproduces not by male-female mating. If Harry were a vertebrate, he would have a backbone and thus reproduce by male-female mating, contradicting being a bee. Therefore, Harry is not a vertebrate; since animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates, and bees are animals, Harry is an invertebrate.

Question 1: Is Harry a queen bee?
- From Harry is a bee, we cannot infer he is a queen bee; being a queen bee implies being a bee, but not vice versa. No information says Harry is a queen. So it is not entailed, nor contradicted. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Is Harry an invertebrate or a queen bee?
- We established Harry is an invertebrate. Therefore the disjunction “invertebrate or queen bee” is true. Answer: True.

Question 3: If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.
- Evaluate antecedent A: “Harry is either (both vertebrate and backbone) or (neither vertebrate nor backbone).”
  - Given bees do not reproduce by male-female, Harry cannot be a vertebrate with a backbone (that would force male-female reproduction). Also, since all vertebrates have backbones, the case “neither vertebrate nor backbone” would mean Harry lacks a backbone and is not a vertebrate. Is that possible? Yes, consistent with being an invertebrate. So A could be true or false depending on whether Harry has a backbone. We do not have a direct statement about invertebrates and backbones; invertebrates typically lack backbones, but that’s not stated. So truth of A is unknown.
- Consequent C: “Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.”
  - We established Harry is an invertebrate. So C is false.
- For an implication If A then C to be true, either A is false or C is true. Since C is false, the implication is true only if A is false; if A is true, implication is false. We cannot determine A’s truth from given facts. Therefore the truth of the implication is not entailed; it could be true or false. Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: Unknown
