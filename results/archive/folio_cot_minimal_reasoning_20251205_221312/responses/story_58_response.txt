==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Premises include: "Books contain tons of knowledge." Walden is a book (“the book ‘Walden’”). Therefore, Walden, being a book, contains knowledge. So the statement is true.

2) Premises: "When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge." Harry read Walden, so Harry gained knowledge. "If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter." Hence Harry became smarter than before. So the statement is true.

3) The given premises state: If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter (knowledge ⇒ smarter). The statement in question is its converse: smarter ⇒ gained knowledge. The converse does not follow logically from the given premises. Therefore, its truth cannot be established from the provided information. So it is unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
