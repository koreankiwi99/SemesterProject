Story ID: 83
Premises: All vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34.
Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul. 
Joe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul. 
Tom's license plate begins with the number 35. 
If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Premises:
  - All vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34. (Istanbul → begins 34)
  - Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul. (¬begins 34 → ¬Istanbul) [This is contrapositive of first, consistent]
  - Joe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul. (Joe → Istanbul)
  - Tom's license plate begins with the number 35. (Tom begins 35)
  - If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34. (begins 35 → ¬begins 34)

Question 1:
- Joe is from Istanbul. From "Istanbul → begins 34", Joe’s plate begins with 34. So the statement "Joe's license plate begins with the number 34" is true.

Question 2:
- Tom’s plate begins with 35. Given "begins 35 → ¬begins 34", Tom’s plate does not begin with 34. From "¬begins 34 → ¬Istanbul", Tom’s plate is not from Istanbul. So the statement "Tom's license plate is from Istanbul" is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
