They knew that if people exercised regularly, they would be fit, and if they ate nutritious foods, they would have energy. But not everyone in town was active or energetic. The mayor concluded that some citizens must not exercise or must not eat well. The mayor understood that if someone valued wellness, they would exercise regularly.\nQuestion: Jane eats very nutritious foods. From the context, is it true that Jane values wellness?\nReasoning steps: \n- From the context: If someone valued wellness, then they would exercise regularly (values wellness \u2192 exercises).\n- Also: If someone eats nutritious foods, then they would have energy (eats nutritious \u2192 energetic).\n- Jane eats very nutritious foods, so we can infer she would have energy.\n- There is no rule that says eating nutritious foods implies valuing wellness.\n- The only link to valuing wellness is via exercising regularly, but we have no information that Jane exercises.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Jane values wellness.\n\nAnswer: No"

Let S = snow melts, T = trails open, R = rink closes, L = skating lessons end, H = nature lovers go hiking, V = enjoy scenic views.\n2. Given: S \u2192 T; R \u2192 L; (S \u2228 R); T \u2192 H; H \u2192 V.\n3. Given in question: \u00acL (skating lessons will not end).\n4. From R \u2192 L and \u00acL, by contrapositive we get \u00acR (the rink did not close).\n5. From (S \u2228 R) and \u00acR, conclude S (the snow melts).\n6. From S \u2192 T, get T (trails open).\n7. From T \u2192 H, get H (they go hiking).\n8. From H \u2192 V, get V (they enjoy scenic views).\nAnswer: Yes"

It does not explicitly assert that bananas (or apples) are growing on trees in this scenario; they are at a market on displays. While bananas do grow on plants (not botanically trees) in reality, the text does not commit to their current growing state.

However, \u201cexactly one of the apples or oranges is not growing on a tree\u201d is supported by the single fallen orange, assuming others are as usual. The first conjunct about bananas growing on a tree is not established by the context. Therefore, the combined statement is not entailed.\nAnswer: no"

From \u201cMath and Science are subjects with concepts\u201d and \u201cTypically, subjects with concepts require problem-solving skills,\u201d we have a defeasible/general rule: being a subject with concepts tends to imply requiring problem-solving skills.

Given step 3, Z does not add heat, so the antecedent \"Z adds heat\" is false in the derived model. However, to validate the conditional logically, we must see whether from the premises, Z adding heat would force Y not adding aroma. There is no rule connecting Z adding heat to Y\u2019s aroma.

However, this only creates a potential inconsistency between Laugh and Convenient; it does not relate to the pen\u2019s usage.\n5. The rule: If book is stationery then city has good public transport.

From \u201cIf a Student is in class, then they study,\u201d we have S_in_class \u2192 S_study.\n3. Therefore, from 1 and 2, if S_in_class holds, then S_study holds; if S_in_class does not hold, 1 still allows T_grades to make the disjunction true.\n4. The statement about the Principal: \u201cIf a Principal grades papers, then a Teacher is in the staff room\u201d (P_grades \u2192 T_staffroom), and \u201cIf a Teacher is in the staff room, then they grade papers\u201d (T_staffroom \u2192 T_grades). Thus P_grades implies T_grades, but says nothing about the case where the Principal does not grade.\n5. The antecedent \u201cPrincipal does not grade papers\u201d (\u00acP_grades) provides no information linking to the Student\u2019s studying. The disjunction S_in_class \u2228 T_grades can still be true independently of P_grades, and S_in_class could hold, which would imply S_study.\n6. Therefore, from \u00acP_grades we cannot infer \u00acS_study; the Student might still study.\n\nAnswer: No"

Translate statements into logic:\n   - If they add exciting new features (F), then they will attract more users (U): F \u2192 U.\n   - If they fix bugs quickly (B), then they will improve user satisfaction (S): B \u2192 S.\n   - They often release updates that either don't attract new users or they have no user satisfaction: often (\u00acU \u2228 \u00acS).\n\n2. From F \u2192 U and B \u2192 S, take contrapositives:\n   - \u00acU \u2192 \u00acF.\n   - \u00acS \u2192 \u00acB.\n\n3. Given (\u00acU \u2228 \u00acS) for those releases, by cases:\n   - If \u00acU, then by contraposition \u00acF.\n   - If \u00acS, then by contraposition \u00acB.\n\n4. Therefore, in each such release, (\u00acF \u2228 \u00acB) holds: they either did not add exciting new features or did not fix bugs quickly.\n\nAnswer: Yes"

From the context: coding daily \u2192 skills grow. Solving challenges \u2192 skills grow. (Also both \u2192 skills grow.)\n2. Also: if skills are built up, then he could create complex web apps. This is a one-way implication: skills \u2192 could create apps; it does not assert that creating apps necessarily occurs, nor that not creating apps implies lack of skills.\n3. The question asks: given that Chris does not create web apps, can we conclude he solves coding challenges?\n4. From skills \u2192 could create apps, the negation (not creating apps) does not imply not having skills (fallacy of denying the consequent, and \u201ccould create\u201d is modal/possibility, even weaker).\n5. Since we cannot infer lack of skills, we also cannot infer whether he codes daily or solves challenges from \u201cdoes not create web apps.\u201d\n6. Therefore, \u201cdoes not create web apps\u201d gives no logical entailment that he solves coding challenges.\n\nAnswer: No"

This is logically equivalent to W \u2228 \u00acC (since (W \u2227 \u00acC) is a stronger case already covered by the disjunction), so we only know that at least one of W or \u00acC holds.\n6.

    "model_response": "Context: Layla reads for 30 minutes each night before bed. She finds this helps her sleep peacefully. Meanwhile, her brother Noah often stays up late playing video games. Noah knows that staying up late makes him tired and irritable the next day. Either Layla read before bed last night, or Noah didn't feel tired and irritable next day. Layla realizes that a good night's rest leaves her feeling refreshed and cheerful in the morning.\nQuestion: Noah stayed up late playing video games. Then did Layla feel well rested and cheerful in the morning?\nReasoning steps: \n1. From the question: Noah stayed up late playing video games.\n2. Given knowledge: If Noah stays up late, he feels tired and irritable the next day.\n3. So, Noah felt tired and irritable the next day.\n4. The disjunction given: Either Layla read before bed last night, or Noah didn't feel tired and irritable the next day.\n5. Since Noah did feel tired and irritable, the second disjunct is false; therefore, the first disjunct must be true: Layla read before bed last night.\n6. Layla finds that reading before bed helps her sleep peacefully, leading to a good night's rest.\n7. A good night's rest leaves Layla feeling refreshed and cheerful in the morning.\n8. Therefore, Layla felt well rested and cheerful in the morning.\nAnswer: Yes"

The premise about not feeling less lonely does not imply joining or not joining the hiking group.\n- Therefore, from \"not feel less lonely\" we cannot deduce that her social life improved.\n\nAnswer: No"

Eating nutritious foods \u2192 more steady energy \u2192 can train harder while staying injury-free. This suggests: if she has the extra energy (from eating nutritious foods), then staying injury-free holds. But we do not know she necessarily ate nutritious foods unless the disjunction picks that disjunct; she could have satisfied the disjunction by training regularly only.\n- Therefore, from \u201cnot complete marathon,\u201d we cannot deduce that she ate nutritious foods, nor that she had the extra energy condition guaranteeing injury-free. Also, training harder while staying injury-free is conditional on extra energy; without it, no guarantee.\n- Hence, \u201cIf not complete, then stays injury-free\u201d is not entailed.\n\nAnswer: No"
