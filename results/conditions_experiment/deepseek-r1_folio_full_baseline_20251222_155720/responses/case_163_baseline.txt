The reasoning involves determining if Breaking Bad airs on Monday at 8 pm based on the given premises. The premises establish that a show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses, which implies it is an episode of The Bachelor. Such shows portray real lives and are reality TV.

Lean Code:
axiom Show : Type
axiom BreakingBad : Show
axiom AiringMonday8pm : Show → Prop
axiom GivesRoses : Show → Prop
axiom IsBachelor : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysReal : Show → Prop
axiom RealityTV : Show → Prop

axiom premise1 : ∃ s, AiringMonday8pm s ∧ GivesRoses s
axiom premise2 : ∀ s, GivesRoses s → IsBachelor s
axiom premise3 : ∀ s, IsBachelor s → PortraysReal s
axiom premise4 : ∀ s, PortraysReal s → RealityTV s
axiom premise6 : ¬ RealityTV BreakingBad

-- Attempt to prove BreakingBad airs on Monday at 8pm
theorem goal_true : AiringMonday8pm BreakingBad := by 
  -- No premise forces BreakingBad to air at that time
  sorry

-- Attempt to prove BreakingBad does not air on Monday at 8pm
theorem goal_false : ¬ AiringMonday8pm BreakingBad := by
  -- No premise prevents BreakingBad from airing then
  sorry
