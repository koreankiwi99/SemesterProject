LLM Response:
The reasoning problem involves determining the truth of the statement: "If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm." Based on the premises:

1. There exists a show airing Monday at 8 pm that gives out roses.
2. Any show giving out roses is an episode of The Bachelor.
3. The Bachelor portrays real people's lives.
4. Any show portraying real people's lives is a reality TV show.
5. Breaking Bad is a show.
6. Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

From premises 2-4, an...

Lean Code:
axiom Show : Type
axiom BreakingBad : Show
axiom AiringAtMonday8pm : Show → Prop
axiom GivesRoses : Show → Prop
axiom IsBachelorEpisode : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealLives : Show → Prop
axiom IsRealityTV : Show → Prop

-- Premise: Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses
axiom premise1 : ∃ S, AiringAtMonday8pm S ∧ GivesRoses S

-- If a show gives out roses, it is an episode of The Bachelor
axiom premise2 : ∀ S, GivesRoses S → IsBachelorEpisode S

-- The Bachelor portrays real lives
axiom premise3 : ∀ S, IsBachelorEpisode S → PortraysRealLives S

-- Portraying real lives implies reality TV
axiom premise4 : ∀ S, PortraysRealLives S → IsRealityTV S

-- Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show
axiom premise6 : ¬ IsRealityTV BreakingBad

-- Proving that Breaking Bad does not give out roses
theorem no_roses_BB : ¬ GivesRoses BreakingBad := by
  intro h
  have h1 : IsBachelorEpisode BreakingBad := premise2 BreakingBad h
  have h2 : PortraysRealLives BreakingBad := premise3 BreakingBad h1
  have h3 : IsRealityTV BreakingBad := premise4 BreakingBad h2
  exact premise6 h3

-- The goal: If Breaking Bad gives roses, then it airs Monday at 8 pm
theorem goal : GivesRoses BreakingBad → AiringAtMonday8pm BreakingBad := by
  intro h
  -- Since Breaking Bad cannot give roses, we have a contradiction
  exact False.elim (no_roses_BB h)
