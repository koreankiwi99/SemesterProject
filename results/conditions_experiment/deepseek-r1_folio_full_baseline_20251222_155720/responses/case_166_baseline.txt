--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM Response:
The textual context states that Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician, which directly implies he was German. The statement "Heinrich Schmidt was German or Russian or both" is logically equivalent to "Heinrich Schmidt was German or Russian". Since he was German, the disjunction is true regardless of whether he was Russian or not. Therefore, the statement is true.

constant HeinrichSchmidt : Person
constant German : Person → Prop

-- Axiom based on the context: Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician, so he is German.
axiom is_german : German HeinrichSchmidt

-- The statement to prove: German or Russian (or both)
theorem goal : German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt := by

  exact is_german

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The compilation errors occurred because `German` and `Russian` were declared as constants without specifying their types as predicates (`Person → Prop`). Here's the corrected Lean code:

constant Person : Type
constant HeinrichSchmidt : Person
constant German : Person → Prop
constant Russian : Person → Prop

--- Iteration 3 ---
LLM Response:
The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect constant declarations for predicates. Here's the corrected Lean code specifying the predicate types explicitly:
