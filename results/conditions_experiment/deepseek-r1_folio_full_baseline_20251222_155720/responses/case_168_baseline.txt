--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM Response:
The given information states that Heinrich Schmidt is a politician and a member of the Nazi Reichstag. The statement "No politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag" is a universal claim that would require no overlap between all politicians and Nazi Reichstag members. However, Heinrich Schmidt serves as a counterexample – he is both a politician and in the Nazi Reichstag. Thus, the statement is false.

Lean verification:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : Person
axiom Politician :...

Lean Code:
axiom Person : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : Person
axiom Politician : Person → Prop
axiom MemberOfReichstag : Person → Prop
axiam isPolitician : Politician HeinrichSchmidt
axiom inReichstag : MemberOfReichstag HeinrichSchmidt

-- Prove the original claim "No politicians are Nazi Reichstag members" is false
theorem false_statement : ¬(∀ (p : Person), Politician p → ¬MemberOfReichstag p) := 
  fun H => H HeinrichSchmidt isPolitician inReichstag

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The corrected Lean code is as follows:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : Person
axiom Politician : Person → Prop
axiom MemberOfReichstag : Person → Prop
axiom isPolitician : Politician HeinrichSchmidt
axiom inReichstag : MemberOfReichstag HeinrichSchmidt

theorem refute_claim : ¬(∀ (p : Person), Politician p → ¬MemberOfReichstag p) := 
  fun H => (H HeinrichSchmidt isPolitician) inReichstag
</lean>

Explanation:
1. We define a type `Person` and a constant `HeinrichSchmidt`.
2. ...

Lean Code:
axiom Person : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : Person
axiom Politician : Person → Prop
axiom MemberOfReichstag : Person → Prop
axiom isPolitician : Politician HeinrichSchmidt
axiom inReichstag : MemberOfReichstag HeinrichSchmidt

theorem refute_claim : ¬(∀ (p : Person), Politician p → ¬MemberOfReichstag p) := 
  fun H => (H HeinrichSchmidt isPolitician) inReichstag
