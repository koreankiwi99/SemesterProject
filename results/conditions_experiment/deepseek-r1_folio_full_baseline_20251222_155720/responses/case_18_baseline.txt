--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM Response:
The premises lead to the following reasoning:

- Rockie is spotted near the campus and calm (given).
- All spotted animals are either rabbits or squirrels (premise 3).
- If Rockie is a rabbit and spotted, then Rockie is cute (premise 1).
- If Rockie is a squirrel and spotted, then Rockie is skittish (premise 5).
- If Rockie is skittish, then Rockie is not calm (premise 4).
- But Rockie is calm, so Rockie cannot be skittish and therefore cannot be a squirrel.
- Thus, Rockie must be a rabbit, maki...

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The compilation errors occurred because predicates like `Rabbit`, `Spotted`, etc., were declared as variables of type `Type` or `Prop` instead of functions (`Animal → Prop`). The corrected code properly declares all predicates as functions and includes all premises. The proof demonstrates that Rockie must be a rabbit (and thus cute) since:
1. Rockie is spotted and calm
2. Spotted animals are only rabbits or squirrels
3. Squirrels would be skittish (contradicting calmness)
4. Therefore Rockie is ...

--- Iteration 3 ---
LLM Response:
The compilation errors occurred because the predicates were not properly declared as functions from `Animal` to `Prop`. The corrected code declares all predicates correctly and includes the complete proof. The reasoning is:

1. Rockie is spotted near campus and calm (given).
2. By premise 3, all spotted animals are rabbits or squirrels, so Rockie must be a rabbit or squirrel.
3. If Rockie is a rabbit:
   - Premise 1: All spotted rabbits are cute → Rockie is cute → Disjunction holds.
4. If Rockie...
