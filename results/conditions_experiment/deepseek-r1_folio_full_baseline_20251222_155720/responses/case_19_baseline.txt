LLM Response:
The reasoning from the textual context leads to the conclusion that the statement "If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish" is true. Here's the formalization and proof in Lean:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom Spotted : Animal → Prop
axiom Cute : Animal → Prop
axiom Skittish : Animal → Prop
axiom Calm : Animal → Prop
axiom Rabbit : Animal → Prop
axiom Turtle : Animal → Prop
axiom Squirrel : Animal → Prop
axiom Rockie : Animal

Lean Code:
axiom Animal : Type
axiom Spotted : Animal → Prop
axiom Cute : Animal → Prop
axiom Skittish : Animal → Prop
axiom Calm : Animal → Prop
axiom Rabbit : Animal → Prop
axiom Turtle : Animal → Prop
axiom Squirrel : Animal → Prop
axiom Rockie : Animal

-- All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute.
axiom rabbit_spotted_cute : ∀ a, Rabbit a → Spotted a → Cute a

-- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
axiom some_turtle_spotted : ∃ a, Turtle a ∧ Spotted a

-- The only animals spotted are rabbits or squirrels.
axiom spotted_only_rabbits_squirrels : ∀ a, Spotted a → Rabbit a ∨ Squirrel a

-- Skittish implies not calm.
axiom skittish_not_calm : ∀ a, Skittish a → ¬ Calm a

-- All spotted squirrels are skittish.
axiom squirrel_spotted_skittish : ∀ a, Squirrel a → Spotted a → Skittish a

-- Rockie is spotted and calm.
axiom rockie_spotted_calm : Spotted Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

-- The goal: If Rockie is not both turtle and squirrel, then Rockie is cute or skittish.
theorem goal : ¬ (Turtle Rockie ∧ Squirrel Rockie) → (Cute Rockie ∨ Skittish Rockie) := by
  intro _  -- The antecedent is unused because the consequent holds unconditionally
