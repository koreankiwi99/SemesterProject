LLM Response:
The reasoning involves analyzing the given statements and their implications for "Black Mirror." 

- From the biconditional: Karen binge-watches a Netflix show if and only if she downloads it.  
- Karen does not download "Black Mirror," so she does not binge-watch it.  
- The sharing condition states that binge-watching implies sharing, but there is no information that sharing occurs without binge-watching.  
- Thus, without binge-watching, we cannot conclude that Karen will share "Black Mirror"...

Lean Code:
axiom NetflixShow : Type
axiom Popular : NetflixShow → Prop
axiom BingeWatch : NetflixShow → Prop
axiom Download : NetflixShow → Prop
axiom ShareWithLisa : NetflixShow → Prop

axiom BlackMirror : NetflixShow
axiom not_download : ¬ Download BlackMirror

axiom binge_iff_download : ∀ (s : NetflixShow), BingeWatch s ↔ Download s
axiom popular_imp_binge : ∀ (s : NetflixShow), Popular s → BingeWatch s
axiom binge_imp_share : ∀ (s : NetflixShow), BingeWatch s → ShareWithLisa s

-- We focus on BlackMirror
theorem no_binge : ¬ BingeWatch BlackMirror := by
  rw [binge_iff_download]
  exact not_download

-- Attempt to prove ShareWithLisa BlackMirror
theorem cannot_prove_share : ¬ (ShareWithLisa BlackMirror) := by
  intro h
  -- We have no axiom that links ShareWithLisa directly to BingeWatch in a way that forces contradiction without binge-watching.
  -- Since binge_imp_share only gives BingeWatch → ShareWithLisa, and we have ¬BingeWatch, we cannot derive a contradiction.
  -- Thus, we cannot prove ¬ShareWithLisa BlackMirror either.
  admit  -- This proof fails

-- Attempt to disprove ShareWithLisa BlackMirror
theorem cannot_disprove_share : ¬ (¬ ShareWithLisa BlackMirror) := by
  intro h
  -- Similarly, we have no information that ShareWithLisa must be false when not binge-watching.
  admit  -- This proof also fails

-- Since we cannot prove or disprove ShareWithLisa BlackMirror, the statement is uncertain.
