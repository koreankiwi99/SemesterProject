LLM Response:
The reasoning involves determining if Tom is allowed to move into The Olive Garden with Fluffy based on the given information. The key points are:
- The Olive Garden is a managed building.
- Fluffy is Tom's cat, and cats are pets.
- If a managed building allows pets, people are allowed to move in with a pet.
- Pets are allowed in some managed buildings, but it is not specified that The Olive Garden allows pets.
- The deposit and rent conditions affect whether Tom *will rent* but not whether he *...

Lean Code:
axiom ManagedBuilding : Type
axiom olive_garden : ManagedBuilding
axiom Person : Type
axiom Tom : Person
axiom Pet : Type
axiom Fluffy : Pet
axiom allows_pets : ManagedBuilding → Prop
axiom allowed_to_move_in_with : ManagedBuilding → Person → Pet → Prop

-- If a managed building allows pets, people are allowed to move in with a pet.
axiom move_in_rule : ∀ (b : ManagedBuilding), allows_pets b → ∀ (p : Person) (pet : Pet), allowed_to_move_in_with b p pet

-- Pets are allowed in some managed buildings (not necessarily olive_garden).
axiom some_building_allows_pets : ∃ (b : ManagedBuilding), allows_pets b

-- No information about olive_garden specifically allowing pets.
theorem goal : allowed_to_move_in_with olive_garden Tom Fluffy := by
  sorry  -- Cannot prove without knowing allows_pets olive_garden.

theorem negation : ¬ allowed_to_move_in_with olive_garden Tom Fluffy := by
  sorry  -- Cannot prove negation without knowing ¬allows_pets olive_garden.
