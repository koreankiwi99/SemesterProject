LLM Response:
The reasoning involves translating the given premises into Lean and attempting to prove whether the Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations. The premises are:

1. All business organizations are legal entities.  
2. All companies are business organizations.  
3. All private companies are companies.  
4. All legal entities are created under law.  
5. All legal entities have legal obligations.  
6. If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company.

Lean Code:
variable U : Type
variable BusinessOrganization : U → Prop
variable LegalEntity : U → Prop
variable Company : U → Prop
variable PrivateCompany : U → Prop
variable CreatedUnderLaw : U → Prop
variable HasLegalObligations : U → Prop
variable hwbc : U

axiom all_business_legal : ∀ x, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom all_companies_business : ∀ x, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom all_private_company : ∀ x, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom legal_created_under_law : ∀ x, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom legal_has_obligations : ∀ x, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom hwbc_law_not_private : CreatedUnderLaw hwbc → ¬ PrivateCompany hwbc

theorem goal : HasLegalObligations hwbc := by
  -- Attempt to prove via chain: private company → company → business org → legal entity → obligations.
  -- But no premise indicates `hwbc` is `PrivateCompany`, `Company`, or `BusinessOrganization`.
  -- Premise 6 only gives a conditional about `CreatedUnderLaw` and `PrivateCompany`, which does not help.
  -- Without evidence for `LegalEntity hwbc`, the obligation cannot be derived.
  sorry -- Proof incomplete (not provable from axioms)

Lean: Failed

LLM Response:
The compilation errors occurred because the variable declarations were not properly scoped. Here's the corrected Lean code with explicit type annotations and axioms:

axiom U : Type
axiom hwbc : U
axiom BusinessOrganization : U → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : U → Prop
axiom Company : U → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : U → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : U → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : U → Prop

Lean Code:
axiom U : Type
axiom hwbc : U
axiom BusinessOrganization : U → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : U → Prop
axiom Company : U → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : U → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : U → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : U → Prop

axiom all_business_legal : ∀ x : U, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom all_companies_business : ∀ x : U, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom all_private_company : ∀ x : U, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom legal_created_under_law : ∀ x : U, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom legal_has_obligations : ∀ x : U, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom hwbc_law_not_private : CreatedUnderLaw hwbc → ¬ PrivateCompany hwbc

theorem goal : HasLegalObligations hwbc := by
  -- Proof attempts:
  -- 1. Try chain: PrivateCompany → Company → BusinessOrganization → LegalEntity → obligations
  --    But no premise states that hwbc is a PrivateCompany
  -- 2. Note that LegalEntity is required for obligations (via legal_has_obligations)
  -- 3. Premise 6 only relates CreatedUnderLaw and ¬PrivateCompany, but:
  --    - We don't know if hwbc is CreatedUnderLaw
  --    - Even if it were, we can't prove it's a LegalEntity
  sorry  -- No proof found

-- Countermodel possibility:
-- Let U := {hwbc}
-- Assume ¬LegalEntity hwbc and ¬HasLegalObligations hwbc
-- All premises hold vacuously since no instances exist for:
--   BusinessOrganization, Company, PrivateCompany
-- CreatedUnderLaw hwbc could be true/false without contradiction
