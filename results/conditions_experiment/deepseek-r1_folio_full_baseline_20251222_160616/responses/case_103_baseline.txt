LLM Response:
The reasoning involves analyzing the given premises and Luke's situation to determine the truth value of the statement "Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings." The premises establish logical chains:

1. Multiple birth → Spend time with siblings → Live at home → ¬Live with strangers
2. Complain about annoying siblings → Has siblings born together → Multiple birth

Luke's situation is given as a disjunction:
- (Born in multiple birth ∧ Lives with stra...

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The compilation error occurred due to improper handling of the disjunction case in the Lean proof. The corrected code properly splits the disjunction and handles each case with appropriate variable extraction and contradiction resolution.

LLM Response:
The error occurred due to incorrect syntax handling in the disjunction case. The corrected proof properly uses `And.intro` and explicit contradiction resolution for both branches.
