LLM Response:
The reasoning involves determining if ETS provides financial aid to Tom based on the given conditions. The key points are:
- ETS provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
- Economic hardship can be proven by living in a single-parent family or having few resources.
- Tom lives in a single-parent family and has few resources.
- Tom is a GRE applicant.

Thus, Tom meets the criteria for proving economic hardship (via both conditions) and is a GRE applicant, so ETS provid...

Lean Code:
axiom Person : Type
axiom Tom : Person

-- Predicates
axiom isGREApplicant : Person → Prop
axiom provesEconomicHardship : Person → Prop
axiom getsFinancialAid : Person → Prop
axiom livesInSingleParentFamily : Person → Prop
axiom hasFewResources : Person → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
axiom aid_rule : ∀ (p : Person), isGREApplicant p ∧ provesEconomicHardship p → getsFinancialAid p
axiom hardship_rule : ∀ (p : Person), (livesInSingleParentFamily p ∨ hasFewResources p) → provesEconomicHardship p
axiom tom_single_parent : livesInSingleParentFamily Tom
axiom tom_few_resources : hasFewResources Tom
axiom tom_applicant : isGREApplicant Tom

-- Theorem: ETS provides financial aid to Tom
theorem ets_aids_tom : getsFinancialAid Tom := by
  -- Tom proves economic hardship (by single-parent family OR few resources; both hold)
  have tom_econ_hardship : provesEconomicHardship Tom := by
    apply hardship_rule Tom
    exact Or.inl tom_single_parent  -- Or.inr tom_few_resources also works
  -- Tom is an applicant with economic hardship, so gets aid
  exact aid_rule Tom ⟨tom_applicant, tom_econ_hardship⟩
