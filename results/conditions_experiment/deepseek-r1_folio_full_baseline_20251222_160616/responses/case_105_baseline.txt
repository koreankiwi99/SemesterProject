LLM Response:
The initial statement directly states, "It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300." This establishes that the base cost of the GRE test is $205, and $205 is less than $300. The subsequent details about financial aid and Tom's situation do not alter the base cost; they only describe eligibility for reduced fees. Therefore, regardless of financial aid, the standard cost remains $205, which is below $300. The Lean code models this by defining the base cost as 205 and proving it...

Lean Code:
def gre_cost : Nat := 205

theorem gre_cost_below_300 : gre_cost < 300 := by
  unfold gre_cost
  decide

Lean: Success
