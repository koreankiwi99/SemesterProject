LLM Response:
The reasoning involves determining if the statement "No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something" is true, false, or uncertain based on the given context. The key points are:

- ETS provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
- Proving economic hardship is possible by living in a single-parent family or having few resources.
- Tom lives in a single-parent family and has few resources, so he proves economic hardship.
- Tom is a GRE applican...

theorem goal : Prop := ∀ p, TakingGRE p → ¬ FinancialAid p

-- We cannot prove `goal` because:
--   We have no evidence that every person taking the GRE lacks financial aid.
-- We cannot prove `¬ goal` (i.e., ∃ p, TakingGRE p ∧ FinancialAid p) because:
--   Although Tom has financial aid, we don't know if he takes the test (`TakingGRE Tom` is not established).
--   No other individuals are mentioned.
-- Therefore, the truth value of `goal` is unknown.

LLM Response:
The compilation errors have been fixed. The previous errors were due to incorrect lemma syntax and misdefinition of the theorem goal. The corrected code properly defines axioms, lemmas, and the goal proposition without attempting unprovable statements.

Analysis:
1. We know Tom qualifies for financial aid (via tom_has_financial_aid)
2. But we have NO axiom stating Tom takes the GRE (TakingGRE Tom)
3. The goal claims "every test-taker lacks financial aid"
4. We cannot prove goal because:
   - We lack evidence that all test-takers lack aid
   - Tom has aid but we don't know if he takes the test
5. We cannot disprove goal (¬goal = ∃ p, TakingGRE p ∧ FinancialAid p) because:
   - No evidence exists that any test-taker has aid
   - Tom has aid but we don't know if he takes the test

--- Iteration 3 ---
LLM Response:
The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect lemma syntax. The lemma `tom_has_financial_aid` now uses proper function application without redundant parentheses. The theorem `goal` is correctly defined as a proposition without proof attempts.

Reasoning:
1. Tom qualifies for financial aid (via tom_has_financial_aid)
2. We have NO information about whether Tom takes the GRE (TakingGRE Tom is unknown)
3. The goal claims "every test-taker lacks financial aid"
4. We cannot prove this universal statement because:
   - Tom has financial aid, but we don't know if he takes the test
   - Other individuals might have both properties
5. We cannot refute it either because:
   - No evidence shows any test-taker has financial aid
   - Tom's test-taking status is unknown
