LLM Response:
The reasoning involves analyzing the given premises and Peter's situation. The key premises are:

1. If someone spills a lot of food, they are not notably tidy: ∀p, SpillsLot(p) → ¬NotablyTidy(p)
2. If someone is cleanly, they are notably tidy: ∀p, Cleanly(p) → NotablyTidy(p)
3. Peter is either (spills a lot and cleanly) or (does not spill and not cleanly): (SpillsLot(Peter) ∧ Cleanly(Peter)) ∨ (¬SpillsLot(Peter) ∧ ¬Cleanly(Peter))

The first case (spills and cleanly) leads to a contradiction:
-...

Lean Code:
axiom Person : Type
axiom Peter : Person

axiom SpillsLot : Person → Prop
axiom NotablyTidy : Person → Prop
axiom Cleanly : Person → Prop

axiom spill_not_tidy : ∀ p, SpillsLot p → ¬ NotablyTidy p
axiom cleanly_tidy : ∀ p, Cleanly p → NotablyTidy p
axiom peter_case : (SpillsLot Peter ∧ Cleanly Peter) ∨ (¬ SpillsLot Peter ∧ ¬ Cleanly Peter)

theorem case1_contradiction : SpillsLot Peter ∧ Cleanly Peter → False := by
  intro ⟨h_spill, h_clean⟩
  have h_not_tidy := spill_not_tidy Peter h_spill
  have h_tidy := cleanly_tidy Peter h_clean
  exact h_not_tidy h_tidy

theorem peter_second_case : ¬ SpillsLot Peter ∧ ¬ Cleanly Peter := by
  cases peter_case with
  | inl h => exact absurd h case1_contradiction
  | inr h => exact h

theorem goal : NotablyTidy Peter := by
  have ⟨no_spill, not_clean⟩ := peter_second_case
  -- Cannot prove NotablyTidy Peter: cleanly_tidy requires Cleanly Peter, which is false.
  -- No other axioms force tidiness without cleanly.
  sorry

theorem neg_goal : ¬ NotablyTidy Peter := by
  have ⟨no_spill, not_clean⟩ := peter_second_case
  -- Cannot prove ¬NotablyTidy Peter: spill_not_tidy requires SpillsLot Peter, which is false.
  -- No axiom states that not cleanly implies not tidy.
  sorry
