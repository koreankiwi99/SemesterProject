LLM Response:
The reasoning text states that all fir trees are evergreens and some objects of worship are fir trees. The query asks whether it necessarily follows that some evergreens are not objects of worship.

In Lean, we formalize the predicates and axioms. The universe is represented by `Object`. We define:
- `FirTree o`: object `o` is a fir tree
- `Evergreen o`: object `o` is an evergreen
- `ObjectOfWorship o`: object `o` is an object of worship

The given premises are:
1. `all_fir_evergreen`: All fir t...

Lean Code:
variable Object : Type
variable FirTree : Object → Prop
variable Evergreen : Object → Prop
variable ObjectOfWorship : Object → Prop

axiom all_fir_evergreen : ∀ (o : Object), FirTree o → Evergreen o
axiom some_worship_fir : ∃ (o : Object), ObjectOfWorship o ∧ FirTree o

-- The statement in question: Some evergreens are not objects of worship
example : (∃ o, Evergreen o ∧ ¬ ObjectOfWorship o) ∨ ¬(∃ o, Evergreen o ∧ ¬ ObjectOfWorship o) := by
  -- We cannot prove either disjunct from the premises
  left  -- Attempt to prove existence
  · -- We know there is some object that is worshiped and is a fir tree (hence evergreen)
    rcases some_worship_fir with ⟨w, hw, hf⟩
    have he := all_fir_evergreen w hf  -- w is evergreen
    -- We need to show there exists some evergreen not worshiped, but we only have w (which IS worshiped)
    -- No premise shows there are other evergreens or non-fir-tree evergreens that might not be worshiped
    -- Cannot construct a witness for the existential claim
    admit  -- Proof fails here
  right -- Attempt to prove impossibility
  · intro h -- Assume there exists an evergreen not worshiped
    -- But there might be such an object; no premise says all evergreens are worshiped
    -- We only know at least one fir tree is worshiped and thus evergreen, but other evergreens could exist
    -- Cannot derive a contradiction
    admit  -- Proof fails here

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect syntax in variable declarations. Here's the corrected Lean formalization:
