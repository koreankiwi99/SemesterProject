LLM Response:
The reasoning involves determining the location of the Picuris Mountains based on the given premises. The Picuris Mountains are stated to be in New Mexico or Texas. The Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in these mountains, was donated. The critical premise is that there are no mountain ranges in Texas with donated mines. Therefore, if the Picuris Mountains were in Texas, they could not have a donated mine. However, since the mine was donated, the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas. Consequently,...
