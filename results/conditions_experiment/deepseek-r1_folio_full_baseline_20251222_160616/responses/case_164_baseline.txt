LLM Response:
The reasoning involves translating the given premises into Lean and proving the statement about Breaking Bad. The premises establish:

1. There exists a show airing Monday at 8 pm that gives out roses.
2. Any show giving out roses is an episode of The Bachelor.
3. Episodes of The Bachelor portray real people.
4. Shows portraying real people are reality TV shows.
5. Breaking Bad is a show.
6. Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

The goal is to determine if Breaking Bad gives out roses on Monda...

Lean Code:
axiom Show : Type
axiom breaking_bad : Show
axiom GivesRoses : Show → Prop
axiom IsBachelorEpisode : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
axiom RealityTV : Show → Prop
axiom AirsMonday8pm : Show → Prop

axiom exists_show : ∃ s : Show, AirsMonday8pm s ∧ GivesRoses s
axiom roses_imp_bachelor : ∀ s : Show, GivesRoses s → IsBachelorEpisode s
axiom bachelor_portrays_real : ∀ s : Show, IsBachelorEpisode s → PortraysRealPeople s
axiom portrays_imp_reality : ∀ s : Show, PortraysRealPeople s → RealityTV s
axiom breaking_bad_not_reality : ¬ RealityTV breaking_bad

theorem breaking_bad_no_roses : ¬ GivesRoses breaking_bad := by
  intro h_roses
  have h_bachelor : IsBachelorEpisode breaking_bad := roses_imp_bachelor breaking_bad h_roses
  have h_real : PortraysRealPeople breaking_bad := bachelor_portrays_real breaking_bad h_bachelor
  have h_reality : RealityTV breaking_bad := portrays_imp_reality breaking_bad h_real
  exact breaking_bad_not_reality h_reality

theorem goal : ¬ (GivesRoses breaking_bad ∧ AirsMonday8pm breaking_bad) := by
  intro ⟨h_roses, _⟩
  exact breaking_bad_no_roses h_roses
