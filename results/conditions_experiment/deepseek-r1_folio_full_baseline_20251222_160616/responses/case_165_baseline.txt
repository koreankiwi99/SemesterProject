LLM Response:
The reasoning involves translating the given premises into Lean and proving the target statement.

Lean Code:
axiom Show : Type
axiom BreakingBad : Show

axiom GivesRoses : Show → Prop
axiom IsBachelorEpisode : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
axiom IsRealityTV : Show → Prop
axiom AirsMonday8pm : Show → Prop

axiom premise1 : ∃ s, AirsMonday8pm s ∧ GivesRoses s
axiom premise2 : ∀ s, GivesRoses s → IsBachelorEpisode s
axiom premise3 : ∀ s, IsBachelorEpisode s → PortraysRealPeople s
axiom premise4 : ∀ s, PortraysRealPeople s → IsRealityTV s
axiom premise6 : ¬ IsRealityTV BreakingBad
