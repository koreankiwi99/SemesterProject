--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM Response:
The information states that Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician. This directly establishes that he was German. The question asks whether he was German or Russian or both. Since we know he was German, the disjunction "German or Russian" is true regardless of whether he was Russian or not. Therefore, the statement is true.

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The compilation errors occurred because `German` and `Russian` were declared as constants of type `Person → Prop` but were used without proper function application syntax. The corrected code properly defines predicates and applies them to `HeinrichSchmidt`.

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 3 ---
LLM Response:
The compilation errors occurred because the predicates `German` and `Russian` were not properly declared as functions from `Person` to `Prop`. The corrected code uses `axiom` for all declarations and ensures proper function application syntax.
