LLM Response:
The information states that Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician and also a member of the Nazi Reichstag. This directly refutes the claim that "no politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag," as Heinrich Schmidt is a politician who was part of the Nazi Reichstag.

In Lean, we model this as follows:
- Define a type `Person`.
- Introduce `HeinrichSchmidt` as a specific person.
- Define predicates `Politician` and `MemberOfReichstag`.
- Include axioms from the given information.
- Prove that th...

Lean Code:
axiom Person : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : Person
axiom Politician : Person → Prop
axiom MemberOfReichstag : Person → Prop
axiom isPolitician : Politician HeinrichSchmidt
axiom inReichstag : MemberOfReichstag HeinrichSchmidt

-- The claim to refute: no politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag
theorem refute_statement : ¬ (∀ p, Politician p → ¬ MemberOfReichstag p) := by
  intro h                -- Assume the universal claim
  have absurd := h HeinrichSchmidt isPolitician  -- Apply to Heinrich Schmidt
  exact absurd inReichstag  -- Contradiction: he is both a politician and in the Reichstag
