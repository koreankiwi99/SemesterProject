LLM Response:
The given premises do not provide sufficient information to determine whether colorectal cancer is a severe cancer. While the premises establish that severe cancers are deadly diseases with low survival rates, and bile duct cancer is a severe cancer, colorectal cancer is explicitly stated not to be both a bile duct cancer and having a low survival rate. This implies colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer, but it does not preclude it from being another form of severe cancer. No premises dire...

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The Lean code has been corrected by properly declaring predicates and entities. The premises are translated as follows:
- `deadly`, `low_survival`, `severe_cancer`, `bile_duct_cancer`, and `is_cholangiocarcinoma` are predicates on `Disease`.
- `mild_flu` and `colorectal_cancer` are specific diseases.
- Premises P1-P6 correspond directly to the given statements.

The proof demonstrates:
1. `colorectal_cancer` cannot be a bile duct cancer (theorem `not_bile_duct`), as this would contradict P6 when...
