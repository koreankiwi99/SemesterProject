LLM Response:
The reasoning in the text establishes that colorectal cancer cannot be a bile duct cancer or cholangiocarcinoma due to a contradiction with premise 6. Specifically, if colorectal cancer were bile duct cancer (or cholangiocarcinoma, which implies bile duct cancer), it would have a low survival rate (via premises 3, 2, and 1), violating premise 6. Thus, the antecedent of the implication ("colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of cholangiocarcinoma") is false. Since a false ante...

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The compilation errors occurred because the proof attempted to derive a contradiction (`False`) where the goal required a conjunction (`BileDuctCancer colorectal ∧ MildFlu colorectal`). This is resolved by using `False.elim` to derive any conclusion from a contradiction, including the required conjunction.
