LLM Response:
The natural language text describes a set of premises and a disjunctive statement about Taylor. The goal is to determine if Taylor eats salads regularly. The Lean formalization captures the premises and the disjunction about Taylor. 

The reasoning shows:
1. The first case (Taylor grew up health-conscious and disregards physical well-being) leads to a contradiction: 
   - If she grew up health-conscious, she eats salads (premise 2).
   - Eating salads implies health consciousness (premise 1).

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The corrected Lean code properly formalizes the natural language reasoning. The analysis shows that Taylor cannot have grown up in a health-conscious home and disregard her physical well-being (due to a contradiction). Therefore, she must have neither grown up in a health-conscious home nor disregarded her physical well-being. 

However:
- There's no premise forcing Taylor to eat salads without the health-conscious home condition
- There's no premise preventing her from eating salads by other me...
