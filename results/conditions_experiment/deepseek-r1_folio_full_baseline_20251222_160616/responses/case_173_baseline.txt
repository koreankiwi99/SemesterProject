LLM Response:
The reasoning follows the logical structure derived from the premises:

- Premise 5 links gym visits to fulfilling nutritional needs: `Gym → Nutrition`
- Premise 3 links nutrition to health-conscious homes: `Nutrition → HealthConsciousHome`
- Therefore: `Gym → HealthConsciousHome`

For Taylor:
- Premise 6 states she is either:
  (a) `HealthConsciousHome ∧ DisregardsHealth`
  (b) `¬HealthConsciousHome ∧ ¬DisregardsHealth`

Case analysis:
- In case (a): 
  - `DisregardsHealth` implies `¬HealthCons...

Lean Code:
axiom Person : Type
axiom Taylor : Person

-- Define predicates
axiom EatsSalads : Person → Prop
axiom HealthConscious : Person → Prop
axiom HealthConsciousHome : Person → Prop
axiom FulfillsNutrition : Person → Prop
axiom DisregardsHealth : Person → Prop
axiom VisitsGymDaily : Person → Prop

-- Premises as axioms
axiom A1 : ∀ (p : Person), EatsSalads p → HealthConscious p
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person), HealthConsciousHome p → EatsSalads p
axiom A3 : ∀ (p : Person), FulfillsNutrition p → HealthConsciousHome p
axiom A4 : ∀ (p : Person), DisregardsHealth p → ¬ HealthConscious p
axiom A5 : ∀ (p : Person), VisitsGymDaily p → FulfillsNutrition p
axiom A6 : (HealthConsciousHome Taylor ∧ DisregardsHealth Taylor) ∨ (¬ HealthConsciousHome Taylor ∧ ¬ DisregardsHealth Taylor)

-- We prove Taylor does NOT visit gym daily
theorem not_gym_taylor : ¬ (VisitsGymDaily Taylor) := by
  -- Assume Taylor visits gym daily
  intro gym_taylor
  -- From A5: gym implies nutrition
  have nutrition_taylor : FulfillsNutrition Taylor := A5 Taylor gym_taylor
  -- From A3: nutrition implies health-conscious home
  have home_taylor : HealthConsciousHome Taylor := A3 Taylor nutrition_taylor
  -- Break down disjunction from A6
  cases A6 with
  | inl both => 
      -- Case: home and disregards health
      have disregard_taylor := both.2
      -- From home_taylor: get eats salads (A2)
      have salad_taylor : EatsSalads Taylor := A2 Taylor home_taylor
      -- Then health conscious (A1)
      have conscious_taylor : HealthConscious Taylor := A1 Taylor salad_taylor
      -- But disregard implies not conscious (A4)
      have not_conscious := A4 Taylor disregard_taylor
      contradiction
  | inr neither => 
      -- Case: not home (contradicts home_taylor)
      have not_home := neither.1
