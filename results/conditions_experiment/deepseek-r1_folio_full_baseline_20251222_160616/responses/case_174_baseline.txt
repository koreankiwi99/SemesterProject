LLM Response:
The reasoning involves analyzing the given premises and the disjunctive statement about Taylor to determine the truth of the conclusion. 

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - If someone eats salads regularly, they are health-conscious: `∀ p, S p → C p`
   - Growing up health-conscious implies salad eating: `∀ p, H p → S p`
   - Fulfilling nutrition implies health-conscious upbringing: `∀ p, N p → H p`
   - Disregarding well-being implies not health-conscious: `∀ p, D p → ¬ C p`
   - Visiting the gym d...

Lean Code:
variable Person : Type
variable Taylor : Person
variable EatsSaladsRegularly : Person → Prop
variable HealthConscious : Person → Prop
variable HealthConsciousHome : Person → Prop
variable DisregardsWellBeing : Person → Prop

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The initial Lean code had compilation errors due to incorrect variable declarations. The corrected version uses axioms instead of variables for propositions to ensure proper function application. The proof demonstrates that the statement about Taylor is true by contradiction and case analysis:

1. **Contradiction in first disjunct**: If Taylor had a health-conscious home and disregarded well-being, she would be both health-conscious (from salad eating) and not health-conscious (from disregarding...
