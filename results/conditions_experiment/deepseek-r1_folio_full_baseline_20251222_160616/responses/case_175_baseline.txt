LLM Response:
The given information establishes that the summer Olympic games is a sporting event and provides details about the last edition in Tokyo. However, there is no mention of the world championships or any logical connection between the summer Olympic games and the world championships. The statement about the world championships being a sporting event cannot be inferred from the provided context, as there might be non-sporting world championships (e.g., in chess, debate, or esports) or sporting ones....

Lean Code:
axiom Event : Type
axiom IsSportingEvent : Event → Prop
axiom summer_olympics : Event
axiom world_championships : Event
axiom summer_olympics_sporting : IsSportingEvent summer_olympics

-- No axioms relate world_championships to sporting events
theorem goal : IsSportingEvent world_championships := 
  sorry -- Unprovable without additional information

theorem neg_goal : ¬ IsSportingEvent world_championships := 
  sorry -- Also unprovable without information
