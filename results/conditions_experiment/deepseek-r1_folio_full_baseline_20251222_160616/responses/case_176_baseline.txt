--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM Response:
The context explicitly states that "The last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo." The question asks whether the statement "The last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo" is true, false, or uncertain based on this context.

In Lean, we model:
- The last summer Olympic games as a constant `last_games`
- The location of games as a function `location`
- The given premise `games_in_tokyo` asserts that the location of the last games is "Tokyo"

The statement to evaluate is whether the last games were...

Lean Code:
constant last_games : Unit  -- Type for games isn't relevant; using Unit for simplicity
constant location : last_games → String
axiom games_in_tokyo : location last_games = "Tokyo"

-- Statement to evaluate: "The last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo"
theorem disprove_statement : ¬ (location last_games ≠ "Tokyo") := by
  rw [not_ne_iff]  -- Convert ¬(a ≠ b) to a = b
  exact games_in_tokyo

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The corrected Lean code properly models the scenario:

<lean>
constant LastSummerOlympics : Type
constant the_last_games : LastSummerOlympics
constant location : LastSummerOlympics → String
axiom games_in_tokyo : location the_last_games = "Tokyo"

theorem disprove_statement : ¬ (location the_last_games ≠ "Tokyo") := 
  fun h => h games_in_tokyo
</lean>

Explanation:
1. `LastSummerOlympics` is defined as a type
2. `the_last_games` is a specific instance of this type
3. `location` maps games to th...

Lean Code:
constant LastSummerOlympics : Type
constant the_last_games : LastSummerOlympics
constant location : LastSummerOlympics → String
axiom games_in_tokyo : location the_last_games = "Tokyo"

theorem disprove_statement : ¬ (location the_last_games ≠ "Tokyo") := 
  fun h => h games_in_tokyo

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 3 ---
LLM Response:
The context explicitly states that the last summer Olympic games were in Tokyo. Therefore, the statement "The last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo" is directly contradicted by this premise. 

Here is the corrected Lean implementation modeling the scenario:

<lean>
axiom Location : Type
axiom Tokyo : Location
axiom last_games_location : Location
axiam games_in_tokyo : last_games_location = Tokyo

theorem disprove_statement : ¬(last_games_location ≠ Tokyo) := 
  fun h => h games_in_tokyo
</...

Lean Code:
axiom Location : Type
axiom Tokyo : Location
axiom last_games_location : Location
axiam games_in_tokyo : last_games_location = Tokyo

theorem disprove_statement : ¬(last_games_location ≠ Tokyo) := 
  fun h => h games_in_tokyo

Lean: Failed
