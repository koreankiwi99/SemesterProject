LLM Response:
The reasoning from the given context is straightforward. The context states that the last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo and that the United States won the most medals in Tokyo. Since the last Olympic games is identified as the Tokyo games, it follows directly that the United States won the most medals in the last summer Olympic games.

In Lean, this is modeled by defining types for `OlympicGame` and `Country`, constants for the last games (`last`) and the Tokyo games (`tokyo`), and equating ...

Lean Code:
axiom OlympicGame : Type
axiom Country : Type
axiom usa : Country
axiom last : OlympicGame
axiom tokyo : OlympicGame
axiom last_is_tokyo : last = tokyo
axiom topMedals : OlympicGame → Country
axiom usa_top_tokyo : topMedals tokyo = usa

theorem usa_won_most_in_last : topMedals last = usa := by
  rw [last_is_tokyo]
  exact usa_top_tokyo

Lean: Success
