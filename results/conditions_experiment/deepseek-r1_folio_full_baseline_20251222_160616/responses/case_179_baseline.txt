LLM Response:
The information provided does not specify whether Susan has only one flight or multiple flights. The statement "Susan flies to LGA airport" indicates that Susan arrives at LGA, but it does not preclude her from having another flight departing from LGA. Similarly, "John flies from LGA airport" shows John departs from LGA, but this does not relate to Susan's flights. The constraint that departure and arrival cannot be the same airport applies to individual flights, not across different flights or ...

Lean Code:
axiom Airport : Type
axiom LGA : Airport

axiom Person : Type
axiom Susan : Person
axiom John : Person

axiom flies : Person → Airport → Airport → Prop

axiom constraint : ∀ (p : Person) (d a : Airport), flies p d a → d ≠ a

axiom susan_to_LGA : ∃ (d : Airport), flies Susan d LGA
axiom john_from_LGA : ∃ (a : Airport), flies John LGA a

theorem susan_from_LGA : ∃ (a : Airport), flies Susan LGA a :=
  sorry  -- No information forces Susan to depart from LGA, but also no information prevents it.

theorem not_susan_from_LGA : ¬ ∃ (a : Airport), flies Susan LGA a :=
  sorry  -- Cannot prove absence without assuming Susan has only one flight (which is not stated).
