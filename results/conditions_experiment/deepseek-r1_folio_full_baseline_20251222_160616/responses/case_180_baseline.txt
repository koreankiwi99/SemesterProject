--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM Response:
The given information states:
- Susan flies to LGA airport (arrives at LGA).
- Departure and arrival cannot be the same airport for any flight.
- John flies from LGA airport (departs from LGA).

The question asks whether John flies to LGA airport (i.e., whether John has a flight arriving at LGA).

Analysis:
- John is known to have a flight departing from LGA. The constraint requires that for this flight, the arrival airport cannot be LGA. Therefore, this specific flight does not arrive at LGA.
-...

Lean Code:
axiom Airport : Type
axiom LGA : Airport
axiom Person : Type
axiom Susan : Person
axiom John : Person
axiom Flight : Person → Airport → Airport → Prop

-- Susan flies to LGA: exists a departure where she arrives at LGA
axiom susan_flight : ∃ (dep : Airport), Flight Susan dep LGA
-- John flies from LGA: exists an arrival where he departs from LGA
axiom john_flight : ∃ (arr : Airport), Flight John LGA arr
-- No flight has the same departure and arrival
axiom no_self_flight : ∀ (p : Person) (d a : Airport), Flight p d a → d ≠ a

-- Statement to evaluate: John flies to LGA (exists a flight where he arrives at LGA)
def target : Prop := ∃ (dep : Airport), Flight John dep LGA

-- Attempt to prove target (fails due to insufficient evidence)
theorem prove_target : target := by
  cases john_flight with
  | intro arr h =>
    -- We know John has a flight from LGA to `arr`, but `arr ≠ LGA` by `no_self_flight`
    have : arr ≠ LGA := no_self_flight John LGA arr h
    -- No information about other flights to LGA
    sorry  -- Cannot prove existence of a flight to LGA

-- Attempt to disprove target (fails due to possibility of other flights)
theorem disprove_target : ¬ target := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | intro dep h_flight =>
    -- We know John has a flight from LGA to some `arr` (≠ LGA), but this new flight `dep LGA` might be different
    -- No axiom prevents multiple flights or a flight from `dep` to LGA (as long as `dep ≠ LGA`)
    have : ∀ (arr : Airport), Flight John LGA arr → arr ≠ LGA := 
      fun arr h_flight => no_self_flight John LGA arr h_flight
    -- Cannot contradict because `h_flight` might be an additional flight
    sorry  -- Cannot prove no flight arrives at LGA

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The compilation errors occurred because the inequality `LGA ≠ arr` was used where `arr ≠ LGA` was expected. Since inequality is symmetric, I've corrected this using `.symm` to flip the inequality. However, the core reasoning remains unchanged: we still cannot prove or disprove whether John flies to LGA due to possible additional flights.

Here is the corrected Lean code:
