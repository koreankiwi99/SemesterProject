LLM Response:
The reasoning involves translating the given statements into first-order logic and analyzing the entailment of the conclusion. The key steps are:

1. **Premises:**
   - No one nice to animals is mean: `∀x, Nice x → ¬Mean x`
   - Some grumpy people are mean: `∃x, Grumpy x ∧ Mean x`
   - Animal lovers are nice: `∀x, Loves x → Nice x`
   - Pet owners love animals: `∀x, PetOwner x → Loves x`
   - Tom is a pet owner: `PetOwner Tom`

2. **Derivations about Tom:**
   - Tom loves animals: `Loves Tom` (f...

theorem tom_grumpy? : Grumpy Tom := by
  -- Cannot be proven: No premise forces Tom to be grumpy.
  rcases premise2 with ⟨w, grumpy_w, mean_w⟩
  -- It is possible that w ≠ Tom, so this doesn't help.

theorem not_tom_grumpy? : ¬ Grumpy Tom := by
  -- Cannot be proven: Tom might still be grumpy (without being mean).
  -- Premises do not state that grumpy implies mean.

LLM Response:
The errors occurred due to incorrect syntax in variable declarations. In Lean 4, `variable` must be used with explicit type annotations for predicates. Here's the corrected version:
