LLM Response:
The reasoning is formalized in Lean by defining the relevant types, predicates, and premises, then proving the goal. The critical steps are:
1. Rockie is calm, so cannot be skittish (via premise 4).
2. Rockie is spotted near campus, so is either a rabbit or squirrel (premise 3).
3. If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish (premise 5), contradicting calmness.
4. Thus, Rockie must be a rabbit, making it cute (premise 1).
5. Therefore, the consequent (cute or skittish) holds regardless of th...

I'll provide the corrected Lean code with the syntax errors fixed. The main issue was with the case syntax and proof structure. Here's the corrected version:
