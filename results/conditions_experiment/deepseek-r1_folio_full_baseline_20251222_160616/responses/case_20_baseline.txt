LLM Response:
The reasoning shows that the given premises lead to a contradiction when assuming the implication is true. Specifically, Rockie is calm and spotted, so Rockie cannot be skittish (from premise 4). Premise 3 implies Rockie is either a rabbit or a squirrel. If Rockie is a squirrel, premise 5 forces skittishness, contradicting calmness. Thus, Rockie must be a rabbit. Premise 1 then ensures Rockie is cute. Therefore, the antecedent (cute and calm) is true, but the consequent (skittish and turtle) is ...
