Lean Code:
axiom Event : Type
axiom Hosted : Event → Prop
axiom season : Event → String
axiom year : Event → ℕ

axiom summer2008 : Event
axiom summer2008_season : season summer2008 = "summer"
axiom summer2008_year : year summer2008 = 2008
axiom hosted_summer2008 : Hosted summer2008

axiom hosted_winter : ∃ (e : Event), season e = "winter" ∧ Hosted e

theorem goal : Hosted summer2008 ∧ (∃ (e : Event), season e = "winter" ∧ Hosted e) := by
