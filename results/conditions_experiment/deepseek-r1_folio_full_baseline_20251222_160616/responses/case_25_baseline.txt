LLM Response:
The given information explicitly states that "Beijing is located in Northern China." However, there is no information provided about the relationship between Northern China and Southern China, such as whether they are mutually exclusive. The statement to evaluate is "Beijing is located in southern China." 

In the Lean representation:
- We define a type `City`.
- We declare `Beijing` as a `City`.
- We define predicates `locatedInNorthernChina` and `locatedInSouthernChina` for cities.
- We have t...

Lean Code:
axiom City : Type
axiom Beijing : City
axiom locatedInNorthernChina : City → Prop
axiom locatedInSouthernChina : City → Prop

-- Premise from the text: Beijing is located in Northern China
axiom premise : locatedInNorthernChina Beijing

-- We try to prove the statement: Beijing is in southern China
theorem beijing_south_true : locatedInSouthernChina Beijing := by
  -- Cannot prove: no supporting evidence
  sorry

-- We try to prove the negation of the statement
theorem beijing_south_false : ¬ locatedInSouthernChina Beijing := by
  -- Cannot prove: no axiom that Northern and Southern China are mutually exclusive
  sorry
