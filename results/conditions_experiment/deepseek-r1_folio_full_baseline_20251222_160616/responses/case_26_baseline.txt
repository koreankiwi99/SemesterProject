Lean Code:
axiom City : Type
axiom Beijing : City
axiom IsSecondLargest : City → Prop

-- No axioms about population rankings exist in the context
theorem cannot_prove_second : IsSecondLargest Beijing := by
  sorry  -- No evidence provided

theorem cannot_disprove_second : ¬ IsSecondLargest Beijing := by
  sorry  -- No counter-evidence provided
