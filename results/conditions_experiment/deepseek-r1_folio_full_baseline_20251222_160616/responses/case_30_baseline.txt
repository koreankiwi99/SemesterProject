LLM Response:
The reasoning problem involves determining whether Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion based on the given premises. After formalizing the statements in Lean, the proof attempt shows that:

1. Djokovic must be either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor (from premise 1 and premise 8).
2. If Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion:
   - He becomes a professional tennis player (premise 2)
   - Then an athlete (premise 4)
   - Then famous (premise 6)
   - Then well-paid (premise 9)
3. If Djokov...

Lean Code:
axiom Person : Type
axiom Djokovic : Person

axiom AtMixer : Person → Prop
axiom GrandSlamChampion : Person → Prop
axiom OscarNominatedActor : Person → Prop
axiom ProfessionalTennisPlayer : Person → Prop
axiom Celebrity : Person → Prop
axiom Athlete : Person → Prop
axiom WellPaid : Person → Prop
axiom Famous : Person → Prop
axiom LivesInTaxHaven : Person → Prop

axiom premise1 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → GrandSlamChampion p ∨ OscarNominatedActor p
axiom premise2 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → GrandSlamChampion p → ProfessionalTennisPlayer p
axiom premise3 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → OscarNominatedActor p → Celebrity p
axiom premise4 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → ProfessionalTennisPlayer p → Athlete p
axiom premise5 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → Celebrity p → WellPaid p
axiom premise6 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → Athlete p → Famous p
axiom premise7 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → WellPaid p → LivesInTaxHaven p
axiom premise8 : AtMixer Djokovic
axiom premise9 : (Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic) → WellPaid Djokovic

theorem goal : GrandSlamChampion Djokovic := by
  have h := premise1 Djokovic premise8
  cases h with
  | inl gsc => exact gsc
  | inr ona => 
    have celeb := premise3 Djokovic premise8 ona
    have wp := premise5 Djokovic premise8 celeb
    -- No contradiction, but no proof of GrandSlamChampion either
    sorry

theorem neg_goal : ¬ GrandSlamChampion Djokovic := by
  intro h_gsc
  have ptp := premise2 Djokovic premise8 h_gsc
  have athlete := premise4 Djokovic premise8 ptp
  have famous := premise6 Djokovic premise8 athlete
  have wp := premise9 ⟨famous, athlete⟩
  -- No contradiction derived from GrandSlamChampion assumption
  sorry
