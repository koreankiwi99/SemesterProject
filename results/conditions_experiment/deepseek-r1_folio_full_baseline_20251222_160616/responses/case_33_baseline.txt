LLM Response:
The reasoning involves representing the context in Lean and proving the statement "Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable" based on given axioms.

- Define types for `Stable` and `Wrestler`
- Introduce `diamond_mine` as a stable and `roderick_strong` as a wrestler
- Use `IsProfessionalWrestlingStable` to denote professional stables
- Use `Leads` for the leadership relation
- Axioms state Diamond Mine is professional and Roderick Strong leads it
- Theorem proves existence of a prof...

Lean Code:
axiom Stable : Type
axiom Wrestler : Type
axiom diamond_mine : Stable
axiom roderick_strong : Wrestler
axiom IsProfessionalWrestlingStable : Stable → Prop
axiom Leads : Wrestler → Stable → Prop

axiom diamond_mine_professional : IsProfessionalWrestlingStable diamond_mine
axiom strong_leads_diamond_mine : Leads roderick_strong diamond_mine

theorem statement_true : ∃ s, IsProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads roderick_strong s := by
  apply Exists.intro diamond_mine
  constructor
  · exact diamond_mine_professional
  · exact strong_leads_diamond_mine
