LLM Response:
The reasoning is translated into Lean by defining the necessary types, constants, and axioms based on the textual context. The key points are:

1. Types are defined for `Person`, `MusicPiece`, and `Orchestra`.
2. Constants include `Beethoven` as a `Person`, `SymphonyNo9` as a `MusicPiece`, and `VMS` (Vienna Music Society) as an `Orchestra`.
3. Predicates include:
   - `Composer : Person → Prop` (a person is a composer)
   - `Writes : Person → MusicPiece → Prop` (a person writes a music piece)
  ...

Lean Code:
axiom Person : Type
axiom MusicPiece : Type
axiom Orchestra : Type

axiom SymphonyNo9 : MusicPiece
axiom VMS : Orchestra
axiom Beethoven : Person

axiom Composer : Person → Prop
axiom Writes : Person → MusicPiece → Prop
axiom PremieredBy : MusicPiece → Orchestra → Prop
axiom Leads : Person → Orchestra → Prop
axiom Conductor : Person → Prop

axiom composers_write : ∀ (p : Person), Composer p → ∃ (mp : MusicPiece), Writes p mp
axiom beethoven_wrote : Writes Beethoven SymphonyNo9
axiom premiered_by : PremieredBy SymphonyNo9 VMS
axiom beethoven_leads : Leads Beethoven VMS
axiom orchestra_led_by_conductors : ∀ (p : Person) (o : Orchestra), Leads p o → Conductor p

theorem beethoven_is_composer : Composer Beethoven := by
  -- Cannot prove: `beethoven_wrote` shows Beethoven writes a piece, but `composers_write` does not provide the converse.
  sorry

theorem not_beethoven_composer : ¬ Composer Beethoven := by
  -- Also unprovable: no information contradicts Beethoven being a composer.
  sorry
