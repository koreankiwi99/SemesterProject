LLM Response:
The reasoning involves analyzing the given statements to determine if Beethoven is not a conductor. The key points are:
- Vienna Music Society is an orchestra.
- Orchestras are led by conductors.
- Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society.

From these, it follows that the leader of an orchestra must be a conductor. Since Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society, Beethoven must be a conductor. Thus, the statement "Beethoven is not a conductor" is false.

The Lean code models the predicates and en...

Lean Code:
axiom MusicPiece : Type
axiom Person : Type
axiom Orchestra : Type

axiom Symphony9 : MusicPiece
axiom Beethoven : Person
axiom ViennaMusicSociety : Orchestra

axiom compose : Person → MusicPiece → Prop
axiom premiere : Orchestra → MusicPiece → Prop
axiom leads : Person → Orchestra → Prop
axiom Conductor : Person → Prop

axiom wrote : compose Beethoven Symphony9
axiom premiered : premiere ViennaMusicSociety Symphony9
axiom leads_group : leads Beethoven ViennaMusicSociety

axiom orchestra_leader_conductor : ∀ (p : Person) (o : Orchestra), leads p o → Conductor p

theorem beethoven_conductor : Conductor Beethoven := by
  apply orchestra_leader_conductor Beethoven ViennaMusicSociety
  exact leads_group

-- The statement in question: "Beethoven is not a conductor" (¬Conductor Beethoven)
-- We proved Conductor Beethoven, so the statement is false.
