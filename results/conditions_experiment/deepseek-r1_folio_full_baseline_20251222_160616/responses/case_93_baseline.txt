LLM Response:
The reasoning involves determining if Tom is allowed to move into The Olive Garden with Fluffy based on the given information. The key points are:

- The Olive Garden is a managed building.
- If a managed building allows pets, people are allowed to move in with a pet.
- Pets are allowed in some managed buildings, but it is not specified whether The Olive Garden allows pets.
- Fluffy is a cat, and cats are pets, so Fluffy qualifies as a pet.
- Tom will rent if allowed to move in with Fluffy and t...

Lean Code:

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The compilation error occurred because the comparison `2000 > 1500` wasn't properly typed. In Lean, we need to specify the numeric type and ensure comparisons are valid. Here's the corrected code:

<lean>
axiom ManagedBuilding : Type
axiom olive_garden : ManagedBuilding

axiom monthly_rent : ManagedBuilding → Nat
axiom security_deposit : ManagedBuilding → Nat

axiom deposit_ge_rent (b : ManagedBuilding) : security_deposit b ≥ monthly_rent b

Lean Code:
axiom ManagedBuilding : Type

axiom security_deposit : ManagedBuilding → Nat

axiom deposit_ge_rent (b : ManagedBuilding) : security_deposit b ≥ monthly_rent b
axiom rent_olive_garden : monthly_rent olive_garden = 2000

axiom allows_pets : ManagedBuilding → Prop
axiom Tom_allowed_in : ManagedBuilding → Prop

axiom move_in_rule (b : ManagedBuilding) : allows_pets b → Tom_allowed_in b

  sorry  -- Missing evidence for allows_pets olive_garden

theorem neg_goal : ¬ Tom_allowed_in olive_garden := by
