--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM Response:
The statement "The security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more" is directly supported by the given information. Specifically:

- The security deposit at any managed building must be at least equal to the monthly rent (from "The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more").
- The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000 (given explicitly).
- Therefore, the security deposit at the Olive Garden must be ≥ $2000, meaning it is either $2000...

Lean Code:

axiom OliveGarden : ManagedBuilding
axiom rent : ManagedBuilding → ℕ
axiom deposit : ManagedBuilding → ℕ
axiom deposit_ge_rent : ∀ (b : ManagedBuilding), deposit b ≥ rent b
axiom rent_og : rent OliveGarden = 2000

  exact deposit_ge_rent OliveGarden

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The compilation error occurred because the rewrite tactic was applied directly to the goal without using the hypothesis correctly. The corrected proof uses the `deposit_ge_rent` axiom to establish that the deposit is at least the rent, then rewrites the rent value specifically for Olive Garden using the `rent_og` axiom.

LLM Response:
The error occurred due to issues with the inequality notation. The corrected version uses `≤` with `Nat` type for clarity and avoids the problematic `≥` notation. Here's the fixed Lean code:

axiom rent : ManagedBuilding → Nat
