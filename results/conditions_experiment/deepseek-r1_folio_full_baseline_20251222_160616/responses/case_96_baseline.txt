LLM Response:
The reasoning involves analyzing the given premises and the statement about the Harvard Weekly Book Club. The key steps are:

1. Assume the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company.  
2. From axioms:  
   - Private company → company (P3)  
   - Company → business organization (P2)  
   - Business organization → legal entity (P1)  
   - Legal entity → created under law (P4)  
3. So, if private company, then created under law.  
4. Premise 6: If created under law, then *not* a private company...

Lean Code:
variable Entity : Type
variable HWBC : Entity
variable BusinessOrganization : Entity → Prop
variable Company : Entity → Prop
variable PrivateCompany : Entity → Prop
variable LegalEntity : Entity → Prop
variable CreatedUnderLaw : Entity → Prop

Lean: Failed

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The errors in the previous Lean code were due to improper usage of `variable` declarations and a trailing `#align` command. The corrected version uses `constant` for all type declarations and axioms for clarity. 

Here's the fixed Lean translation:

<lean>
constant Entity : Type
constant HWBC : Entity
constant BusinessOrganization : Entity → Prop
constant Company : Entity → Prop
constant PrivateCompany : Entity → Prop
constant LegalEntity : Entity → Prop
constant CreatedUnderLaw : Entity → Prop

constant HWBC : Entity
constant BusinessOrganization : Entity → Prop
constant Company : Entity → Prop
constant PrivateCompany : Entity → Prop
constant LegalEntity : Entity → Prop
constant CreatedUnderLaw : Entity → Prop
constant HasLegalObligations : Entity → Prop

axiom P2 : ∀ x : Entity, Company x → BusinessOrganization x

axiom P4 : ∀ x : Entity, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom P5 : ∀ x : Entity, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom P6 : CreatedUnderLaw HWBC → ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC

  have hcul := P4 HWBC hl    -- HWBC is created under law
