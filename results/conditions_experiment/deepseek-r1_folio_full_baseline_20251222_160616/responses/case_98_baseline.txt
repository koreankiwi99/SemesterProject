LLM Response:
The given information allows us to deduce several properties about Harry:
- Harry is a bee (given).
- All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating, so Harry does not reproduce this way.
- Animals that reproduce without male-and-female mating cannot have backbones (contrapositive of "all animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating").
- Without a backbone, Harry cannot be a vertebrate (contrapositive of "all vertebrates have backbones").
- Therefore, Harry must be an inverteb...

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM Response:
The errors occurred because `contradiction` requires both a hypothesis and its negation to be present in the local context. The corrected proofs explicitly derive contradictions by applying relevant theorems. Regarding the main question about Harry being a queen bee:

- We know Harry is a bee (premise6)
- We know all queen bees are bees (premise5)
- But there are no premises stating that all bees are queen bees or any properties forcing Harry to be a queen bee
- There are also no premises exclud...
