-- Premises
-- 1. If people are born in a multiple birth, they spend a lot of time with their siblings.
axiom ax1 : ∀ x : Person, MultipleBirth x → SpendTimeWithSiblings x
-- 2. If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.

-- 3. If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.

-- 4. If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
axiom ax4 : ∀ x : Person, LiveAtHome x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x
-- 5. If people spend a lot of time with their siblings, then they often live at home.

-- 6. Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers,
--    or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.
axiom ax6 :
  (Baby Luke ∧ MultipleBirth Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) ∨
  (¬ (Baby Luke ∧ MultipleBirth Luke) ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke)

-- Useful derived facts

-- From MultipleBirth, derive not living with strangers (via ax1, ax5, ax4)
theorem multipleBirth_implies_not_strangers :
  ∀ x : Person, MultipleBirth x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x := by
  intro x hmb
  have hSpend : SpendTimeWithSiblings x := ax1 x hmb
  have hHome : LiveAtHome x := ax5 x hSpend
  exact ax4 x hHome

-- The first disjunct in ax6 is impossible (contradiction with derived fact)
theorem first_branch_impossible :
  ¬ (Baby Luke ∧ MultipleBirth Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) := by
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨_, hMB, hStr⟩
  have hNotStr : ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke := multipleBirth_implies_not_strangers Luke hMB
  exact hNotStr hStr

-- Therefore, Luke does not live with strangers
theorem luke_not_live_with_strangers : ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke := by
  have h := ax6
  rcases h with h1 | h2
  · exact False.elim (first_branch_impossible h1)
  · exact h2.right

-- Complaining implies not living with strangers (via ax3, ax2, derived)
theorem complains_implies_not_strangers :
  ∀ x : Person, ComplainsOftenAboutAnnoyingSiblings x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x := by
  intro x hC
  have hSibBorn : SiblingsBornTogether x := ax3 x hC
  have hMB : MultipleBirth x := ax2 x hSibBorn
  exact multipleBirth_implies_not_strangers x hMB

-- Attempt to prove the target statement: ComplainsOftenAboutAnnoyingSiblings Luke.
-- This is not derivable from the given axioms; we can only derive ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke.
-- Hence, we do not assert a theorem stating ComplainsOftenAboutAnnoyingSiblings Luke.
