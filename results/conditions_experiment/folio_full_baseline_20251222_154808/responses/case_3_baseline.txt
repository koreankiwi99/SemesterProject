-- Premises from the text
-- 1) All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom premise1 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ SchedulesWithCustomers x → AppearsInCompanyToday x

-- 2) Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom premise2 : ∀ x : Person, LunchInBuilding x → SchedulesWithCustomers x

-- 3) Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom premise3 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x → LunchInBuilding x ∨ LunchAtHome x

-- 4) If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom premise4 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → RemoteFromHome x

-- 5) All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom premise5 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → RemoteFromHome x

-- 6) No managers work remotely from home.
axiom premise6 : ∀ x : Person, Manager x → ¬ RemoteFromHome x

-- 7) James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom premise7 : AppearsInCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Some derived consequences

-- If James is an employee and has lunch in the company building, then (by 2 and 1) he appears,
-- hence (by 7) he is a manager.
theorem lunch_in_building_employee_implies_manager :
  Employee James → LunchInBuilding James → Manager James := by
  intro hE hL
  have hSched : SchedulesWithCustomers James := premise2 James hL
  have hApp : AppearsInCompanyToday James := premise1 James ⟨hE, hSched⟩
  exact (premise7.mp hApp)

-- If James is both an employee and a manager, then James must have lunch in the company building.
-- Proof: as an employee he lunches in building or at home (3). If at home, then remote (4),
-- contradicting managers are not remote (6). Hence lunch in building.
