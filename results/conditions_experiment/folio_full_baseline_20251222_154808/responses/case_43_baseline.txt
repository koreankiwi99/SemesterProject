-- Premises
-- 1. If someone is ranked highly by the WTA, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis.
axiom A1 : ∀ p : Person, RankedHighlyWTA p → MostActiveMajor p

-- 2. Everyone who lost to Iga Swiatek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the WTA.
axiom A2 : ∀ p : Person, LostToIgaRG2022 p → RankedHighlyWTA p

-- 3. All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Swiatek.
axiom A3 : ∀ p : Person, FemaleRG2022 p → LostToIgaRG2022 p

-- 4. All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
axiom A4 : ∀ p : Person, AtRG2022 p → (FemaleRG2022 p ∨ MaleRG2022 p)

-- 5. All male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
axiom A5 : ∀ p : Person, MaleRG2022 p → LostToNadalRG2022 p

-- 6. If Coco is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
axiom A6 : (RankedHighlyWTA Coco ∨ LostToNadalRG2022 Coco) → ¬ MaleRG2022 Coco

-- 7. Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.
axiom A7 : AtRG2022 Coco

-- A consequence we can prove from the premises:
-- Coco is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
theorem notMale_Coco : ¬ MaleRG2022 Coco := by
  intro hMale
  have hLost : LostToNadalRG2022 Coco := A5 Coco hMale
  have hNotMale : ¬ MaleRG2022 Coco := A6 (Or.inr hLost)
  exact hNotMale hMale

-- Target (for reference): LostToNadalRG2022 Coco
-- From the given premises, this cannot be derived nor can its negation be derived.
