axiom HamdenPlazaStore : Restaurant

-- Premises
-- 1. If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then it has not received many negative reviews.
axiom A1 : ∀ r : Restaurant, Listed r → ¬ ManyNegativeReviews r
-- 2. All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
axiom A2 : ∀ r : Restaurant, RatingGT4 r → Listed r
-- 3. Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
axiom A3 : ∃ r : Restaurant, ¬ ProvidesTakeout r ∧ ManyNegativeReviews r
-- 4. All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
axiom A4 : ∀ r : Restaurant, PopularAmongLocals r → RatingGT4 r
-- 5. The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.
axiom A5 : RatingGT4 HamdenPlazaStore ∨ PopularAmongLocals HamdenPlazaStore

-- Deductions we can make:
theorem hamden_ratingGT4 : RatingGT4 HamdenPlazaStore := by
  cases A5 with
  | inl h => exact h
  | inr hpop => exact A4 HamdenPlazaStore hpop

theorem hamden_listed : Listed HamdenPlazaStore := by
  exact A2 HamdenPlazaStore hamden_ratingGT4

theorem hamden_not_many_negative_reviews : ¬ ManyNegativeReviews HamdenPlazaStore := by
  exact A1 HamdenPlazaStore hamden_listed
