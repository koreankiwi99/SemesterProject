-- Premises from the text

-- "When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox."
-- We model "may" as a separate possibility predicate (not strong enough to derive HasMonkeypox).
axiom PossiblyHasMonkeypox : Being → Prop
axiom may_get_monkeypox : ∀ b : Being, MonkeypoxVirusOccurs b → PossiblyHasMonkeypox b

-- "Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals."
axiom occurs_in_certain_animals : ∃ a : Being, Animal a ∧ MonkeypoxVirusOccurs a
