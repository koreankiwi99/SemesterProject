ANSWER: True...

Lean Code:
axiom Thing : Type
axiom Square : Thing → Prop
axiom FourSided : Thing → Prop
axiom Shape : Thing → Prop

axiom allSquaresAreFourSided : ∀ x : Thing, Square x → FourSided x
axiom allFourSidedAreShapes : ∀ x : Thing, FourSided x → Shape x

theorem allSquaresAreShapes : ∀ x : Thing, Square x → Shape x := by
