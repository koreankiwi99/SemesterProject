We formalize the given facts about Beijing but note that none of them
provide information about its population size ranking among Chinese cities.
Thus, from these axioms, we cannot derive whether Beijing is or is not the
second largest Chinese city.

No information connecting these facts to population size ranking is provided.
Hence, we cannot derive either IsSecondLargestChineseCity Beijing or its negation
from the above axioms.
