-- 2. Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.

-- 3. Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.

-- 4. If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.

-- 7. James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.

-- Some consequences we can prove:

-- If James is an employee and a manager, then he cannot have lunch at home.

  intro hL
  have hR : Remote James := A4 James (And.intro hE hL)
