-- Axioms from the textual context

axiom allRomanceAreIE : ∀ x : Language, Romance x → IndoEuropean x

-- 2) Romance languages are a language family, and all languages within a language family are related to each other.
--    We capture this specifically for the Romance family:
axiom romance_related : ∀ x y : Language, Romance x → Romance y → Related x y

-- 3) French and Spanish are both Romance languages.
axiom french_romance : Romance French
axiom spanish_romance : Romance Spanish

-- 4) German is related to Spanish.
axiom german_related_spanish : Related German Spanish

-- 5) Basque is not related to any other language.
axiom basque_isolate : ∀ x : Language, ¬ Related Basque x ∧ ¬ Related x Basque

-- Some derivable consequences (not solving the target, but showing context is consistent)
theorem spanish_related_french : Related Spanish French := by
  exact romance_related Spanish French spanish_romance french_romance

theorem french_related_spanish : Related French Spanish := by
  exact romance_related French Spanish french_romance spanish_romance

-- We cannot derive Romance German or its negation from the given axioms.
-- Hence, the truth of "German is a Romance language" is not determined by the axioms.
