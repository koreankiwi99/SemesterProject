axiom Listed : Restaurant → Prop
axiom ManyNeg : Restaurant → Prop
axiom RatingGT4 : Restaurant → Prop
axiom Takeout : Restaurant → Prop
axiom Popular : Restaurant → Prop

-- 1. If listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then not many negative reviews.
axiom premise1 : ∀ r : Restaurant, Listed r → ¬ ManyNeg r
-- 2. All restaurants with rating > 4 are listed.
axiom premise2 : ∀ r : Restaurant, RatingGT4 r → Listed r
-- 3. Some restaurants that do not provide take-out receive many negative reviews.
axiom premise3 : ∃ r : Restaurant, ¬ Takeout r ∧ ManyNeg r
-- 4. All restaurants popular among local residents have ratings > 4.
axiom premise4 : ∀ r : Restaurant, Popular r → RatingGT4 r
-- 5. HPS has rating > 4, or it is popular among local residents.
axiom premise5 : RatingGT4 HPS ∨ Popular HPS
