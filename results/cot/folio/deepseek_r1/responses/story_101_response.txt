### Reasoning for Each Question

**Question 1:** The statement is "No one playing for Nautico is Brazilian." The context states that "Ailton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Náutico" (note: "Nautico" in the question is assumed to be a variant spelling of "Náutico" from the context). This directly contradicts the statement, as it confirms that at least one player (Ailton Silva) for Náutico is Brazilian. Therefore, the statement is false.

**Question 2:** The statement is "Ailton Silva does not play for a football club." The context explicitly says "Ailton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Náutico" and "Náutico is a football club." Thus, Ailton Silva does play for a football club (Náutico), making the statement false.

**Question 3:** The statement is "Ailton was not loaned out to a football club." The context states that "Ailton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga" and that "Náutico is a football club along with Braga," confirming Braga is a football club. Therefore, Ailton was loaned out to a football club (Braga), so the statement is false.

**Question 4:** The statement is "Ailton Silva played for Fluminense." The context mentions "Fluminense is a football club" but provides no information about Ailton Silva's association with Fluminense. It only states he plays for Náutico and was loaned to Braga. Since there is no evidence linking him to Fluminense, his involvement with this club is uncertain.

**Question 5:** The statement is "Ailton Silva was loaned out to a football club." The context says "Ailton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga" and identifies "Ailton" as commonly known for Ailton Silva. Additionally, Braga is confirmed as a football club. Thus, Ailton Silva was loaned out to a football club (Braga), making the statement true.
