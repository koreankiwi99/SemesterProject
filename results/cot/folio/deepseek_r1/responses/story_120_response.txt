==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1:
The textual context states that "The Working title 'The Secret Dude Society' was used for Badults" and "Andrew Collins was the script editor for Badults." Since the working title "The Secret Dude Society" is directly associated with Badults, and Andrew Collins was the script editor for Badults, it follows that Andrew Collins was indeed the script editor for a series (Badults) with that working title. There is no ambiguity or missing information here; the context directly supports the statement. Therefore, the statement is True.

### Reasoning for Question 2:
The textual context states that "Badults is a British Sitcom series starring members of Pappy's" and "Badults was piloted in July 2013 on BBC Three." This means that members of Pappy's have starred in at least one show (Badults) that piloted on BBC Three. The statement claims that "no members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three." However, the existence of Badults piloting on BBC Three directly contradicts this, as it provides a specific counterexample where members of Pappy's starred in a show on BBC Three. While the context does not mention BBC Two or any other shows, the "or" in the statement means that the BBC Three part alone is sufficient to falsify the claim. There is no information suggesting that members of Pappy's have not starred in other shows on BBC Two or BBC Three, but the counterexample makes the universal statement false. Therefore, the statement is False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
