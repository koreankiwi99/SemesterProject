### Reasoning for Question 1
The statement is: "Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico."  
- From the context, Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.  
- The Picuris Mountains are described as being in New Mexico or Texas, but the exact location is initially uncertain.  
- However, the Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in the Picuris Mountains and was donated.  
- The context also states: "There are no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines that have been donated."  
- If the Picuris Mountains were in Texas, they would have a donated mine (the Harding Pegmatite Mine), contradicting the given information.  
- Therefore, the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas and must be in New Mexico.  
- Since Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains, which are in New Mexico, it follows that he visited a mountain range in New Mexico.  
- Conclusion: The statement is **True**.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The statement is: "Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in Texas."  
- As established in Question 1, the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico, not Texas, due to the contradiction with the donated mine information.  
- Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains, and there is no mention in the context of him visiting any other mountain range.  
- Therefore, Juan de Onate did not visit a mountain range in Texas.  
- Conclusion: The statement is **False**.

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement is: "The Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico."  
- The Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in the Picuris Mountains.  
- As deduced in Question 1, the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico.  
- Therefore, the mine is located in a mountain range in New Mexico.  
- The statement claims that the mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico, which is incorrect based on the above reasoning.  
- Conclusion: The statement is **False**.
