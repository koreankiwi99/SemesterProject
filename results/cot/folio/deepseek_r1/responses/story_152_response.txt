Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The context states: "Susan flies to LGA airport." This means that for Susan's flight, LGA is the arrival airport. The general rule provided is: "The departure and arrival cannot be at the same airport." Therefore, for Susan's flight, since she arrives at LGA, she must have departed from a different airport. The statement in question 1 is "Susan flies from LGA airport," which would mean LGA is her departure airport. However, based on the information, Susan is arriving at LGA, so she cannot be departing from LGA for the same flight. There is no information about multiple flights involving Susan, so we consider only the given flight. Thus, the statement is false.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The context states: "John flies from LGA airport." This means that for John's flight, LGA is the departure airport. The general rule states: "The departure and arrival cannot be at the same airport." Therefore, for John's flight, since he departs from LGA, he must arrive at a different airport. The statement in question 2 is "John flies to LGA airport," which would mean LGA is his arrival airport. However, based on the information, John is departing from LGA, so he cannot arrive at LGA for the same flight. There is no information about multiple flights involving John, so we consider only the given flight. Thus, the statement is false.
