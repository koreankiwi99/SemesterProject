Story ID: 166
Premises: Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.

Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The statement is: "Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden."  
- Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building only if two conditions are met: (1) he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and (2) the security deposit is no more than $1500.  
- The Olive Garden is a managed building with a monthly rent of $2000.  
- The security deposit at a managed building can be equal to the monthly rent or more, so at The Olive Garden, it must be at least $2000 (since the rent is $2000).  
- $2000 is more than $1500, so the security deposit at The Olive Garden is definitely more than $1500. Therefore, condition (2) is not satisfied.  
- Since condition (2) is false, Tom will not rent at The Olive Garden, regardless of whether he is allowed to move in with Fluffy (which is unknown but irrelevant here).  
- Thus, the statement is **False**.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The statement is: "Tom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy."  
- Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy (a cat, which is a pet) only if The Olive Garden allows pets.  
- The context states that pets are allowed in some managed buildings, but it does not specify whether The Olive Garden allows pets.  
- The rule "If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet" confirms that pet allowance depends on the building's policy, but no information is given about The Olive Garden's pet policy.  
- Therefore, it is unknown whether pets are allowed at The Olive Garden, and thus unknown whether Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy.  
- Thus, the statement is **Unknown**.

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement is: "The security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more."  
- The context states that for any managed building, the security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent or more.  
- The Olive Garden is a managed building with a monthly rent of $2000.  
- Therefore, the security deposit at The Olive Garden must be equal to $2000 or more than $2000.  
- This directly matches the statement "either $2000 or more."  
- Thus, the statement is **True**.
