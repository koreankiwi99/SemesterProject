Premises: If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z
Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.

### Reasoning for Question 1:  
The statement is: "Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class."  
- From the context, Michael is taller than everyone else in his class.  
- Peter is taller than Michael.  
- By the transitivity rule (if x is taller than y and y is taller than z, then x is taller than z), Peter is taller than everyone in Michael's class.  
- Therefore, there is no man in Michael's class who is taller than Peter; Peter is taller than all of them.  
- The statement claims Peter is shorter than some man in the class, which is impossible based on the information.  
- Conclusion: The statement is **False**.  

### Reasoning for Question 2:  
The statement is: "Windy is a great shooter."  
- Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.  
- Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.  
- Therefore, if Michael cannot block Windy's shooting, Windy must be jumping when shooting (contrapositive of the blocking condition).  
- The context states that every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.  
- Since Windy is shooting (implied by "Windy's shooting"), Windy is a shooter, and jumping when shooting makes Windy a great shooter.  
- There is no information suggesting uncertainty about Windy being a shooter or jumping.  
- Conclusion: The statement is **True**.  

### Reasoning for Question 3:  
The statement is: "Peter can block Windy's shooting."  
- Peter is taller than Michael, and the general rule states that if one man is taller than another, the taller can block the shorter man's shooting. However, this rule only applies between men, and Windy's gender is not specified.  
- Windy jumps when shooting (inferred from Question 2), and Michael cannot block Windy's shooting due to jumping.  
- For Peter to block Windy's shooting:  
  - Windy must be a man (for the height-based blocking rule to apply), but this is unknown.  
  - Peter must be taller than Windy, but Windy's height relative to Peter is unknown (Peter is taller than Michael, but Michael's height relative to Windy is not given).  
  - Even if Peter is taller, jumping might prevent blocking, but the context only specifies that jumping affects Michael's blocking ability; it does not generalize to others like Peter.  
- Without information on Windy's height, gender, or whether jumping negates blocking for taller blockers like Peter, it is impossible to determine if Peter can block Windy's shooting.  
- Conclusion: The statement is **Unknown**.  

ANSWERS:  
1: False  
2: True  
3: Unknown
