==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The statement is: "Karen will share 'Stranger Things' with Lisa."

- From the context: "Stranger Things" is a popular Netflix show.
- It is given that if a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it. Therefore, since "Stranger Things" is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.
- It is also given that if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa. Therefore, since Karen binge-watches "Stranger Things", she will share it with Lisa.
- Thus, the statement is True.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The statement is: "'Black Mirror' is popular."

- From the context: Karen does not download "Black Mirror" and "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show.
- It is given that if and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it. This means that not downloading implies not binge-watching. Therefore, since Karen does not download "Black Mirror", she does not binge-watch it.
- It is also given that if a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it. By contrapositive, if Karen does not binge-watch a Netflix show, then it is not popular. Therefore, since Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror", it is not popular.
- Thus, the statement is False.

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement is: "Karen will share 'Black Mirror' with Lisa."

- From the context: Karen does not download "Black Mirror" and "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show.
- As established in Question 2, Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror" because she does not download it (based on the "if and only if" relationship).
- It is given that if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa. However, this is a conditional statement (binge-watching implies sharing), but it does not state that sharing only occurs if she binge-watches. Without binge-watching, there is no information indicating that Karen will share "Black Mirror" with Lisa. It is possible that sharing could occur for other reasons, but the context does not provide any such information.
- Therefore, it cannot be determined whether Karen will share "Black Mirror" with Lisa, making the statement Unknown.
