Story ID: 191
Premises: A natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.
If the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.
Machine translation is a natural language processing task.
The output of machine translation is a text sequence.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1:
The textual context states:
- A natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.
- If the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.
- Machine translation is a natural language processing task.
- The output of machine translation is a text sequence.

Given that machine translation has an output that is a text sequence, and the context specifies that any natural language processing task with a text sequence output is a language generation task, it directly follows that machine translation is a language generation task. There is no contradictory information, and the categorization is clear based on the given conditions. Therefore, the statement "Machine translation is a language generation task" is true.

### Reasoning for Question 2:
The textual context categorizes natural language processing tasks as either language generation or language understanding, implying mutual exclusivity (i.e., a task cannot be both). From Question 1, machine translation is established as a language generation task because its output is a text sequence. Since the context provides no information suggesting that machine translation could also be a language understanding task (and it defines tasks based on output type, with no conditions given for understanding tasks), it cannot be categorized as a language understanding task. The context does not define what constitutes a language understanding task, but given the mutual exclusivity and the clear assignment to generation based on output, the statement "Machine translation is a language understanding task" must be false.

1: True
