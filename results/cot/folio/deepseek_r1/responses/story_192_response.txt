Story ID: 192
Premises: International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
Mike is an international student.
Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1:
The context states that international students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa. It also specifies that an international student with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT to work in the US. The given information about Mike states that he is an international student and that he needs to apply for CPT to work in the US. Since the requirement for CPT or OPT is explicitly associated only with F1 visa holders in the context, and there is no mention of J1 visa holders requiring CPT or OPT, it follows that Mike must have an F1 visa to have this requirement. Therefore, the statement "Mike has an F1 visa" is true.

### Reasoning for Question 2:
As established, Mike must have an F1 visa based on the requirement to apply for CPT to work. The context indicates that international students have either an F1 or J1 visa, but not both. Therefore, since Mike has an F1 visa, he cannot have a J1 visa. No information suggests that J1 visa holders might need CPT or that Mike could be an exception. Thus, the statement "Mike has a J1 visa" is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
