==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1:
The statement is: "ETS provides financial aid to Tom."  
- The context states that ETS provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.  
- It also states that those living in single-parent families or having few resources can prove economic hardship.  
- Tom lives in a single-parent family and has few resources available (as his dad is out of work).  
- Tom is applying to take the GRE test.  
- Since Tom meets the criteria for proving economic hardship, and ETS provides aid to such applicants, it follows that ETS provides financial aid to Tom. There is no information suggesting Tom would not apply for aid or be denied, so the statement is true based on the given context.

### Reasoning for Question 2:
The statement is: "It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test."  
- The context explicitly states: "It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300."  
- $205 is less than $300, so the cost is below US $300.  
- This is directly stated and unambiguous, so the statement is true.

### Reasoning for Question 3:
The statement is: "No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something."  
- The context states that ETS provides financial aid to some GRE applicants (specifically, those who prove economic hardship).  
- This means there are people taking the GRE who receive financial aid from ETS (an entity, which can be referred to as "something").  
- Therefore, the claim that "no one" has financial aid provided by "something" is false, as ETS provides aid to qualified applicants.  
- The word "something" is broad but includes ETS based on the context, so there is no uncertainty here.
