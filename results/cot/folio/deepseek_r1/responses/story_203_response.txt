A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1:  
The context states that "Vacuums suck" and "Space is a vacuum." Since space is explicitly identified as a vacuum, and vacuums have the property of sucking, it directly follows that space sucks. Therefore, the statement "Space sucks" is true based on the given information.

### Reasoning for Question 2:  
The context states that "Vampires suck," but it does not link vampires to space in any way. Space is described as a vacuum, not as a vampire. While vampires suck, this does not imply that everything that sucks (like plungers or vacuums) is a vampire. Thus, there is no evidence supporting that space is a vampire, and the statement "Space is a vampire" is false based on the information.

### Reasoning for Question 3:  
The context states that "A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck." This provides a direct counterexample to the universal claim that "if something is a household appliance, it sucks." Since the duster is a household appliance that does not suck, the conditional statement is false. Other household appliances like plungers or vacuums may suck, but the existence of at least one exception (the duster) makes the general rule invalid.
