Story ID: 20
Premises: A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.
All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The textual context states: "If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list." It also explicitly states: "The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies." Therefore, by logical deduction, The Legend of Zelda must be included in the Top 10 list. There is no contradictory information, and the context confirms that The Legend of Zelda is made by a Japanese company, which aligns with the condition that all games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese companies. Thus, the statement "The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list" is true.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The textual context provides information only about The Legend of Zelda and general rules regarding the Top 10 list and game sales. It does not mention FIFA 22 at all. While the context states that "All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies," this only applies to games on the list. There is no information about whether FIFA 22 is on the Top 10 list, its sales figures, or its developer. Therefore, it is impossible to determine from the given information whether FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese video game company. The statement is uncertain, and the answer is unknown.

### Reasoning for Question 3
As established in Question 1, the context confirms that The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies and must therefore be included in the Top 10 list. This directly contradicts the statement "The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list." Since the context provides sufficient evidence to conclude that the game is on the list, this statement is false.
