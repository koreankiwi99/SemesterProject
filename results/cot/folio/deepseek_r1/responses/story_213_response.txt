==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1: Basque is a Romance language.
- The context states: "Basque is not related to any other language."
- Romance languages are defined as a language family, and "all languages within a language family are related to each other."
- Therefore, if Basque is not related to any other language, it cannot be part of the Romance language family.
- This means the statement "Basque is a Romance language" must be false.

### Reasoning for Question 2: German is a Romance language.
- The context states: "German is related to Spanish" and "Spanish is a Romance language."
- However, Romance languages are a specific language family (e.g., descendants of Latin), and the context does not indicate that German is part of this family.
- Being related to a Romance language (like Spanish) does not imply membership in the Romance family; it could indicate a broader relationship (e.g., both being Indo-European, but German belonging to the Germanic branch).
- Since German is only stated to be related to Spanish, not that it is a Romance language, and Romance languages are a distinct family, the statement "German is a Romance language" must be false.

### Reasoning for Question 3: French is an Indo-European language.
- The context states: "All Romance languages are Indo-European languages" and "French and Spanish are both Romance languages."
- Therefore, since French is a Romance language, it must be an Indo-European language.
- This directly follows from the given information, so the statement "French is an Indo-European language" must be true.
