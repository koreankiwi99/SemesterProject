If George has access to a program, he can compose.
If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The textual context provides three statements:
1. If George likes music, he wants to compose.
2. If George has access to a program, he can compose.
3. If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.

The question asks: "If George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose."

- If George likes music, then from statement 1, he wants to compose.
- If George has access to a program, then from statement 2, he can compose.
- Since he wants to compose (from step 1) and can compose (from step 2), both conditions of statement 3 are satisfied. Therefore, he will compose.

This conclusion follows directly from the given context without any gaps or uncertainties. There is no information suggesting exceptions or other factors that could prevent composing under these conditions. Thus, the statement is true.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The question asks: "If George will not compose, George cannot compose." This can be rephrased as: "If George does not compose, then George cannot compose."

From the context, statement 3 states: "If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose." The contrapositive of this is: "If George does not compose, then it is not the case that he both can compose and wants to compose." This means: ¬(will compose) → ¬(can compose ∧ wants to compose), which is equivalent to: ¬(will compose) → ¬can compose ∨ ¬wants to compose.

In other words, if George does not compose, it could be because he cannot compose, or because he does not want to compose, or both. The statement in question 2 claims that if he does not compose, he cannot compose, but this is not necessarily true. For example:
- Consider a scenario where George does not like music (so he may not want to compose, as statement 1 only guarantees that liking music implies wanting to compose, but not vice versa). Suppose he has access to a program (so he can compose, per statement 2), but he does not want to compose. Then, he does not compose because he lacks the desire, not the ability. In this case, he does not compose, but he can compose, making the statement false.

The context does not provide any information that forces "does not compose" to imply "cannot compose" exclusively. Since a counterexample exists where the statement is false, and the context does not universally support the implication, the statement is false, not merely uncertain.

1: True
