==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The statement is: "Beijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics."

- The context explicitly states: "Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2008 Summer Paralympics Games." This confirms that Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics.
- The context also states: "Beijing has hosted the Summer and Winter Olympics and the Summer and Winter Paralympics." This confirms that Beijing has hosted the Winter Olympics at some point, though it does not specify the year.
- The statement does not require the Winter Olympics to have occurred in 2008; it simply asserts that Beijing has hosted both events (the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics in general). Since the context supports both facts, the statement is true.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The statement is: "Beijing is located in southern China."

- The context explicitly states: "Beijing is located in Northern China." This directly contradicts the statement, which claims Beijing is in southern China.
- There is no ambiguity or additional information suggesting Beijing could be in southern China. Therefore, the statement is false.

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement is: "Beijing is the second largest Chinese city."

- The context mentions that Beijing is the capital of China and part of "the world's most populous nation" (China), but it provides no information about Beijing's population size relative to other Chinese cities (e.g., Shanghai, Guangzhou).
- The context discusses universities and hosted events, but these do not indicate city size or ranking. Without any data on population or comparative size, it is impossible to determine if Beijing is the second largest city. Therefore, the statement is unknown.
