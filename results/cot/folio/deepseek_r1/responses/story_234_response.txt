==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1:
The textual context states that "Yale University is a private Ivy League research university" and that "Yale University moved to New Haven in 1716." Therefore, Yale University, which is explicitly described as a private Ivy League research university, did move to New Haven. The statement "A private Ivy League research university moved to New Haven" is true because at least one such university (Yale) satisfies this description based on the given information. There is no indication in the context that this refers to multiple universities or that it is false, so the statement is confirmed as true.

### Reasoning for Question 2:
The textual context states that "Yale university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion." However, the context provides no information about the endowments of other educational institutions or any comparison to establish that Yale's endowment is the largest. The statement "Yale University has the largest university endowment of any educational institution" cannot be verified as true or false based solely on the given context, as it lacks comparative data. Therefore, the truth value is unknown.

### Reasoning for Question 3:
The textual context includes a list of residential colleges at Yale, explicitly naming "Pierson College" among them. Therefore, the statement "Pierson College is a residential college at Yale" is directly supported by the information provided and is true. There is no ambiguity or conflicting information in the context.
