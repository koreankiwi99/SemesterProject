### Reasoning for Question 1

The textual context provides two statements:
1. "All cats are mammals." This means that every cat is a mammal, so cats are a subset of mammals.
2. "Some pets are not mammals." This means there exists at least one pet that is not a mammal. It does not imply that all pets are non-mammals; it only confirms that not all pets are mammals. Therefore, there could be pets that are mammals, or all pets could be non-mammals (though the latter is not explicitly stated).

The question asks whether the statement "No pets are cats" is true, false, or uncertain based on this context. "No pets are cats" means that there is no overlap between pets and cats; no pet is a cat.

- If all pets were non-mammals, then since cats are mammals, no pet could be a cat. In this case, "No pets are cats" would be true.
- However, it is possible that some pets are mammals (as "some pets are not mammals" does not preclude this), and among those mammalian pets, some could be cats. For example, a pet cat exists in reality, and the context does not contradict this. In this case, "No pets are cats" would be false.

The context does not provide any information about whether cats can be pets or not. It only discusses the relationship between cats and mammals, and between pets and mammals. Therefore, it is possible for "No pets are cats" to be true (if no cats are pets) or false (if some cats are pets). Since both scenarios are consistent with the given information, the truth value of the statement cannot be determined definitively.

Thus, based on the context, the statement "No pets are cats" is uncertain.
