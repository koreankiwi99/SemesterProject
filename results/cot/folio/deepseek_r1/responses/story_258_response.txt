Premises: All humans are mortal.
All Greeks are humans.

Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1

The textual context provides two statements:
1. "All humans are mortal." This means that if something is a human, it must be mortal.
2. "All Greeks are humans." This means that Greeks are a subset of humans, so if something is Greek, it must be human.

From these, we can infer that all Greeks are mortal through logical transitivity: since all Greeks are humans and all humans are mortal, all Greeks must be mortal.

The question asks whether "Some Greeks are mortal" is true, false, or uncertain. While "all Greeks are mortal" implies "some Greeks are mortal" if Greeks exist, the context does not provide any information about whether Greeks actually exist. 

- If Greeks exist, then "some Greeks are mortal" is true because all Greeks are mortal.
- If Greeks do not exist (i.e., there are no Greeks), then "some Greeks are mortal" is false because there are no Greeks to be mortal.

Since the context does not confirm or deny the existence of Greeks, the truth value of "some Greeks are mortal" cannot be determined solely from the given information. Therefore, it is uncertain.

Thus, the answer is "Unknown."
