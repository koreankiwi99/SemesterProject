==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1

The textual context states:
- "Events are either happy or sad." This means that every event must be classified as either happy or sad; there are no other possibilities.
- "At least one event is happy." This confirms that there exists at least one event that is happy.

The question asks whether the statement "All events are sad" is true, false, or uncertain based on this information.

- The statement "All events are sad" asserts that every event is sad, implying no happy events exist.
- However, the context explicitly states that at least one event is happy. Therefore, it is impossible for all events to be sad because there is at least one counterexample (a happy event).
- This means the statement is directly contradicted by the given information, making it false.
- There is no uncertainty here because the context provides sufficient information to conclude that the statement cannot be true. The context does not specify the total number of events, but since at least one is happy, "all are sad" is falsified regardless of the total count.

Thus, the statement is false.

1: False
