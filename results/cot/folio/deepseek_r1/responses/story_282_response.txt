All four-sided things are shapes. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning Step-by-Step

The textual context provides two statements:
1. "All squares are four-sided." This means that every square has four sides; squares are a subset of four-sided things.
2. "All four-sided things are shapes." This means that anything with four sides is a shape; four-sided things are a subset of shapes.

The question asks whether the statement "All squares are shapes" is true, false, or uncertain based solely on this information.

- From the first statement, if something is a square, it must be four-sided.
- From the second statement, if something is four-sided, it must be a shape.
- Therefore, by transitivity, if something is a square, it must be a shape. This is a valid logical syllogism (e.g., if A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C).

There is no information suggesting that some squares might not be shapes or that there are exceptions. The context is clear and complete for this deduction.

Thus, the statement "All squares are shapes" is necessarily true based on the given context.
