Premises: A hawk never swims. 
Some birds are hawks.

Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1

The textual context provides two pieces of information:
1. "A hawk never swims." This means that hawks do not swim; if something is a hawk, it is not a swimmer.
2. "Some birds are hawks." This means that there exists at least one bird that is a hawk.

The statement in question is: "All birds swim." This is a universal claim that every bird must swim.

- From the context, since some birds are hawks (e.g., there is at least one bird that is a hawk), and hawks never swim, it follows that there exists at least one bird (the hawk) that does not swim.
- Therefore, the statement "All birds swim" cannot be true because we have a counterexample: hawks are birds that do not swim.
- This conclusion does not depend on whether other birds swim or not; the existence of one non-swimming bird (a hawk) is sufficient to falsify the universal claim.
- There is no uncertainty here because the context directly provides evidence against the statement. Even though "some birds are hawks" implies that there may be other birds that are not hawks (and could potentially swim), the presence of hawks as non-swimming birds means "All birds swim" is definitively false.

Thus, based on the given information, the statement "All birds swim" is false.
