==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The statement to evaluate is: "If the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out service."  
- From the context, we know that for Hamden Plaza: it has a rating greater than four or it is popular among local residents (given).  
- Also, all restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations, and if listed, they have not received many negative reviews (from context points 2 and 1). Thus, rating > 4 → not many negative reviews.  
- Similarly, all popular restaurants have ratings greater than four (from context point 4), so popular → rating > 4 → not many negative reviews.  
- Therefore, for Hamden Plaza, since it must have either rating > 4 or be popular, it cannot receive many negative reviews. That is, "receives many negative reviews" (N) is false for Hamden Plaza.  
- The premise of the implication is "provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews" (T ∧ N). Since N is false, T ∧ N is false.  
- An implication "If A then B" is true whenever A is false, regardless of B. Here, A (T ∧ N) is false, so the entire implication is true.  
- Thus, the statement is true.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The statement to evaluate is: "The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service or does not receive many negative reviews." (T ∨ ¬N)  
- As established in Question 1, Hamden Plaza does not receive many negative reviews (¬N is true).  
- Therefore, T ∨ ¬N is true because ¬N is true (even if T is unknown).  
- Thus, the statement is true.

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement to evaluate is: "The Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service." (¬T)  
- The context provides no information about whether Hamden Plaza provides take-out service or not.  
- Context point 3 states that some restaurants without take-out receive many negative reviews, but Hamden Plaza does not receive many negative reviews (as established). This does not constrain take-out service for Hamden Plaza.  
- Hamden Plaza could provide take-out service or not; there is no link in the context to determine this.  
- Therefore, it is unknown whether Hamden Plaza does not provide take-out service.

1: True
