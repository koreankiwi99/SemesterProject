Story ID: 315
Premises: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. 
If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.

Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1: Is John's car a Tesla Model 3?
- The textual context provides information about Tesla Model 3, one-seaters, single-seat electric cars, and Solo EV cars, but there is no direct information about John's car.
- Statement 5 ("If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car") is logically analyzed as follows:
  - Let P be "John's car is a Tesla Model 3" and Q be "John's car is a single-seat electric car".
  - The statement is: If ¬P, then (¬P ∨ ¬Q).
  - If ¬P is true, then ¬P ∨ ¬Q is true (since ¬P is true), so the implication holds.
  - If ¬P is false (i.e., P is true), the implication is vacuously true because the antecedent is false.
  - Thus, this statement is a tautology and provides no new information about John's car.
- Since no other statements mention John's car, there is insufficient information to determine if John's car is a Tesla Model 3. It could be true or false, but it is not specified.
- Therefore, the statement "John's car is a Tesla Model 3" is **Unknown**.

### Reasoning for Question 2: Is John's car a Solo EV?
- From the context:
  - All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars (Statement 4).
  - All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters (Statement 3).
  - However, there is no information linking John's car to Solo EV cars or any other specific type.
- Statement 5, as established, is a tautology and does not provide information about John's car being a Solo EV.
- John's car could be a Solo EV, a Tesla Model 3 (which is not a one-seater and thus not a single-seat electric car), or something else entirely (e.g., a car not mentioned in the context).
- Without any information about John's car, it is impossible to determine if it is a Solo EV.
- Therefore, the statement "John's car is a Solo EV" is **Unknown**.

### Reasoning for Question 3: Is John's car not a Solo EV?
- This question is the negation of Question 2 ("John's car is a Solo EV").
- Since the status of John's car being a Solo EV is unknown (as reasoned in Question 2), its negation is also unknown.
- There is no evidence in the context to confirm or deny that John's car is not a Solo EV. It could be true (if John's car is something else) or false (if it is a Solo EV), but there is no basis to decide.
- Therefore, the statement "John's car is not a Solo EV" is **Unknown**.
