Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The statement is: "Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm."

From the context:
- "Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV." This indicates that at least one show airs at that time, but it does not specify which shows air then or imply that all shows air at that time.
- "Breaking Bad is a show" and "Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show" are given, but there is no information about when Breaking Bad airs.
- The context does not link Breaking Bad to Monday at 8 pm in any way, nor does it rule out the possibility that Breaking Bad could air at that time (e.g., on a different channel or in a different context).
- Therefore, based on the given information, it is uncertain whether Breaking Bad airs on Monday at 8 pm.

Answer: Unknown

### Reasoning for Question 2
The statement is: "Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm."

From the context:
- "If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor." This means any show that gives out roses must be The Bachelor.
- "The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people" and "All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows," so The Bachelor is a reality TV show.
- "Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show," so Breaking Bad cannot be The Bachelor.
- Since Breaking Bad cannot be The Bachelor, it cannot give out roses at all (because if it did, it would be The Bachelor, which contradicts the information).
- Therefore, the specific claim that roses are given out during Breaking Bad on Monday at 8 pm is false.

Answer: False

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement is: "If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm."

From the context:
- As established in Question 2, Breaking Bad cannot give out roses because it would require it to be The Bachelor, but Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, while The Bachelor is.
- Therefore, the antecedent "roses are given out during Breaking Bad" is always false based on the given information.
- In logic, a conditional statement "If P, then Q" is true whenever P is false, regardless of Q. This is known as vacuous truth.
- Even though the context mentions that "some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses," it does not restrict rose-giving to only that time slot (e.g., The Bachelor could air at other times). However, since the antecedent cannot be true, the implication holds vacuously.
- Thus, the statement is true based on the information provided.

Answer: True
