### Reasoning Step-by-Step

I will analyze each question based on the given textual context:

- **No baked sweets are spicy.** (Baked sweets and spicy are mutually exclusive.)
- **All cupcakes are baked sweets.** (Cupcakes are a subset of baked sweets.)
- **All mala hotpots are spicy.** (Mala hotpots imply spicy and are not baked sweets, as baked sweets cannot be spicy.)
- **All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.** (Products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes, hence baked sweets, and not spicy.)
- **Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets.** (This is a disjunction: at least one of these must be true for Dried Thai chilies.)

Now, I will address each question individually:

#### Question 1: Dried Thai chilies are products of Baked by Melissa.
- Products of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes (from context), which are baked sweets and not spicy.
- If Dried Thai chilies were products of Baked by Melissa, they would be baked sweets and not spicy.
- However, the disjunction states that Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets.
  - If they are baked sweets (as assumed), then "not baked sweets" is false.
  - Since baked sweets cannot be spicy, "spicy" is false.
  - Mala hotpots are spicy, so if they are not spicy, they cannot be mala hotpots; thus "mala hotpots" is false.
- All parts of the disjunction would be false, contradicting the given context.
- Therefore, Dried Thai chilies cannot be products of Baked by Melissa. The statement is **False**.

#### Question 2: Dried Thai chilies are not products of Baked by Melissa.
- From Question 1, we deduced that Dried Thai chilies cannot be products of Baked by Melissa due to a contradiction with the disjunction.
- Thus, it must be true that they are not products of Baked by Melissa.
- Therefore, the statement is **True**.

#### Question 3: Dried Thai chilies are a mala hotpot.
- The disjunction states that Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets.
- They could be mala hotpots (which would satisfy the disjunction), but they do not have to be.
- For example:
  - They could be spicy but not mala hotpots (e.g., another spicy item).
  - They could be not baked sweets without being spicy or mala hotpots.
- There is no information forcing them to be mala hotpots specifically.
- Therefore, it is uncertain whether they are a mala hotpot. The statement is **Unknown**.

#### Question 4: Dried Thai chilies are neither products of Baked by Melissa nor baked sweets.
- "Neither products of Baked by Melissa nor baked sweets" means not products and not baked sweets.
- From Question 2, we know Dried Thai chilies are not products of Baked by Melissa.
- Now, consider if they are baked sweets:
  - If they are baked sweets, they cannot be spicy (from context).
  - Then, in the disjunction:
    - "Spicy" is false.
    - "Mala hotpots" is false (since mala hotpots are spicy and they are not spicy).
    - "Not baked sweets" is false (since they are baked sweets).
  - This contradicts the disjunction, so they cannot be baked sweets.
- Thus, Dried Thai chilies are not baked sweets and not products of Baked by Melissa.
- Therefore, the statement is **True**.

#### Question 5: Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes and products of Baked by Melissa.
- Products of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes, so this statement implies they are products of Baked by Melissa.
- From Question 1, we know Dried Thai chilies cannot be products of Baked by Melissa.
- Additionally, if they were cupcakes, they would be baked sweets, but we know from Question 4 that they are not baked sweets.
- Thus, the statement is impossible. It is **False**.
