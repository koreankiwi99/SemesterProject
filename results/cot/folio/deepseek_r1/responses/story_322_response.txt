Premises: All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
Some stocks are growth stocks.
All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
KO is a mature stock.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The textual context states: "KO is a mature stock." Since "mature stock" implies a category of stocks, KO being a mature stock directly means KO is a stock. There is no information suggesting KO is not a stock. Therefore, the statement "KO is a stock" is true.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The textual context states: "KO is a mature stock" and "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund." Additionally, "All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation" and "If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund" (interpreted as "if a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund"). Since KO is suitable for a retirement fund (as a mature stock), it cannot be bought for rapid price appreciation and thus cannot be a growth stock. Therefore, while KO is a stock (from Question 1), it is not a growth stock. The statement "KO is a stock and a growth stock" is false because the second part is false.

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement is: "If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile." From the context, KO is a mature stock, not a growth stock, and not bought for rapid price appreciation (as established in Question 2). Thus, the antecedent ("KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation") is false. In logic, a conditional statement is true whenever the antecedent is false, regardless of the consequent. The consequent ("KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile") includes "neither a stock," which is false (as KO is a stock), and "nor is its price volatile," which is unknown (as volatility is not mentioned in the context). However, since the antecedent is false, the entire conditional is true. Therefore, the statement is true.
