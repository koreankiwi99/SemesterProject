Story ID: 330
Premises: All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.

### Reasoning for Each Question

The textual context provides general rules and specific implications about John, but no direct facts about John's situation. I will reason through each question step by step using the given information.

#### Context Summary:
- **General rules (for all people):**
  1. All people who make wedding plans are engaged: MakePlans → Engaged
  2. All people who invite others to their ceremony make wedding plans: InviteOthers → MakePlans
  3. Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to their ceremony: WellAttended → InviteOthers
  4. Some people with well-attended weddings have larger families: ∃x (WellAttended(x) ∧ LargerFamily(x)) — this is existential and does not specify John.
- **Specific implications about John (only apply to John):**
  5. If John is engaged, then John does not both invite friends and make wedding plans: Engaged → ¬(InviteFriends ∧ MakePlans)
  6. If John has a larger family, then John either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends: LargerFamily → (WellAttended ∨ InviteFriends)

Note: "Invite others" and "invite friends" are treated as distinct predicates since the context uses different terms without defining a relationship between them. "Invite others" refers to inviting people in general, while "invite friends" may be a subset or separate action.

#### Analysis for John:
We have no direct information about John's attributes (e.g., engaged, has larger family, invites others/ friends, makes plans, has well-attended wedding). The general rules and specific implications for John are conditional, so we can only deduce possibilities, not certainties:
- From rules 1, 2, and 3, we derive: WellAttended → InviteOthers → MakePlans → Engaged. But this chain only applies if we know WellAttended, InviteOthers, or MakePlans for John, which we do not.
- Rule 4 is existential and does not involve John; it only states that some people have both properties, but not that John does.
- Rule 5 (for John) imposes a condition if John is engaged, but we don't know if he is engaged. Similarly, rule 6 imposes a condition if John has a larger family, but we don't know if he has one.
- Since no facts are given about John, all attributes (engaged, larger family, invites others, etc.) could be true or false without contradiction.

Now, addressing each question:

**Question 1: John has a larger family?**
- This asks if LargerFamily(John) is true.
- From rule 6, if LargerFamily is true, then WellAttended or InviteFriends must be true. But this is only a conditional; it does not mean LargerFamily must be true for John.
- From rule 4, some people have larger families with well-attended weddings, but this does not apply to John specifically.
- John could have a larger family (e.g., if WellAttended or InviteFriends is true) or not (e.g., if neither is true or other scenarios).
- No rules force LargerFamily to be true or false for John. Thus, it is **Unknown**.

**Question 2: John does not have a larger family?**
- This asks if ¬LargerFamily(John) is true.
- From the reasoning for Question 1, LargerFamily could be false (e.g., if WellAttended and InviteFriends are both false, making the implication in rule 6 vacuously true). However, it could also be true (as per rule 6).
- Since LargerFamily is not determined, its negation is also not determined. If we don't know if John has a larger family, we also don't know if he does not have one.
- Thus, it is **Unknown**.

**Question 3: John is engaged?**
- This asks if Engaged(John) is true.
- From rules 1-3, Engaged could be true only if John makes wedding plans or has related attributes like inviting others or having a well-attended wedding—but we don't know if any of these apply.
- Rule 5 gives a condition if Engaged is true, but it doesn't provide information on whether Engaged is true or false.
- Engaged could be true (e.g., if John makes plans) or false (e.g., if he doesn't make plans and isn't affected by the chain).
- No rule forces Engaged to be true or false. Thus, it is **Unknown**.

**Question 4: John neither has a larger family nor invites others to his wedding?**
- This asks if ¬LargerFamily ∧ ¬InviteOthers is true for John.
- ¬LargerFamily and ¬InviteOthers could both be true. For example, John could have a smaller family and not invite anyone, and this doesn't violate any rules:
  - Rule 6: If LargerFamily false, the implication is vacuously true regardless of WellAttended or InviteFriends.
  - Rules 1-3: No issue if InviteOthers is false, as this doesn't force MakePlans or Engaged (though if MakePlans were true, it could lead to contradictions, but we have no such fact).
- However, both could be false: John could have a larger family or invite others, independently.
- The specific attributes for John are not constrained to make this conjunction true or false consistently.
- Since we don't know John's status for larger family or inviting others, the conjunction is **Unknown**.

In all cases, the information is insufficient to determine truth or falsehood for John's attributes.
