Premises: Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.
Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player.
All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities.
All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes.
If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid.

Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1: Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.
- Djokovic is at the mixer, so he must be either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor (from "Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor").
- There is no information specifying which category Djokovic belongs to. He could be a Grand Slam champion, or he could be an Oscar-nominated actor.
- The additional statement about Djokovic ("if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid") does not provide evidence about whether he is a Grand Slam champion or not. It only adds a conditional about his status if he is an athlete, which relates to the Grand Slam champion path, but it does not confirm or deny his membership in that category.
- Therefore, it is uncertain whether Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.

### Reasoning for Question 2: Djokovic lives in a tax haven.
- To determine if Djokovic lives in a tax haven, note that "All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens." Thus, if Djokovic is well paid, he lives in a tax haven.
- Djokovic is at the mixer, so he is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.
- **Case 1: Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor.**
  - All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities (from context).
  - If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid (from context).
  - Therefore, Djokovic would be well paid.
- **Case 2: Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.**
  - Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player (from context).
  - All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes (from context).
  - If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous (from context).
  - Thus, Djokovic would be a famous athlete.
  - The specific statement about Djokovic says: "if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid." Since he is a famous athlete in this case, he must be well paid.
- In both cases, Djokovic is well paid:
  - As an Oscar-nominated actor, he is well paid directly.
  - As a Grand Slam champion, he is well paid due to the specific conditional statement about him.
- Since Djokovic is well paid in all scenarios, and all well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens, Djokovic lives in a tax haven.
- Therefore, the statement is true.

### Reasoning for Question 3: Djokovic does not live in a tax haven.
- From Question 2, it has been established that Djokovic lives in a tax haven (as reasoned above).
- The statement "Djokovic does not live in a tax haven" directly contradicts this conclusion.
- There is no uncertainty or alternative scenario where Djokovic does not live in a tax haven, as his being well paid (and thus living in a tax haven) is certain based on the context.
- Therefore, the statement is false.
