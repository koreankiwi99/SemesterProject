Story ID: 343
Premises: No digital media are analog.
Every printed text is analog media.
All streaming services are digital media.
If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.
If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.

### Reasoning for Question 1: Is "1984 is printed text" true, false, or uncertain?
- The context states: "If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text." (Statement 4)
- It also states: "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book." (Statement 5)
- Therefore, if 1984 were a streaming service, it would imply that 1984 is a hardcover book and thus printed text. However, as will be shown in the reasoning for Question 2, 1984 cannot be a streaming service due to a logical contradiction.
- Since 1984 is not a streaming service (as established in Question 2), the chain of implications (streaming service → hardcover book → printed text) does not apply.
- There is no other information in the context that directly indicates whether 1984 is printed text. For example, 1984 could be a printed text (like a book) or it could be something else (like a digital file or film), but the context does not specify.
- Therefore, based solely on the given information, it is uncertain whether 1984 is printed text.

### Reasoning for Question 2: Is "1984 is a streaming service" true, false, or uncertain?
- The context states: "All streaming services are digital media." (Statement 3)
- It also states: "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book." (Statement 5)
- Additionally: "If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text." (Statement 4)
- And: "Every printed text is analog media." (Statement 2)
- Finally: "No digital media are analog." (Statement 1), meaning digital and analog media are mutually exclusive.
- Now, assume that 1984 is a streaming service (S). Then:
  - S implies 1984 is digital media (from Statement 3).
  - S implies 1984 is a hardcover book (from Statement 5).
  - Being a hardcover book implies 1984 is printed text (from Statement 4).
  - Being printed text implies 1984 is analog media (from Statement 2).
- Therefore, if S is true, 1984 would be both digital media (from streaming service) and analog media (from printed text). This directly contradicts Statement 1, which states that no digital media are analog.
- Since assuming S leads to a contradiction, S must be false. Thus, 1984 is not a streaming service.
- Therefore, the statement "1984 is a streaming service" is false.

### Reasoning for Question 3: Is "1984 is not a streaming service" true, false, or uncertain?
- As established in the reasoning for Question 2, assuming that 1984 is a streaming service leads to a logical contradiction with the given statements.
- Therefore, 1984 cannot be a streaming service, meaning "1984 is not a streaming service" must be true.
- There is no information in the context that suggests 1984 could be a streaming service without contradiction, so this is definitively true.
- Thus, the statement "1984 is not a streaming service" is true.
