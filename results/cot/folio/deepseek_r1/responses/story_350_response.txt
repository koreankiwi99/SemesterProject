Story ID: 350
Premises: All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.

Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The statement is: "A design by Max is a brutalist building." This is interpreted existentially: "There exists a design that Max adores that is a brutalist building."

From the context:
- Every design style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style (point 3).
- All Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries (point 1).
- No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries (point 2).
- If a design that Max adores has interesting geometries, then it is a brutalist building and evocative (point 6).

However, a contradiction arises if we assume Max adores any Zaha Hadid designs:
- If Max adores a Zaha Hadid design, it must have interesting geometries (point 1).
- Then, by point 6, it must be a brutalist building and evocative.
- But point 2 states that no brutalist building has interesting geometries, leading to a contradiction.

Therefore, Max cannot adore any Zaha Hadid designs. Thus, all designs Max adores must be Kelly Wearstler's design styles (point 3), and these are all evocative and dreamy (points 4 and 5).

Brutalist buildings that Max adores (if any) must be a subset of Kelly Wearstler's design styles, since Zaha Hadid styles are impossible. However, the context does not specify whether Kelly Wearstler's designs include brutalist buildings or whether Max adores any such buildings. Brutalist buildings may or may not exist in the set of designs Max adores. Thus, we cannot determine if there is a brutalist building that Max adores.

Conclusion: The statement is **Unknown**.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The statement is: "A design by Max is evocative and dreamy." This is interpreted existentially: "There exists a design that Max adores that is both evocative and dreamy."

As established:
- Max adores no Zaha Hadid designs (due to the contradiction).
- Therefore, all designs Max adores are Kelly Wearstler's design styles (point 3).
- All Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative (point 4) and dreamy (point 5).

Thus, every design Max adores is both evocative and dreamy. Therefore, there exists at least one design (in fact, all) that is evocative and dreamy.

Conclusion: The statement is **True**.

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement is: "A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy." This is interpreted existentially: "There exists a design that Max adores that is evocative or dreamy (or both)."

Again:
- All designs Max adores are Kelly Wearstler's design styles (as Zaha Hadid styles are impossible).
- All Kelly Wearstler's designs that Max adores are evocative (point 4) and dreamy (point 5), meaning every design has both properties.

Since every design is both evocative and dreamy, it is trivially true that every design is at least one of evocative or dreamy (in fact, both). Therefore, there exists at least one design (all) that satisfies "either evocative or dreamy."

Conclusion: The statement is **True**.
