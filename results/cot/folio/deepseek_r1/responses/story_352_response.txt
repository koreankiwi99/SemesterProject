### Reasoning for Question 1:
The statement is: "The Harvard Weekly Book club has legal obligations."  
- From the context, all legal entities have legal obligations (statement 5).  
- However, the Harvard Weekly Book Club (H) is not directly categorized in the context. Statement 6 provides a conditional: if H is created under law, then it is not a private company. But this does not specify whether H is a legal entity, a business organization, or something else.  
- H could be a legal entity (e.g., if it is a business organization), which would imply it has legal obligations. Alternatively, H could be an informal entity not created under law and not a legal entity, in which case it might not have legal obligations.  
- Since there is no information confirming H's status as a legal entity or otherwise, it is unknown whether H has legal obligations.  

### Reasoning for Question 2:
The statement is: "The Harvard Weekly Book club has legal obligations and is a private company."  
- First, consider if H can be a private company:  
  - If H is a private company, then from statement 3, it is a company; from statement 2, it is a business organization; from statement 1, it is a legal entity; and from statement 4, it is created under law.  
  - However, statement 6 states that if H is created under law, then it is not a private company. This creates a contradiction: if H is a private company, it must be created under law, but statement 6 says that if created under law, it cannot be a private company.  
- Therefore, H cannot be a private company; it is impossible based on the given statements.  
- Since "H is a private company" is false, the conjunction "H has legal obligations and is a private company" is false regardless of whether H has legal obligations.  
- Thus, the statement is false.  

### Reasoning for Question 3:
The statement is: "If the Harvard Weekly Book club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law."  
- As established in Question 2, H cannot be a private company (it leads to a contradiction with statement 6).  
- In logic, an implication "If P, then Q" is true whenever P is false, regardless of Q. Here, P ("H is a private company") is false, so the entire implication is vacuously true.  
- Additionally, if H were a private company (though impossible), it would be a legal entity (from statements 1-3) and thus have legal obligations (statement 5) and be created under law (statement 4). Therefore, the consequent ("has legal obligations or is created under law") would be true anyway, as both disjuncts are true.  
- Thus, the statement is true.
