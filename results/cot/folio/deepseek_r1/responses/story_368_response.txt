Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The statement is: "Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition."

From the textual context:
- Statement 7 states: "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition."
- Logically, this can be represented as: Hannah works (H_work = true) and (H_need_money → (¬H_picky ∧ ¬H_need_money)).
- The implication H_need_money → (¬H_picky ∧ ¬H_need_money) requires that H_need_money must be false. If H_need_money were true, the consequent (¬H_picky ∧ ¬H_need_money) would be false (because ¬H_need_money is false), making the implication false. But since the implication is given as true, H_need_money must be false.
- Therefore, Hannah does not need to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.
- Although statement 1 ("If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition") suggests that working implies needing money, statement 7 provides specific information about Hannah that overrides or conflicts with this general rule for her case. Based on the direct deduction from statement 7, H_need_money is false.
- Thus, the statement "Hannah needs to earn money" is false.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The statement is: "Hannah is at Mary's school and she is not a picky eater and spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls."

From the textual context:
- Statement 6 confirms Hannah is at Mary's school, so that part is true.
- We need to determine if Hannah is not a picky eater (¬H_picky) and if she spends a lot of time eating and catching up with friends (H_spend_time).
- From statement 3: "People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes." For Hannah, this means Order Takeout ∨ Enjoy Dining.
- From statement 4: "If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters." So Enjoy Dining → ¬H_picky.
- From statement 5: "If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls." So Enjoy Dining → H_spend_time.
- If Hannah enjoys dining (Enjoy Dining = true), then ¬H_picky and H_spend_time are both true, making the statement true.
- If Hannah orders takeout (Order Takeout = true), then Enjoy Dining may be false. In this case:
  - Statement 4 and 5 do not apply (they only give implications when Enjoy Dining is true), so we have no information about H_picky or H_spend_time.
  - Hannah could be picky or not picky, and she may or may not spend time in the dining halls.
- From statement 7 and the deduction for question 1, we know H_need_money is false and H_work is true, but this does not provide information about Order Takeout, Enjoy Dining, H_picky, or H_spend_time.
- Statement 2 ("If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus") is Order Takeout → Work, but since Hannah works, this does not require her to order takeout; she could still enjoy dining instead.
- Therefore, it is possible that Hannah enjoys dining (making ¬H_picky and H_spend_time true), or she orders takeout and is picky and does not spend time (making ¬H_picky false and H_spend_time false). Without knowing whether she enjoys dining or orders takeout, we cannot determine if she is not picky and spends time.
- Thus, the statement is uncertain (Unknown).

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement is: "Hannah is at Mary's school and she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls."

From the textual context:
- Hannah is at Mary's school (true, from statement 6).
- The second part: "she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time..." can be logically simplified. Let P = H_picky, S = H_spend_time. The phrase is: ¬P ∨ (P → S).
- P → S is equivalent to ¬P ∨ S, so ¬P ∨ (¬P ∨ S) simplifies to ¬P ∨ S.
- Therefore, the statement is equivalent to: Hannah is at Mary's school and (¬H_picky ∨ H_spend_time).
- We need to evaluate if ¬H_picky ∨ H_spend_time is true for Hannah.
- As in question 2, from statement 3, Hannah either orders takeout or enjoys dining.
- If she enjoys dining, then from statements 4 and 5, ¬H_picky and H_spend_time are both true, so ¬H_picky ∨ H_spend_time is true.
- If she orders takeout, Enjoy Dining may be false. In this case:
  - H_picky could be true or false (no information from context).
  - H_spend_time could be true or false (statement 5 only applies if Enjoy Dining is true).
  - It is possible that she is picky and does not spend time (H_picky = true, H_spend_time = false), making ¬H_picky false and H_spend_time false, so ¬H_picky ∨ H_spend_time false.
  - It is also possible that she is not picky (¬H_picky true) or spends time (H_spend_time true), making the disjunction true.
- Since the case where she orders takeout, is picky, and does not spend time is possible (and not contradicted by any statement), ¬H_picky ∨ H_spend_time could be false.
- However, it could also be true (e.g., if she enjoys dining, or orders takeout but is not picky, or spends time).
- Therefore, we cannot determine if ¬H_picky ∨ H_spend_time is true or false based on the given information; it depends on unknown factors (whether she enjoys dining or orders takeout, and her pickiness/spending time if she orders takeout).
- Thus, the statement is uncertain (Unknown).
