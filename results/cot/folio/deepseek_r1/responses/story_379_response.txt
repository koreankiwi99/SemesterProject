Story ID: 379
Premises: People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.
If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.
If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. 
Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers

### Reasoning for Question 1
The statement is: "Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings." We need to determine if this is true, false, or uncertain based on the context.

- From the context, people born in a multiple birth spend a lot of time with siblings: MB → ST.
- Luke's situation is defined as: (MB ∧ LS) ∨ (¬MB ∧ ¬LS).
- If MB ∧ LS were true:
  - MB → ST (so ST true).
  - ST → LH (so LH true).
  - LH → ¬LS (so ¬LS true).
  - But LS is true, leading to a contradiction (¬LS and LS cannot both be true). Thus, MB ∧ LS is impossible.
- Therefore, Luke must be in the case ¬MB ∧ ¬LS (not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers).
- Since ¬MB is true, and MB → ST only implies that ST must be true if MB is true, it does not constrain ST when MB is false. ST could be true (e.g., if Luke has non-multiple-birth siblings and spends time with them) or false (e.g., if Luke has no siblings or does not spend time with them). The context does not provide information to determine ST when ¬MB holds.
- Thus, whether Luke spends a lot of time with siblings is uncertain.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The statement is: "Luke complains often about annoying siblings." We need to determine if this is true, false, or uncertain based on the context.

- From the context:
  - CA → SBT (if people complain often about annoying siblings, they have siblings born together).
  - SBT → MB (if people have siblings born together, they were born in a multiple birth).
  - Thus, CA → MB (if people complain often, they were born in a multiple birth).
- From Question 1, Luke is not born in a multiple birth (¬MB is true).
- Applying the contrapositive of CA → MB: ¬MB → ¬CA (if not born in a multiple birth, then does not complain often).
- Therefore, ¬CA must be true for Luke, meaning he does not complain often about annoying siblings.
- Thus, the statement is false.

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement is: "Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings." We need to determine if this is true, false, or uncertain based on the context.

- From Question 1, Luke is not born in a multiple birth (¬MB is true).
- From Question 2, Luke does not complain often about annoying siblings (¬CA is true).
- Therefore, both ¬MB and ¬CA are true, meaning Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings.
- Thus, the statement is true.
