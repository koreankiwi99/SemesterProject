Story ID: 380
Premises: People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. 
Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.

### Reasoning for Question 1:
The statement to evaluate is: "Bonnie performs in school talent shows often."  
- From the context, club members are either people who perform in school talent shows often (P) or inactive and disinterested members (I).  
- If Bonnie performs (P), then from the first context statement (people who perform attend and are engaged), Bonnie is engaged with school events (E). From Bonnie's specific information (she either is both engaged and a student or is not engaged or not a student), we know that if engaged (E), then she is a student (S) (since E → S). So if P, then E and S.  
- If Bonnie is inactive (I), then from the context (all inactive members chaperone dances, and chaperones are not students), Bonnie is not a student (¬S). Since E → S (from Bonnie's info), if ¬S, then ¬E.  
- Bonnie must be either P or I, as per the second context statement.  
- However, we have no information forcing Bonnie to be exclusively P or I; both cases are consistent with the given information. Thus, it is uncertain whether Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.

### Reasoning for Question 2:
The statement to evaluate is: "If Bonnie is either [both a young child/teenager who wishes to further her career and chaperones dances] or [not a young child/teenager who wishes to further her career], then Bonnie is either a student or an inactive member."  
- Define Y: Bonnie is a young child/teenager who wishes to further academics; C: Bonnie chaperones dances; S: Bonnie is a student; I: Bonnie is an inactive member.  
- The antecedent (Y ∧ C) ∨ ¬Y simplifies to Y → C (from logical equivalence: (Y ∧ C) ∨ ¬Y ≡ ¬Y ∨ C).  
- The consequent is S ∨ I.  
- For the implication (Y → C) → (S ∨ I) to be evaluated, we check if it must hold for Bonnie given the context.  
- From context: Y → S (all young/teen who wish are students), I → ¬S (inactive members chaperone → not students).  
- If Y is true, S is true, but Y → C requires C to be true, which implies ¬S (since chaperones are not students). This would cause a contradiction (S and ¬S), so Y cannot be true if Y → C holds; thus Y must be false.  
- With Y false, antecedent Y → C is true (vacuously).  
- For consequent S ∨ I: Bonnie must be P or I (from context). If P, then P → E (performance → engaged) and E → S (Bonnie's info), so S true. If I, then I true. Thus S ∨ I always holds for Bonnie.  
- Since the antecedent implies the consequent is always true (when antecedent holds, Y false allows S ∨ I to hold), and S ∨ I always holds regardless, the entire implication is always true for Bonnie.  
- Therefore, the statement must be true.

### Reasoning for Question 3:
The statement to evaluate is: "If Bonnie either chaperones dances or [if not, she performs often], then Bonnie is both a young child/teenager who wishes to further her career and an inactive member."  
- The antecedent "either C or if not C, then P" simplifies to C ∨ P (logically, C ∨ (¬C → P) ≡ C ∨ P).  
- The consequent is Y ∧ I (both Y and I).  
- For Bonnie, C ∨ P is always true because, from context, she must be P or I. If P, P true; if I, C true (since inactive chaperone), so C ∨ P holds regardless.  
- With antecedent always true, the implication (C ∨ P) → (Y ∧ I) simplifies to requiring Y ∧ I to be true (since true → B ≡ B).  
- However, Y ∧ I is not necessarily true for Bonnie. If Bonnie is P, then I is false (since P and I are mutually exclusive—performers are engaged, inactive are not). If Bonnie is I, Y may or may not be true (e.g., she may not be young/teen or may not wish to further academics).  
- Thus, Y ∧ I can be false (e.g., if Bonnie is P, I false; or if I but not Y).  
- Since the antecedent is always true and the consequent can be false, the implication can be false. Without more information on Bonnie's status, we cannot determine if Y ∧ I holds, so the truth value of the entire statement is uncertain.
