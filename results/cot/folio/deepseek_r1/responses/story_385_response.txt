### Reasoning for Question 1
The statement is: "Coco Gauff is among the most active Grand-Slam players."  
From the context:  
- If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), they are one of the most active players in major tennis (which includes Grand Slam events).  
- All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.  
- Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the WTA.  
- Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.  
- All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.  
- Point 6 states that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not male.  

First, determine Coco Gauff's gender:  
- Assume Coco Gauff is male. Then, from point 5, all male players lost to Rafael Nadal, so Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal. Point 6 says if Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not male. This is a contradiction, so Coco Gauff cannot be male. Therefore, Coco Gauff must be female (since all players are either female or male).  

Since Coco Gauff is female and at Roland Garros 2022:  
- From point 3, all female players lost to Iga Świątek, so Coco Gauff lost to Iga Świątek.  
- From point 2, everyone who lost to Iga Świątek is ranked highly by the WTA, so Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA.  
- From point 1, being ranked highly by the WTA implies Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis (which includes Grand Slam players).  

Thus, Coco Gauff is among the most active Grand-Slam players, making the statement true.  

### Reasoning for Question 2
The statement is: "Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal."  
From the context:  
- Coco Gauff is female (as established in Question 1).  
- Point 5 states that all male tennis players lost to Rafael Nadal, but this applies only to male players.  
- Point 3 states that all female tennis players lost to Iga Świątek, not Rafael Nadal.  
- Since men's and women's tennis are separate categories, Coco Gauff, being female, would not play against Rafael Nadal (a male player) in a professional match at Roland Garros.  
- There is no information suggesting that Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal; in fact, the context indicates she lost only to Iga Świątek.  

Therefore, Coco Gauff has not lost to Rafael Nadal, making the statement false.  

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement is: "Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis."  
This means it is claiming that Coco Gauff does not simultaneously have both properties: (A) lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and (B) is one of the most active players in major tennis.  

From the context (as established in Question 1):  
- Coco Gauff lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 (A is true).  
- Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis (B is true).  
Therefore, both A and B are true for Coco Gauff.  

The statement "not both A and B" is equivalent to denying that both are true. Since both are true, "not both A and B" is false.  

Thus, the given statement is false.
