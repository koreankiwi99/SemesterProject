Story ID: 386
Premises: If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.

### Reasoning for Question 1
The statement is: "Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer."

From the context:
- "Severe cancers are deadly diseases" and "if something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate." Thus, severe cancers have low survival rates.
- "Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer," so bile duct cancer is a severe cancer.
- "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer," so Cholangiocarcinoma is also a severe cancer.
- "Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate."

The key point is that colorectal cancer cannot be both a bile duct cancer and have a low survival rate. Since bile duct cancer (and by extension, Cholangiocarcinoma) must have a low survival rate (as it is severe and deadly), if colorectal cancer were a bile duct cancer, it would have a low survival rate, contradicting the "not both" statement. Therefore, colorectal cancer cannot be a bile duct cancer (or Cholangiocarcinoma).

However, the context does not provide any information about whether colorectal cancer itself is a severe cancer. Severe cancers are defined, but colorectal cancer is only mentioned in relation to not being a bile duct cancer and not having both properties simultaneously. It could be a severe cancer (if it has a low survival rate and is deadly) or not (if it lacks a low survival rate or is not deadly). The context does not specify colorectal cancer's survival rate or whether it is deadly, except indirectly through the "not both" statement, which only rules out it being bile duct cancer with low survival rate. Without further information, it is uncertain whether colorectal cancer is a severe cancer.

Thus, the answer is **Unknown**.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The statement is: "If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu."

In logical terms:
- Let A: "colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer"
- Let B: "colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma"
- Let C: "colorectal cancer is a kind of mild flu"

The statement is: If (A or B), then (A and C).

From the context:
- "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer," so B implies A (if B is true, A must be true).
- Therefore, (A or B) is equivalent to A, because B → A makes A or B true only if A is true.
- Thus, the implication simplifies to: If A, then (A and C), which requires that if A is true, C must also be true (since A and C must both be true).

Now, from the context and previous reasoning:
- Colorectal cancer cannot be a bile duct cancer (A is false), as established in Question 1 (due to the "not both" statement with low survival rate).
- Since B implies A, and A is false, B must also be false (colorectal cancer cannot be Cholangiocarcinoma).
- Therefore, (A or B) is false.

In logic, an implication "If P then Q" is true whenever the antecedent P is false, regardless of Q. Here, (A or B) is false, so the entire implication is true, even though the consequent (A and C) is false (as colorectal cancer is not mild flu, based on common sense and the context separating cancers from flu).

Thus, the statement is **True**.

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement is: "Colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above."

This can be interpreted as a compound statement:
- Let X: "colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma"
- Let Y: "colorectal cancer is a kind of mild flu"
- Let Z: "colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer"

The statement is: [X and (Y or Z)] or (X and Y and Z).

From the context:
- "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer," so if X is true, Z must be true.
- Therefore, if X is true, (Y or Z) is true because Z is true, so [X and (Y or Z)] simplifies to X (since Y or Z is true when Z is true).
- Similarly, (X and Y and Z) requires X to be true.
- Thus, the entire statement reduces to X: colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma.

However, from the context and previous reasoning:
- Colorectal cancer cannot be a bile duct cancer (Z is false), as established in Question 1.
- Since "all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer," if X were true, Z would be true, but Z is false, so X must be false (colorectal cancer is not Cholangiocarcinoma).
- Therefore, X is false, making the entire statement false.

Additionally, Y is false (colorectal cancer is not mild flu, as they are distinct diseases based on context), but this is not necessary to establish falsity since X is false.

Thus, the statement is **False**.
