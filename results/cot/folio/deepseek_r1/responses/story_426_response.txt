Story ID: 426
Premises: All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. 
Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. 
Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. 
No managers work remotely from home. 
James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.

Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The statement is: "James has lunch in the company."  
From the context:  
- Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home (point 3).  
- If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home (point 4).  
- James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager (point 7).  
- If James appears in the company (A), he must have lunch in the company building (L_comp), because if he had lunch at home (L_home), he would be working remotely (R), which implies he does not appear (¬A), contradicting A.  
- Conversely, if James does not appear (¬A), he must have lunch at home (L_home), as he cannot have lunch in the company building if not present.  
- Thus, A ↔ L_comp and ¬A ↔ L_home.  
- Since A ↔ M (James is a manager), it follows that L_comp ↔ M.  
- However, the context does not specify whether James is a manager or not. Therefore, we cannot determine if James has lunch in the company; it depends on his managerial status.  
- Conclusion: The statement is uncertain.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The statement is: "James does not have lunch in the company."  
This is equivalent to James having lunch at home (L_home).  
- As established in Question 1, L_home ↔ ¬M (not a manager).  
- The context does not specify if James is a manager or not, so we cannot determine if he has lunch at home.  
- Therefore, the truth value of this statement is also dependent on unknown information about James.  
- Conclusion: The statement is uncertain.

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement is: "If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James does not either have lunch at home or work remotely from home. If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries."  
This is a single logical implication with its contrapositive. We can represent it as:  
- Let P: M or C (James is a manager or in other countries).  
- Let Q: L_home or R (James has lunch at home or works remotely from home).  
- The statement is: If P, then not Q. (Equivalently, via contrapositive: If Q, then not P.)  

From the context:  
- If James is in other countries (C), then he works remotely from home (R) (point 5).  
- If C is true, then R is true, so Q (L_home or R) is true (since R implies Q).  
- If C is true, P (M or C) is also true.  
- But "not Q" would be false when Q is true.  
- Thus, when C is true, P is true and not Q is false, making the implication "If P, then not Q" false.  
- Specifically, the context allows for James to be in other countries (C), which is consistent with the rules, and in this case, the statement fails.  
- Therefore, the statement is not universally true; it can be false under valid scenarios described in the context.  
- Conclusion: The statement is false.

ANSWERS:
1: Uncertain
2: Uncertain
3: False
