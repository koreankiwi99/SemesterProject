Story ID: 435
Premises: None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department. 
All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. 
All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department. 
All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. 
All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.
James is a student working in the lab. 
James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.

### Reasoning Step-by-Step

The textual context provides several statements, including a contradiction regarding James's employment. Specifically:
- "James is a student working in the lab" (statement 6) implies James works in the lab (LabWork is true).
- "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university" (statement 7) implies James does not work in the lab (not LabWork) and does not have a part-time job (not PartTimeJob).

Statements 6 and 7 conflict directly: statement 6 asserts LabWork is true, while statement 7 asserts not LabWork is true. This creates a logical inconsistency in the premises. However, since statement 7 explicitly states James does not work in the lab and does not have a part-time job, and it is part of the given context, it must be treated as factual for reasoning purposes. Thus, for James:
- LabWork is false (he does not work in the lab).
- PartTimeJob is false (he does not have a part-time job offered by the university).

The general logical relationships from the context are:
1. No LibraryWork students are from CS (LibraryWork → ¬CS).
2. All PartTimeJob students work in the library (PartTimeJob → LibraryWork).
3. All DBCourse students are from CS (DBCourse → CS).
4. All ProfDavid students are taking DBCourse (ProfDavid → DBCourse).
5. All LabWork students are taking ProfDavid (LabWork → ProfDavid).

Since James does not work in the lab (LabWork false), there are no implications from the general statements about whether James takes ProfDavid, DBCourse, or is from CS. Specifically:
- LabWork false means no chain to ProfDavid, DBCourse, or CS.
- PartTimeJob false means no chain to LibraryWork or ¬CS.
- No other information about James's course enrollment or department is provided.

Now, evaluate each question:

**Question 1: James has a part-time job offered by the university.**  
- This is PartTimeJob for James.  
- From statement 7, James does not have a part-time job (PartTimeJob false).  
- Therefore, the statement is false.  

**Question 2: James does not have a part-time job offered by the university.**  
- This is not PartTimeJob for James.  
- From statement 7, James does not have a part-time job (PartTimeJob false).  
- Therefore, the statement is true.  

**Question 3: James either takes the database course or has a part-time job offered by the university.**  
- This is DBCourse or PartTimeJob for James.  
- PartTimeJob is false (from statement 7).  
- DBCourse is unknown (no information from context, as LabWork false breaks the chain to DBCourse).  
- If DBCourse is true, the "or" statement is true; if DBCourse is false, it is false. Since DBCourse is unknown, the truth value of the "or" statement cannot be determined.  
- Therefore, the statement is uncertain (unknown).  

**Question 4: James takes the database course.**  
- This is DBCourse for James.  
- No information links James to DBCourse (LabWork false, so no implication from LabWork → ProfDavid → DBCourse).  
- James's course enrollment is not specified elsewhere.  
- Therefore, the statement is uncertain (unknown).  

The contradiction between statements 6 and 7 is resolved by prioritizing statement 7 for James's employment status, as it directly addresses the questions about part-time jobs and lab work. However, the lack of information about James's courses leads to uncertainty for questions 3 and 4.
