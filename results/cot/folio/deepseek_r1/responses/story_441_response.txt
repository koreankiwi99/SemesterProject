==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1:
The statement is: "Tom is a grumpy person."
- From the context: "All pet owners love animals" and "Tom is a pet owner," so Tom loves animals.
- "All animal lovers are nice to animals," so since Tom loves animals, he is nice to animals.
- "No one nice to animals is also mean to animals," so Tom cannot be mean to animals.
- "Some grumpy people are mean to animals," but this does not imply that all grumpy people are mean to animals or that non-grumpy people cannot be mean to animals. It only indicates that there exists at least one grumpy person who is mean to animals.
- Tom is nice to animals and not mean to animals, but there is no information linking pet owners, animal lovers, or being nice to animals to whether Tom is grumpy or not. Grumpiness is independent of these attributes based on the given context.
- Therefore, it is uncertain whether Tom is a grumpy person. The answer is Unknown.

### Reasoning for Question 2:
The statement is: "Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals."
- As established, Tom is nice to animals and cannot be mean to animals (from "no one nice to animals is also mean to animals").
- Therefore, it is impossible for Tom to be mean to animals, regardless of whether he is grumpy or not.
- The statement "Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals" means that the combination (grumpy and mean to animals) is false for Tom.
- Since Tom cannot be mean to animals, the combination is always false, making the statement true.
- Thus, the answer is True.

### Reasoning for Question 3:
The statement is: "If Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover."
- First, the antecedent ("Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals") is true, as reasoned for Question 2.
- The consequent ("Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover") means Tom is not grumpy and not an animal lover.
- However, from the context: "All pet owners love animals" and "Tom is a pet owner," so Tom loves animals. Also, "all animal lovers are nice to animals," so Tom is an animal lover. Therefore, Tom is an animal lover, making "not an animal lover" false.
- Since Tom is an animal lover, the consequent is false (it requires him not to be an animal lover).
- The implication "if antecedent then consequent" is false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.
- Therefore, the overall statement is false.
- Thus, the answer is False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
