Premises: All aliens are extraterrestrials.
If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.
No extraterrestrials are human.
All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.
Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1: Is Marvin an alien?

- From the context: "All aliens are extraterrestrials" means that if someone is an alien, they are an extraterrestrial, but it does not imply that all extraterrestrials are aliens.
- "If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien" means that being from Mars implies being an alien, but it does not cover cases where someone is not from Mars.
- Marvin is not from Mars (as derived below), so this does not confirm he is an alien.
- Marvin is an extraterrestrial (as derived below), but there is no information stating that all extraterrestrials are aliens. Therefore, it is unknown whether Marvin is an alien.

### Reasoning for Question 2: Is Marvin neither a human nor from Mars?

- "Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither." However, the case where Marvin is from both Earth and Mars leads to a contradiction:
  - If from Mars, then alien (from context).
  - If alien, then extraterrestrial (from context).
  - If extraterrestrial, then not human (from "no extraterrestrials are human").
  - But if from Earth and highly intelligent (given), then human (from "all highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans").
  - This results in Marvin being both human and not human, which is impossible. Therefore, Marvin cannot be from both Earth and Mars.
- Thus, Marvin must be from neither Earth nor Mars (i.e., ¬E ∧ ¬M).
- Since Marvin is not from Earth, and "if Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial" (from context), Marvin is an extraterrestrial.
- As an extraterrestrial, Marvin is not human (from "no extraterrestrials are human").
- Also, Marvin is not from Mars (as established).
- Therefore, Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars, making the statement true.

### Reasoning for Question 3: If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human.

- As established above, Marvin is not from Mars (¬M is true).
- However, Marvin is not human (as derived from being an extraterrestrial).
- The implication "if not from Mars, then human" (if ¬M, then human) is false because the antecedent (¬M) is true, but the consequent (human) is false.
- Therefore, the statement is false.
