### Reasoning Step-by-Step

The context provides the following information:
- Some professional basketball players are not American nationals. This means there exists at least one professional basketball player who is not an American national, but it does not imply that all are non-American or provide information about non-players.
- All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
- If someone can do jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
- If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles.
- Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

From these statements, we can derive logical implications:
- Since all professional basketball players can do jump shots (universal), and doing jump shots implies leaping straight into the air (conditional), all professional basketball players must leap straight into the air.
- Leaping straight into the air implies activating leg muscles (conditional), so all professional basketball players must activate their leg muscles.
- Therefore, if someone does not activate their leg muscles, they cannot be a professional basketball player (contraposition).
- Given that Yuri does not activate his leg muscles, Yuri cannot be a professional basketball player. Thus, ¬PBP(Yuri) is true (where PBP means professional basketball player).

Now, we address each question based on this reasoning:

**Question 1: Yuri is an American national.**
- We know Yuri is not a professional basketball player (¬PBP(Yuri)).
- However, the context provides no information about the nationality of non-players. The statement "Some professional basketball players are not American nationals" only concerns players and does not generalize to non-players like Yuri.
- Therefore, Yuri's nationality is unknown. It could be American or non-American; we cannot determine it from the context.
- Answer: Unknown

**Question 2: Yuri is not an American professional basketball player.**
- An "American professional basketball player" is defined as a professional basketball player who is also an American national (PBP ∧ AN).
- We know Yuri is not a professional basketball player (¬PBP(Yuri)).
- If Yuri is not a professional basketball player, he cannot be an American professional basketball player, as that would require him to be both a player and American.
- Therefore, the statement "Yuri is not an American professional basketball player" is true.
- Answer: True

**Question 3: Yuri is an American professional basketball player.**
- This means Yuri is both a professional basketball player and an American national (PBP(Yuri) ∧ AN(Yuri)).
- However, we know Yuri is not a professional basketball player (¬PBP(Yuri)), so this conjunction is false.
- Therefore, the statement is false.
- Answer: False

**Question 4: If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player.**
- First, we need to evaluate the antecedent: "Yuri does not leap straight into the air" (¬LS(Yuri)).
- From the context: Not activating leg muscles implies not leaping straight into the air (contraposition of "leaping straight into the air implies activating leg muscles").
- Since Yuri does not activate his leg muscles, he does not leap straight into the air. Thus, ¬LS(Yuri) is true.
- The consequent is "Yuri is an American professional basketball player" (PBP(Yuri) ∧ AN(Yuri)), which we know is false because ¬PBP(Yuri).
- The implication "If P, then Q" is false when P is true and Q is false.
- Here, P (¬LS(Yuri)) is true, and Q (PBP(Yuri) ∧ AN(Yuri)) is false, so the implication is false.
- Therefore, the statement is false.
- Answer: False

**Question 5: If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player.**
- "Yuri is not an American professional basketball player" means ¬(PBP(Yuri) ∧ AN(Yuri)), which is equivalent to ¬PBP(Yuri) ∨ ¬AN(Yuri).
- We know ¬PBP(Yuri) is true, so ¬PBP(Yuri) ∨ ¬AN(Yuri) is true (since ¬PBP(Yuri) alone makes the disjunction true).
- The consequent is "Yuri is a professional basketball player" (PBP(Yuri)), which is false.
- The implication "If P, then Q" is false when P is true and Q is false.
- Here, P (¬(PBP(Yuri) ∧ AN(Yuri))) is true, and Q (PBP(Yuri)) is false, so the implication is false.
- Therefore, the statement is false.
- Answer: False
