Story ID: 467
Premises: All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.
All monkeys are mammals. 
Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. 
Peter's birds can fly.
All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
Rock is Peter's pet.
Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1: Rock is a monkey.
- Rock is Peter's pet (from context point 7).
- Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds (from point 3), so Rock is either a monkey or a bird.
- Rock can breathe (from point 5: all animals that are Peter's pets can breathe, and Rock is a pet, hence an animal).
- Point 8 states: Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. Since Rock can breathe, this simplifies to: Rock can fly or Rock is a bird.
- If Rock is a bird, then Rock can fly (from point 4: Peter's birds can fly).
- If Rock is not a bird (i.e., Rock is a monkey), then from the disjunction above, Rock must be able to fly.
- However, the context does not specify whether monkeys can fly or have wings; it only states that all monkeys are mammals (point 2) and that birds can fly (point 4). It is possible for Rock to be a bird (and not a monkey) or a monkey that can fly (e.g., a fictional flying monkey), as there is no contradiction in the text.
- Therefore, it is uncertain whether Rock is a monkey, as both possibilities (monkey or bird) are consistent with the context.

### Reasoning for Question 2: Rock has wings.
- As established, Rock can breathe, so from point 8, Rock can fly or Rock is a bird.
- If Rock is a bird, then Rock can fly (point 4), and if Rock can fly, then Rock has wings (point 6).
- If Rock is not a bird (i.e., Rock is a monkey), then Rock must be able to fly (from the disjunction), and thus Rock has wings (point 6).
- In both cases (Rock is a bird or Rock is a monkey), Rock has wings.
- There is no scenario where Rock does not have wings, as all possibilities lead to Rock flying and thus having wings.
- Therefore, the statement "Rock has wings" is true.

### Reasoning for Question 3: Rock does not have wings.
- From the reasoning for Question 2, Rock must have wings in all possible scenarios.
- Therefore, the statement "Rock does not have wings" is false, as it directly contradicts the conclusion that Rock has wings.
