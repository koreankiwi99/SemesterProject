Story ID: 46
Premises: Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.
Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs.
Heck cattle are animals.
Aurochs are animals.
Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1:
The statement is: "Some Heck cattle are artificially selected."

- The context defines breeding back as "a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals."
- It explicitly states that "Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs."
- Since Heck cattle were bred back, and breeding back is a form of artificial selection, it follows that Heck cattle are the result of artificial selection.
- The use of "some" in the statement is appropriate because it does not claim that all Heck cattle are artificially selected (e.g., if considering individual animals over time), but the breed as a whole was created through artificial selection, so at least some Heck cattle must be artificially selected.
- There is no information suggesting that Heck cattle are not artificially selected; the context directly supports that they were bred back.
- Therefore, based on the given information, the statement is **True**.

### Reasoning for Question 2:
The statement is: "Aurochs are extinct."

- The context states that "some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals."
- It also specifies that "Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs," indicating that Heck cattle are an example of animals bred back to resemble another animal (the aurochs).
- Since Heck cattle are part of "some animals to be bred back" that resemble extinct animals, and they resemble aurochs, it logically follows that aurochs must be extinct. Otherwise, the resemblance to an extinct animal would not apply in this case.
- The context does not explicitly state "aurochs are extinct," but the inference is strong based on the connection: Heck cattle (bred back) resemble extinct animals, and they resemble aurochs, so aurochs are extinct.
- There is no information suggesting that aurochs are not extinct or that this inference is incorrect.
- Therefore, based on the given information, the statement is **True**.

1: True
