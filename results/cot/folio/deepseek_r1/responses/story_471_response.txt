### Reasoning for Each Question

I will analyze each question step-by-step based on the given textual context. The context is:

- All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute.
- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
- The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
- If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
- All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
- Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.

First, derive key facts from the context:
- From point 6, Rockie can be spotted near the campus and is calm.
- From point 3, the only animals that can be spotted are rabbits and squirrels. Therefore, Rockie must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.
- From point 4, if something is skittish, it is not calm. By contraposition, if something is calm, it is not skittish. Since Rockie is calm, Rockie is not skittish.
- From point 5, all squirrels that can be spotted are skittish. If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish, but Rockie is not skittish (due to being calm). Therefore, Rockie cannot be a squirrel.
- Since Rockie must be either a rabbit or a squirrel (from point 3) and cannot be a squirrel, Rockie must be a rabbit.
- From point 1, all rabbits that can be spotted are cute. Since Rockie is a spotted rabbit, Rockie is cute.
- Rockie is calm (point 6), so Rockie is not skittish (from point 4).
- Point 2 states that some turtles can be spotted, but point 3 states that only rabbits and squirrels can be spotted. This creates a potential inconsistency, as turtles are neither rabbits nor squirrels. However, for Rockie specifically, since Rockie is spotted and deduced to be a rabbit (not a turtle or squirrel), the inconsistency does not affect the reasoning about Rockie. Rockie is definitively a rabbit based on the logic.

Now, address each question:

**Question 1: Rockie is a turtle.**
- From the reasoning above, Rockie is a rabbit (not a turtle). Therefore, the statement is false.
- Answer: False

**Question 2: Rockie is not a turtle.**
- Rockie is a rabbit, so Rockie is not a turtle. Therefore, the statement is true.
- Answer: True

**Question 3: Rockie is a turtle or cute.**
- Rockie is not a turtle (from above), but Rockie is cute (as a spotted rabbit). A disjunction ("or") is true if at least one part is true. Since "cute" is true, the statement is true regardless of the turtle part.
- Answer: True

**Question 4: If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish.**
- "Not both a turtle and a squirrel" means Rockie is not (turtle and squirrel), which is equivalent to Rockie is not a turtle or not a squirrel. Since Rockie is a rabbit, it is not a turtle and not a squirrel, so "not both" is true.
- The consequent: "Rockie is either cute or skittish." Rockie is cute (true) and not skittish (false), so "cute or skittish" is true because "cute" is true.
- The implication "if P then Q" is true when P is true and Q is true. Here, P ("not both turtle and squirrel") is true, and Q ("cute or skittish") is true, so the implication is true.
- Answer: True

**Question 5: If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.**
- The antecedent: "Rockie is cute and calm." Rockie is cute (true) and calm (true), so this is true.
- The consequent: "Rockie is a skittish turtle." Rockie is a rabbit, not a turtle, and not skittish (since calm), so "skittish turtle" is false.
- An implication "if P then Q" is false when P is true and Q is false. Here, P is true and Q is false, so the implication is false.
- Answer: False
