Story ID: 472
Premises: Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. 
All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
All queen bees are bees.
Harry is a bee.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The statement is: "Harry is a queen bee."  
- From the context: "Harry is a bee" and "All queen bees are bees."  
- However, not all bees are queen bees; bees can include worker bees, drones, etc.  
- The context does not specify that Harry is a queen bee, so it is unknown whether Harry is a queen bee.  
- Therefore, the statement is **Unknown**.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The statement is: "Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee."  
- Harry is a bee (given).  
- From the context: "All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating" and "All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating." This implies bees cannot have backbones, as they would otherwise be required to reproduce by male-and-female mating.  
- Since "Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates" and vertebrates have backbones, bees must be invertebrates.  
- Therefore, Harry, as a bee, is an invertebrate.  
- The statement is an "or" condition: Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee. Since Harry is an invertebrate, this part is true, making the entire statement true regardless of whether Harry is a queen bee.  
- Thus, the statement is **True**.

### Reasoning for Question 3
The statement is: "If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee."  
- First, evaluate the antecedent (the "if" part): Harry must be either:  
  - Option A: Both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or  
  - Option B: Neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone.  
- From the context: Harry is a bee, and as established in Question 2, bees are invertebrates (no backbone) and not vertebrates.  
- Thus, Harry is neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, satisfying Option B. Therefore, the antecedent is true.  
- Now, the consequent (the "then" part): Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.  
- However, Harry is an invertebrate (as established), so "neither an invertebrate" is false. This makes the entire consequent false.  
- Since the antecedent is true and the consequent is false, the conditional statement (implication) is false.  
- Therefore, the statement is **False**.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
