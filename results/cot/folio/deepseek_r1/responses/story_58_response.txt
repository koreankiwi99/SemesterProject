==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The textual context states: "Books contain tons of knowledge." It also specifically refers to "Walden" as "the book 'Walden'." Since "Walden" is identified as a book, and all books contain knowledge according to the context, it follows that Walden contains knowledge. There is no information suggesting that Walden is an exception or lacks knowledge. Therefore, the statement "Walden contains knowledge" is true.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The context states: "When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge." Harry read the book "Walden," so Harry gained knowledge. Additionally, the context states: "If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter." Therefore, Harry became smarter after gaining knowledge from reading the book. The statement "Harry is smarter than before" implies a comparison to his state before reading the book, which is supported by the causal chain in the context. There is no indication of any other factors affecting Harry's intelligence, so the statement is true.

### Reasoning for Question 3
The context states: "If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter." This implies that gaining knowledge is a sufficient condition for becoming smarter, but it does not claim that gaining knowledge is the only way to become smarter. However, the statement "A smarter person has gained knowledge" is existential (meaning there exists at least one smarter person who has gained knowledge). From the context, Harry read "Walden," gained knowledge, and became smarter. Thus, Harry is a specific example of a smarter person who has gained knowledge. Since the statement is satisfied by this instance, it is true. The context does not require that all smarter people have gained knowledge for this existential statement to hold.
