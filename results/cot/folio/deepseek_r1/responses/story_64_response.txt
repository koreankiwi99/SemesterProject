==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1: Is Dani Shapiro a novel writer?
- The context states: "If a book is a novel and it is written by a person, then the person is a novel writer."
- It also states: "Family History is written by Dani Shapiro" and "Family History is a novel written in 2003."
- Therefore, Family History is a novel written by Dani Shapiro, so by the given rule, Dani Shapiro is a novel writer.
- Additionally, "Dani Shapiro is an American writer" supports that she is a writer, but the specific evidence from Family History confirms she is a novel writer.
- There is no contradictory information, so the statement is true.

### Reasoning for Question 2: Is Family Secrets a novel?
- The context states: "Dani Shapiro created a podcast called Family Secrets" and "A podcast is not a novel."
- Therefore, Family Secrets is explicitly identified as a podcast, and since a podcast is not a novel, Family Secrets cannot be a novel.
- There is no information suggesting Family Secrets is a novel or anything else; it is solely described as a podcast.
- Thus, the statement is false.

### Reasoning for Question 3: Was Dani Shapiro born in Boston?
- The context states: "If a person is born in American City, the person is American," "Boston is an American city," and "Dani Shapiro is an American writer."
- While Dani Shapiro is American, the rule only states that being born in an American city implies being American, not the reverse. Being American does not necessarily mean being born in an American city (e.g., she could have been naturalized or born elsewhere to American parents).
- There is no information linking Dani Shapiro to Boston or any specific birthplace; Boston is mentioned only as an example of an American city with no connection to her.
- Therefore, without evidence about her birthplace, the statement is unknown.
