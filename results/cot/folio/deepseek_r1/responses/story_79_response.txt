Strikers are soccer players.

If a player leaves a team they no longer play for that team.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1
The textual context states: "Robert Lewandowski is a striker" and "Strikers are soccer players." This implies that Robert Lewandowski, being a striker, must therefore be a soccer player. This is a direct logical inference, so the statement "Robert Lewandowski is a soccer player" is true.

### Reasoning for Question 2
The textual context states: "Robert Lewandowski left Bayern Munchen" and "If a player leaves a team they no longer play for that team." Therefore, since Robert Lewandowski left Bayern Munchen, he no longer plays for Bayern Munchen. The statement "Robert Lewandowski plays for Bayern Munchen" contradicts this information, so it is false.

### Reasoning for Question 3
The textual context provides no information about Robert Lewandowski being a "star." The term "star" is not defined or mentioned in any way, and there is no logical connection to the given facts (e.g., being a striker or leaving Bayern Munchen does not inherently imply stardom). Therefore, without additional context, the statement "Robert Lewandowski is a star" cannot be verified or refuted, making it unknown.
