Story ID: 83
Premises: All vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34.
Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul. 
Joe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul. 
Tom's license plate begins with the number 35. 
If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1:
The textual context states: "All vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34." It also explicitly says: "Joe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul." Therefore, based on the universal statement that all Istanbul plates begin with 34, Joe's plate must begin with 34. There is no ambiguity or conflicting information, so the statement "Joe's license plate begins with the number 34" is true.

### Reasoning for Question 2:
The textual context states: "Tom's license plate begins with the number 35." It also says: "If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34." Furthermore, it states: "Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul." Since Tom's plate begins with 35, it does not begin with 34, and thus it cannot be from Istanbul. Therefore, the statement "Tom's license plate is from Istanbul" is false. The information is consistent and leaves no room for uncertainty.
