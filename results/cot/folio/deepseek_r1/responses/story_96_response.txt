==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
### Reasoning for Question 1:
The textual context states that "Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE" and "Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine." Therefore, Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable (specifically, Diamond Mine). This directly supports the statement, making it true.

### Reasoning for Question 2:
The context states that "Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine" and "Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers." Since Strong leads the stable, and the Creed Brothers are members of that stable, it follows that Strong leads the Creed Brothers as part of the group. There is no information suggesting separate leadership or exceptions, so the statement is true.

### Reasoning for Question 3:
The context states that "Diamond Mine includes Ivy Nile" and "Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine." Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile, so Imperium does have a feud with such a stable. The statement claims that "Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile," which is contradicted by the given information. Therefore, the statement is false. There is no mention of other stables involving Ivy Nile, so no uncertainty arises.
