==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

**Question 1:**
Statement: Heinrich Schmidt was German or Russian or both.
- The context states that Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician.
- There is no information suggesting he was Russian or both German and Russian.
- Since the statement uses "or" (inclusive), and we know he was German, the statement is true regardless of whether he was Russian or not.
- However, since the context does not mention Russian nationality at all, the most precise answer is that the statement "German or Russian or both" is true because he was German (the "or" does not require the other options to be possible).

**Question 2:**
Statement: Some German politician was part of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag.
- The context states that Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician, a member of the Prussian State Parliament, and a member of the Nazi Reichstag.
- This directly confirms that at least one German politician (Heinrich Schmidt) was part of both bodies.
- Thus, the statement is true.

**Question 3:**
Statement: No politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag.
- The context states that Heinrich Schmidt was a member of the Nazi Reichstag.
- This directly contradicts the statement that "no politicians" were part of the Nazi Reichstag.
- Thus, the statement is false.
