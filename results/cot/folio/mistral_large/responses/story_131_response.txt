==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

### Question 1: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? *Supervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.*

1. The context states: "The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms."
2. Machine learning algorithms are categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
3. The context explicitly says: "Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model."
4. This leaves two possibilities: supervised learning or unsupervised learning.
5. The context also says: "The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data."
6. Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data (as stated in the context).
7. Therefore, if the algorithm requires labeled data, it cannot be unsupervised learning.
8. Thus, the algorithm must be supervised learning.

**Conclusion for Question 1:** True.

### Question 2: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? *Unsupervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.*

1. As reasoned in Question 1, the algorithm requires labeled data.
2. Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
3. Therefore, unsupervised learning cannot be the algorithm used for the state-of-the-art text summarization model.

**Conclusion for Question 2:** False.
