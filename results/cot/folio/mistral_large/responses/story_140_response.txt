==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step.

### Question 1:
**Statement:** Steinhauer was not the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic.

- The context explicitly states: "The winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic was Steinhauer."
- This directly contradicts the statement that Steinhauer was *not* the winner.
- Therefore, the statement is **False**.

### Question 2:
**Statement:** Descampe is in the six-way tie in the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic.

- The context states: "One six-way tie was on the leaderboard, and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium."
- It also states: "Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic."
- However, the context does not explicitly state that Descampe is the *specific* Belgian in the six-way tie. There could be other Belgians on the leaderboard not involved in the six-way tie.
- Thus, we cannot definitively conclude that Descampe is in the six-way tie. The statement is **Unknown**.
