Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

### Question 1: Is James's favorite season summer?

1. The context states: "All students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season."
2. It also states: "James wants to have a long vacation."
3. From these two statements, we can logically conclude that James's favorite season is summer because he wants a long vacation, and all such students have summer as their favorite season.

Thus, the statement is **True**.

### Question 2: Is Mia's favorite season spring?

1. The context states: "Emma's favorite season is summer."
2. It also states: "Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's." This means Mia's favorite season is not summer.
3. However, the context does not provide any information about whether Mia's favorite season is specifically spring, fall, or winter. It could be any of these three seasons.
4. Since we cannot determine from the given information whether Mia's favorite season is spring, the statement is **Unknown**.
