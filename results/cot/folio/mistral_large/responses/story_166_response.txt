Story ID: 166
Premises: Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.

Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

---

**Question 1: Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden.**

- The Olive Garden is a managed building.
- Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if:
  1. He is allowed to move in with Fluffy (his cat).
  2. The security deposit is no more than $1500.
- We do not know whether The Olive Garden allows pets. The context only says "Pets are allowed in *some* managed buildings," but it does not specify whether The Olive Garden is one of them.
- The security deposit at The Olive Garden can be either equal to the monthly rent ($2000) or more. Since $2000 is more than $1500, the security deposit at The Olive Garden is definitely more than $1500.
- Since the security deposit exceeds Tom's limit, even if pets were allowed, Tom would not rent there.
- However, since we don't know if pets are allowed, and the deposit is too high regardless, Tom will **not** rent at The Olive Garden.

Thus, the statement is **False**.

**Question 2: Tom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy.**

- The Olive Garden is a managed building.
- Cats are pets.
- Fluffy is Tom's cat.
- The context states: "If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet."
- However, we do not know whether The Olive Garden allows pets. The context only says "Pets are allowed in *some* managed buildings," but it does not confirm whether The Olive Garden is one of them.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy.

Thus, the statement is **Unknown**.

**Question 3: The security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more.**

- The context states: "The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more."
- The monthly rent at The Olive Garden is $2000.
- Therefore, the security deposit at The Olive Garden is either $2000 or more.

Thus, the statement is **True**.
