Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

---

**Question 1:** *Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class.*

- From the context: "Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class." This means Michael is the tallest in his class.
- Also, "Peter is a man who is taller than Michael." This means Peter is taller than Michael.
- Since Michael is taller than everyone in his class, and Peter is taller than Michael, Peter must be taller than every man in Michael's class.
- Therefore, there is no man in Michael's class who is taller than Peter.
- The statement claims Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class, which contradicts the above reasoning.

**Conclusion:** False.

**Question 2:** *Windy is a great shooter.*

- From the context: "Michael cannot block Windy's shooting."
- Also, "Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting." This implies that if Michael cannot block someone's shooting, that person must be jumping when shooting.
- Therefore, Windy must be jumping when shooting.
- The context also states: "Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter."
- Since Windy can jump when shooting, Windy must be a great shooter.

**Conclusion:** True.

**Question 3:** *Peter can block Windy's shooting.*

- From the context: "If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting." This implies height is a factor in blocking.
- Peter is taller than Michael (given).
- Michael is taller than everyone in his class (given), but Windy's height relative to Michael or Peter is not explicitly stated.
- However, we know Michael cannot block Windy's shooting because Windy jumps when shooting.
- Peter is taller than Michael, so Peter might be able to block Windy's shooting *if* height alone determines blocking. But the context specifies that Michael can block shooting *only if* the shooter does not jump. Since Windy jumps, Michael cannot block, but it does not say whether Peter can block a jumping shooter.
- The context does not provide information about whether Peter (or any taller person) can block a jumping shooter. The blocking rule is only explicitly stated for non-jumping shooters relative to Michael.
- Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether Peter can block Windy's shooting.

**Conclusion:** Unknown.
