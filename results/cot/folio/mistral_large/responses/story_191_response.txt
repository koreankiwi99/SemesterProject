Story ID: 191
Premises: A natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.
If the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.
Machine translation is a natural language processing task.
The output of machine translation is a text sequence.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

**Question 1: Is the statement "Machine translation is a language generation task" true, false, or uncertain?**

1. The context states that a natural language processing (NLP) task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.
2. It also states that if the output of an NLP task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.
3. Machine translation is given as an example of an NLP task.
4. The output of machine translation is a text sequence.
5. Therefore, since the output of machine translation is a text sequence, it must be a language generation task.

Conclusion: The statement is **True**.

**Question 2: Is the statement "Machine translation is a language understanding task" true, false, or uncertain?**

1. The context states that an NLP task is either a language generation task or a language understanding task (mutually exclusive categories).
2. From Question 1, we concluded that machine translation is a language generation task.
3. Since the categories are mutually exclusive, machine translation cannot be a language understanding task if it is a language generation task.
4. There is no information suggesting that a task can belong to both categories simultaneously.

Conclusion: The statement is **False**.
