### Question 1: Mike has an F1 visa.

**Reasoning:**
- The context states that Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.
- The context also states that only international students with an F1 visa need to apply for CPT or OPT to work in the US.
- Since Mike needs to apply for CPT to work, this implies he must have an F1 visa (because J1 visa holders are not mentioned as needing CPT/OPT to work).
- Therefore, the statement "Mike has an F1 visa" is **True**.

### Question 2: Mike has a J1 visa.

**Reasoning:**
- The context states that international students in the US have either an F1 or a J1 visa.
- From Question 1, we deduced that Mike has an F1 visa.
- If Mike has an F1 visa, he cannot have a J1 visa (since the two are mutually exclusive for international students in the US).
- Therefore, the statement "Mike has a J1 visa" is **False**.
