==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step:

**Question 1: ETS provides financial aid to Tom.**
- The context states that ETS provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
- It also states that those living in single-parent families or having few resources can prove economic hardship.
- Tom lives in a single-parent family, his dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.
- Since Tom meets the criteria for proving economic hardship, it logically follows that ETS would provide financial aid to Tom.
**Conclusion: True**

**Question 2: It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test.**
- The context explicitly states that it costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
- This directly confirms that the cost is below $300.
**Conclusion: True**

**Question 3: No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something.**
- The context states that ETS provides financial aid to some GRE applicants (those who prove economic hardship).
- This means at least some people taking the GRE test do receive financial aid from ETS.
- The statement claims that *no one* has financial aid provided to them by *something* (which could include ETS or other sources). Since ETS does provide aid, the statement is false.
**Conclusion: False**
