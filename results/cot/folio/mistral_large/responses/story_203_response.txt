Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

### Question 1: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Space sucks.

Reasoning:
- The context states that "Vacuums suck."
- It also states that "Space is a vacuum."
- From these two statements, we can infer that since space is a vacuum, and vacuums suck, space sucks.
- Therefore, the statement "Space sucks" is true.

### Question 2: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Space is a vampire.

Reasoning:
- The context states that "Vampires suck."
- It also states that "Space is a vacuum."
- There is no information connecting vampires to vacuums or space beyond the fact that both "suck."
- The statement "Space is a vampire" cannot be logically derived from the given information.
- Therefore, the statement is uncertain.

### Question 3: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If something is a household appliance, it sucks.

Reasoning:
- The context states that "A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck."
- This directly contradicts the statement "If something is a household appliance, it sucks," because the duster is a counterexample.
- Therefore, the statement is false.
