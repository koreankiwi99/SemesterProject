==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

---

**Question 1: Basque is a Romance language.**

- The context states that "Basque is not related to any other language."
- Romance languages are a language family, and all languages within a language family are related to each other.
- Since Basque is not related to any other language, it cannot be part of the Romance language family.
- Therefore, the statement "Basque is a Romance language" is **False**.

---

**Question 2: German is a Romance language.**

- The context states that "German is related to Spanish."
- It also states that "French and Spanish are both Romance languages."
- However, being related to a Romance language (Spanish) does not necessarily mean German is itself a Romance language. For example, German is a Germanic language, which is a different branch of the Indo-European family.
- The context does not explicitly state that German is a Romance language, nor does it provide enough information to conclude this.
- Therefore, the statement "German is a Romance language" is **Unknown** (we cannot confirm it based on the given information).

---

**Question 3: French is an Indo-European language.**

- The context states that "All Romance languages are Indo-European languages."
- It also states that "French is a Romance language."
- Therefore, since French is a Romance language, it must also be an Indo-European language.
- The statement "French is an Indo-European language" is **True**.
