Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step.

---

**Question 1:**
*Statement:* If George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose.

**Given information:**
1. If George likes music, he wants to compose.
2. If George has access to a program, he can compose.
3. If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.

**Reasoning:**
- If George likes music, then from (1), he wants to compose.
- If George has access to a program, then from (2), he can compose.
- So, if George likes music **and** has access to a program, then:
  - He wants to compose (from 1).
  - He can compose (from 2).
- From (3), if he can compose **and** wants to compose, then he will compose.

Thus, if George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose.
**Conclusion:** True.

**Question 2:**
*Statement:* If George will not compose, George cannot compose.

**Given information:**
3. If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.

**Reasoning:**
- The given rule (3) says: (can compose ∧ wants to compose) → will compose.
- The contrapositive of this rule is: ¬(will compose) → ¬(can compose ∧ wants to compose), which is equivalent to: ¬(will compose) → (¬can compose ∨ ¬wants to compose).
- The statement claims: If George will not compose, then George cannot compose (i.e., ¬will compose → ¬can compose).
- However, the contrapositive tells us that if George will not compose, then either he cannot compose **or** he does not want to compose (or both).
- The statement assumes that the only possibility is that he cannot compose, but he might also just not want to compose (even if he can).
- Thus, the statement is **not necessarily true**.

**Conclusion:** False.

**ANSWERS:**
