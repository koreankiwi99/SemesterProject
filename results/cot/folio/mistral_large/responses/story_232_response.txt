Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the provided context:

**Question 1:**
Statement: Beijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.
- The context states: "Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics Games."
- It also states: "Beijing has hosted the Summer and Winter Olympics and the Summer and Winter Paralympics."
- The first sentence confirms Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics.
- The second sentence confirms Beijing hosted the Winter Olympics (though it does not specify the year).
- Therefore, the statement is **True** because Beijing hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics (even though the Winter Olympics year is not specified, the context confirms it happened).

**Question 2:**
Statement: Beijing is located in southern China.
- The context states: "Beijing is located in Northern China."
- This directly contradicts the statement, which claims Beijing is in southern China.
- Therefore, the statement is **False**.

**Question 3:**
Statement: Beijing is the second largest Chinese city.
- The context provides information about Beijing's capital status, location, Olympic hosting, and universities.
- However, it does **not** provide any information about Beijing's population size or its ranking among Chinese cities by size.
- Without this information, we cannot determine whether Beijing is the second largest Chinese city.
