Premises: All humans are mortal.
All Greeks are humans.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's reason through the question step-by-step:

1. The first premise states: "All humans are mortal." This means that if something is a human, it is definitely mortal.
2. The second premise states: "All Greeks are humans." This means that every Greek is a human.
3. Combining these two premises, we can infer that since all Greeks are humans, and all humans are mortal, then all Greeks must be mortal.
4. The statement in question is: "Some Greeks are mortal."
5. Since we have established that all Greeks are mortal, it logically follows that at least some Greeks (in fact, all) are mortal. Therefore, the statement "Some Greeks are mortal" is true.
