Premises: All horses have hooves.
No humans have hooves.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze the question step-by-step:

1. The given information states: "All horses have hooves."
   - This means if something is a horse, it must have hooves.

2. The given information also states: "No humans have hooves."
   - This means if something is a human, it cannot have hooves.

3. The statement to evaluate is: "Some humans are horses."
   - For this statement to be true, there would have to exist at least one individual that is both a human and a horse.
   - However, from the given information:
     - All horses have hooves.
     - No humans have hooves.
   - This means humans and horses cannot share any members because their defining characteristics (having hooves or not) are mutually exclusive.
   - Therefore, it is impossible for any human to be a horse.
