Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

**Question 1: Platypuses are mammals with no teeth.**
- The context states that "Platypuses have no teeth" and "Platypuses are mammals."
- It also says "Some mammals have teeth," which implies that not all mammals necessarily have teeth.
- Therefore, the statement "Platypuses are mammals with no teeth" aligns perfectly with the given information.
- Conclusion: True.

**Question 2: Platypuses are reptiles.**
- The context explicitly states that "Platypuses are mammals."
- There is no information suggesting that platypuses are reptiles or that they could belong to both categories.
- Since mammals and reptiles are distinct classes, and the context confirms platypuses are mammals, the statement is false.
- Conclusion: False.

**Question 3: Humans are mammals.**
- The context states that "Humans have teeth" and "Some mammals have teeth."
- However, the context does not explicitly state whether humans are mammals.
- While it is common biological knowledge that humans are mammals, the given context does not provide this information.
