Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze the given information and the question step-by-step.

Given:
1. Events are either happy or sad. (This means there are no events that are neither happy nor sad, and no events are both happy and sad.)
2. At least one event is happy.

Question 1: All events are sad.

Reasoning:
- If all events were sad, this would contradict the second given statement that at least one event is happy.
- Since we know at least one event is happy, it is impossible for all events to be sad.
- Therefore, the statement "All events are sad" is false.

ANSWERS:
1: False
