==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's reason through the question step-by-step:

1. The first statement says: "All squares are four-sided." This means that if something is a square, it must have four sides.
2. The second statement says: "All four-sided things are shapes." This means that if something has four sides, it is a shape.
3. The question asks: "All squares are shapes." To determine this, we can chain the two given statements:
   - All squares are four-sided (from statement 1).
   - All four-sided things are shapes (from statement 2).
   - Therefore, all squares are shapes (by logical transitivity).

Thus, the statement "All squares are shapes" is true based on the given information.
