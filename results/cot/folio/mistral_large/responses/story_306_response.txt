Let's analyze each question step-by-step using the given context.

### Given Context:
1. If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then it has not received many negative reviews.
2. All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
3. Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
4. All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
5. The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.

### Question 1:
**Statement:** If the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out service.

#### Reasoning:
- The statement is a conditional: "If (provides take-out AND receives many negative reviews), then (rating > 4 AND does not provide take-out)."
- From the context, we know:
  - If a restaurant receives many negative reviews, it cannot be listed in Yelp’s recommendations (from 1).
  - If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, it must have a rating > 4 (from 2).
  - Thus, if a restaurant receives many negative reviews, it cannot have a rating > 4 (because that would require it to be listed in Yelp’s recommendations, which it cannot be).
- The premise of the conditional is: "provides take-out AND receives many negative reviews."
  - If the store receives many negative reviews, then its rating cannot be > 4 (as reasoned above).
  - The conclusion of the conditional is: "rating > 4 AND does not provide take-out."
    - The first part ("rating > 4") is false if the premise is true (because receiving many negative reviews implies rating ≤ 4).
    - Thus, the entire conclusion is false if the premise is true.
- A conditional statement "If P, then Q" is false only when P is true and Q is false. Here, if P is true (provides take-out AND receives many negative reviews), then Q is false (rating > 4 is false). Thus, the entire conditional is false.

#### Answer:
False

### Question 2:
**Statement:** The Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service or does not receive many negative reviews.

#### Reasoning:
- From the context (point 5), the Hamden Plaza Subway store either:
  - Has a rating > 4, or
  - Is popular among local residents (which implies rating > 4, from point 4).
- Thus, the Hamden Plaza Subway store must have a rating > 4 (because both options lead to rating > 4).
- From point 2, if a restaurant has a rating > 4, it is listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
- From point 1, if a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, it has not received many negative reviews.
- Thus, the Hamden Plaza Subway store has not received many negative reviews.
- The statement is: "provides take-out OR does not receive many negative reviews."
  - We know it does not receive many negative reviews, so the "OR" statement is true (only one part of an "OR" needs to be true).

#### Answer:
True

### Question 3:
**Statement:** The Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service.

#### Reasoning:
- From the context, we know:
  - The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating > 4 (as reasoned in Question 2).
  - Some restaurants that do not provide take-out receive many negative reviews (point 3), but this does not imply anything about restaurants that *do* provide take-out.
  - There is no information linking the Hamden Plaza Subway store's take-out service to its rating or reviews.
- The statement claims that the Hamden Plaza store *does not* provide take-out service. However:
  - The context does not provide any information about whether the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out or not.
  - It could provide take-out or not; we cannot determine this from the given information.

#### Answer:
Unknown

### Final Answers:
ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: Unknown
