### Question 1: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? "Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm."

- From the context, we know that *some* show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses. This does not necessarily mean that *all* shows airing at 8 pm on Monday give out roses, nor does it specify which show this is.
- The show that gives out roses at 8 pm on Monday is implied to be The Bachelor (from point 2).
- Breaking Bad is explicitly stated to be a show, but there is no information linking it to the Monday 8 pm time slot.
- Since the context does not provide any connection between Breaking Bad and the Monday 8 pm time slot, we cannot confirm or deny this statement.

**Conclusion for Question 1:** Unknown.

---

### Question 2: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? "Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm."

- From point 2, if a show gives out roses on TV, then it is The Bachelor. This means no other show gives out roses on TV.
- Breaking Bad is not The Bachelor (since The Bachelor is a reality TV show and Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, from points 4 and 6).
- Therefore, Breaking Bad cannot be a show in which roses are given out.
- The statement claims that Breaking Bad is such a show, which contradicts the given information.

**Conclusion for Question 2:** False.

---

### Question 3: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? "If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm."

- From point 2, if a show gives out roses, it must be The Bachelor. Breaking Bad is not The Bachelor (as established in Question 2).
- Therefore, the premise "roses are given out during Breaking Bad" is impossible (false) based on the given information.
- In logic, if the premise of an implication is false, the entire implication is considered true (a false premise makes the implication vacuously true).
- Thus, the statement "If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm" is logically true, even though the premise is false.

**Conclusion for Question 3:** True.
