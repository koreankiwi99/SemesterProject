Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step using the given information.

### Given Information:
1. No baked sweets are spicy.
2. All cupcakes are baked sweets.
3. All mala hotpots are spicy.
4. All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.
5. Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets.

### Key Deductions:
- From (2) and (4): All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes, and all cupcakes are baked sweets. Thus, all products from Baked by Melissa are baked sweets.
- From (1): No baked sweets are spicy. Thus, products from Baked by Melissa are not spicy.
- From (3): All mala hotpots are spicy. Thus, mala hotpots are not baked sweets (from 1).
- From (5): Dried Thai chilies are either:
  - spicy, or
  - mala hotpots (which are spicy), or
  - not baked sweets.

This means dried Thai chilies cannot be baked sweets (because if they were baked sweets, they could not be spicy or mala hotpots, but (5) says they must be one of those three). Thus:
- Dried Thai chilies are not baked sweets.
- Since all products from Baked by Melissa are baked sweets, dried Thai chilies cannot be products of Baked by Melissa.

### Question 1: Dried Thai chilies are products of Baked by Melissa.
- From the above, dried Thai chilies are not baked sweets, and all products from Baked by Melissa are baked sweets. Thus, this statement is False.

### Question 2: Dried Thai chilies are not products of Baked by Melissa.
- This is the negation of Question 1. Since Question 1 is False, this statement is True.

### Question 3: Dried Thai chilies are a mala hotpot.
- From (5), dried Thai chilies could be a mala hotpot, but they could also be spicy (without being a mala hotpot) or not baked sweets. The information does not definitively say they are a mala hotpot. Thus, this is Unknown.

### Question 4: Dried Thai chilies are neither products of Baked by Melissa nor baked sweets.
- From the deductions, dried Thai chilies are not baked sweets, and thus not products of Baked by Melissa. This statement is True.

### Question 5: Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes and products of Baked by Melissa.
- Dried Thai chilies are not baked sweets (from deductions), and cupcakes are baked sweets. Thus, they cannot be cupcakes or products of Baked by Melissa. This statement is False.

### Final Answers:
