Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

### Given Context:
1. All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
2. If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
3. Some stocks are growth stocks.
4. All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
5. KO is a mature stock.

### Question 1: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? KO is a stock.

**Reasoning:**
- The context states that "KO is a mature stock."
- The context also states that "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund," which implies that mature stocks are a subset of stocks (since only stocks can be suitable for a retirement fund).
- Therefore, KO is a stock.

**Conclusion:** True.

---

### Question 2: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? KO is a stock and a growth stock.

**Reasoning:**
- From Question 1, we know KO is a stock.
- The context states that "KO is a mature stock."
- The context also states that "All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund," while "If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund."
- Growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation (from statement 1), so they are not suitable for a retirement fund.
- Since KO is a mature stock, it cannot be a growth stock (because growth stocks are not suitable for retirement funds, but mature stocks are).
- Therefore, KO is not a growth stock.

**Conclusion:** False.

---

### Question 3: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.

**Reasoning:**
- The statement is a conditional: "If (KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation), then (KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile)."
- We know from the context that KO is a mature stock, so it is not a growth stock (as established in Question 2).
- The first part of the conditional ("KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation") is false because:
  - KO is not a growth stock.
  - KO is a mature stock, and mature stocks are not bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation (since growth stocks are the ones bought for that purpose, and mature stocks are suitable for retirement funds, which are not for rapid price appreciation).
- In logic, if the premise of a conditional is false, the entire conditional statement is true (a false premise makes the implication vacuously true).
- Therefore, the statement is true regardless of the truth of the conclusion ("KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile").

**Conclusion:** True.
