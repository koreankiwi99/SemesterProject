==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step using the given information.

### Given Information Recap:
1. All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
2. All people who invite others to their ceremony make wedding plans.
3. Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to their ceremony.
4. Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
5. If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
   - This can be rephrased as: If John is engaged, then John does not (invite friends to their ceremony AND make wedding plans). This is equivalent to: If John is engaged, then either John does not invite friends to their ceremony OR John does not make wedding plans.
6. If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.

### Question 1: Is the statement "John has a larger family" true, false, or uncertain?
- From the given information, we know that some people with well-attended weddings have larger families (statement 4). However, this does not guarantee that John has a larger family.
- From statement 6: If John has a larger family, then either he has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to his ceremony.
   - But from statement 5: If John is engaged, then he does not (invite friends AND make wedding plans). This implies that if John is engaged, he cannot both invite friends and make wedding plans. However, this does not directly contradict statement 6.
   - There is no information that directly confirms or denies that John has a larger family. We cannot conclude this from the given statements.
- Thus, the statement is **Unknown**.

### Question 2: Is the statement "John does not have a larger family" true, false, or uncertain?
- This is the negation of Question 1. Since we cannot confirm that John has a larger family, we also cannot confirm that he does not have a larger family.
- The given information does not provide any direct evidence to support or refute this statement.
- Thus, the statement is **Unknown**.

### Question 3: Is the statement "John is engaged" true, false, or uncertain?
- From statement 5: If John is engaged, then he does not (invite friends AND make wedding plans).
   - However, this does not tell us whether John is engaged or not; it only gives a condition if he is engaged.
- From statement 2: All people who invite others to their ceremony make wedding plans. This does not directly relate to John's engagement status.
- There is no direct information confirming or denying that John is engaged.
- Thus, the statement is **Unknown**.

### Question 4: Is the statement "John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding" true, false, or uncertain?
- Let's break this into two parts:
   1. John does not have a larger family.
   2. John does not invite others to his wedding.
- From Question 2, we concluded that "John does not have a larger family" is Unknown.
- For the second part: If John does not invite others to his wedding, then from statement 2, he does not make wedding plans. From statement 1, if he does not make wedding plans, he is not necessarily not engaged (since the converse of statement 1 is not given).
   - However, from statement 5: If John is engaged, then he does not (invite friends AND make wedding plans). This does not directly say anything about inviting others (not necessarily friends) to the wedding.
   - There is no direct information confirming or denying that John invites others to his wedding.
- Since both parts of the statement are Unknown, the entire statement is **Unknown**.

### Summary:
1. Unknown
2. Unknown
3. Unknown
4. Unknown

However, let's re-examine Question 4 more carefully:
- The statement is: "John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding."
   - This is equivalent to: John does not have a larger family AND John does not invite others to his wedding.
- From statement 6: If John has a larger family, then either he has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to his ceremony.
   - The contrapositive of this is: If John does not have a well-attended wedding AND does not invite friends to his ceremony, then John does not have a larger family.
   - But we don't know if John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to his ceremony.
- From statement 5: If John is engaged, then he does not (invite friends AND make wedding plans). This does not directly say anything about inviting others (not necessarily friends) to the wedding.
- There is no direct information confirming or denying that John invites others to his wedding or has a larger family.
- Thus, the statement is still **Unknown**.
