==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

---

**Question 1: Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.**

- The context states: "Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor."
- Djokovic is at the mixer, so he must be either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.
- The context also states: "Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid."
- We know: "All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes," and "Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player."
- If Djokovic were a Grand Slam champion, he would be a professional tennis player, hence an athlete, and thus famous (from "If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous").
- The conditional statement about Djokovic says that if he is a famous athlete, then he is well-paid. Since being a Grand Slam champion would make him a famous athlete, this conditional would hold.
- However, the context does **not** explicitly state that Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion. He could also be an Oscar-nominated actor.
- Since the context does not provide definitive information that Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion (he could be an Oscar-nominated actor instead), we cannot conclude this with certainty.

**Conclusion for Question 1: Unknown**

---

**Question 2: Djokovic lives in a tax haven.**

- From the context: "All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens."
- To conclude that Djokovic lives in a tax haven, we must establish that he is well-paid.
- The conditional about Djokovic says: "if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid."
- For Djokovic to be well-paid, he must be a famous athlete.
- For Djokovic to be a famous athlete, he must be an athlete (from "If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous").
- For Djokovic to be an athlete, he must be a professional tennis player (from "All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes").
- For Djokovic to be a professional tennis player, he must be a Grand Slam champion (from "Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player").
- However, as established in Question 1, we do not know for certain whether Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion. He could be an Oscar-nominated actor instead.
- If Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, then:
  - He is a celebrity (from "All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities").
  - If he is a celebrity, then he is well-paid (from "If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid").
  - If he is well-paid, then he lives in a tax haven (from "All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens").
- Thus, whether Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor, he would be well-paid and thus live in a tax haven.

**Conclusion for Question 2: True**

---

**Question 3: Djokovic does not live in a tax haven.**

- This is the negation of Question 2.
- Since we concluded that Djokovic **does** live in a tax haven, this statement is false.

**Conclusion for Question 3: False**

1: Unknown
