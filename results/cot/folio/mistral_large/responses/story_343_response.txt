### Question 1: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? *1984 is printed text.*

**Reasoning:**
- From statement 5: If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.
- From statement 4: If 1984 is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.
- However, we do not know whether 1984 is a streaming service. The statement "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book" does not tell us whether 1984 *is* a streaming service; it only provides a conditional implication.
- Without knowing whether 1984 is a streaming service, we cannot conclude that 1984 is a hardcover book or printed text.
- Additionally, there is no other information linking 1984 to printed text directly.

Thus, the statement "1984 is printed text" is **Unknown**.

### Question 2: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? *1984 is a streaming service.*

**Reasoning:**
- The given information does not provide any direct evidence about whether 1984 is a streaming service.
- The only relevant statement is the conditional: "If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book." This does not assert that 1984 *is* a streaming service; it only describes a consequence *if* it were.
- There is no way to determine from the given information whether 1984 is a streaming service.

Thus, the statement "1984 is a streaming service" is **Unknown**.

---

### Question 3: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? *1984 is not a streaming service.*

**Reasoning:**
- This is the negation of Question 2.
- As established in Question 2, we have no information about whether 1984 is a streaming service.
- The given statements do not rule out the possibility that 1984 is a streaming service, nor do they confirm it.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude that 1984 is *not* a streaming service.

Thus, the statement "1984 is not a streaming service" is **Unknown**.
