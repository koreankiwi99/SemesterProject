Story ID: 350
Premises: All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.

Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze the given information and each question step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
2. No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
3. Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.
4. All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
5. All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
6. If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.

### Key Deductions:
- From (1) and (2): Since no brutalist buildings Max adores have interesting geometries, but all Zaha Hadid's designs Max adores do have interesting geometries, Max cannot adore any brutalist buildings that are Zaha Hadid's designs. This implies that no brutalist buildings Max adores are Zaha Hadid's designs.
- From (3): Max only adores Zaha Hadid's or Kelly Wearstler's designs. Since brutalist buildings Max adores cannot be Zaha Hadid's (from above), they must be Kelly Wearstler's designs. But from (2), brutalist buildings Max adores do not have interesting geometries, and from (4) and (5), Kelly Wearstler's designs Max adores are evocative and dreamy. This seems contradictory because (6) says that if a design has interesting geometries, it is brutalist and evocative, but brutalist buildings Max adores do not have interesting geometries. This suggests that Max does not adore any brutalist buildings at all (because if he did, they would have to be Kelly Wearstler's, but then they would be evocative and dreamy, yet not have interesting geometries, which contradicts (6) if they were to have interesting geometries). Thus, it is likely that Max does not adore any brutalist buildings.
- From (4) and (5): All Kelly Wearstler's designs Max adores are both evocative and dreamy.
- From (1) and (6): If a design has interesting geometries, it must be Zaha Hadid's (from (1)) and also brutalist and evocative (from (6)). But from (2), no brutalist buildings Max adores have interesting geometries, so this creates a contradiction unless no designs with interesting geometries are adored by Max. But (1) says Zaha Hadid's designs Max adores have interesting geometries, so this implies Max does not adore any Zaha Hadid's designs (because if he did, they would have interesting geometries, which would require them to be brutalist and evocative, but brutalist buildings Max adores do not have interesting geometries). Thus, Max must only adore Kelly Wearstler's designs.
- Therefore, Max only adores Kelly Wearstler's designs, which are all evocative and dreamy, and none of the designs Max adores are brutalist or have interesting geometries.

### Question 1: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? A design by Max is a brutalist building.
- From the deductions, Max does not adore any brutalist buildings. Thus, the statement "A design by Max is a brutalist building" is false.

### Question 2: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? A design by Max is evocative and dreamy.
- From the deductions, all designs Max adores are Kelly Wearstler's, and all Kelly Wearstler's designs Max adores are evocative and dreamy. Thus, the statement is true.

### Question 3: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy.
- Since all designs Max adores are both evocative and dreamy, they are certainly either evocative or dreamy (in fact, they are both). Thus, the statement is true.

### ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
