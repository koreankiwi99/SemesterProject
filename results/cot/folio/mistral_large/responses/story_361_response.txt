Story ID: 361
Premises: If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's reason through each question step-by-step:

**Question 1:**
1. Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.
2. If Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing, then he is not notably tidy (from the given context).
3. If Peter is cleanly, then he is notably tidy (from the given context).
4. Therefore, if Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, he would be both notably tidy and not notably tidy, which is a contradiction.
5. Hence, Peter must be a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.
6. Since Peter is not cleanly, he is not notably tidy.

**Question 2:**
1. Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.
2. If Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing, then he is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try (from the given context).
3. If Peter is not cleanly, then he does not value order and spotlessness (from the given context).
4. If Peter does not value order and spotlessness, then his family does not prioritize order and spotlessness (from the given context).
5. Therefore, Peter is either a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, or his family does not prioritize order and spotlessness.
6. Since the statement includes "or," it is true if either condition is met.

**Question 3:**
1. Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.
2. If Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing, then he is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try (from the given context).
3. If Peter is cleanly, then he values order and spotlessness (from the given context).
4. If Peter values order and spotlessness, then his family prioritizes order and spotlessness (from the given context).
5. Therefore, if Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, he would be both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness.
6. However, from Question 1, we know Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly.
7. Therefore, Peter is neither a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness.
8. Since the statement includes "or," it is true if either condition is met.

**ANSWERS:**
1: False
2: True
3: True
