Let's analyze each question step-by-step using the given information.

### Given Information Recap:
1. If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition.
   - Student job → Need money for tuition
2. If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus.
   - Order takeout frequently → Student job
3. People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.
   - Order takeout frequently ∨ Enjoy dining hall meals
4. If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters.
   - Enjoy dining hall meals → Not picky
5. If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.
   - Enjoy dining hall meals → Spend time in dining halls
6. Hannah is at Mary's school.
7. Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.
   - Hannah has a student job.
   - Need money for tuition → (¬picky ∧ ¬need money for tuition)

### Question 1: Does Hannah need to earn money to help pay for her college tuition?
From (1) and (7):
- Hannah works in a student job → She needs to earn money for tuition (from 1).
- But (7) says: If she needs to earn money for tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money for tuition.
  - This is a contradiction because "need money for tuition" cannot imply "¬need money for tuition."
  - The only way this implication holds is if the premise ("need money for tuition") is false. Otherwise, the implication is false.
Thus, Hannah cannot need money for tuition (otherwise the implication in (7) would be false). Therefore, the statement "Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition" is **False**.

### Question 2: Is Hannah at Mary's school and she is not a picky eater and spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls?
From (3) and (7):
- Hannah is at Mary's school, so she either orders takeout frequently or enjoys dining hall meals.
- From (2), if she orders takeout frequently, then she works in a student job (which she does). But from (1), working in a student job implies needing money for tuition, which we've established is false (from Question 1). Thus, she cannot order takeout frequently (because that would imply needing money for tuition, which is false).
- Therefore, she must enjoy dining hall meals (from 3, since the "order takeout frequently" option is impossible).
From (4) and (5):
- If she enjoys dining hall meals, then she is not picky (from 4).
- If she enjoys dining hall meals, then she spends a lot of time in dining halls (from 5).
Thus, Hannah is not picky and spends a lot of time in dining halls. The statement is **True**.

### Question 3: Is Hannah at Mary's school and she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls?
From Question 2, we know:
- Hannah is not picky (from 4, since she enjoys dining hall meals).
The statement is: "Hannah is at Mary's school and (¬picky ∨ (picky → spend time in dining halls))."
- Since Hannah is at Mary's school and ¬picky is true, the entire statement is true (because the first part of the "or" is true).
Thus, the statement is **True**.

### Final Answers:
ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
