==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step using the given context.

---

**Question 1: Is Coco Gauff among the most active Grand-Slam players?**

- From the context: "If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis."
- Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022, and all female players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
- Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
- Since Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022 and female, she lost to Iga Świątek, so she is ranked highly by the WTA.
- Therefore, Coco Gauff is one of the most active players in major tennis (which includes Grand Slams).

**Conclusion:** True.

**Question 2: Has Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal?**

- From the context: "All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal."
- Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.
- The context states: "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022."
- We already established Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA (from Question 1 reasoning).
- The implication means that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA (which she is), then she is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
- Since Coco Gauff is not male, the statement about male players losing to Rafael Nadal does not apply to her.
- There is no information suggesting Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal.

**Conclusion:** False.

---

**Question 3: Is Coco Gauff not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis?**

- From the context: Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022 and female, so she lost to Iga Świątek.
- From Question 1 reasoning, Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA, so she is one of the most active players in major tennis.
- The statement claims Coco Gauff is **not** both:
  - A player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 (True, she did)
  - One of the most active players in major tennis (True, she is)
- The negation of "both" would be False, because both conditions are actually True.

**Conclusion:** False.
