Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

### Given Information Recap:
1. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
2. Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
3. Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
4. If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
5. All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
6. No managers work remotely from home.
7. James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.

### Key Deductions:
- From (7): James is in the company today ↔ James is a manager.
- From (6): No managers work remotely from home. So if James is a manager, he does not work remotely from home.
- From (4): If an employee has lunch at home, they work remotely from home. So if James works remotely from home, he has lunch at home (contrapositive: if James does not have lunch at home, he does not work remotely from home).
- From (5): If James is in other countries, he works remotely from home (and thus has lunch at home, from (4)).
- From (2) and (1): If James has lunch in the company building, he schedules meetings with customers, and thus goes to the company building today. But from (7), James is in the company today only if he is a manager. So if James has lunch in the company building, he must be a manager.

### Question 1: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? James has lunch in the company.
- From (7), James is in the company today if and only if he is a manager.
- From (2) and (1), if James has lunch in the company building, he must be a manager (as he would go to the company building today, implying he is a manager).
- However, the converse is not necessarily true: James could be a manager but not have lunch in the company building (e.g., he could have lunch at home, but this would imply he works remotely from home, which contradicts (6) because no managers work remotely from home).
- Wait: If James is a manager, he cannot work remotely from home (from (6)), so he cannot have lunch at home (from (4)). Thus, if James is a manager, he must have lunch in the company building (from (3)).
- Therefore, James is a manager ↔ James has lunch in the company building.
- But from (7), James is a manager ↔ James is in the company today.
- So James has lunch in the company building is equivalent to James being a manager, which is equivalent to James being in the company today.
- However, we do not know whether James is in the company today or not (the context does not say). Thus, we cannot determine whether James has lunch in the company building.
- Answer: Unknown.

### Question 2: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? James does not have lunch in the company.
- This is the negation of Question 1.
- From the reasoning in Question 1, we cannot determine whether James has lunch in the company building or not.
- Thus, we also cannot determine whether James does not have lunch in the company building.
- Answer: Unknown.

### Question 3: Is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James does not either have lunch at home or work remotely from home. If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries.
- This is a biconditional statement, equivalent to its contrapositive.
- Let’s break it into two parts:
  1. If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James does not either have lunch at home or work remotely from home.
     - If James is a manager: From (6), he does not work remotely from home. From (4), if he does not work remotely from home, he does not have lunch at home. So he does not have lunch at home or work remotely from home. The implication holds.
     - If James is in other countries: From (5), he works remotely from home. But the implication says he does not work remotely from home. This is a contradiction, so the implication does not hold in this case.
     - Thus, the first part is false because it fails when James is in other countries.
  2. The contrapositive: If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor in other countries.
     - From (4), if James has lunch at home, he works remotely from home. So "has lunch at home or works remotely from home" is equivalent to "works remotely from home".
     - From (6), if James works remotely from home, he is not a manager.
     - From (5), if James works remotely from home, he is not necessarily not in other countries (in fact, if he is in other countries, he works remotely from home). So the contrapositive fails here because James could be in other countries and work remotely from home.
     - Thus, the contrapositive is false because it fails when James is in other countries.
- Since both parts are false, the entire biconditional statement is false.
- Answer: False.
