==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step using the given information.

### Given Information:
1. No one nice to animals is also mean to animals.
   - This means: If someone is nice to animals, they are not mean to animals.
   - Contrapositive: If someone is mean to animals, they are not nice to animals.

2. Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
   - This means: There exists at least one grumpy person who is mean to animals.

3. All animal lovers are nice to animals.
   - This means: If someone is an animal lover, they are nice to animals.

4. All pet owners love animals.
   - This means: If someone is a pet owner, they love animals.

5. Tom is a pet owner.

### Additional Deductions:
- From (4) and (5): Tom is a pet owner → Tom loves animals.
- From (3): Tom loves animals → Tom is nice to animals.
- From (1): Tom is nice to animals → Tom is not mean to animals.

### Question 1: Is Tom a grumpy person?
- We know Tom is not mean to animals (from above).
- From (2), some grumpy people are mean to animals, but this does not imply that all grumpy people are mean to animals, nor does it imply that all people who are mean to animals are grumpy.
- There is no information linking Tom's grumpiness to his behavior toward animals other than the fact that some grumpy people are mean to animals.
- Since Tom is not mean to animals, he could still be grumpy (if grumpiness does not necessarily imply meanness to animals), or he could not be grumpy.
- Thus, we cannot determine whether Tom is grumpy based on the given information.

**Answer: Unknown**

### Question 2: Is Tom not both a grumpy person and mean to animals?
- From earlier, we know Tom is not mean to animals (because he is nice to animals).
- The statement "Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals" is equivalent to "It is not the case that Tom is grumpy AND Tom is mean to animals."
- Since Tom is not mean to animals, the entire "grumpy AND mean to animals" statement is false, so "not (grumpy AND mean to animals)" is true.
- Thus, the statement is true regardless of whether Tom is grumpy or not.

**Answer: True**

---

### Question 3: If Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.
- The premise "Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals" is true (from Question 2).
- The conclusion is "Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover."
- We know Tom is an animal lover (from "Tom is a pet owner" and "All pet owners love animals").
- The conclusion claims Tom is not an animal lover, which contradicts what we know.
- Thus, the conclusion is false.
- The statement is of the form "If P, then Q," where P is true and Q is false. This makes the entire implication false.

**Answer: False**
