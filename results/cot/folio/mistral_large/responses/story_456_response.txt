==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step using the given information.

### Given Information:
1. Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
   - This means at least one professional basketball player is not American, but it does not exclude the possibility that some are American.
2. All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
3. If someone can do jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
4. If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles.
5. Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

### Logical Deductions:
- From (4) and (5): If Yuri does not activate his leg muscles, then he does not leap straight into the air (contrapositive of (4)).
- From (3) and the above: If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then he cannot do jump shots (contrapositive of (3)).
- From (2) and the above: If Yuri cannot do jump shots, then he is not a professional basketball player (contrapositive of (2)).

Thus, we can conclude: Yuri is not a professional basketball player.
