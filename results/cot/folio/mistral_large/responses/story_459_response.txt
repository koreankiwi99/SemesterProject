Let's analyze each question step-by-step using the given information.

### Given Information Recap:
1. Jane does not like any animals that bark.
2. All dogs are animals that bark.
3. Jane likes all animals that jump.
4. If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
5. If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.
6. KiKi is an animal.
7. If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.

### Question 1: Is KiKi terricolous?
- From point 5: If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.
  - This is equivalent to: terricolous → has legs.
  - The contrapositive is: does not have legs → not terricolous.
- From point 4: If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
  - This is equivalent to: has legs → jumps.
  - The contrapositive is: does not jump → does not have legs.
- From point 7: If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
  - This is a conditional statement: (¬jumps ∧ ¬has legs) → (terricolous ∨ has legs).
  - The contrapositive is: ¬(terricolous ∨ has legs) → ¬(¬jumps ∧ ¬has legs), which simplifies to: (¬terricolous ∧ ¬has legs) → (jumps ∨ has legs).
  - This does not directly help us determine if KiKi is terricolous.

Now, let's consider possibilities for KiKi:
- If KiKi jumps:
  - From point 4, if KiKi jumps, it could be because KiKi has legs (but not necessarily).
  - If KiKi has legs, then from point 5, KiKi could be terricolous (but not necessarily).
  - If KiKi does not have legs, then from point 5's contrapositive, KiKi is not terricolous.
- If KiKi does not jump:
  - From point 4's contrapositive, KiKi does not have legs.
  - From point 5's contrapositive, KiKi is not terricolous.
  - From point 7, if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. But we've deduced KiKi does not have legs, so KiKi must be terricolous. However, this contradicts the earlier deduction that KiKi is not terricolous (from point 5's contrapositive). This means the assumption that KiKi does not jump leads to a contradiction, so KiKi must jump.

Thus, KiKi must jump. But this does not necessarily mean KiKi is terricolous. KiKi could jump for other reasons (e.g., kangaroos jump but are not necessarily terricolous in the sense of living exclusively on land). The information does not conclusively determine whether KiKi is terricolous.

**Conclusion for Q1: Unknown.**

### Question 2: Is KiKi a barking dog?
- From point 2: All dogs are animals that bark.
  - So if KiKi is a dog, KiKi barks.
- But we have no information about whether KiKi is a dog or not.
- From point 1 and 3, Jane's preferences do not provide information about KiKi's species or barking.
- From the deductions in Q1, KiKi jumps, but this does not imply anything about barking or being a dog.

**Conclusion for Q2: Unknown.**

### Question 3: Does KiKi not bark and is he not a dog?
- From Q1, we deduced that KiKi jumps.
- From point 4: If an animal has legs, then it jumps. So KiKi could have legs (but not necessarily).
- From point 2: All dogs bark. So if KiKi is a dog, KiKi barks.
- The statement is: KiKi does not bark and is not a dog.
  - For this to be true, both parts must be true: KiKi does not bark, and KiKi is not a dog.
  - We have no information about whether KiKi barks or is a dog, except that if KiKi were a dog, KiKi would bark.
  - The statement does not claim KiKi is a dog, so the second part ("is not a dog") could be true.
  - The first part ("does not bark") could also be true, as there is no evidence KiKi barks.
  - However, we cannot confirm either part with certainty.

But let's think differently: The statement is a conjunction ("and"), so for it to be true, both parts must be true. For it to be false, at least one part must be false. For it to be unknown, we cannot determine the truth of at least one part.

- We cannot confirm that KiKi does not bark (could be true or false).
- We cannot confirm that KiKi is not a dog (could be true or false).
- Thus, the entire statement is unknown.

However, the statement is "KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog." If KiKi were a dog, then KiKi would bark (from point 2), so the statement "KiKi does not bark and is not a dog" would be false (because if KiKi is a dog, the first part is false). But we don't know if KiKi is a dog. If KiKi is not a dog, then the second part is true, and the first part could be true or false (no info). So the entire statement could be true or false depending on whether KiKi is a dog and whether KiKi barks.

But the question is whether the statement is true, false, or uncertain. Since we cannot determine with certainty, the answer is Unknown.

**Conclusion for Q3: Unknown.**
