All monkeys are mammals. 
Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds.

Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step using the given information.

### Given Information Recap:
1. All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.
2. All monkeys are mammals.
3. Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds.
4. Peter's birds can fly.
5. All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
6. If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
7. Rock is Peter's pet.
8. Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.

### Additional Deductions:
- From (3), Peter's pets are only monkeys or birds. So Rock is either a monkey or a bird.
- From (2), all monkeys are mammals, so if Rock is a monkey, Rock is a mammal.
- From (1), if Rock is a mammal (i.e., a monkey), then Rock is an animal.
- From (5), all animals that are Peter's pets can breathe, so Rock can breathe (since Rock is a pet, and if Rock is an animal, this holds; if Rock is a bird, birds are animals because all mammals are animals and birds are not mammals, but the context implies all pets are animals).
- From (8), Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. But from (5), Rock can breathe (since Rock is a pet and all pets can breathe), so the "Rock cannot breathe" option is false. Thus, Rock can fly or Rock is a bird (or both).

### Question 1: Is Rock a monkey?
- Rock is either a monkey or a bird (from 3).
- If Rock is a bird, then from (4), Rock can fly. From (6), if Rock can fly, then Rock has wings.
- If Rock is a monkey, then Rock is a mammal (from 2), and thus an animal (from 1), and can breathe (from 5).
- The given information does not force Rock to be a monkey or a bird; both are possible. For example:
   - Rock could be a bird (and thus not a monkey).
   - Rock could be a monkey (and thus not a bird).
- Thus, we cannot definitively say Rock is a monkey.

Answer: Unknown.

### Question 2: Does Rock have wings?
- From (8) and the deduction that Rock can breathe, we know Rock can fly or Rock is a bird (or both).
   - If Rock can fly, then from (6), Rock has wings.
   - If Rock is a bird, then from (4), Rock can fly, and thus from (6), Rock has wings.
- In both cases (Rock can fly or Rock is a bird), Rock has wings.
- Thus, Rock must have wings.

Answer: True.

### Question 3: Does Rock not have wings?
- From Question 2, we concluded that Rock has wings.
- Thus, "Rock does not have wings" is false.

Answer: False.

### Final Answers:
ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
