==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

**Question 1: Some Heck cattle are artificially selected.**

- The context states that "Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals."
- It also states that "Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs."
- Since breeding back involves artificial selection, and Heck cattle were bred back, it follows that Heck cattle were artificially selected.
- Therefore, the statement "Some Heck cattle are artificially selected" is true.

**Question 2: Aurochs are extinct.**

- The context states that "Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals."
- It also mentions that Heck cattle were bred back to resemble the aurochs.
- However, the context does not explicitly state whether aurochs are extinct or not. It only implies that some animals bred back resemble extinct animals, but this does not necessarily confirm the extinction status of aurochs.
- Therefore, the statement "Aurochs are extinct" is uncertain based on the given information.
