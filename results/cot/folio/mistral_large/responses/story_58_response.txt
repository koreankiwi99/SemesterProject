Let's analyze each question step-by-step based on the given context.

### Question 1: Walden contains knowledge.
- The context states: "Books contain tons of knowledge."
- "Walden" is a book.
- Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that "Walden" contains knowledge.
- **Conclusion**: True.

### Question 2: Harry is smarter than before.
- The context states: "Harry read the book 'Walden' by Henry Thoreau."
- It also states: "When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge."
