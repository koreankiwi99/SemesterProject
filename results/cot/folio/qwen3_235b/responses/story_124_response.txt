Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1:  
To determine if Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico (NM), we start with the given facts. The Picuris Mountains are in NM or Texas (TX). The Harding Pegmatite Mine is in the Picuris Mountains and was donated. Additionally, there are no mountain ranges in TX with donated mines. Since the Harding Mine is donated and located in the Picuris Mountains, the Picuris Mountains cannot be in TX (due to the contradiction with the rule about TX). Therefore, the Picuris Mountains must be in NM. Since Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains, which are in NM, the statement "Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico" is **true**.

Question 2:  
The question is whether Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in Texas. While the text specifies that Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains (which we know are in NM), it does not provide any information about whether he visited any mountain ranges in TX. Since the text only confirms his visit to a mountain range in NM and does not address his travels to other regions, we cannot conclude whether he did or did not visit a mountain range in TX. Thus, the statement is **uncertain**.

Question 3:  
The statement is "The Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico." From the earlier reasoning, we established that the Picuris Mountains (where the mine is located) cannot be in TX due to the presence of the donated mine in contradiction with the rule that no TX mountain ranges have donated mines. Therefore, the Picuris Mountains must be in NM, meaning the Harding Pegmatite Mine is indeed located in a mountain range in NM. Thus, the statement "not located in a mountain range in New Mexico" is **false**.
