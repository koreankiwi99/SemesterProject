Story ID: 131
Premises: Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms.
Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.
The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
ANSWERS:
1: True  
2: False  

**Reasoning:**  
1. The state-of-the-art text summarization model requires labeled data (as stated in point 5). Since supervised learning relies on labeled data (per classification in supervised vs. unsupervised learning), this confirms supervised learning is used.  
2. Unsupervised learning does not require labeled data (point 2), but the training for the text summarization model explicitly requires labeled data (point 5). Thus, unsupervised learning cannot be used, making the statement false.
