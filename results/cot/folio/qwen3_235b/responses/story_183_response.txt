### Analysis of Each Question

---

#### **Question 1: Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class.**

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

- **Premise 1**: "Michael is taller than everyone else in his class."
- **Premise 2**: "Peter is taller than Michael."
- **Inference**: If Peter is taller than Michael, and Michael is taller than all in his class, then Peter must also be taller than everyone in Michael's class.
- **Conclusion**: The statement "Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class" is **False** because Peter is taller than every man in Michael's class.

#### **Question 2: Windy is a great shooter.**

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

- **Premise 1**: "Michael cannot block Windy's shot."
- **Premise 2**: "If person x is taller than person y, then x can block y's shooting." (Rule of height-based blocking)
- **Premise 3**: "Michael can block a person's shot **if the person does not jump**."
- **Premise 4**: "Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter."

**Implication of the Premises:**

- From the contrapositive of Premise 3: If Michael **cannot** block Windy, then **Windy must have jumped**.
- Therefore, Windy **jumped** when shooting.
- From Premise 4: Every shooter who jumps is a **great shooter**.
- Therefore, Windy is a **great shooter**.

**Conclusion**: The statement "Windy is a great shooter" is **True**.

#### **Question 3: Peter can block Windy's shooting.**

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

- **From Question 2 (True)**: Windy **jumped** when shooting.
- **From Question 1 (False)**: Peter is taller than **every man in Michael's class**.
- **Premise 1 (Height Transitivity)**: If x > y and y > z, then x > z.
- **Peter > Michael > class members**, but **Windy's height is not directly compared** to Michael or Peter.

**Critical Inference:**

- **Blocking requires being taller** than the shooter **and** the shooter **not jumping** (from the context and the implications of height and jumping on blockability).
- Windy **did jump**, based on Question 2.
- Therefore, **even if Peter is taller than Windy**, **Peter cannot block Windy's shot** because Windy jumped.
- However, we **do not know** whether **Peter is taller than Windy**. Windy could be in the class (Michael > Windy > Peter?), or taller than Peter.

**Conclusion**: There are **multiple possible scenarios**:
- Windy could be in the class (Michael > Windy > Peter), but he jumped → Peter can't block.
- Windy could be **taller** than Michael (and possibly Peter) → Peter can't block.
- Windy could be **shorter** than Peter and jumped → still can't be blocked.

Thus, **Peter's ability to block Windy** is **inconclusive** based on the given information.
