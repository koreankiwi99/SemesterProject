Story ID: 213
Premises: All Romance languages are Indo-European languages.
Romance languages are a language family.
All languages within a language family are related to each other.
French and Spanish are both Romance languages.
German is related to Spanish.
Basque is not related to any other language.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1: The context states that Basque is not related to any other language. Since all Romance languages are part of a language family (and thus related to each other), Basque cannot belong to the Romance family. **Answer: False.**

Question 2: The context confirms German is related to Spanish (a Romance language) but does not state that German is a Romance language. Relatedness alone does not imply inclusion in the same family, as per the third premise (relation does not necessarily mean shared family, though shared family guarantees relation). **Answer: False.**

Question 3: All Romance languages are Indo-European, and French is explicitly listed as a Romance language. Thus, French must be an Indo-European language via syllogistic inference. **Answer: True.**

ANSWERS:  
1: False  
2: False  
3: True
