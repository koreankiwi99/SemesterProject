Premises: All horses have hooves.
No humans have hooves.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
The two premises establish that all horses have hooves (H ⊂ W) and no humans have hooves (Hu ∩ W = ∅). Since horses require hooves and humans categorically lack them, there is no overlap between humans and horses. The statement "Some humans are horses" directly contradicts these premises.
