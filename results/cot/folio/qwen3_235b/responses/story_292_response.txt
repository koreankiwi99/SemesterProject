Premises: A hawk never swims. 
Some birds are hawks.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
The textual context provides two premises:  
1. "A hawk never swims" (interpreted as "No hawks swim").  
2. "Some birds are hawks" (establishing that at least some birds belong to the subset of hawks).  

**Logical deduction**:  
- From premise 1, all hawks are non-swimmers.  
- From premise 2, since some birds are hawks, there exist birds that are non-swimmers.  
- Therefore, the universal statement "All birds swim" is directly contradicted by the existence of these non-swimming birds (the hawks).  

**Answer to Q1**: The statement "All birds swim" is **false** because the premises guarantee the existence of birds (hawks) that do not swim.  

ANSWERS:  
1: False
