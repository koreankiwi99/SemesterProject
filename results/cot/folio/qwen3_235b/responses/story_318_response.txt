ANSWERS:
1: Unknown  
2: False  
3: True  

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

**Question 1:** "Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm."  
- The context states that a show airing at Monday 8 pm gives roses, and such a show must be *The Bachelor*.  
- Breaking Bad is confirmed to be a show but is explicitly not a reality TV show, while *The Bachelor* is a reality TV show (via the chain of implications).  
- However, the context provides no direct information about Breaking Bad’s air time.  
- **Conclusion:** Since no premises specify Breaking Bad’s schedule, **it cannot be determined**.  
**Answer:** **Unknown**

**Question 2:** "Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm."  
- If roses were given out in Breaking Bad, it would have to be an episode of *The Bachelor* (per premise 2).  
- However, Breaking Bad is explicitly stated to not be a reality TV show, while *The Bachelor* is a reality TV show (via premise 4).  
- Therefore, Breaking Bad cannot be an episode of *The Bachelor* and cannot give out roses at any time.  
- **Conclusion:** The statement is **directly false** due to the contradiction.  
**Answer:** **False**

**Question 3:** "If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm."  
- If roses were given out during Breaking Bad, it would have to be an episode of *The Bachelor* (premise 2).  
- *The Bachelor* has at least one episode at Monday 8 pm (premise 1), but the premises do not state that **all** *The Bachelor* episodes air at Monday 8 pm.  
- Therefore, the **time of the episode (Monday 8 pm)** is **not logically enforced** by the premises.  
- However, in classical logic, a conditional with an **impossible antecedent** (roses in Breaking Bad contradicts the premises) is **vacuously true**.  
- **Conclusion:** The implication holds **vacuously** due to the antecedent’s impossibility.  
**Answer:** **True**
