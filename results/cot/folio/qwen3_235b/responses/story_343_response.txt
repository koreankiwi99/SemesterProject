**Question 2: Is 1984 a streaming service?**  
- Assume 1984 **is** a streaming service.  
  - Premise 3: It would be **digital**.  
  - Premise 5 and 4: It would be a hardcover book → printed text → **analog**.  
  - This creates a contradiction (digital and analog cannot coexist per Premise 1).  
- Therefore, the assumption is **false**.  
**Conclusion: False**  

**Question 3: Is 1984 not a streaming service?**  
- From Question 2, the assumption of being a streaming service leads to a contradiction.  
**Conclusion: True**  

**Question 1: Is 1984 printed text?**  
- A conclusion of "printed text" requires 1984 to be a hardcover book (Premise 4).  
- However, there is **no definitive premise** to confirm or deny that 1984 is a hardcover book.  
  - It could be a hardcover book (making it printed text).  
  - It could also be neither a hardcover book nor printed text (e.g., an unpublished digital text).  
- The status of 1984 as a hardcover book is **undetermined** by the premises.  
**Conclusion: Unknown**
