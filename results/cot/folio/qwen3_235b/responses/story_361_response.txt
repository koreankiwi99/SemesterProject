Story ID: 361
Premises: If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Given Premises:
1. **If S, then not T** (S → ¬T)  
2. **C → S**  
3. **Cl → T**  
4. **V → Cl**  
5. **F → V**  
6. **Peter is either (S ∧ Cl) or (¬S ∧ ¬Cl)**

Let’s define:
- S: Spills a lot of food on clothing  
- C: Clumsy foodie  
- Cl: Is cleanly  
- V: Values order and spotlessness  
- F: Family prioritizes order and spotlessness  
- T: Is notably tidy

From (2): C → S  
→ Contrapositive: ¬S → ¬C  
Peter is ¬S (from logical conflict in 6)  
→ Therefore, ¬C  

From (6) and (S → ¬T) and (Cl → T):  
If Peter is (S ∧ Cl) → T and ¬T → contradiction  
→ So Peter must be (¬S ∧ ¬Cl)

From (3): Cl → T  
→ Since ¬Cl → T is not determined  
From (1): S → ¬T  
→ Since ¬S → ¬T is not determined  
→ Therefore, **T is unknown**  
(Answer to Q1: **Unknown**)

From (2): C → S  
→ Since ¬S → ¬C  
→ Since Peter is ¬S → Peter is ¬C  
From (5): F → V  
→ From (4): V → Cl  
→ So F → V → Cl → T  
→ But Peter is ¬Cl → ¬V → ¬F  
→ So Peter is ¬C and ¬F  
→ Therefore, **(C ∨ F) is false**  
(Answer to Q2: **False**)

From above: Peter is ¬C and ¬F  
→ Therefore, **(¬C ∧ ¬F) is true**  
→ So **(C ∧ F) ∨ (¬C ∧ ¬F)** is true  
(Answer to Q3: **True**)

### Final Answers:
ANSWERS:
1: Unknown  
2: False  
3: True
