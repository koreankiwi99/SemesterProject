Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1:  
Tom's grumpiness isn't directly addressed in the premises. The premises confirm Tom is nice to animals (via being a pet owner and thus an animal lover), but grumpiness is unrelated to this. While some grumpy people are mean to animals, being non-mean to animals doesn't exclude Tom from being grumpy. Thus, his grumpiness remains uncertain.  

**Answer 1: Uncertain**  

Question 2:  
Tom is nice to animals (N). From the first premise, N and M (mean to animals) are mutually exclusive. Since M is false, the conjunction G ∧ M must also be false (as M is false). Therefore, ¬(G ∧ M) is **true** regardless of G.  

**Answer 2: True**  

Question 3:  
The implication "If ¬(G ∧ M), then ¬G ∧ ¬L" is evaluated. Since Tom is an animal lover (L is true), ¬L is false. Thus, the consequent ¬G ∧ ¬L is false (due to ¬L). The antecedent ¬(G ∧ M) is true (as shown in Q2). The implication becomes True → False, which is **false**.  

**Answer 3: False**  

ANSWERS:  
1: Unknown  
2: True  
3: False
