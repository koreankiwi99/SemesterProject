Story ID: 456
Premises: Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. 
Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1:  
Yuri does not activate leg muscles. This implies he does not leap straight (contrapositive of "leaping → leg activation"). Since jump shots require leaping straight, Yuri cannot perform jump shots and thus is not a professional basketball player. However, the context only states that *some* professionals are non-Americans but provides no direct link between non-professionals and nationality. Yuri’s nationality remains undetermined based on the premises.  

**Answer**: Unknown.  

Question 2:  
Yuri is not a professional basketball player (as shown in Q1). Therefore, regardless of nationality, he cannot be an American professional basketball player.  

**Answer**: True.  

Question 3:  
This directly contradicts the conclusion from Q1 and Q2. Yuri is not a professional player, so this statement is false.  

**Answer**: False.  

Question 4:  
The premise "Yuri does not leap" is true (as shown in Q1). The conditional states that this implies Yuri *is* an American professional basketball player. However, we already established Yuri is *not* a professional player, so the implication's conclusion is false. A true antecedent with a false consequent makes the entire conditional false.  

**Answer**: False.  

Question 5:  
The conditional states: "If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player (which is true), then Yuri is a professional basketball player (which is false)." This creates a false implication (True → False = False).  

**Answer**: False.

**Final Answers**:  
1: Unknown  
2: True  
3: False  
4: False
