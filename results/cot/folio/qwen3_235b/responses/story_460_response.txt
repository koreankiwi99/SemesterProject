### Reasoning Summary

We are given a set of logical premises that provide various relationships between characteristics of films, such as being appropriate for all ages (A), being rated General Audience (G), being family-friendly (F), being part of the Frozen series (Fr), and containing excessive erotic/violent content (E). Additionally, specific logical implications are stated:

- A → ¬P (if a film is appropriate for all ages, children can watch it without parental guidance)
- E → P (if a film contains excessive erotic/violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance)
- G → A
- F → G
- Fr → F
- H is a film
- H is either F ∨ A

---

### Key Logical Inference

Since F → G, and G → A, then F implies A. Hence, F ∨ A is logically equivalent to A alone (since F ⊆ A). Therefore, **H is A**.

Now, A → ¬P and E → P. These together imply that A and E are mutually exclusive: **H cannot be both appropriate for all ages and contain excessive erotic/violent content**. Therefore, **E is false**.

### Question 1: Is "Hachi: A Dog’s Tale" rated General Audience?

- We know H is A.
- A is not sufficient to conclude G; only F implies G.
- So, unless H is F, we cannot infer G.
- H is F ∨ A, and we know H is A, so H may or may not be F.
- If H is F, then G is true.
- If H is not F, then G may or may not be true, as there may be other ways to be rated G (though not directly stated).
- Since we do not know whether H is F, we cannot determine G.
  
**Answer: Unknown**

### Question 2: Is "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" in the Frozen series or contains excessive erotic and violent content?

- We know E is false (as discussed above).
- Therefore, the statement reduces to: "H is in the Frozen series."
- There is no information in the premises that determines whether H is in the Frozen series.
- Hence, we cannot determine the truth of the statement.

**Answer: Unknown**

### Question 3: Does "Hachi: A Dog’s Tale" either contain excessive erotic/violent content and be in the Frozen series, **or** neither?

- The structure of the statement is: (E ∧ Fr) ∨ (¬E ∧ ¬Fr)
- We established that E is false.
- This reduces the statement to ¬Fr.
- The statement is true if and only if H is **not** in the Frozen series.
- However, we have no information about whether H is in the Frozen series.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of the statement.

**Answer: Unknown**
