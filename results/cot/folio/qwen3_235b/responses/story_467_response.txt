ANSWERS:
1: Unknown  
2: True  
3: False  

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

**Premise Analysis:**
- Peter's pets: monkeys (mammals → animals) or birds.  
- All monkeys are mammals.  
- All of Peter's birds can fly → can fly → has wings (via premise6).  
- All pets can breathe.  
- Rock is a pet; premise8: (CanFly ∨ Bird ∨ ¬Breathe). Since pets can breathe (¬Breathe is false), this reduces to (CanFly ∨ Bird).  
- Since Bird → CanFly (premise4), the disjunction requires **CanFly be true** (if Bird is false, CanFly must be true; if Bird is true, CanFly is true).  

**Implications:**
- **Rock can fly** (established via logical necessity from premise8).  
- **Rock has wings** (from premise6: if can fly → has wings).  

**Question 1: Rock is a monkey?**  
- Peter's pets are monkeys or birds (premise3).  
- Rock can fly (established), so he could be:  
  - A bird (allowed, as birds can fly).  
  - A monkey (allowed if the monkey can fly, as the premises do not prohibit monkeys from flying).  
- No premises resolve whether Rock is a bird or monkey.  
→ **Unknown**  

**Question 2: Rock has wings?**  
- Rock can fly (established).  
- All flying pets have wings (premise6).  
→ **True**  

**Question 3: Rock does not have wings?**  
- Rock must have wings (from Q2).  
→ **False**
