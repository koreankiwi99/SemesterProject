In logical terms: \u2200x (Professor(x) \u2192 (HighlyEducated(x) \u2227 ExcellentTeacher(x))).  \n   - However, the context adds: \"Nonetheless, some professors fell short of this lofty reputation.\" This means there exists at least one professor who does not satisfy the conjunction of being both highly educated and an excellent teacher. In logical terms: \u2203x (Professor(x) \u2227 \u00ac(HighlyEducated(x) \u2227 ExcellentTeacher(x))).\n\n2. **Analyze \"fell short\":**  \n   - \"Fell short of this lofty reputation\" refers directly to failing to meet the standard of being both highly educated and an excellent teacher. Thus, for some professor(s), it is not true that they are both highly educated and an excellent teacher.\n\n3. **Apply De Morgan's law:**  \n   - The expression \u00ac(HighlyEducated(x) \u2227 ExcellentTeacher(x)) is logically equivalent to \u00acHighlyEducated(x) \u2228 \u00acExcellentTeacher(x) by De Morgan's law. This means that for the professors who fell short, either being highly educated is false, or being an excellent teacher is false, or both are false.\n\n4. **Formalize the existential claim:**  \n   - From step 3, the statement about some professors falling short becomes: \u2203x (Professor(x) \u2227 (\u00acHighlyEducated(x) \u2228 \u00acExcellentTeacher(x))). This asserts that there is at least one professor for whom at least one of the properties (being highly educated or being an excellent teacher) is not true.\n\n5. **Compare to the question:**  \n   - The question asks whether the context entails that there is at least one professor for whom either being highly educated is not true, or being an excellent teacher is not true, or both.

This can be represented as: If a citizen donates (D), then they support important causes (Support). Symbolically: \\(D \\rightarrow \\text{Support}\\).  \n   - Citizens have limited time and money, so they face a constraint: They can either volunteer or they do not support important causes through donations. This constraint means that for any citizen, it must be true that they volunteer or they do not donate. Symbolically: \\(V \\lor \\neg D\\).  \n     - This is equivalent to: If a citizen does not volunteer (\\(\\neg V\\)), then they do not donate (\\(\\neg D\\)), because \\(\\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg D\\) is logically equivalent to \\(V \\lor \\neg D\\).\n\n2. **Analyze the constraint:**  \n   - The constraint \\(V \\lor \\neg D\\) applies to all citizens in the community due to limited resources. It ensures that citizens cannot both not volunteer and donate; they must choose one option: either volunteer (and help those in need) or not donate (and thus not support important causes through donations).\n\n3. **Apply the context to Luis:**  \n   - Luis is described as a \"busy working father,\" but this is contextual and does not override the general rule. As a citizen, Luis is subject to the same constraint: \\(V \\lor \\neg D\\) must hold for him.  \n   - The question asks whether Luis either \"helps those in need by volunteering\" (which implies V, since volunteering entails helping) or \"does not donate money to charity organizations\" (\\(\\neg D\\)).\n\n4. **Logical deduction for Luis:**  \n   - From \\(V \\lor \\neg D\\):  \n     - If Luis volunteers (V is true), then he helps those in need by volunteering, satisfying the first part of the disjunction.  \n     - If Luis does not volunteer (V is false), then \\(\\neg D\\) must be true (he does not donate), satisfying the second part of the disjunction.  \n   - Therefore, in all cases, Luis either helps those in need by volunteering or does not donate. This follows directly from the general constraint \\(V \\lor \\neg D\\) applied to him.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   - Based on the context, the constraint \\(V \\lor \\neg D\\) logically applies to Luis, meaning the statement about him is necessarily true. No information suggests Luis is an exception, and his status as a \"busy working father\" does not change the rule.\n\n**Answer:** Yes"

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Interpret the context:**  \n   - Studying a topic in depth (denoted as S) leads to expertise and authority on that subject (denoted as E).  \n   - Learning broadly across disciplines (denoted as B) exposes someone to diverse ideas and perspectives (denoted as D).  \n   - Students may opt to either study in depth (S) or learn broadly (B), but this is stated as a possibility (\"may opt\"), not a necessity or obligation for all students.  \n\n2. **Analyze the logical structure:**  \n   - The context provides conditional relationships:  \n     - If S, then E (S \u2192 E).  \n     - If B, then D (B \u2192 D).  \n   - The choice between S or B is presented as an option (\"students may opt\"), meaning it is possible for a student to choose S, choose B, or choose neither. There is no statement that all students must choose one of these paths.  \n\n3. **Consider Sarah's case:**  \n   - Sarah is described as a \"dedicated student,\" but this does not add new information that overrides the context. It only specifies that she is part of the group of students, but it does not imply she must engage in S or B.  \n   - Since the context only says students \"may opt\" for S or B, Sarah could potentially:  \n     - Choose S, leading to E.  \n     - Choose B, leading to D.  \n     - Choose neither S nor B (e.g., by studying superficially or focusing on something else), resulting in neither E nor D.  \n\n4. **Evaluate the entailment:**  \n   - The conclusion claims that for Sarah, either E or D must hold (E \u2228 D).  \n   - However, from the premises, it is possible for Sarah to avoid both S and B, leading to \u00acE and \u00acD, which means E \u2228 D would be false in this scenario.  \n   - Since the premises do not force Sarah to choose S or B, the conclusion E \u2228 D is not necessarily true. Therefore, the context does not entail that Sarah must gain expertise or be exposed to diverse perspectives.  \n\n5. **Conclusion on entailment:**  \n   - Entailment requires that the conclusion must follow necessarily from the premises. Here, the possibility of Sarah not engaging in S or B means the conclusion does not always hold. Thus, the premises do not entail the conclusion.  \n\nAnswer: No"

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the premises:**\n   - Premise 1: If someone takes their car for an oil change, it runs smoothly. (Logical form: OilChange \u2192 RunsSmoothly)\n   - Premise 2: If someone washes their car, it looks shiny and clean. (Logical form: Wash \u2192 LooksClean)\n   - Premise 3: This month, someone had a car that was not running smoothly or did not look clean, or both. (Logical form: \u2203x (\u00acRunsSmoothly(x) \u2228 \u00acLooksClean(x)))\n\n2. **Focus on Tyler based on the question:**\n   - Given: Tyler took his car for an oil change (OilChange(Tyler) is true).\n   - From Premise 1: OilChange \u2192 RunsSmoothly. Since OilChange(Tyler) is true, RunsSmoothly(Tyler) must be true. (Thus, \u00acRunsSmoothly(Tyler) is false.)\n\n3. **Analyze Premise 3:**\n   - Premise 3 states that there exists at least one person (not necessarily Tyler) for whom \u00acRunsSmoothly \u2228 \u00acLooksClean is true.\n   - Since RunsSmoothly(Tyler) is true, \u00acRunsSmoothly(Tyler) is false. Therefore, for Tyler, \u00acRunsSmoothly \u2228 \u00acLooksClean simplifies to \u00acLooksClean(Tyler) (because the first disjunct is false).\n   - However, Premise 3 does not specify that Tyler is the \"someone\" in question. It could be true for another individual, meaning LooksClean(Tyler) could be true or false.\n\n4. **Determine if Tyler washed his car (Wash(Tyler)):**\n   - From Premise 2: Wash \u2192 LooksClean. If LooksClean(Tyler) is true, Wash(Tyler) could be true (he washed it) or false (it became clean another way), as the implication is not bidirectional.\n   - If LooksClean(Tyler) is false, then Wash(Tyler) must be false (by contrapositive: \u00acLooksClean \u2192 \u00acWash).\n   - But Premise 3 does not force LooksClean(Tyler) to be false; it only requires that someone has \u00acLooksClean or \u00acRunsSmoothly. Since RunsSmoothly(Tyler) is true, Tyler could have LooksClean true or false without violating Premise 3.\n\n5. **Conclusion on whether Wash(Tyler) is true:**\n   - Given OilChange(Tyler) is true, we know RunsSmoothly(Tyler) is true, but we have no information about LooksClean(Tyler) or Wash(Tyler) from the premises.\n   - Wash(Tyler) cannot be logically deduced; it is possible that Tyler washed his car (LooksClean true) or did not (LooksClean false, so Wash false).\n   - Therefore, it is not necessarily true that Tyler washed his car. The question asks if it is true, and based on the premises, we cannot affirm it; it may be false.\n\n**Answer: No**"

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the premises:**\n   - Premise 1: \"When people drive safely, they avoid accidents.\" This is a conditional statement: If a person drives safely, then they avoid accidents.

Logically, for any person \\( p \\), \\( F_p \\rightarrow \\neg L_p \\), where \\( F_p \\) means \"\\( p \\) follows directions\" and \\( L_p \\) means \"\\( p \\) gets lost.\"\n   - Premise 3: \"Either someone did not avoid an accident or someone got lost, or both.\" This is a disjunction: There exists at least one person who did not avoid an accident, or at least one person who got lost, or both.

Therefore, \\( \\neg A_j \\) is false (Jane did not fail to avoid an accident).\n\n3. **Analyze the disjunction (Premise 3) with respect to Jane:**\n   - Premise 3 states that \\( \\exists p \\, (\\neg A_p) \\lor \\exists q \\, (L_q) \\) must be true.\n   - Since \\( \\neg A_j \\) is false (Jane avoided accidents), Jane does not satisfy the first part of the disjunction (\\( \\exists p \\, \\neg A_p \\)). Therefore, for the disjunction to hold, it must be that \\( \\exists q \\, L_q \\) is true\u2014meaning at least one person (possibly Jane or someone else) got lost.\n\n4. **Evaluate whether Jane must have followed directions:**\n   - We need to determine if \\( F_j \\) (Jane followed directions) must be true based on the premises.\n   - From Premise 2 (\\( F_p \\rightarrow \\neg L_p \\)), if Jane followed directions (\\( F_j \\)), then she did not get lost (\\( \\neg L_j \\)). Conversely, if Jane got lost (\\( L_j \\)), then she did not follow directions (\\( \\neg F_j \\)).\n   - However, the disjunction \\( \\exists q \\, L_q \\) does not specify who got lost. It could be Jane or another person.\n     - If Jane got lost (\\( L_j \\) is true), then \\( F_j \\) must be false (she did not follow directions).\n     - If someone else got lost (and not Jane), then \\( L_j \\) could be false, and \\( F_j \\) could be true or false (no information forces a conclusion about Jane in this case).\n   - Since \\( \\exists q \\, L_q \\) could be satisfied by Jane getting lost (where \\( F_j \\) is false) or by someone else getting lost (where \\( F_j \\) is not constrained), the premises do not require that \\( F_j \\) is true.\n\n5. **Conclusion on logical necessity:**\n   - The premises imply that Jane avoided accidents (\\( A_j \\)) due to driving safely (\\( S_j \\)).\n   - However, the disjunction allows for scenarios where Jane did not follow directions (e.g., if she got lost) or where she may have followed directions (e.g., if someone else got lost or someone else did not avoid an accident).\n   - Therefore, it is not logically necessary that Jane followed directions; the conclusion that \"she followed directions\" does not follow from the premises.\n\n**Answer: No**"

This implies that rain is possible but not certain if it is cloudy.\n   - If it rains (R), then the grass gets wet (G). This is a definite implication: R \u2192 G.\n   - If the grass is wet (G), then kids can jump in puddles. This means G enables jumping but does not guarantee that kids actually jump; it only states a possibility (G \u2192 possible K, where K is \"kids were jumping in puddles\").\n   - Either it was cloudy today (C), or kids were jumping in puddles (K), or both: C \u2228 K.\n\n2. **Given information from the question:** There was no wet grass today, so G is false (\u00acG).\n\n3. **From R \u2192 G and \u00acG:** Using modus tollens, if G is false, then R must be false (\u00acR). Therefore, it did not rain.\n\n4. **From C \u2192 might R and \u00acR:** Since it did not rain (\u00acR), and \"might\" allows for no rain even if it is cloudy, C could be true or false:\n   - If C is true, then no rain (\u00acR) is consistent with \"might rain\" (as \"might\" does not guarantee rain).\n   - If C is false, then no rain is also consistent.\n\n5. **From C \u2228 K:** This disjunction must hold true. We consider cases based on C:\n   - If C is false, then K must be true to satisfy C \u2228 K (since C false requires K true).\n   - If C is true, then C \u2228 K is satisfied regardless of K (K can be true or false).\n\n6. **K is not necessarily true:** Since C could be true (as \u00acR does not force C to be false), K can be false. For example:\n   - Scenario: C true, R false (no rain), G false, K false. This satisfies all premises: C \u2228 K holds (C true), \"might rain\" is consistent with no rain, R \u2192 G is true (R false implies anything), and G \u2192 possible K is true (G false implies anything).\n\n7. **K could be true but not forced:** If C is false, K must be true, but C could be true (allowing K false). The premises do not require K to be true when G is false, as jumping could occur without wet grass (e.g., from other water sources), and the implication G \u2192 possible K does not make G necessary for K.\n\n8. **Conclusion:** With \u00acG, it is possible that K is false (e.g., cloudy but no rain and no jumping). Therefore, we cannot conclude that kids were jumping in puddles based on the given premises and \u00acG.\n\n### Answer:\nNo"

Specifically, this person believed that if someone exercises regularly, they will gain more energy, and if someone gains energy, they have improved moods.\n2.

Since James is not explicitly mentioned in the context, I infer that James is the \"someone\" referred to, as this is a common logical assumption for coherence with the question.\n3. Therefore, James decided to start exercising regularly and holds the beliefs: (a) exercising regularly leads to gaining more energy, and (b) gaining energy leads to improved moods.\n4. From these beliefs, by transitivity, James believes that exercising regularly leads to improved moods (and thus becoming happier, as \"improved moods\" can be interpreted as increased happiness).\n5. However, beliefs do not equate to facts; they are subjective and may not reflect reality. James could hold these beliefs without them being true (e.g., due to individual differences, external factors, or incorrect assumptions).\n6. The context provides no information about the actual outcomes of James's exercise routine, such as whether he gained energy or experienced improved moods. It only describes his decision and beliefs.\n7. For the conclusion \"James became much happier\" to logically follow, the premises must necessitate this outcome.

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps\n\nTo determine if the pantry is empty when Sam starts cooking, I will analyze the given premises step by step using propositional logic. Define the propositions as follows:\n- \\( C \\): It is close to dinnertime.\n- \\( S \\): Sam starts cooking.\n- \\( G \\): Sam goes grocery shopping.\n- \\( M \\): Sam can make dinner.\n- \\( E \\): The fridge is empty.\n- \\( N \\): The pantry is empty (no ingredients).\n\nThe premises from the context are:\n1. \\( C \\rightarrow S \\): If it is close to dinnertime, then Sam starts cooking.\n2. \\( G \\rightarrow M \\): If Sam goes shopping, then Sam can make dinner.\n3. \\( C \\lor \\neg M \\) (equivalently, \\( M \\rightarrow C \\)): Either it is close to dinnertime, or Sam will not make dinner (meaning if Sam makes dinner, it must be close to dinnertime).\n4. \\( E \\rightarrow G \\): If the fridge is empty, then Sam must go shopping.\n5. \\( N \\rightarrow E \\): If there are no ingredients in the pantry, then the fridge is empty.\n\nThe question assumes \\( S \\) is true (Sam starts cooking) and asks whether \\( N \\) must be true (pantry is empty).\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the implication of \\( S \\) being true.**  \n- From premise 1, \\( C \\rightarrow S \\). Since \\( S \\) is true, this does not force \\( C \\) to be true; \\( C \\) could be true or false. If \\( C \\) is true, \\( S \\) must be true, but \\( S \\) being true does not require \\( C \\) to be true (converse fallacy).\n\n**Step 2: Consider the disjunction in premise 3 (\\( C \\lor \\neg M \\)).**  \n- This premise means \\( M \\rightarrow C \\): If Sam can make dinner (\\( M \\) true), then it must be close to dinnertime (\\( C \\) true).  \n- If \\( C \\) is false, then \\( \\neg M \\) must be true (Sam cannot make dinner).  \n- If \\( C \\) is true, \\( M \\) could be true or false.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the relationship between \\( N \\), \\( E \\), \\( G \\), and \\( M \\).**  \n- From premise 5, \\( N \\rightarrow E \\): If the pantry is empty (\\( N \\) true), then the fridge is empty (\\( E \\) true).  \n- From premise 4, \\( E \\rightarrow G \\): If the fridge is empty (\\( E \\) true), then Sam goes shopping (\\( G \\) true).  \n- From premise 2, \\( G \\rightarrow M \\): If Sam goes shopping (\\( G \\) true), then Sam can make dinner (\\( M \\) true).  \n- Therefore, if \\( N \\) is true, it implies \\( E \\) true, \\( G \\) true, \\( M \\) true, and from \\( M \\rightarrow C \\), \\( C \\) true. Then from \\( C \\rightarrow S \\), \\( S \\) true. So \\( N \\) true leads to \\( S \\) true, but this does not mean \\( S \\) true implies \\( N \\) true.\n\n**Step 4: Test if \\( S \\) true forces \\( N \\) to be true.**  \n- Assume \\( S \\) is true and \\( N \\) is false (pantry is not empty).  \n  - If \\( N \\) is false, \\( E \\) could be true or false (no implication from premise 5).  \n  - If \\( E \\) is false, \\( G \\) could be true or false (no implication from premise 4).  \n  - If \\( G \\) is false, \\( M \\) could be true or false (no implication from premise 2).  \n  - Now, consider \\( C \\):  \n    - If \\( C \\) is true, \\( M \\) could be true (if ingredients are available) or false.  \n      - Example: \\( C \\) true, \\( N \\) false, \\( E \\) false, \\( G \\) false, \\( M \\) true (if pantry has ingredients). Premises hold:  \n        - P1: \\( C \\rightarrow S \\) true (both true).  \n        - P2: \\( G \\rightarrow M \\) true (false implies true is true).  \n        - P3: \\( C \\lor \\neg M \\) true (\\( C \\) true).  \n        - P4: \\( E \\rightarrow G \\) true (false implies false is true).  \n        - P5: \\( N \\rightarrow E \\) true (false implies false is true).  \n      - Thus, \\( S \\) true and \\( N \\) false is possible.  \n    - If \\( C \\) is false, then \\( \\neg M \\) must be true (from P3).  \n      - With \\( C \\) false, \\( N \\) false is possible: e.g., \\( N \\) false, \\( E \\) false, \\( G \\) false, \\( M \\) false. Premises hold:  \n        - P1: \\( C \\rightarrow S \\) true (false implies true is true).  \n        - P2: \\( G \\rightarrow M \\) true (false implies false is true).  \n        - P3: \\( C \\lor \\neg M \\) true (\\( C \\) false, \\( \\neg M \\) true).  \n        - P4: \\( E \\rightarrow G \\) true (false implies false is true).  \n        - P5: \\( N \\rightarrow E \\) true (false implies false is true).  \n      - Thus, \\( S \\) true and \\( N \\) false is possible when \\( C \\) false.  \n- Now, if \\( S \\) true and \\( N \\) true:  \n  - As in Step 3, \\( N \\) true implies \\( M \\) true and \\( C \\) true, leading to \\( S \\) true, which is consistent but not required when \\( S \\) true.\n\n**Step 5: Determine logical necessity.**  \n- Since there are scenarios where \\( S \\) is true and \\( N \\) is false (e.g., when \\( C \\) true and pantry has ingredients, or when \\( C \\) false and pantry has ingredients), \\( S \\) true does not logically imply \\( N \\) true.  \n- The pantry being empty (\\( N \\) true) is not a necessary condition for Sam starting cooking (\\( S \\) true); it is possible for Sam to start cooking with a non-empty pantry.\n\n**Conclusion:** The conclusion that the pantry is empty does not logically follow from Sam starting cooking.\n\nAnswer: No"

The disjunction \"StudyHard \u2228 \u00acTestDifficult \u2228 (StudyHard \u2227 \u00acTestDifficult)\" is redundant because \"StudyHard \u2227 \u00acTestDifficult\" is already covered by \"StudyHard \u2228 \u00acTestDifficult\". Thus, Premise 3 is equivalent to: StudyHard \u2228 \u00acTestDifficult.\n   - Premise 4: \"It's expected that if someone earns high marks, they will be satisfied with their performance.\" \u2192 HighMarks \u2192 Satisfied\n\n2. **Question statement:** The teacher made the test very difficult, so TestDifficult is true.\n\n3. **Apply TestDifficult to Premise 3:**\n   - With TestDifficult true, \u00acTestDifficult is false.\n   - Since Premise 3 requires StudyHard \u2228 \u00acTestDifficult to be true, and \u00acTestDifficult is false, StudyHard must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore: TestDifficult \u2192 StudyHard.\n\n4. **Apply StudyHard to Premise 1:**\n   - StudyHard \u2192 HighMarks, and since StudyHard is true (from step 3), HighMarks must be true.\n\n5. **Apply HighMarks to Premise 4:**\n   - HighMarks \u2192 Satisfied, and since HighMarks is true (from step 4), Satisfied must be true.\n\n6. **Consider Premise 2 for consistency:**\n   - Premise 2 states that a difficult test may cause many students to fail, but it does not imply that no student can earn high marks (e.g., a student who studies hard might still achieve high marks). Since StudyHard is true (from step 3), HighMarks is achieved, and Premise 2 is not contradicted.\n\n**Conclusion:** Given that the test is very difficult, the student studies hard (from Premise 3), earns high marks (from Premise 1), and is therefore satisfied (from Premise 4). Premise 2 does not override this conclusion, as it allows for exceptions.\n\nAnswer: Yes"

This can be rewritten using logical equivalence: \\( P \\lor \\neg I \\) is equivalent to \\( I \\rightarrow P \\) (if the star player is injured, then the team practiced hard).\n   - Premise 4: \"When the team is well-prepared, the team wins the important game.\" \u2192 \\( \\text{Prep} \\rightarrow W \\)\n   - Premise 5: \"If the team wins the important game, they will celebrate with a team dinner afterwards.\" \u2192 \\( W \\rightarrow C \\)\n\n3. **Analyze the implication for the injured scenario (\\( I \\))**:  \n   - From Premise 3 (\\( I \\rightarrow P \\)), if the star player is injured (\\( I \\) is true), then the team practiced hard (\\( P \\) is true).\n   - From Premise 1 (\\( P \\rightarrow \\text{Prep} \\)), if \\( P \\) is true, then the team is prepared (\\( \\text{Prep} \\) is true).\n   - From Premise 4 (\\( \\text{Prep} \\rightarrow W \\)), if \\( \\text{Prep} \\) is true, then the team wins the game (\\( W \\) is true).\n   - From Premise 5 (\\( W \\rightarrow C \\)), if \\( W \\) is true, then the team celebrates with a dinner (\\( C \\) is true).\n   - Therefore, by transitivity: \\( I \\rightarrow P \\rightarrow \\text{Prep} \\rightarrow W \\rightarrow C \\), which simplifies to \\( I \\rightarrow C \\).\n\n4. **Consider potential counterarguments or missing elements**:\n   - Premise 2 states that injury implies the star player cannot play, but this is not linked to preparation, winning, or celebration in the premises. Specifically, there is no rule stating that injury (or inability to play) causes the team to be unprepared or lose the game.\n   - Premise 4 asserts that preparation is sufficient for winning, regardless of injury, as no premise contradicts this.\n   - Premise 3 ensures that if injury occurs, practice must have happened, compensating for any potential negative effect of injury.\n\n5. **Conclusion derivation**:\n   - The chain \\( I \\rightarrow C \\) holds: if the star player is injured, the team will celebrate with a team dinner.\n   - Thus, the answer to the question \"If the star player is injured, will the team celebrate with a team dinner after the big game?\" is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes"

With no other causes for a plentiful harvest, H is likely false.\n    - If H is false, premise 5 (H \u2192 P) implies P is false (farmer does not make good profit).\n    - Conclusion for Subcase B2: If T is false and S is false, P is false.\n\n**Step 4: Determine if P must be true given W.**\n- From Case A: If T is true, P is true.\n- From Case B: If T is false, P may be true (if S is true) or false (if S is false).\n- Since W is true but T is not necessarily true (due to the \"might\" in premise 2), T could be false.\n- When T is false and S is false (as in Subcase B2), P is false.\n- Therefore, it is possible for W to be true while P is false (e.g., windy with no trees falling and no sunlight, leading to weak crops, poor harvest, and no profit).\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion.**\n- The farmer making a good profit (P) does not logically follow from it being windy (W) alone, because there exists a scenario (W true, T false, S false) where P is false.\n- Thus, we cannot conclude that the farmer made a good profit solely based on it being windy.\n\nAnswer: No"

Therefore, severe weather alone does not directly imply any specific outcome about exams or satisfaction.\n\n4. **Examine the information about Alex's exams:**\n   - Premise 3 specifically mentions Alex studying diligently for his biology exam. There is no mention of the history exam in any premise.\n   - The chain of reasoning (Study Hard \u2192 Confident \u2192 Do Well \u2192 Satisfied) is tied to the biology exam based on premise 3, but it does not apply to the history exam, as no information is provided about Alex's actions or outcomes for history.\n\n5. **Consider the effect of severe weather on the biology exam:**\n   - If severe weather occurs (assumed true for the question), premise 2 suggests class cancellation is possible but not certain.\n   - From premise 3 (Studied Diligently for Biology \u2228 \u00acClass Canceled):\n     - If class is canceled (CC true), then \u00acClass Canceled is false, so Alex must have studied diligently for biology (Studied Diligently for Biology true).\n     - If class is not canceled (CC false), then \u00acClass Canceled is true, and Alex may or may not have studied diligently for biology.\n   - If Alex studied diligently for biology, the chain (Study Hard for Biology \u2192 Confident for Biology \u2192 Do Well on Biology \u2192 Satisfied with Biology) could lead to satisfaction with the biology exam. However, this does not extend to the history exam.\n\n6. **Evaluate the history exam specifically:**\n   - The premises contain no information about the history exam, Alex's study habits for history, his confidence for history, his performance on history, or any satisfaction related to history.\n   - Satisfaction (from premise 5) is derived from performing well on a specific exam, but the history exam is never referenced in the context. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Alex's satisfaction with the history exam based on the given premises.\n\n7. **Determine logical follow-through:**\n   - Severe weather (if true) might indirectly relate to the biology exam through possible class cancellation and premise 3, but it has no established connection to the history exam.\n   - Since the history exam is not mentioned in the premises, there is no logical path from severe weather to Alex's satisfaction with the history exam.

    "model_response": "**Context:** Julia, Emma, and Lucas are graduate students in the biology department and have published research papers. Generally, students who have published are considered for scholarships. At least one of Julia or Emma has not been considered for a scholarship.\n\n**Question:** Can we conclude Lucas has been considered for a scholarship and exactly one of Julia or Emma has not been considered?\n\n**Reasoning steps:**\n1. All three students (Julia, Emma, Lucas) have published research papers.\n2. The general rule states that students who publish are generally considered for scholarships, but this rule may have exceptions, as indicated by the context.\n3. It is given that at least one of Julia or Emma has not been considered for a scholarship, meaning \u00acC_Julia \u2228 \u00acC_Emma (where C_X denotes that X has been considered).\n4. Since the general rule is not absolute and has an exception for at least one of Julia or Emma, we cannot automatically assume it applies to Lucas without additional information.\n5. However, using non-monotonic reasoning (as the context allows), the general rule can be treated as a default: if a student has published, they are considered unless there is evidence to the contrary. For Lucas, there is no evidence suggesting he was not considered, so we can infer that Lucas has been considered for a scholarship.\n6. For Julia and Emma, the premise only specifies that at least one has not been considered (\u00acC_Julia \u2228 \u00acC_Emma). This does not specify which one or if both have not been considered; it could be that one is considered and the other is not, or both are not considered.\n7. Therefore, we cannot conclude that exactly one of Julia or Emma has not been considered, as the case where both have not been considered is possible and consistent with the premise.\n8. The conclusion requires both that Lucas has been considered and that exactly one of Julia or Emma has not been considered. While we can infer Lucas's consideration (from step 5), we cannot infer the exact state for Julia and Emma (from step 6 and 7).\n9. Since the second part (exactly one not considered) cannot be concluded, the full conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n**Answer:** No"

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the premises**:  \n   - Astronomer Alice asserts that the planet Zorotar orbits its star every 20 years (P).  \n   - Cosmologist Bob asserts that the planet Zorotar does not orbit its star every 20 years (\u00acP).  \n   - Normally, when scientists assert something about planetary orbits, they are right. This is a default rule, meaning that under normal circumstances, a scientist's assertion about planetary orbits can be accepted as true.  \n\n2. **Identify the conflict**:  \n   - Alice and Bob are both scientists making assertions about planetary orbits, so the default rule applies to both.  \n   - However, their assertions are contradictory (P and \u00acP), creating a conflict. This means the default rule cannot hold for both simultaneously without inconsistency.  \n\n3. **Consider the default rule in conflict scenarios**:  \n   - The default rule (\"normally\" scientists are right) is defeasible, meaning it can be overridden in abnormal situations, such as when there is conflicting evidence or information about reliability.  \n   - In this case, the conflict suggests that at least one scientist is incorrect, so we need additional information to resolve which assertion to trust.  \n\n4. **Introduce the reliability condition from the question**:  \n   - The question asks if we can conclude that if Bob's evidence is more reliable than Alice's, then \u00acP is true.  \n   - Reliability is not mentioned in the context, but it is provided as a conditional in the question. Since reliability affects the credibility of an assertion, it can be used to break the tie in the conflict.  \n\n5. **Apply reliability to resolve the conflict**:  \n   - Given that Bob's evidence is more reliable, Bob's assertion is more trustworthy under the default rule. This makes it more likely that Bob is right and Alice is wrong.  \n   - Since the default rule implies that scientists are normally correct, higher reliability strengthens the case for accepting Bob's assertion (\u00acP) as true, while lower reliability weakens Alice's assertion (P).  \n\n6. **Evaluate the conclusion**:  \n   - With Bob's higher reliability, we can infer that the normal condition for the default rule is satisfied for Bob, leading to the acceptance of \u00acP.  \n   - Therefore, the implication \"if Bob's evidence is more reliable than Alice's, then \u00acP\" follows from the premises and the way default reasoning handles reliability-based conflicts.  \n\n7. **Conclusion**:  \n   - Based on the reasoning, we can conclude that if Bob's evidence is more reliable, then the planet does not orbit every 20 years (\u00acP).  \n\nAnswer: Yes"

This confirms that the rule is not absolute, and exceptions are possible.\n\n3. **Evaluate the status of Green Comet (G):**\n   - No information is given about whether G is being studied or not. Since the typical rule has exceptions (as shown for B or R), S(G) could be true or false. It is possible that G is being studied (e.g., if the space agency follows the rule for G), but it is also possible that G is not studied (e.g., if the agency makes an exception for G too). Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that S(G) is true.\n\n4. **Evaluate \"exactly one of B or R is not being studied\":**\n   - The premise states that at least one of B or R is not studied (\u00acS(B) \u2228 \u00acS(R)), but this does not specify that exactly one is not studied. It allows for three scenarios:\n     - Only B is not studied (\u00acS(B) \u2227 S(R)).\n     - Only R is not studied (S(B) \u2227 \u00acS(R)).\n     - Both B and R are not studied (\u00acS(B) \u2227 \u00acS(R)).\n   - Since the \"both not studied\" scenario is possible (and not ruled out by the premises), we cannot conclude that exactly one is not studied.

In this case, S(G) is false, and it is not true that exactly one of B or R is not studied (since both are not studied).\n\n6. **Determine logical entailment:**\n   - Since the premises do not force S(G) to be true or force exactly one of B or R to not be studied, and there are valid interpretations where the conclusion is false, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No"

    "model_response": "### Reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Identify key premises from the context:**\n   - The teacher stated that Alex got 90% on the test.\n   - The principal stated that Alex did not get 90% on the test.\n   - Normally, people tell the truth about grades (implying truthfulness is the default, but exceptions are possible).\n   - The teacher has better information than the principal (making the teacher's claim more reliable).\n   - If there was a grading error, Alex could not have actually gotten 90% (i.e., grading error \u2192 \u00acgot 90%).\n\n2. **Analyze the conflict between statements:**\n   - The teacher and principal provide contradictory information about Alex's grade.\n   - Given that people \"normally\" tell the truth (premise 3), both could be truthful under normal circumstances, but the contradiction suggests an abnormality or error.\n\n3. **Evaluate reliability based on information:**\n   - Premise 4 states the teacher has better information, so the teacher's statement is more credible and likely accurate.\n   - Therefore, Alex probably did get 90%, and the principal's statement is likely mistaken or based on inferior information (without implying dishonesty, as truthfulness is normal but not infallible).\n\n4. **Apply the grading error condition:**\n   - Premise 5 establishes that a grading error implies Alex did not get 90% (grading error \u2192 \u00acgot 90%).\n   - The contrapositive is: if Alex got 90%, then there was no grading error (got 90% \u2192 \u00acgrading error).\n\n5. **Draw a conclusion from the reliable statement:**\n   - Since the teacher's claim (Alex got 90%) is reliable due to better information, we accept that Alex got 90%.\n   - From the contrapositive in step 4, if Alex got 90%, there was no grading error.\n\n6. **Determine if a grading error can be concluded:**\n   - The evidence points to no grading error (as Alex got 90%).\n   - The principal's contrary statement does not override the teacher's reliability or imply a grading error, as it may stem from misinformation.\n   - Therefore, we cannot conclude there was a grading error; instead, we conclude there was none.\n\nAnswer: No"

However, the premises state multiple reasons for incomplete vaccination:  \n     - Youth (explicitly: if too young, then not fully vaccinated).  \n     - Owner-surrendered status (which may lead to incomplete records, unrelated to age).  \n   - The implication \"if too young, then not fully vaccinated\" (TooYoung \u2192 \u00acFullyVaccinated) does not work in reverse; incomplete vaccination does not necessarily imply youth (it could be due to other factors like owner surrender).  \n   - Since we have no evidence that Mike's dog is not fully vaccinated (the \"usually\" vaccinated rule suggests it might be), and no evidence linking it to youth, we cannot deduce youth from the given information.  \n\n4. **Consider alternative explanations:**  \n   - Even if Mike's dog isn't fully vaccinated (which isn't stated), it could be due to being owner-surrendered rather than too young. The premises do not rule out this possibility.  \n   - The context provides no details about Mike's dog's age, history, or vaccination status, so we lack specific evidence to support the conclusion.  \n\n5. **Determine if the conclusion logically follows:**  \n   - The premises do not provide sufficient or direct evidence to conclude that Mike's dog is too young.

This is a defeasible rule: normally, N implies A, but exceptions exist.\n   - Some more affordable rentals that are a few blocks from the water (and thus still near the beach) do not include beach access (not A). This introduces an exception based on affordability.\n   - If a rental is luxury (L), it does not have public beach access (not A_public). For consistency, \"access to the ocean\" and \"beach access\" are treated as equivalent to public beach access here, given the context, so A implies not L.\n\n2. **Assess Emily's rental properties:**\n   - We know N is true for Emily (she rented near the beach).\n   - We do not know if Emily's rental is affordable or unaffordable, or if it has access or not. Affordability is not mentioned, so it is unknown and cannot be assumed.\n\n3. **Apply default (non-monotonic) reasoning:**\n   - The typical rule states that beach rentals near the beach usually have access (N typically \u2192 A). Since no information suggests Emily's rental is affordable (the known exception case), the default applies. Thus, we defeasibly infer that Emily's rental has access (A).\n\n4. **Evaluate the luxury condition:**\n   - The premise states that luxury rentals do not have public beach access (L \u2192 not A). By contraposition, if a rental has access (A), it cannot be luxury (A \u2192 not L).\n   - From step 3, we have A (defeasibly), so Emily's rental cannot be luxury (not L).\n\n5. **Conclusion on luxury property:**\n   - Since we infer not L from the reasoning, we cannot conclude L (luxury).

Here, \"the book\" refers to Author 1's book, based on the chain of implications.\n\n2. **Derive logical implications for Author 1:**\n   - From the premises A \u2192 L and L \u2192 M, we can infer by transitivity that if Author 1 receives an award, then Mia recommends the book (A \u2192 M).\n   - The contrapositive of A \u2192 M is: if Mia does not recommend the book, then Author 1 does not receive a literary award (\u00acM \u2192 \u00acA).\n\n3. **Analyze the query about \"the other author\":**\n   - The question asks whether we can conclude that if Mia does not recommend the book (\u00acM), then \"the other author\" (Author B) does not receive a literary award (\u00acB).\n   - From step 2, \u00acM implies \u00acA (Author 1 does not receive an award), but there is no direct or indirect link between \u00acM (or \u00acA) and Author B's award status.\n   - The premise that \"authors of best-selling novels often receive literary awards\" applies to both authors but is not deterministic. It allows for scenarios where Author B receives an award even if Author 1 does not (or vice versa), as \"often\" does not mean \"always\" or imply mutual exclusivity.\n\n4. **Consider possible scenarios:**\n   - Scenario 1: Mia does not recommend the book (\u00acM). This implies \u00acA (Author 1 has no award), but Author B could still receive an award (B is true) because:\n     - Author B has a best-selling novel, and the \"often\" premise permits Author B to receive an award independently.\n     - No premise connects Author B's award to Mia's recommendation or Author 1's award.\n   - Scenario 2: If Author B receives an award (B true) and Author 1 does not (\u00acA), then \u00acM holds (from \u00acA \u2192 \u00acL \u2192 \u00acM), but B is true. Thus, \u00acM \u2192 \u00acB is false in this case, showing the conclusion is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Evaluate logical validity:**\n   - The implication \u00acM \u2192 \u00acB cannot be derived from the premises because:\n     - There is no chain of reasoning linking Mia's recommendation to Author B's award.\n     - The premises do not state that only one author can receive an award, or that the awards are dependent.\n     - The probabilistic nature of \"often\" introduces uncertainty, but even under a logical interpretation, no rule forces \u00acB when \u00acM is true.\n\n6. **Conclusion on the query:**\n   - Based on the premises, we can only conclude that if Mia does not recommend the book, Author 1 does not receive an award (\u00acM \u2192 \u00acA).

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the premises from the context:**\n   - Premise 1: Both cars C1 and C2 have automatic parallel parking (APP). So, APP(C1) and APP(C2) are true.\n   - Premise 2: Normally, cars with automatic parallel parking also have cruise control (CC). This is a default rule, meaning it typically holds but may have exceptions (e.g., APP(C) \u2192 CC(C) under normal circumstances).\n   - Premise 3: If car C1 has cruise control (CC(C1)), then driver D1 can relax during long drives (Relax(D1)). So, CC(C1) \u2192 Relax(D1).\n   - Premise 4: If driver D1 can relax during long drives (Relax(D1)), then passenger P1 falls asleep (Asleep(P1)). So, Relax(D1) \u2192 Asleep(P1).\n\n2. **Derive implications from premises 3 and 4:**\n   - Combining premises 3 and 4: CC(C1) \u2192 Relax(D1) \u2192 Asleep(P1). Therefore, CC(C1) \u2192 Asleep(P1).\n   - By contraposition: If passenger P1 does not fall asleep (\u00acAsleep(P1)), then car C1 does not have cruise control (\u00acCC(C1)). So, \u00acAsleep(P1) \u2192 \u00acCC(C1).\n\n3. **Analyze the \"normally\" rule in premise 2:**\n   - Premise 2 states that cars with APP normally have CC, but it is not a strict logical implication (it allows for exceptions). Since \u00acAsleep(P1) implies \u00acCC(C1) (from step 2), and C1 has APP (from premise 1), this means C1 is an exception to the normal rule (APP(C1) does not guarantee CC(C1)).\n\n4. **Consider car C2:**\n   - C2 has APP (premise 1), so under the normal rule, it should have CC(C2). However, the normal rule is defeasible and does not strictly enforce CC(C2) in all cases.\n   - The condition \u00acAsleep(P1) only provides information about C1 (specifically, \u00acCC(C1)) but does not directly relate to C2. There is no premise linking \u00acAsleep(P1) or \u00acCC(C1) to CC(C2).\n\n5. **Evaluate the conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion to test is: If passenger P1 does not fall asleep (\u00acAsleep(P1)), then car C2 has cruise control (CC(C2)), i.e., \u00acAsleep(P1) \u2192 CC(C2).\n   - From step 2, \u00acAsleep(P1) implies \u00acCC(C1), but this has no bearing on CC(C2). C2 could have CC or not, as the premises do not constrain C2 based on P1's state or C1's CC status.\n   - Since the normal rule for APP implying CC is not strict, and no other premises connect \u00acAsleep(P1) to CC(C2), we cannot derive CC(C2) from \u00acAsleep(P1).\n\n6. **Determine logical consequence:**\n   - The conclusion \u00acAsleep(P1) \u2192 CC(C2) does not logically follow from the premises because:\n     - The derivation of \u00acCC(C1) from \u00acAsleep(P1) does not entail anything about C2.\n     - Premise 2's \"normally\" allows for scenarios where C2 does not have CC, even if C1 is an exception.\n     - Therefore, it is possible for \u00acAsleep(P1) to be true while CC(C2) is false (e.g., if both C1 and C2 lack CC due to exceptions), meaning the implication is not necessary.\n\nAnswer: No"

This means if car 1 has high performance, Sarah gets excited.\n   - The contrapositive of HP1 \u2192 S is \u00acS \u2192 \u00acHP1.

Exceptions are possible, and car 2 could also lack high performance independently.\n\n5. **Evaluate the conclusion: \"If Sarah does not get excited, then the other car (car 2) has high performance\" (\u00acS \u2192 HP2):**\n   - From \u00acS, we can conclude \u00acHP1, but this does not directly relate to car 2. There is no logical link between \u00acS (or \u00acHP1) and HP2 in the premises.\n   - The premises do not provide any information that Sarah's excitement (or lack thereof) depends on car 2 or that car 2's performance affects Sarah. Thus, \u00acS only informs us about car 1, not car 2.\n   - While default reasoning might suggest HP2 is likely (since car 2 has a turbo and no exception is indicated), it is not a strict logical conclusion. It is possible for \u00acS to be true (due to \u00acHP1) while HP2 is false (if car 2 is also an exception), so \u00acS \u2192 HP2 is not necessarily true.\n\n6. **Determine logical entailment:**\n   - The conclusion \u00acS \u2192 HP2 does not deductively follow from the premises because the \"usually\" rule allows for scenarios where both cars lack high performance (e.g., both are exceptions), making \u00acS possible without HP2.\n   - Therefore, we cannot logically conclude the conditional statement \u00acS \u2192 HP2 with certainty.\n\n**Answer: No**"

This is a general statement with \"commonly,\" indicating it is not a strict logical implication (i.e., it does not mean all such chefs always use fresh herbs).\n   - If Chef 1 uses fresh herbs, then Tony appreciates the flavors.

By transitivity, this implies \\(C1 \\rightarrow J\\).\n\n2. **Analyze the contrapositive for Chef 1:**\n   - From \\(C1 \\rightarrow J\\), the contrapositive is \\(\\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg C1\\). This means if Julia does not request the recipe (\\(\\neg J\\)), then Chef 1 does not use fresh herbs (\\(\\neg C1\\)).\n\n3. **Consider the role of Chef 2 (the \"other chef\"):**\n   - The premises provide no direct link between Chef 2's actions and Tony's appreciation or Julia's request. The conditionals \\(C1 \\rightarrow T\\) and \\(T \\rightarrow J\\) specifically involve Chef 1, not Chef 2.\n   - The general statement about chefs specializing in Italian cuisine using fresh herbs \"commonly\" is not sufficient for logical deduction about Chef 2 because \"commonly\" implies possibility, not necessity. It does not guarantee that Chef 2 uses fresh herbs, nor does it connect Chef 2 to Julia's request.\n\n4. **Evaluate the conclusion to be tested:**\n   - The conclusion is: If Julia does not request the recipe (\\(\\neg J\\)), then Chef 2 does not use fresh herbs (\\(\\neg C2\\)).\n   - From step 2, \\(\\neg J\\) implies \\(\\neg C1\\) (Chef 1 does not use fresh herbs), but this says nothing about Chef 2.\n   - Chef 2 could use fresh herbs (\\(C2\\)) or not (\\(\\neg C2\\)), as the premises do not constrain Chef 2's behavior relative to Julia's request.

The question asks: If the team does not succeed (\u00acSu), can we conclude that athletes do not show teamwork (\u00acT)?\n\n3. From S \u2192 Su, we can derive the contrapositive: if the team does not succeed (\u00acSu), then players are not selfless (\u00acS). This is a strict logical implication.\n\n4. From S \u2228 \u00acC and \u00acS (derived in step 3), since S is false, \u00acC must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, coaches do not provide guidance (\u00acC).\n\n5. From T \u2192 C, we can derive the contrapositive: if coaches do not provide guidance (\u00acC), then athletes do not show teamwork (\u00acT). This is another strict logical implication.\n\n6.

This chain of implications shows that \u00acSu \u2192 \u00acT is logically derivable from the premises.\n\n7. The \"typically\" statement about teamwork is not used in this deduction because the strict logical premises (S \u2192 Su, T \u2192 C, and S \u2228 \u00acC) are sufficient to force the conclusion without relying on default assumptions. Even if teamwork is typical, the logical rules override any default in this case, as \u00acSu directly necessitates \u00acT.\n\n8.

However, if a person does not speak Spanish (\\(\\neg S\\) true), this premise is satisfied regardless of \\(E\\) (since \\(\\neg S\\) makes \\(S \\rightarrow E\\) vacuously true), so \\(\\neg S\\) does not provide information about \\(E\\) or \\(F\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate the conclusion \\(\\neg S \\rightarrow F\\):**\n   - To check if \\(\\neg S \\rightarrow F\\) logically follows, consider if \\(\\neg S\\) being true forces \\(F\\) to be true.\n   - If \\(\\neg S\\) is true (person does not know Spanish), the premises do not require \\(F\\) to be true:\n     - \\(E\\) could be true or false (e.g., English might have a written script or not, as \"generally\" allows exceptions).\n     - \\(F\\) could be false (e.g., French could have an alphabet but no written script as an exception to the general rule).\n     - The other premises (third and fourth) do not link \\(\\neg S\\) to \\(F\\); they primarily involve \\(S\\), \\(E\\), or English/French alphabets.\n   - A counterexample is possible: Suppose \\(\\neg S\\) is true (person does not know Spanish), \\(F\\) is false (French has no written script), and \\(E\\) is true (English has a written script). All premises hold:\n     - English and French have alphabets (true).\n     - Generally, languages with alphabets have written scripts (true for English, false for French as an exception, which \"generally\" permits).\n     - If a person speaks English, they might know Spanish (could be true even if the person does not know Spanish, as \"might\" allows for non-knowledge).\n     - \\(E \\lor \\neg S\\) is true since \\(E\\) is true.\n   - Since this scenario satisfies all premises while \\(\\neg S\\) is true and \\(F\\) is false, \\(\\neg S \\rightarrow F\\) is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **Conclusion on logical entailment:**\n   - The premises do not provide a direct or indirect link between a person not knowing Spanish and French having a written script. The fourth premise ties Spanish knowledge to English's written script, not French's. Additionally, the use of \"generally\" weakens the derivation of \\(F\\), and no premise forces \\(F\\) to be true when \\(\\neg S\\) is true.\n   - Therefore, we cannot conclusively derive \\(\\neg S \\rightarrow F\\) from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No"

    "model_response": "**Reasoning steps:**\n\n1. The context provides several premises:  \n   - Phones and laptops are electronic devices.  \n   - Usually, devices with internet access can browse websites (this is a default rule with possible exceptions).  \n   - If a device has a camera, then it can take photos (a strict implication).  \n   - If phones can browse websites, then laptops have multiple functions (B_p \u2192 M).  \n   - Either devices can browse websites or laptops do not have multiple functions, or both (B \u2228 \u00acM), where B means that browsing websites is possible for some device (e.g., phones or laptops).\n\n2. The question asks whether we can conclude that phones do not have internet access (\u00acI_p) if a device cannot take photos (\u00acC_d for some device d).\n\n3. From the premise \"if a device has a camera, then it can take photos,\" we derive the contrapositive: if a device cannot take photos, then it does not have a camera (\u00acC_d \u2192 \u00achas_camera_d). This applies to any device, including phones or laptops.\n\n4. However, there is no premise linking the absence of a camera (or inability to take photos) to internet access or browsing capability. Internet access and camera presence are independent properties based on the given rules.\n\n5. Specifically:  \n   - A device without a camera (and thus unable to take photos) could still have internet access and be able to browse websites, as per the \"usually\" rule (though exceptions are possible).  \n   - For example, a laptop without a camera cannot take photos but may have internet access and browse websites.  \n   - Similarly, a phone without a camera cannot take photos but may have internet access and browse websites.\n\n6. Now, consider the implication for phones:  \n   - If phones have internet access (I_p), then usually they can browse websites (B_p).  \n   - If B_p is true, then laptops have multiple functions (M) from B_p \u2192 M.  \n   - With M true, the disjunction B \u2228 \u00acM requires B to be true (since \u00acM is false), meaning browsing is possible.  \n   - This is consistent even if some device (e.g., a laptop or a phone without a camera) cannot take photos.\n\n7. Conversely, if phones do not have internet access (\u00acI_p), it could be due to other reasons, but the inability of some device to take photos does not necessitate this state.\n\n8. Since the premises do not connect camera absence to internet access, and scenarios exist where phones have internet access while some device (including possibly the phone itself) cannot take photos, we cannot derive \u00acI_p from \u00acC_d alone.\n\n9. Therefore, based on the context, we cannot conclude that phones do not have internet access from the fact that a device cannot take photos.\n\n**Answer: No**"

This means all motorcycles with sidecars can carry an extra passenger.\n   - Premise 5: Either a convertible has a retractable top, or a motorcycle with a sidecar can carry an extra passenger, or both.

This implies that if there exists a red car with leather seats, there must exist a convertible with a retractable top (since all convertibles have retractable tops from Premise 3).\n\n2. **Understand the question:**\n   - The question asks whether we can conclude that if there exists a vehicle without a retractable top, then there exists a blue car with leather seats. In logical terms, this is: \u2203x \u00acT(x) \u2192 \u2203y (Blue(y) \u2227 Car(y) \u2227 LeatherSeats(y)).\n\n3. **Consider scenarios where a vehicle lacks a retractable top:**\n   - A vehicle without a retractable top could be, for example:\n     - A motorcycle (as motorcycles do not have retractable tops).\n     - A non-convertible car (which may or may not have a retractable top, but it is not required to have one).\n   - The existence of such a vehicle (\u2203x \u00acT(x)) does not directly relate to blue cars or leather seats based on the premises.\n\n4. **Examine Premise 5 for constraints:**\n   - Premise 5 requires that at least one of the following is true:\n     - There exists a convertible with a retractable top (which is always true if convertibles exist, per Premise 3).\n     - There exists a motorcycle with a sidecar that can carry an extra passenger (which is always true if such motorcycles exist, per Premise 4).\n     - Or both.\n   - If there are no convertibles, Premise 5 forces the existence of a motorcycle with a sidecar to satisfy the disjunction.\n\n5. **Use Premise 6 to derive implications:**\n   - Premise 6: If there exists a red car with leather seats, then there exists a convertible with a retractable top.\n   - Contrapositively: If there is no convertible (meaning no vehicle with a retractable top from convertibles), then there cannot be any red car with leather seats. Otherwise, Premise 6 would be violated.\n\n6. **Construct a counterexample where the conclusion fails:**\n   - Assume a scenario with:\n     - No convertibles (so no vehicles with retractable tops from this category).\n     - A motorcycle with a sidecar (to satisfy Premise 5, as there must be a motorcycle with a sidecar carrying an extra passenger since no convertibles exist).\n     - Red cars exist but have no leather seats (consistent with Premise 6, as no convertibles imply no red car can have leather seats).\n     - Blue cars exist and have sunroofs (per Premise 1), but they do not have leather seats (allowed by Premise 2's \"typically,\" as exceptions are possible).\n   - In this scenario:\n     - There exists a vehicle without a retractable top (e.g., the motorcycle, or any non-convertible car).\n     - However, no blue car has leather seats, as they all lack leather seats.\n   - This satisfies all premises:\n     - Premise 1: Blue cars have sunroofs.\n     - Premise 2: The lack of leather seats is an exception to the typical rule.\n     - Premise 3: Vacuously true, as no convertibles exist.\n     - Premise 4: True for the motorcycle with sidecar.\n     - Premise 5: Satisfied by the motorcycle with sidecar.\n     - Premise 6: Since no red car has leather seats, the implication holds vacuously.\n   - Thus, \u2203x \u00acT(x) is true, but \u2203y (Blue(y) \u2227 Car(y) \u2227 LeatherSeats(y)) is false.\n\n7. **Determine if the conclusion must hold:**\n   - The counterexample shows that it is possible for the premises to be true while the conclusion (if a vehicle lacks a retractable top, then a blue car has leather seats) is false.\n   - Premise 2's use of \"typically\" weakens any guarantee about leather seats, and there are no other premises forcing blue cars to have leather seats in the absence of retractable tops.\n   - Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude the statement based on the given premises.\n\n**Answer: No**"

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps\n\n1. **Identify relevant premises from the context:**\n   - Premise 1: X and Y are ingredients that enhance flavor.\n   - Premise 2: Normally, ingredients that enhance flavor also add aroma. Since X and Y are flavor enhancers and the context states this as a norm (with no exceptions indicated), we can infer that both X and Y add aroma. Thus, A_X (X adds aroma) and A_Y (Y adds aroma) are true.\n   - Premise 3: If ingredient Z is spicy, then Z adds heat. This is not directly used, as the query focuses on whether Z adds heat.\n   - Premise 4: If ingredient W is a preservative, then it prolongs shelf life. This is about a different ingredient (W) and unrelated to Z, heat, X, Y, or aroma, so it can be ignored.\n   - Premise 5: Either Z does not add heat or V is not aromatic. This can be logically rewritten as: If Z adds heat (H), then V is not aromatic (\u00acA_V). Symbolically: H \u2192 \u00acA_V.\n   - Premise 6: If X adds aroma (A_X), then V is aromatic (A_V). Symbolically: A_X \u2192 A_V.\n\n2. **Inference from premises about A_X and A_V:**\n   - From Premise 1 and Premise 2, since X enhances flavor and flavor enhancers normally add aroma, we infer A_X (X adds aroma) is true.\n   - From Premise 6 (A_X \u2192 A_V) and the truth of A_X, we infer A_V (V is aromatic) is true via modus ponens.\n\n3. **Inference about Z adding heat (H):**\n   - From Premise 5 (H \u2192 \u00acA_V) and the derived truth of A_V, if H were true, this would imply \u00acA_V. But A_V is true, so \u00acA_V would be a contradiction. Therefore, the premises can only be consistent if H is false. That is, ingredient Z does not add heat.\n\n4. **Evaluate the conclusion: \"If ingredient Z adds heat to the dish, then ingredient Y does not add aroma\" (symbolically: H \u2192 \u00acA_Y):**\n   - The antecedent (H: Z adds heat) must be false, as derived in Step 3. Under logic, any implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. Therefore, H \u2192 \u00acA_Y holds, regardless of the truth value of \u00acA_Y.\n   - Additionally, from Premise 1 and Premise 2, we have A_Y (Y adds aroma) as true, so \u00acA_Y is false. But since H is false, the implication H \u2192 \u00acA_Y remains true.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the premises and reasoning, the implication \"if Z adds heat, then Y does not add aroma\" can be concluded as true. This is derivable from the logical consistency of the premises (e.g., the falsehood of H due to contradiction with A_V and A_X) and the properties of logical implication (vacuity).\n\n### Answer\nYes"

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:  \n   - Premise 1: Diamonds and rubies are precious stones. This means any diamond or ruby is a precious stone.  \n   - Premise 2: Normally, precious stones are valuable. This is a default rule; in the absence of abnormalities, precious stones can be assumed valuable.  \n   - Premise 3: If a diamond sparkles, then it is cut well. (This is not directly relevant to value but may be noted.)  \n   - Premise 4: If a ruby is deep red, then it is considered high-quality. This implies that deep red is a sufficient condition for high-quality.  \n   - Premise 5: Either a diamond sparkles or a ruby is deep red. This is an inclusive disjunction (OR), meaning at least one must be true.  \n   - Premise 6: If a diamond is valuable, then it is worth a lot. (This is not needed for the conclusion, as it depends on value being true first.)  \n\n2. **Question Focus**:  \n   - The question asks whether we can conclude that \"if a ruby is not high-quality, then a diamond is valuable.\" Symbolically, this is: \u00acHQ(R) \u2192 V(D).  \n\n3. **Derive Implications from Premises**:  \n   - From Premise 4 (DR(R) \u2192 HQ(R)), take the contrapositive: If a ruby is not high-quality (\u00acHQ(R)), then it is not deep red (\u00acDR(R)). Thus: \u00acHQ(R) \u2192 \u00acDR(R).  \n   - From Premise 5 (S(D) \u2228 DR(R)) and \u00acDR(R) (from above), apply disjunctive syllogism: Since DR(R) is false, S(D) must be true. Thus: \u00acDR(R) \u2192 S(D).  \n   - Therefore, from \u00acHQ(R), we have S(D) (the diamond sparkles).  \n\n4. **Apply Default Rule for Value**:  \n   - From Premise 1, a diamond is a precious stone (PS(D)).  \n   - Premise 2 states that normally, precious stones are valuable. Since there is no evidence of abnormality (e.g., no premises suggest the diamond is not valuable or has defects that override the default), we can apply the default rule: PS(D) \u2192 V(D) under normal circumstances. Thus, V(D) holds.  \n   - Note: S(D) (sparkling) and CW(D) (cut well) do not conflict with or negate the default rule for value; they are consistent with normal conditions.  \n\n5. **Conclusion Validity**:  \n   - Starting from \u00acHQ(R), we derive \u00acDR(R), then S(D), and finally V(D) via the default rule. Thus, \u00acHQ(R) \u2192 V(D) is supported by the premises.  \n   - No premises introduce exceptions to the default value rule for diamonds, and \u00acHQ(R) (ruby not high-quality) does not imply any abnormality for the diamond's value.  \n\n**Answer**: Yes"

No contradiction is provided for X or Y, so A_X and A_Y hold.\n\n3. **Use Premise 6 to infer V is aromatic:**\n   - Since A_X is true (from step 2), Premise 6 (A_X \u2192 A_V) implies that V is aromatic (A_V is true).\n\n4. **Apply Premise 5 with A_V true:**\n   - Premise 5 states \u00acH \u2228 \u00acA_V.

In logic, an implication H \u2192 A_Y is true whenever H is false, regardless of A_Y (this is the principle of vacuous truth).\n   - Additionally, from step 2, A_Y is true (Y adds aroma), so even if H were true, A_Y would hold, but H is false here.\n   - Therefore, H \u2192 A_Y is true under the given premises.\n\n6. **Consider non-monotonic aspects:**\n   - Premise 2 uses \"normally,\" allowing for exceptions, but no exceptions are indicated for X or Y. Step 2 relies on default reasoning, which is consistent as no evidence contradicts A_X or A_Y. Even if H were true (which it isn't, per step 4), the default would still imply A_Y true, supporting the conclusion.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the premises and reasoning, we can conclude that if Z adds heat, then Y adds aroma.

So, for this teacher, \u00acKnowledgeable(T).\n   - However, this does not imply that no teacher is knowledgeable (\u2203T Knowledgeable(T) could still be true if another teacher is knowledgeable).\n\n4. **Consider the disjunction (premise 5):**\n   - Premise 5 states: \u2203S StudiesHard(S) \u2228 \u2203T Knowledgeable(T)\n   - If \u2203T \u00acImpartsUsefulInfo(T) holds, it only means one teacher is not knowledgeable, not that all are. Thus:\n     - If \u2203T Knowledgeable(T) is true (due to another teacher), then \u2203S StudiesHard(S) may be false.\n     - If \u2203T Knowledgeable(T) is false (no teacher is knowledgeable), then \u2203S StudiesHard(S) must be true.\n   - In either case, there is no direct link to students having or not having books.\n\n5. **Evaluate the book premise:**\n   - Premise 2 states that typically, individuals have books.

Therefore, \u00acImpartsUsefulInfo(T) does not entail anything about HasBooks(S).\n\n6. **Check for logical entailment:**\n   - The premises do not force \u2203S \u00acHasBooks(S) when \u2203T \u00acImpartsUsefulInfo(T) is true. For example:\n     - Scenario: A teacher is not knowledgeable and does not impart useful information, but another teacher is knowledgeable (so \u2203T Knowledgeable(T) is true). Students could still typically have books, so \u2203S \u00acHasBooks(S) is not necessarily true.\n     - Scenario: No teacher is knowledgeable (so \u2203T Knowledgeable(T) is false), but some student studies hard (\u2203S StudiesHard(S) is true). Students could still typically have books; no premise requires that studying hard or lack of knowledge affects book possession.\n   - Since the conclusion requires that \u00acImpartsUsefulInfo(T) implies \u00acHasBooks(S), but the premises allow for cases where books are present despite a teacher not imparting useful information, the conclusion does not logically follow.\n\n7. **Conclusion on logical follow:**\n   - The premises do not provide a deductive path to the conclusion.

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the premises:**\n   - Books and pens are items of category Q and both are used for writing. (Given as fact: UsedForWriting(book) and UsedForWriting(pen) are true.)\n   - Usually, items of category Q used for writing are stationery. (This is a default rule with possible exceptions; not strict.)\n   - If a movie is a comedy, then it makes people laugh. (Comedy \u2192 Laugh)\n   - If a city has good public transport, then it is convenient. (GoodTransport \u2192 Convenient)\n   - Either the comedy movie does not make people laugh or the city with good public transport is not convenient. (\u00acLaugh \u2228 \u00acConvenient, which is equivalent to Laugh \u2192 \u00acConvenient)\n   - If a book is stationery, then the city has good public transport. (BookStationery \u2192 GoodTransport)\n\n2. **Analyze the logical implications:**\n   - From \u00acLaugh \u2228 \u00acConvenient and GoodTransport \u2192 Convenient, derive Laugh \u2192 \u00acConvenient (via disjunction and implication).\n   - From Laugh \u2192 \u00acConvenient and GoodTransport \u2192 Convenient (contrapositive: \u00acConvenient \u2192 \u00acGoodTransport), derive Laugh \u2192 \u00acGoodTransport.\n   - From Laugh \u2192 \u00acGoodTransport and BookStationery \u2192 GoodTransport (contrapositive: \u00acGoodTransport \u2192 \u00acBookStationery), derive Laugh \u2192 \u00acBookStationery.\n   - Therefore, if the comedy movie makes people laugh (Laugh is true), then the book is not stationery (\u00acBookStationery).\n\n3. **Consider the \"usually\" rule for stationery:**\n   - Premise 2 states that items of category Q used for writing are usually stationery, but it is not strict (allowing exceptions).\n   - Since book is used for writing and category Q, but \u00acBookStationery when Laugh is true, this is an exception to the \"usually\" rule.\n   - Pen is also used for writing and category Q (from premise 1), so it is usually stationery, but no premise forces it to not be stationery or not used for writing.\n\n4. **Evaluate the conclusion: \"If the comedy movie makes people laugh, then the pen is not used for writing\" (Laugh \u2192 \u00acUsedForWriting(pen)):**\n   - Premise 1 explicitly states that the pen is used for writing (UsedForWriting(pen) is true), so \u00acUsedForWriting(pen) is false.\n   - Therefore, the consequent \u00acUsedForWriting(pen) is always false, regardless of Laugh.\n   - The implication Laugh \u2192 false can only be true if Laugh is false (since true \u2192 false is false, but false \u2192 false is true).\n   - However, the premises do not require Laugh to be false; Laugh can be true (e.g., if comedy exists and makes people laugh, leading to \u00acBookStationery as an exception).\n   - When Laugh is true, Laugh \u2192 \u00acUsedForWriting(pen) evaluates to true \u2192 false = false, meaning the implication does not hold.\n   - Since there exists a scenario (Laugh true) where the implication is false under the premises, it cannot be concluded as a logical consequence.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The pen being used for writing is a fixed fact from premise 1, so it cannot be negated.\n   - The premises do not entail that Laugh implies \u00acUsedForWriting(pen), as this would contradict premise 1 when Laugh is true.\n   - Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the comedy movie makes people laugh, then the pen is not used for writing.\n\n**Answer: No**"

This holds independently of other conditions like ripeness.\n\n3. **Derive implications from the disjunction and conditional:**\n   - The disjunction \"Either a Banana is ripe or an Apple is red\" means at least one must be true.\n   - From \"If an Apple is red, then it is ripe,\" take the contrapositive: If an Apple is not ripe, then it is not red.\n\n4. **Apply the assumption for the conclusion (Apple not ripe):**\n   - Assume the Apple is not ripe (\u00acRipe_Apple).\n   - From step 3, if Apple is not ripe, then it is not red (\u00acRed_Apple).\n   - With \u00acRed_Apple, the disjunction requires that Banana is ripe (Ripe_Banana) to satisfy \"Either a Banana is ripe or an Apple is red.\"\n\n5. **Relate to seeds:**\n   - Banana being ripe (from step 4) implies it is sweet (from \"If ripe, then sweet\"), but this does not directly affect seed content.\n   - Seed content for Banana is determined by the default rule (step 2): Banana has peels, so it contains seeds (Seeds_Banana), regardless of ripeness.\n\n6. **Form the conclusion:**\n   - Since Seeds_Banana is true (from step 2) even when Apple is not ripe, the implication \"If an Apple is not ripe, then a Banana contains seeds\" holds. Specifically, \u00acRipe_Apple implies Seeds_Banana because Seeds_Banana is always true under the default reasoning.\n\n7. **Confirm logical follow-through:**\n   - No premises challenge the default seed rule for Bananas, and the disjunction forces Banana ripeness when Apple is not ripe, but ripeness does not alter seed content.

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps\n\nTo determine if we can conclude that \"if Hot Chocolate is not aromatic, then Tea can be sweetened,\" I will analyze the given premises step by step. The premises are:\n\n1. Coffee and Tea are beverages served in a cafe.\n2. Usually, beverages served in a cafe are hot.\n3. If Coffee is brewed, then it is aromatic.\n4. If Tea is steeped, then it can be sweetened.\n5. Either Coffee is brewed or Tea can be sweetened, or both.\n6. If Hot Chocolate can be sweetened, then Tea is steeped.\n7. If Espresso is hot, then Coffee is brewed.\n\nThe question asks whether we can logically conclude the implication: \"If Hot Chocolate is not aromatic, then Tea can be sweetened.\"\n\n**Step 1: Identify relevant properties and variables.**\n- Define logical symbols for clarity:\n  - Let \\( B_c \\): Coffee is brewed.\n  - Let \\( A_c \\): Coffee is aromatic (from premise 3: \\( B_c \\rightarrow A_c \\)).\n  - Let \\( T_s \\): Tea is steeped.\n  - Let \\( S_t \\): Tea can be sweetened (from premise 4: \\( T_s \\rightarrow S_t \\)).\n  - Let \\( S_h \\): Hot Chocolate can be sweetened.\n  - Let \\( A_h \\): Hot Chocolate is aromatic. (Note: \\( A_h \\) is not mentioned in any premise.)\n  - Let \\( E_h \\): Espresso is hot (from premise 7: \\( E_h \\rightarrow B_c \\)).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the disjunction in premise 5.**\n- Premise 5 states: \\( B_c \\lor S_t \\) (Coffee is brewed or Tea can be sweetened, or both).\n- This means that at least one of \\( B_c \\) or \\( S_t \\) must be true. If \\( B_c \\) is false, then \\( S_t \\) must be true; if \\( S_t \\) is false, then \\( B_c \\) must be true.\n\n**Step 3: Consider constraints on Tea being sweetened.**\n- From premise 4: \\( T_s \\rightarrow S_t \\). If Tea is steeped, it can be sweetened.\n- From premise 6: \\( S_h \\rightarrow T_s \\). If Hot Chocolate can be sweetened, then Tea is steeped.\n- Combining these: \\( S_h \\rightarrow T_s \\rightarrow S_t \\). So, if \\( S_h \\) is true, then \\( S_t \\) must be true.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the role of Hot Chocolate.**\n- Hot Chocolate is mentioned in premise 6, but only in relation to \\( S_h \\) (can be sweetened). There is no premise that defines or relates to \\( A_h \\) (Hot Chocolate being aromatic).\n- Premise 2 states that beverages are \"usually\" hot, but this is a non-strict, default rule (indicated by \"usually\"). It does not provide a logical link to aromatic properties, nor does it specify anything about Hot Chocolate's aroma.\n- Since \\( A_h \\) is not referenced in any premise, its truth value (whether Hot Chocolate is aromatic or not) is independent of all other variables. It cannot be inferred from the given information.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the conclusion \"if Hot Chocolate is not aromatic, then Tea can be sweetened.\"**\n- The conclusion is an implication: \\( \\neg A_h \\rightarrow S_t \\).\n- For this to be logically concluded, \\( \\neg A_h \\) must necessitate \\( S_t \\) based on the premises.\n- However, \\( A_h \\) (and thus \\( \\neg A_h \\)) is unconstrained by the premises. \\( S_t \\) depends only on \\( B_c \\), \\( T_s \\), and \\( S_h \\) (via premises 4, 5, and 6), not on \\( A_h \\).\n- We can construct a scenario where \\( \\neg A_h \\) is true but \\( S_t \\) is false:\n  - Suppose \\( B_c \\) is true (Coffee is brewed). From premise 5, \\( S_t \\) can be false (Tea cannot be sweetened) because \\( B_c \\lor S_t \\) is satisfied.\n  - If \\( S_t \\) is false, from premise 4 (\\( T_s \\rightarrow S_t \\)), \\( T_s \\) must be false (Tea is not steeped).\n  - From premise 6 (\\( S_h \\rightarrow T_s \\)), if \\( T_s \\) is false, then \\( S_h \\) must be false (Hot Chocolate cannot be sweetened).\n  - Now, \\( A_h \\) (Hot Chocolate aromatic) is not defined; it could be false (\\( \\neg A_h \\) true) in this scenario.\n  - Thus, \\( \\neg A_h \\) is true and \\( S_t \\) is false, making the implication \\( \\neg A_h \\rightarrow S_t \\) false in this case.\n- Since such a scenario is consistent with all premises, the implication does not hold in all models. Therefore, it cannot be logically concluded.\n\n**Step 6: Address the \"usually\" in premise 2.**\n- Premise 2 uses \"usually,\" which suggests a default or probabilistic rule, not a strict logical implication. In logical reasoning, this cannot be used to derive definite conclusions about all cases. It does not connect to aromatic properties or force any relationship involving \\( A_h \\).\n\n**Step 7: Consider if Hot Chocolate is implicitly a beverage.**\n- Premise 1 mentions Coffee and Tea explicitly, but Hot Chocolate is introduced in premise 6, implying it is relevant. However, even if we assume Hot Chocolate is a beverage served in the cafe, premise 2 (\"usually hot\") does not provide information about aroma, and no other premise links Hot Chocolate to aromatic properties.\n\n**Conclusion:** The premises do not allow us to conclude that \"if Hot Chocolate is not aromatic, then Tea can be sweetened\" because there is no logical connection between Hot Chocolate's aroma and Tea's sweetness. A counterexample exists where Hot Chocolate is not aromatic, but Tea cannot be sweetened, without violating any premises.\n\nAnswer: No"

The only mention of Tiger is in the implication \\(\\text{Carn}_t \\rightarrow P_c\\), which relates to Cat purring, not Tiger purring.\n   - Since \\(P_t\\) is not referenced in any premise, \\(\\neg P_t\\) (Tiger does not purr) is an independent proposition that does not logically constrain or affect other propositions in the premises.\n\n4. **Analyze the premises for Dog having a tail (\\(D_{\\text{tail}}\\)):**\n   - \\(D_{\\text{tail}}\\) is only supported by the default rule: \"Typically, animals with fur have tails.\" Since Dogs have fur (\\(D_{\\text{fur}}\\)), this suggests \\(D_{\\text{tail}}\\) is likely, but the word \"typically\" makes this rule defeasible (non-strict). No premises guarantee \\(D_{\\text{tail}}\\) absolutely, and exceptions are possible (e.g., a tailless dog breed, though not mentioned).\n   - No other premises (e.g., about barking, mammals, or carnivores) provide information about tails, so \\(D_{\\text{tail}}\\) cannot be strictly derived.\n\n5. **Evaluate the logical connection:**\n   - There is no premise linking Tiger purring (\\(P_t\\)) to Dog having a tail (\\(D_{\\text{tail}}\\)) or to any other proposition that affects \\(D_{\\text{tail}}\\). Thus, \\(\\neg P_t\\) has no bearing on \\(D_{\\text{tail}}\\).\n   - Since \\(D_{\\text{tail}}\\) is not necessarily true (due to the \"typically\" qualifier), and \\(\\neg P_t\\) is unconstrained, the implication \\(\\neg P_t \\rightarrow D_{\\text{tail}}\\) could be false in scenarios where \\(\\neg P_t\\) is true and \\(D_{\\text{tail}}\\) is false (e.g., if an exception to the fur-tail rule exists).\n\n6. **Determine if the conclusion follows:**\n   - For the conclusion \\(\\neg P_t \\rightarrow D_{\\text{tail}}\\) to logically follow, it must hold in all models consistent with the premises.

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the premises from the context:**\n   - Coffee and Tea are beverages served in a cafe. (Background information, not directly used in logical deductions.)\n   - Usually, beverages served in a cafe are hot. (This is a general rule with \"usually,\" indicating it may not always hold; for strict logical reasoning, we treat it as non-binding and focus on definite premises.)\n   - If Coffee is brewed, then it is aromatic. (Logical form: Brewed_Coffee \u2192 Aromatic_Coffee)\n   - If Tea is steeped, then it can be sweetened. (Logical form: Steeped_Tea \u2192 Sweetened_Tea)\n   - Either Coffee is brewed or Tea can be sweetened, or both. (Logical form: Brewed_Coffee \u2228 Sweetened_Tea)\n   - If Hot Chocolate can be sweetened, then Tea is steeped. (Logical form: Sweetened_HotChocolate \u2192 Steeped_Tea)\n   - If Espresso is hot, then Coffee is brewed. (Logical form: Hot_Espresso \u2192 Brewed_Coffee; Espresso is not referenced elsewhere, so this premise may not be relevant unless Hot_Espresso is true, which is unknown.)\n\n2. **Define the conclusion to evaluate:**\n   - The question asks if we can conclude: \"If Hot Chocolate is not aromatic, then Tea cannot be sweetened.\" (Logical form: \u00acAromatic_HotChocolate \u2192 \u00acSweetened_Tea)\n\n3. **Analyze the premises for relevant information:**\n   - The premises mention \"aromatic\" only in relation to Coffee (from \"If Coffee is brewed, then it is aromatic\"). There is no premise that attributes \"aromatic\" to Hot Chocolate or any other beverage. Therefore, \"Hot Chocolate is not aromatic\" (\u00acAromatic_HotChocolate) is an undefined property in the context and cannot be inferred from the given premises.\n   - The property \"can be sweetened\" is discussed for Tea (via steeping) and Hot Chocolate, but not directly linked to aromatic properties. Specifically:\n     - Sweetened_Tea depends on Steeped_Tea (from Steeped_Tea \u2192 Sweetened_Tea).\n     - Sweetened_HotChocolate implies Steeped_Tea (from Sweetened_HotChocolate \u2192 Steeped_Tea), but this does not relate to aromatic qualities.\n   - The disjunction (Brewed_Coffee \u2228 Sweetened_Tea) means that if Sweetened_Tea is false, Brewed_Coffee must be true, leading to Aromatic_Coffee. However, this involves Coffee, not Hot Chocolate.\n\n4. **Check for logical connections to the conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion requires a relationship between \u00acAromatic_HotChocolate and \u00acSweetened_Tea. Since the premises provide no information about Hot Chocolate being aromatic (or not), \u00acAromatic_HotChocolate has no basis in the given context. It could be true or false independently.\n   - Sweetened_Tea can be true or false based on other factors (e.g., if Tea is steeped or from the disjunction with Coffee brewing), but it is not contingent on Hot Chocolate's aromatic properties. For instance:\n     - If Hot Chocolate is not aromatic (\u00acAromatic_HotChocolate), Sweetened_Tea could still be true (e.g., if Tea is steeped).\n     - There is no premise linking aromatic properties of Hot Chocolate to the sweetening of Tea or any other condition affecting Sweetened_Tea.\n\n5. **Consider the role of \"usually\" and non-monotonic elements:**\n   - The statement \"beverages served in a cafe are usually hot\" is non-binding and does not specify properties like \"aromatic\" or directly include Hot Chocolate. Even if we assume Hot Chocolate is a beverage, \"hot\" \u2260 \"aromatic,\" and \"usually\" allows exceptions, so it cannot force a deduction about aromatic properties.\n\n6. **Evaluate if the implication holds:**\n   - For \u00acAromatic_HotChocolate \u2192 \u00acSweetened_Tea to be concluded, it must be entailed by the premises in all possible scenarios. However:\n     - If \u00acAromatic_HotChocolate is true, Sweetened_Tea could be true (e.g., if Steeped_Tea is true) or false (e.g., if Brewed_Coffee is true and Steeped_Tea is false), showing no dependency.\n     - Since Aromatic_HotChocolate is undefined, the truth value of \u00acAromatic_HotChocolate is arbitrary, and the implication cannot be derived from the premises.\n\n7. **Conclusion on logical entailment:**\n   - The premises do not support any inference about Hot Chocolate's aromatic properties. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"if Hot Chocolate is not aromatic, then Tea cannot be sweetened\" based on the given context. The conclusion does not logically follow.\n\nAnswer: No"

There is no such evidence in the context, so \\( \\text{L\\_e} \\) holds.\n   - From \\( \\text{L\\_e} \\rightarrow \\text{S\\_in\\_class} \\), if \\( \\text{L\\_e} \\) is true, then \\( \\text{S\\_in\\_class} \\) must be true.\n\n4. **Derive that Student is in class and studies:**  \n   - With \\( \\text{L\\_e} \\) true (from typicality), \\( \\text{S\\_in\\_class} \\) is true (from \\( \\text{L\\_e} \\rightarrow \\text{S\\_in\\_class} \\)).\n   - From \\( \\text{S\\_in\\_class} \\rightarrow \\text{Study} \\), if \\( \\text{S\\_in\\_class} \\) is true, then Study is true. Therefore, Study is true.\n\n5. **Evaluate the implication under \\( \\neg \\text{G\\_pr} \\):**  \n   - Assume \\( \\neg \\text{G\\_pr} \\) (Principal does not grade papers).\n   - From step 4, Study is true regardless of \\( \\text{G\\_pr} \\), because \\( \\text{S\\_in\\_class} \\) and Study are true independently of the Principal's actions (due to the Librarian being educated).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg \\text{Study} \\) is false when \\( \\neg \\text{G\\_pr} \\) is true.\n   - The implication \\( \\neg \\text{G\\_pr} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Study} \\) requires that whenever \\( \\neg \\text{G\\_pr} \\) is true, \\( \\neg \\text{Study} \\) must also be true. But here, \\( \\neg \\text{G\\_pr} \\) is true and \\( \\neg \\text{Study} \\) is false, so the implication is false in this scenario.\n\n6. **Check for logical entailment:**  \n   - For \\( \\neg \\text{G\\_pr} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Study} \\) to logically follow, it must hold in all models where the premises are true.\n   - However, in the model where \\( \\text{L\\_e} \\) is true (as per typicality), \\( \\text{S\\_in\\_class} \\) and Study are true, making \\( \\neg \\text{Study} \\) false even when \\( \\neg \\text{G\\_pr} \\) is true. Thus, there exists a model where the premises are true but \\( \\neg \\text{G\\_pr} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Study} \\) is false.\n   - Without the typicality assumption, if \\( \\text{L\\_e} \\) were false, \\( \\text{S\\_in\\_class} \\) could be false (from \\( \\text{L\\_e} \\rightarrow \\text{S\\_in\\_class} \\)), leading to \\( \\neg \\text{Study} \\) (from \\( \\text{S\\_in\\_class} \\rightarrow \\text{Study} \\)), and \\( \\neg \\text{G\\_pr} \\) could be true. But this is not the typical case, and the variability means the implication does not always hold.\n   - Since the implication can be false in some valid models (e.g., when Librarian is educated), it is not entailed by the premises.\n\n7. **"

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the propositions and premises:**\n   - Let \\(B\\): Book is a bestseller.\n   - Let \\(RIC\\): Pen has a refillable ink cartridge.\n   - Let \\(FP\\): Pen is a fountain pen.\n   - Let \\(N_{\\text{avail}}\\): Notebook is available for purchase.\n   - From premise 3: If Book is a bestseller, then it is displayed prominently (\\(B \\rightarrow P_{\\text{display}}\\)).\n   - From premise 4: If Pen is a fountain pen, then it has a refillable ink cartridge (\\(FP \\rightarrow RIC\\)).\n   - From premise 5: Either Book is a bestseller or Pen has a refillable ink cartridge, or both (\\(B \\lor RIC\\)).\n   - From premise 6: If Notebook is available for purchase, then Pen is a fountain pen (\\(N_{\\text{avail}} \\rightarrow FP\\)).\n   - From premise 7: If Planner is displayed prominently, then Book is a bestseller (\\(Planner_{\\text{display}} \\rightarrow B\\)).\n   - Premise 2 states that items in the bookstore are \"normally\" available for purchase, but \"normally\" implies a default with possible exceptions, so it does not guarantee that all items are always available.\n\n2. **Analyze the question:**\n   - The question asks: \"Can we conclude if a Notebook is not a fountain pen then a Book is a bestseller?\"\n   - Notebook and fountain pen are distinct: Notebook is likely a type of book or stationery item, while a fountain pen is a type of pen. Therefore, \"Notebook is not a fountain pen\" (\\(\\neg(\\text{Notebook is FP})\\)) is always true because a notebook cannot be a pen (they are different categories of items).\n\n3. **Simplify the implication:**\n   - The implication \"if Notebook is not a fountain pen then Book is a bestseller\" has an antecedent (\\(\\neg(\\text{Notebook is FP})\\)) that is always true.\n   - An implication with a true antecedent reduces to the truth of the consequent: \"Book is a bestseller\" (\\(B\\)).\n   - Thus, the question reduces to: \"Can we conclude that Book is always a bestseller?\" (i.e., is \\(B\\) necessarily true?).\n\n4. **Check if \\(B\\) is always true using the premises:**\n   - From premise 5: \\(B \\lor RIC\\), so if \\(B\\) is false, then \\(RIC\\) must be true.\n   - \\(RIC\\) being true does not require \\(FP\\) to be true, because premise 4 (\\(FP \\rightarrow RIC\\)) is a conditional that does not assert the converse (i.e., \\(RIC\\) could be true without \\(FP\\) if there is a non-fountain pen with a refillable ink cartridge).\n   - Now, consider the availability of Notebook (\\(N_{\\text{avail}}\\)):\n     - If \\(N_{\\text{avail}}\\) is true, premise 6 (\\(N_{\\text{avail}} \\rightarrow FP\\)) requires \\(FP\\) to be true, which implies \\(RIC\\) (from premise 4).\n     - If \\(N_{\\text{avail}}\\) is false, premise 6 is satisfied regardless of \\(FP\\) (since a false antecedent implies anything), so \\(FP\\) could be false.\n   - Premise 2 (\"normally\" available) allows for exceptions, so \\(N_{\\text{avail}}\\) can be false without contradiction.\n   - Premise 7 (\\(Planner_{\\text{display}} \\rightarrow B\\)) does not force \\(B\\) to be true if Planner is not displayed prominently.\n   - Therefore, a consistent scenario exists where \\(B\\) is false:\n     - Assume \\(B = \\text{false}\\) (Book is not a bestseller).\n     - Then \\(RIC = \\text{true}\\) (from \\(B \\lor RIC\\)), possibly from a non-fountain pen (e.g., a rollerball pen with refillable cartridge, so \\(FP = \\text{false}\\)).\n     - Set \\(N_{\\text{avail}} = \\text{false}\\) (Notebook not available, allowed by premise 2's \"normally\").\n     - Set \\(Planner_{\\text{display}} = \\text{false}\\) (so premise 7 is satisfied).\n     - All premises hold: Premise 3 is true (false implies anything), premise 4 is true (false implies anything), premise 5 is true (\\(RIC\\) true), premise 6 is true (false implies anything), premise 7 is true (false implies anything).\n\n5. **Conclusion from the analysis:**\n   - Since \\(B\\) can be false in a valid scenario (e.g., Book not a bestseller, Pen not a fountain pen but has refillable ink, Notebook not available), we cannot conclude that Book is always a bestseller.\n   - Therefore, we cannot conclude the implication \"if Notebook is not a fountain pen then Book is a bestseller\" because the antecedent is always true, but the consequent is not always true.\n\nAnswer: No"

This implies that, barring exceptions, carnivores like lions and tigers are fed raw meat.\n   - If an animal has a mane and roars loudly, visitors find it majestic (Premise 3). Lions typically have manes and roar loudly, so this suggests lions are likely majestic.\n   - If a big cat has stripes and hunts at night, visitors are intrigued (Premise 4). Tigers have stripes and may hunt at night, so this suggests tigers are likely intriguing.\n   - Visitors find either an animal with a mane majestic or a big cat that hunts at night intriguing, or both (Premise 5). This is a disjunction but does not force specific outcomes for lions or tigers.\n   - If the lion is majestic, then the tiger is intriguing (Premise 6). This is a conditional: L_majestic \u2192 T_intriguing.\n   - If the tiger is fed raw meat, then the lion is majestic (Premise 7). This is a conditional: T_fed_raw \u2192 L_majestic.\n\n2. **Focus on the relevant implication for the conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion to evaluate is: \"If the lion is not majestic, then the tiger is not fed raw meat\" (\u00acL_majestic \u2192 \u00acT_fed_raw).\n   - Premise 7 directly states: T_fed_raw \u2192 L_majestic.\n   - The contrapositive of Premise 7 is logically equivalent: \u00acL_majestic \u2192 \u00acT_fed_raw. This means that if the lion is not majestic, the tiger cannot be fed raw meat, based solely on Premise 7.\n\n3. **Check for consistency with other premises:**\n   - Premise 1 and Premise 2 suggest that tigers, as carnivores, are normally fed raw meat. However, \"normally\" allows for exceptions, so \u00acT_fed_raw is possible without contradiction.\n   - Premise 3 implies lions are likely majestic due to having a mane and roaring, but it does not guarantee L_majestic must be true in all scenarios (e.g., if \"normally\" or other factors apply). Thus, \u00acL_majestic is a feasible case to consider.\n   - Premise 6 (L_majestic \u2192 T_intriguing) and Premise 4 (relating to tigers being intriguing) do not interact with the contrapositive of Premise 7, as they concern different attributes (intrigue vs. feeding).\n   - Premise 5 is a disjunctive statement about visitor perceptions but does not constrain the truth values of L_majestic or T_fed_raw in a way that affects the contrapositive.\n   - No premise contradicts \u00acL_majestic \u2192 \u00acT_fed_raw. If \u00acL_majestic were true, Premise 7 would require \u00acT_fed_raw to hold, making the conclusion valid.\n\n4. **Determine logical entailment:**\n   - The contrapositive \u00acL_majestic \u2192 \u00acT_fed_raw is directly derivable from Premise 7 and is a valid logical inference.\n   - Since Premise 7 is given and no other premise overrides or invalidates this relationship, the conclusion follows logically.\n\n**Answer: Yes**"

Consider other premises for potential influence:\n   - Premise 1: \"Normally, baked goods prepared with care are delicious.\" This is a default rule (non-monotonic), suggesting \\(\\text{D_cookie}\\) is typically true since the cookie is baked with care. However, Premise 6 provides a strict logical implication that overrides this default when \\(\\neg \\text{CC}\\) is true, as it forces \\(\\neg \\text{D_cookie}\\).\n   - Premises 2-5 discuss enjoyment of desserts/pastries and appetizing qualities, but none link \\(\\neg \\text{CC}\\) directly to \\(\\text{D_cookie}\\) or override the contrapositive of Premise 6. For example:\n     - Premise 4 states customers enjoy either a chocolate-frosted dessert or a buttery-layered pastry (or both), but this does not affect the cookie's deliciousness.\n     - Premise 5 links \\(\\text{CC}\\) to the buttery pastry being appetizing, but it is irrelevant to \\(\\text{D_cookie}\\).\n   - Thus, no other premise supports \\( \\neg \\text{CC} \\rightarrow \\text{D_cookie} \\).\n\n6. Conclusion: Since \\( \\neg \\text{CC} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{D_cookie} \\) logically follows from Premise 6 and contradicts \\( \\neg \\text{CC} \\rightarrow \\text{D_cookie} \\), we cannot conclude the desired statement. The reasoning shows that if the chocolate cake is not enjoyed, the cookie cannot be delicious, not that it must be delicious.\n\n**Answer: No**"

This implies \\( \\neg F \\lor \\neg V \\) (either not feed or not vaccines, or both).\n   - \"The cows can either eat nutritious feed or not remain healthy\" \u2192 This is interpreted as \\( F \\lor \\neg H \\).

    "model_response": "**Reasoning steps:**\n- Step 1: The context provides two premises:  \n  - Premise 1: If the Supernova 5000 was calibrated precisely (P), then it would capture clearer images of distant galaxies (Q).

No additional constraints or exceptions are provided, so the entailment holds based on the given premises.  \n- Step 6: Since P \u2192 (Q \u2227 R) is derivable from P \u2192 Q and P \u2192 R, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n**Answer:** Yes"

Symbolically, S \u2192 usually (E \u2227 F).\n   - Premise 2: \"Last night, Jenny made sure to get to bed early and got a full 8 hours of rest.\" This directly states that Jenny obtained adequate sleep (S is true).\n   - Premise 3: \"Jenny got adequate sleep.\" This is an explicit affirmation of S, reinforcing Premise 2.\n\n2. **Apply logical inference:**\n   - Since S is true (Jenny got adequate sleep), and the rule S \u2192 usually (E \u2227 F) holds, we can infer that Jenny is usually energetic and focused as a result.\n   - The word \"usually\" indicates a default or probabilistic relationship, not a strict logical necessity. However, in the absence of any contradictory evidence (e.g., factors like illness or stress that might override the rule), default reasoning supports the conclusion that E and F are true.\n\n3. **Consider temporal relevance:**\n   - The sleep occurred last night, and the question asks about today.

The context also states: \"Last night, either the electricity went out, it started raining, or both things happened.\" This is E \u2228 R, where R is \"it started raining.\"\n6. Since we have \u00acE (electricity did not go out) and E \u2228 R must be true (as it happened last night), R must be true. Therefore, it started raining (R).\n7. Another premise states: \"If it starts raining, the streets get wet.\" This is R \u2192 W, where W is \"streets get wet.\"\n8. From R (it started raining) and R \u2192 W, we infer that the streets got wet (W).\n9. Therefore, given that we did not light any candles (\u00acC), the streets did get wet (W).\n\n**Answer:** Yes"

Was Kate feeling stressed?\nReasoning steps: [generate step-by-step reasoning]\nAnswer: Yes/No",
    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Define the logical propositions based on the context:**\n   - Let \\( S \\) represent \"Kate feels stressed.\"\n   - Let \\( M \\) represent \"Kate meditates.\"\n   - Let \\( A \\) represent \"Kate feels anxious.\"\n   - Let \\( E \\) represent \"Kate exercises.\"\n\n2. **Translate the context into logical implications:**\n   - \"Whenever Kate feels stressed, she meditates\" translates to \\( S \\rightarrow M \\). This means if Kate is stressed, she must meditate.\n   - \"Kate also exercises when feeling anxious\" translates to \\( A \\rightarrow E \\). This means if Kate is anxious, she must exercise.\n   - \"Relaxation techniques and physical activity help manage stress\" is a general statement and does not provide a direct logical rule about Kate's state or actions for this deduction. It is background information and not used in the logical inference here.\n\n3. **Analyze the given premise from the question:**\n   - The premise is \"Either Kate did not meditate or she did not exercise,\" which translates to \\( \\neg M \\lor \\neg E \\).\n\n4. **Determine the goal:**\n   - The question asks if Kate was feeling stressed, i.e., whether \\( S \\) is true, given \\( \\neg M \\lor \\neg E \\).\n\n5. **Consider the contrapositive of the first rule:**\n   - From \\( S \\rightarrow M \\), the contrapositive is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\). This means if Kate does not meditate, she is not stressed.\n\n6. **Evaluate the premise \\( \\neg M \\lor \\neg E \\) case by case:**\n   - **Case 1: \\( \\neg M \\) is true (Kate did not meditate).**\n     - If \\( \\neg M \\) is true, then from \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), \\( \\neg S \\) must be true. Thus, Kate is not stressed (\\( S \\) is false).\n   - **Case 2: \\( \\neg E \\) is true (Kate did not exercise), and \\( M \\) may be true or false.**\n     - If \\( \\neg E \\) is true, from the second rule \\( A \\rightarrow E \\), the contrapositive \\( \\neg E \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) applies, meaning Kate is not anxious (\\( \\neg A \\) is true).\n     - However, the context does not link anxiety (\\( A \\)) directly to stress (\\( S \\)). Stress and anxiety are treated as separate states.\n     - Therefore, \\( \\neg E \\) (and thus \\( \\neg A \\)) does not provide information about \\( S \\). Kate could be stressed (\\( S \\) true) or not stressed (\\( S \\) false) in this case.\n     - For example:\n       - If \\( S \\) is true, Kate must meditate (\\( M \\) true) from \\( S \\rightarrow M \\). With \\( \\neg E \\) true, \\( \\neg M \\lor \\neg E \\) holds because \\( \\neg E \\) is true, and \\( S \\) can be true.\n       - If \\( S \\) is false, Kate might still meditate for other reasons (\\( M \\) true), and with \\( \\neg E \\) true, \\( \\neg M \\lor \\neg E \\) holds, and \\( S \\) is false.\n\n7. **Overall conclusion from the premise:**\n   - The premise \\( \\neg M \\lor \\neg E \\) does not necessarily imply \\( S \\) is true:\n     - In Case 1 (\\( \\neg M \\) true), \\( S \\) is false.\n     - In Case 2 (\\( \\neg E \\) true), \\( S \\) can be true or false.\n   - Since \\( S \\) can be false in some scenarios (e.g., when \\( \\neg M \\) is true, or when \\( M \\) is true and \\( \\neg E \\) is true but \\( S \\) is false), we cannot conclude that Kate was feeling stressed based solely on the given premise and context.\n\n8. **Answer the question:**\n   - The question asks \"Was Kate feeling stressed?\" expecting a yes or no based on the information.\n   - Since the premise does not force \\( S \\) to be true (it can be false), the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No"

However, \"could help\" suggests that I is not necessarily sufficient for A (other factors may influence acceptance). Thus, I being true does not guarantee A is true; not A is possible.\n\n4. **Question analysis: \"If Laura does not get accepted into music school, does she take voice lessons?\"**\n   - This is equivalent to: Does \u00acA \u2192 V logically follow?\n   - V is established as true from the context (Laura takes voice lessons).\n   - Since V is true, the implication \u00acA \u2192 V is always true, regardless of A's value. A true consequent (V) makes the implication hold for all antecedents (including \u00acA).\n   - Therefore, even if \u00acA occurs, V must be true because it is a fact from the context.\n\n5. **Conclusion based on logical reasoning:**\n   - The premises do not link \u00acA to the negation of V or suggest that V depends on A. V is independently true.\n   - As a result, the conclusion \u00acA \u2192 V logically follows from the given context.\n\n**Answer: Yes**"

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the premises from the context:**\n   - Premise 1: \"Whenever Mark gets a flat tire, he changes it himself.\" This is a conditional statement: If Mark gets a flat tire (F), then he changes it himself (C). Logically: F \u2192 C.\n   - Premise 2: \"If Mark gets a flat, he calls roadside assistance.\" This is another conditional: If Mark gets a flat tire (F), then he calls roadside assistance (A). Logically: F \u2192 A.\n   - The additional commentary (\"Being self-reliant and seeking help...\") does not introduce new logical rules, so it is not relevant for deriving the conclusion.\n\n2. **Analyze the given information in the question:**\n   - The question states: \"Either Mark did not change the tire himself, or he did not call for assistance.\" This is a disjunction: Not C or Not A. Logically: \u00acC \u2228 \u00acA.\n   - This disjunction is presented as a fact or observation to be used in reasoning.\n\n3. **Determine the logical implications:**\n   - If Mark got a flat tire (F is true), then from Premise 1 (F \u2192 C), C must be true (he changes it himself).\n   - Similarly, from Premise 2 (F \u2192 A), A must be true (he calls roadside assistance).\n   - Therefore, if F is true, both C and A are true, meaning \u00acC is false and \u00acA is false.\n   - With both \u00acC and \u00acA false, the disjunction \u00acC \u2228 \u00acA would be false.\n\n4. **Evaluate the given disjunction against the premises:**\n   - The disjunction \u00acC \u2228 \u00acA is given as true.\n   - If F were true, \u00acC \u2228 \u00acA would be false (as shown above), leading to a contradiction with the given disjunction.\n   - Therefore, F cannot be true; Mark did not get a flat tire.\n\n5. **Consider the case where Mark did not get a flat tire:**\n   - If F is false (Mark did not get a flat tire), the premises F \u2192 C and F \u2192 A do not impose any constraints on C or A. Mark may or may not have changed a tire or called assistance, but this is irrelevant to the disjunction \u00acC \u2228 \u00acA.\n   - Since \u00acC \u2228 \u00acA can be true without contradiction when F is false, it supports the conclusion that Mark did not get a flat tire.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the premises and the given disjunction, Mark did not get a flat tire.\n\nAnswer: No"

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If the recipe only requires pantry staples (P), Miriam can make dinner (D). This is stated as: \"If the recipe only requires pantry staples, Miriam can make dinner tonight.\" So, P \u2192 D.\n\n2. **Premise 3:** It is not possible for Miriam to both make dinner and bake cookies. This is derived from: \"Either she won't make dinner or she won't bake cookies, or she'll do neither,\" which logically means \u00ac(D \u2227 C). Therefore, if D is true, C must be false (i.e., D \u2192 \u00acC).\n\n3. **Premise 2:** If Miriam went grocery shopping this week (G), she will bake cookies for dessert (C). This is stated as: \"If she went grocery shopping this week, she'll also bake cookies for dessert.\" So, G \u2192 C. By contraposition, if C is false, then G must be false (\u00acC \u2192 \u00acG).\n\n4. **From Steps 1-3:** If P is true, then D is true (from Premise 1). Since D is true, C must be false (from Premise 3). Then, since C is false, G must be false (from Premise 2). Therefore, P \u2192 \u00acG.\n\n5. **Premise 4:** If milk and eggs are in the refrigerator (M \u2227 E), then Miriam went grocery shopping this week (G). This is stated as: \"She knows that if milk and eggs are there, then she went grocery shopping this week.\" So, (M \u2227 E) \u2192 G. By contraposition, if G is false, then (M \u2227 E) must be false (\u00acG \u2192 \u00ac(M \u2227 E)).\n\n6. **Combining with Step 4:** If P is true, then G is false (from Step 4). Since G is false, \u00ac(M \u2227 E) must be true (from Premise 4). Therefore, P \u2192 \u00ac(M \u2227 E).\n\n7. **Conclusion for the Question:** The question asks: \"If the recipe only requires pantry staples (P), are milk and eggs in the refrigerator (M \u2227 E)?\" From Step 6, if P is true, then \u00ac(M \u2227 E) is true, meaning milk and eggs are not both in the refrigerator. Therefore, it does not follow that milk and eggs are in the refrigerator when P is true; in fact, the premises imply the opposite.\n\n**Answer:** No"

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Context Analysis**: The context states it was Saturday afternoon. Since Saturday is part of the weekend, \"it is the weekend\" (denoted as \\(S\\)) is true.\n\n2. **Premise 1**: Jane knows that if it is the weekend, then the cafe is busy. This is \\(S \\rightarrow B\\). Since \\(S\\) is true (from step 1), \\(B\\) (the cafe is busy) must be true.

This is because a false antecedent makes the entire implication vacuously true in propositional logic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The implication \\(\\neg B \\rightarrow E\\) logically follows from the premises, as the falsehood of \\(\\neg B\\) ensures the truth of the conditional statement.\n\n**Answer: Yes**"

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps\n\nTo determine if Emma is meeting a friend for dinner given that she did not buy treats, I will use the premises from the context and apply logical reasoning step by step. I define the following propositions for clarity:\n- \\(O\\): The pet store is open.\n- \\(B\\): Emma buys treats for her dog.\n- \\(H\\): Emma takes her dog on a long hike.\n- \\(E\\): The dog gets well-exercised.\n- \\(F\\): Emma finished work early.\n- \\(M\\): Emma is meeting a friend for dinner.\n\n**Premises from the context:**\n1. If the store is open, Emma buys treats: \\(O \\rightarrow B\\).\n2. If Emma goes on a long hike, the dog gets well-exercised: \\(H \\rightarrow E\\).\n3. Either the store is open or the dog is not exercised (or both): \\(O \\lor \\neg E\\). (The phrase \"or the store is open and the dog isn't exercised\" is redundant as it is already covered by \\(O \\lor \\neg E\\), so it simplifies to \\(O \\lor \\neg E\\).)\n4. If Emma finished work early, she goes on a hike: \\(F \\rightarrow H\\).\n5. The friend wondered if Emma finished work early or is meeting a friend for dinner (or both): \\(F \\lor M\\). However, this is not an asserted fact; it is merely what the friend wondered about. It does not provide evidence that \\(F \\lor M\\) is true.\n\n**Assumption for the question:** Emma did not buy treats, so \\(\\neg B\\).\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. From premise 1 (\\(O \\rightarrow B\\)) and the assumption \\(\\neg B\\), we can infer \\(\\neg O\\) by contraposition (if not B, then not O). Thus, \\(\\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg O\\), so the store is not open: \\(\\neg O\\).\n\n2. From premise 3 (\\(O \\lor \\neg E\\)) and \\(\\neg O\\), we can infer \\(\\neg E\\) because for the disjunction \\(O \\lor \\neg E\\) to hold when \\(O\\) is false, \\(\\neg E\\) must be true. Thus, the dog is not exercised: \\(\\neg E\\).\n\n3. From premise 2 (\\(H \\rightarrow E\\)) and \\(\\neg E\\), we can infer \\(\\neg H\\) by contraposition (if not E, then not H). Thus, Emma does not go on a long hike: \\(\\neg H\\).\n\n4. From premise 4 (\\(F \\rightarrow H\\)) and \\(\\neg H\\), we can infer \\(\\neg F\\) by contraposition (if not H, then not F). Thus, Emma did not finish work early: \\(\\neg F\\).\n\n5. Now, we have \\(\\neg F\\) from step 4. The friend wondered about \\(F \\lor M\\) (premise 5), but this is not a factual premise; it is only a consideration. Since \\(\\neg F\\) is true, \\(F \\lor M\\) would require \\(M\\) to be true for it to hold. However, there is no premise asserting that \\(F \\lor M\\) is true. Therefore, \\(M\\) (meeting a friend for dinner) could be true or false; it is not constrained by the premises or the assumption \\(\\neg B\\).\n\n6. Specifically:\n   - If \\(M\\) is true, then \\(F \\lor M\\) is true (as the friend wondered), but this is not necessary.\n   - If \\(M\\) is false, then \\(F \\lor M\\) is false (since \\(\\neg F\\) and \\(\\neg M\\)), but this does not contradict any premise, as the friend's wonder does not impose truth.\n   \n7. Thus, from \\(\\neg B\\), we can derive \\(\\neg F\\), but we cannot derive \\(M\\). The truth value of \\(M\\) is independent and unknown based on the given information.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assumption that Emma did not buy treats (\\(\\neg B\\)) does not logically imply that she is meeting a friend for dinner (\\(M\\)). Therefore, we cannot conclude that she is meeting a friend for dinner based on the premises and the assumption.\n\nAnswer: No"

    "model_response": "### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Define propositions based on the context:**\n   - Let \\( TH \\): Team is training hard.\n   - Let \\( P \\): Team is prepared for the upcoming game.\n   - Let \\( EP \\): Coach scheduled extra practices.\n   - Let \\( MH \\): Players are putting in more hours.\n   - Let \\( IM \\): This weekend's match is very important.\n   - Let \\( LL \\): Team lost their last game.\n\n2. **Translate premises into logical statements:**\n   - Premise 1: If training hard, then prepared. (\\( TH \\rightarrow P \\))\n   - Premise 2: If extra practices, then more hours. (\\( EP \\rightarrow MH \\))\n   - Premise 3: Either training hard, or not more hours, or both (simplified from context: \"Either the team is training hard, or the players are not putting in more hours, or the team is training hard but the players are not putting in more hours\"). This is logically equivalent to \\( TH \\lor \\neg MH \\).\n   - Premise 4: If important match, then extra practices. (\\( IM \\rightarrow EP \\))\n   - Premise 5: If lost last game, then important match. (\\( LL \\rightarrow IM \\))\n\n3. **Question to evaluate:** \"If the team will not be prepared for the game, then did the team lose their last game?\" This translates to: Does \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow LL \\) hold based on the premises?\n\n4. **Assume \\( \\neg P \\) (team is not prepared) and derive implications:**\n   - From Premise 1 (\\( TH \\rightarrow P \\)) and \\( \\neg P \\), by contraposition, \\( \\neg TH \\) must be true (team is not training hard).\n   - From Premise 3 (\\( TH \\lor \\neg MH \\)) and \\( \\neg TH \\), \\( \\neg MH \\) must be true (players are not putting in more hours).\n   - From Premise 2 (\\( EP \\rightarrow MH \\)) and \\( \\neg MH \\), by contraposition, \\( \\neg EP \\) must be true (coach did not schedule extra practices).\n   - From Premise 4 (\\( IM \\rightarrow EP \\)) and \\( \\neg EP \\), by contraposition, \\( \\neg IM \\) must be true (this weekend's match is not very important).\n   - From Premise 5 (\\( LL \\rightarrow IM \\)) and \\( \\neg IM \\), by contraposition, \\( \\neg LL \\) must be true (team did not lose their last game).\n\n5. **Conclusion from assumption:** Under \\( \\neg P \\), we derived \\( \\neg LL \\). Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg LL \\) holds, meaning that if the team is not prepared, they did not lose their last game. This directly contradicts \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow LL \\).\n\n6. **Verify with alternative approach:** \n   - Suppose \\( LL \\) is true. From Premise 5, \\( LL \\rightarrow IM \\), so \\( IM \\) true. From Premise 4, \\( IM \\rightarrow EP \\), so \\( EP \\) true. From Premise 2, \\( EP \\rightarrow MH \\), so \\( MH \\) true. From Premise 3 (\\( TH \\lor \\neg MH \\)) and \\( MH \\) true, \\( \\neg MH \\) false, so \\( TH \\) must be true. From Premise 1, \\( TH \\rightarrow P \\), so \\( P \\) true. Thus, \\( LL \\rightarrow P \\), or equivalently \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg LL \\). Again, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow LL \\) is false.\n\n7. **Final determination:** The premises entail that \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg LL \\), not \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow LL \\).

This is stated: \"And making new connections would lead to an improved social life for Carol.\" So, F \u2192 S.\n   - The context mentions Carol's hopes and decisions (e.g., \"Carol decided to adopt a puppy\" and \"whether Carol adopted the puppy, or joined a local hiking group, or did both\"), but these are descriptive and do not provide factual information about what actually occurred. They only express possibilities or intentions, so they do not add logical implications about A, H, L, F, or S being true or false.\n\n2. **Understand the question:**\n   - The question is: \"If Carol does not feel less lonely (\u00acL), then has her social life improved (S)?\" This asks whether \u00acL implies S (i.e., \u00acL \u2192 S) based on the premises.\n\n3. **Analyze the contrapositive of the first premise:**\n   - From A \u2192 L, we can derive the contrapositive: if Carol does not feel less lonely (\u00acL), then she did not adopt the puppy (\u00acA). So, \u00acL \u2192 \u00acA.\n\n4. **Examine the relationship between \u00acL and S:**\n   - \u00acL implies \u00acA (from step 3), but \u00acA does not provide any information about H (joining the hiking group) or S (social life improvement).\n   - S depends on F (making new friends), which depends on H (joining the hiking group), as per H \u2192 F and F \u2192 S.\n   - The premises do not link \u00acA or \u00acL to H or S. Specifically:\n     - If H is true (she joined the hiking group), then F and S are true, so S could be true even if \u00acL is true.\n     - If H is false (she did not join the hiking group), then F and S may be false (assuming no other ways to make friends or improve social life are mentioned), so S could be false when \u00acL is true.\n   - Therefore, \u00acL does not determine the truth value of H, F, or S. S can be true or false when \u00acL is true.\n\n5. **Determine logical entailment:**\n   - For \u00acL \u2192 S to hold, S must be true whenever \u00acL is true. However, the premises allow for scenarios where \u00acL is true and S is false (e.g., if \u00acL, \u00acA, and \u00acH, leading to \u00acF and \u00acS). They also allow for scenarios where \u00acL is true and S is true (e.g., if \u00acL, \u00acA, but H is true, leading to F and S).\n   - Since S is not necessarily true when \u00acL is true, \u00acL does not imply S based on the given premises.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The premises do not support the conclusion that if Carol does not feel less lonely, her social life has improved. Therefore, the answer is \"no\".\n\nAnswer: No"

(\\( F \\rightarrow W \\))  \n- Premise 2: If Sam's friend asks to meet up, Sam gets coffee instead of working out. (\\( A \\rightarrow C \\))  \n  - The word \"instead\" implies that getting coffee prevents working out, so \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) and \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) (mutual exclusion).  \n- Premise 3: Either Sam has free time or his friend asks to meet up (or both).

Thus, \\( N \\) is necessary for \\( S \\) in this scenario, leading to \\( S \\rightarrow N \\) or its contrapositive \\( \\neg N \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\n3. **Derive implications for \\( \\neg M \\):**\n   - Using contraposition on \\( E \\rightarrow M \\): \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg E \\).\n   - Using contraposition on \\( C \\rightarrow E \\): \\( \\neg E \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n   - Combining these: \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg E \\) and \\( \\neg E \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), so \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\n4. **Use the disjunction \\( C \\lor N \\) with \\( \\neg C \\):**\n   - From \\( \\neg C \\) and \\( C \\lor N \\), we get \\( N \\) (since if \\( C \\) is false, \\( N \\) must be true).\n\n5. **Link \\( N \\) to \\( S \\):**\n   - From step 4, \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow N \\).\n   - From the premise that \\( N \\) enables staying injury-free (\\( S \\)), we infer that \\( N \\rightarrow S \\) (because the context states that with the extra energy from nutritious foods, she could and did stay injury-free as part of her approach to training). Therefore, \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow N \\) and \\( N \\rightarrow S \\) imply \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow S \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The derivation \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow S \\) means that if Jessica does not complete the marathon (\\( \\neg M \\)), she must stay injury-free during training (\\( S \\)). Thus, the answer is \"yes.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes"
