While it might imply active study, the premises do not link dedication to a requirement for choosing one of the two paths.  \n4. **Logical Disjunction Requirement**: For the conclusion (\"either she gains expertise or is exposed...\") to follow, the premises must necessitate that all students (including Sarah) must choose at least one option.

If it is interpreted as **F** (the chef used fresh ingredients), then from **F \u2192 D**, we can directly conclude **D** (the food is delicious) via **Modus Ponens**. This would make the conclusion hold regardless of whether the chef also cooked a complicated recipe (C).  \n- **Step 2:** However, the phrasing \"Either the chef used fresh ingredients...\" implies a disjunction (e.g., F \u2228 G, where G is unspecified). Without knowing G, we cannot infer F unless G is \u00acC. If G were \u00acC (e.g., the disjunction is **F \u2228 \u00acC**), then **C** (as in the question's hypothesis) would force **F** to be true (via disjunctive syllogism), leading to **D** via **F \u2192 D**.  \n- **Step 3:** Since the context does not specify the missing part of the disjunction, the third premise cannot reliably confirm **F** in the absence of **G**. Thus, **C** alone (cook a complicated recipe) does not entail **F** (use fresh ingredients), meaning **D** (delicious food) cannot be logically inferred solely from **C**.  \n\nThe conclusion hinges on **F \u2192 D** requiring **F** for **D** to hold. The third premise does not guarantee **F** unless misinterpreted as asserting **F** directly. Since the question asks whether **C** (cook a complicated recipe) ensures **D** (delicious food), and **C** has no direct link to **F**, the conclusion does not logically follow.  \n\n**Answer:** No."

    "model_response": "Reasoning steps: \n1. The general rule states that \"typically, large cities have an international airport,\" which implies that being a large city is a sufficient condition for expecting an international airport unless exceptions apply.  \n2. Boston has a population over 500,000 people, which strongly suggests it qualifies as a \"large city\" under reasonable interpretations of the population threshold.  \n3. Atlanta is explicitly stated to not have an international airport. If Atlanta were a large city, this would make it an exception to the general rule. However, the premises do not clarify whether Atlanta is \"large\" (its population is not provided), so the rule\u2019s applicability to Atlanta remains ambiguous.  \n4. Since Boston meets the likely criteria for a \"large city\" and no exception is stated for it, non-monotonic reasoning (e.g., default logic) allows us to infer that Boston has an international airport by default. The absence of counter-evidence supports this conclusion.  \n\nAnswer: Yes"

All three students (Julia, Emma, Lucas) have published, so the general rule (if published, considered for scholarships) applies unless there are exceptions.  \n2. The premise states \"at least one of Julia or Emma\" has not been considered, implying an exception exists for at least one of them.  \n3. The general rule \"generally\" allows exceptions, so Lucas's status as \"considered\" depends on whether his case is an exception. However, no premise explicitly states Lucas is an exception, so non-monotonic reasoning might assume he is considered by default.  \n4. To conclude \"exactly one of Julia or Emma\" was not considered, the premise \"at least one\" allows for both to be exceptions. Without explicit confirmation that both are not exceptions (or only one is), the conclusion of \"exactly one\" cannot be logically enforced.  \n5. The conclusion requires both Lucas being considered and \"exactly one\" of Julia/Emma not being considered.

The coach claims the player scored **30 points**; the referee denies this, asserting the player **did not** score 30 points. These statements directly contradict.\n2. **Officials (referees)** are stated to be \"normally correct,\" indicating a general assumption of reliability. **However**, the coach is explicitly stated to have \"**better information than the referee**,\" creating a hierarchy of reliability in this specific case.\n3. The superior reliability of the coach\u2019s information overrides the ref\u2019s statement (non-monotonic reasoning: default assumptions about referees are abandoned due to higher credibility of coach\u2019s account).\n4. Therefore, the coach\u2019s statement takes precedence: **the player scored 30 points**.\n5.

Since L is false (from step 4), L \u2192 \u00acP is vacuously true (material implication: false antecedent makes implication true regardless of \u00acP's truth value).  \n7. Even though P is true (pen is used for writing), the implication L \u2192 \u00acP still holds because L is false in all models satisfying the premises.  \n\nAnswer: Yes"

However, pests can sometimes attack and damage crops. The farmer's wife believed that either the crop was watered sufficiently or there were no pest attacks or both.  \nQuestion: If there were pests attacking the crop, does this mean it had a high yield?  \nReasoning steps:  \n1. Let $ P $: \"There are pests attacking the crop\", $ W $: \"The crop was watered sufficiently\", $ H $: \"The crop has a high yield\".  \n2. Premise 1: $ W \\rightarrow H $ (watering leads to high yield).  \n3. Premise 2: The wife's belief: $ W \\lor \\lnot P $ (either watered or no pests or both).  \n4. Given $ P $ is true (pests are attacking), substitute into Premise 2: $ W \\lor \\lnot P \\Rightarrow W \\lor \\text{False} $ (since $ \\lnot P $ is false when $ P $ is true).  \n5. Thus, $ W $ must be true to satisfy Premise 2.  \n6. From Premise 1 ($ W \\rightarrow H $) and $ W $, apply Modus Ponens: $ H $ is true.  \nConclusion: If pests attacked the crop, then the crop had a high yield.  \nAnswer: Yes"

From the context: \"While Laura spends hours each day on the piano, she also enjoys taking voice lessons during her free time.\" This directly states that she takes voice lessons as part of her routine, regardless of acceptance outcome.  \n2. The disjunction in the context (\"either devotes time to piano, or focuses on vocal talents, if not both\") explicitly allows for both activities to occur simultaneously.  \n3. The question's premise (\u00acR) does not alter the established fact that she already takes voice lessons.

If Dan planned healthy meals, he would start eating a more nutritious diet. Eating well combined with exercise meant Dan could achieve his fitness goals.  \nQuestion: If Dan does not gain strength and energy, then does he achieve his fitness goals?  \n\n**Reasoning steps:**  \n1. The statement establishes that exercising (A) helps gain strength and energy (E), implying **A \u2192 E** (Dan's active routine leads to E).  \n2. Achieving fitness goals (D) requires both eating well (C) and exercising (A), implying **(C \u2227 A) \u2192 D**.  \n3. The question assumes **\u00acE** (Dan does not gain strength and energy). From **A \u2192 E** and **\u00acE**, **Modus Tollens** gives **\u00acA** (Dan is not exercising).  \n4. If Dan is not exercising (**\u00acA**), then **C \u2227 A** becomes false, so **(C \u2227 A) \u2192 D** cannot satisfy **D**.  \n5. Thus, **\u00acE** leads to **\u00acD** via **Modus Tollens** over **A \u2192 E** and **(C \u2227 A) \u2192 D**.  \n\n**Answer:** No"
