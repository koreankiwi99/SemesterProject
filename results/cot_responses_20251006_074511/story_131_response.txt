Story ID: 131
Premises: Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms.
Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.
The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Categories of ML: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning.
- Unsupervised algorithms do not require labeled data.
- The SOTA text summarization model is trained with ML algorithms, and reinforcement learning is not used.
- The ML algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.
- Therefore, the training algorithm cannot be unsupervised (since it requires labels) and, with RL excluded, it must be supervised.

Question 1:
- Since the algorithm used requires labeled data and RL is not used, supervised learning is used. True.

Question 2:
- Unsupervised learning does not require labeled data, but the training algorithm requires labeled data, so unsupervised is not used. False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
