Model Response:

Reasoning:
1. It is explicitly stated that the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic was Steinhauer. Therefore, the statement that Steinhauer was not the winner contradicts the given information.

However, it is not stated that Descampe is the Belgian in the six-way tie; there could be other Belgian players on the leaderboard, and Descampe might not be in the tie. Thus, this cannot be concluded from the given information.
