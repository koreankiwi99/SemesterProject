Premises: If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z
Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.

Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1 reasoning:
- Michael is taller than everyone else in his class.
- Peter is taller than Michael.
- By transitivity, Peter is taller than everyone in Michael’s class.
- Therefore, there is no man in Michael’s class taller than Peter, so the statement is false.

Question 2 reasoning:
- If a person does not jump when shooting, Michael can block their shooting.
- Michael cannot block Windy’s shooting.
- Therefore, Windy must jump when shooting.
- Anyone who can jump when shooting is a great shooter. Since Windy jumps when shooting, she can jump when shooting, so she is a great shooter.

Question 3 reasoning:
- We know Windy jumps when shooting.
- The only general blocking rule given (taller man can block another man) requires both to be men and a known taller-than relation.
- We don’t know Windy’s gender or any height relation between Peter and Windy, and we have no rule that Peter can block jump shooters.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Peter can block Windy’s shooting.

ANSWERS:
1: False
