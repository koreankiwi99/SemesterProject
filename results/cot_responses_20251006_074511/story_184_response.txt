Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Premises:
  - Stranger Things (ST) is a popular Netflix show.
  - If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it. (Popular → Binge)
  - Karen will download a Netflix show if and only if she binge-watches it. (Binge ↔ Download)
  - Karen does not download Black Mirror (BM).
  - BM is a Netflix show.
  - If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa. (Binge → Share)

Question 1:
- ST is popular and a Netflix show ⇒ Karen binge-watches ST.
- Binge(ST) ⇒ Share(ST).
- Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- Not Download(BM) and Binge ↔ Download ⇒ Not Binge(BM).
- For Netflix shows, Popular → Binge, so contrapositive gives Not Binge ⇒ Not Popular.
- BM is a Netflix show, so Not Popular(BM).
- The statement “BM is popular” is False.

Question 3:
