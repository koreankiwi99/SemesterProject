Story ID: 197
Premises: It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
Tom lives in a single-parent family.
Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them. 
Tom is applying to take the GRE test.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Policy: ETS provides aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
- Criteria: Those in single-parent families or with few resources can prove economic hardship.
- Tom: Is a GRE applicant; lives in a single-parent family; has few resources.
- However, “can prove” does not entail that Tom actually did prove hardship or that he applied for aid. Therefore, we cannot conclude that ETS provides financial aid to Tom.
Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Given: It costs $205 to take the GRE, which is cheaper than $300.
- Therefore, the cost is below $300.
Conclusion: True.

Question 3:
- Claim: No one taking the GRE has financial aid provided to them by something.
- Policy: ETS provides aid to any GRE applicant who proves economic hardship.
- We do not know if any specific GRE applicant actually proved hardship (even Tom only “can” prove).
- Thus we cannot confirm the universal negative nor refute it with a concrete counterexample.
Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: Unknown
