==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. Given: Vacuums suck. Given: Space is a vacuum. Therefore, by modus ponens, Space sucks. So the statement "Space sucks" is true.
2. Given: Vampires suck. From "Space sucks" we cannot infer "Space is a vampire," because sucking is not unique to vampires (plungers and vacuums also suck). No information says Space is a vampire. So this is unknown.
3. The statement claims all household appliances suck. Given: A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck. This is a counterexample, so the universal claim is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
