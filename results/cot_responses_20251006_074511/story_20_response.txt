Story ID: 20
Premises: A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.
All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies. By the rule, any game that sells more than one million copies will be included in the Top 10 list. Therefore, The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.
2) We know only that all games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies. We have no information about whether FIFA 22 is on the Top 10 list or its sales. Therefore, we cannot determine whether FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese company.
3) From (1), The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list. Therefore, the statement that it is not on the Top 10 list is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
