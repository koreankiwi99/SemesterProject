==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1 reasoning:
- French and Spanish are Romance languages, so the Romance family has multiple members.
- All languages within a language family are related to each other.
- Basque is not related to any other language.
- If Basque were a Romance language, it would be related to other Romance languages (e.g., French, Spanish), contradicting that Basque is not related to any other language.
- Therefore, Basque is not a Romance language. The statement is false.

Question 2 reasoning:
- German is related to Spanish, and Spanish is a Romance language.
- We know that being in the same family implies relatedness, but we are not told that relatedness implies being in the same family.
- Therefore, from “German is related to Spanish,” we cannot conclude that German is a Romance language, nor can we rule it out.
- The statement is uncertain based on the given information.

Question 3 reasoning:
- French is a Romance language.
- All Romance languages are Indo-European.
- Therefore, French is Indo-European. The statement is true.
