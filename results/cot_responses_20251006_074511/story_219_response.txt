Premises: Symphony No. 9 is a music piece.

Orchestras are led by conductors.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) We know: Composers write music pieces. Beethoven wrote a music piece (Symphony No. 9). From “Composers write music pieces” we cannot infer the converse that everyone who writes a music piece is a composer. So we cannot conclude Beethoven is a composer from the given statements alone.

2) Vienna Music Society is an orchestra and premiered Symphony No. 9, which is a music piece. Therefore, at least one orchestra premiered a music piece.

3) Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society. Orchestras are led by conductors. Therefore, the leader of an orchestra is a conductor; hence Beethoven is a conductor. So “Beethoven is not a conductor” is false.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
