Some pets are not mammals.

Model Response:
==================================================
- All cats are mammals, so any cat is a mammal.
- Some pets are not mammals, so at least one pet is definitely not a cat.
- However, this does not rule out that some other pets could be mammals and possibly cats.
- Both scenarios are consistent with the premises: some pets being cats, or none being cats.
