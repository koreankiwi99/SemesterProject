Premises: All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.

KO is a mature stock.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Let G(x): x is a growth stock. B(x): x is bought to earn rapid appreciation. S(x): x is suitable for a retirement fund. Stock(x): x is a stock. Mature(x): x is a mature stock.
- Premises:
  1) ∀x (G(x) -> B(x))
  2) ∀x (B(x) -> ¬S(x))
  3) ∃x (Stock(x) ∧ G(x))
  4) ∀x (Mature(x) -> S(x))
  5) Mature(KO)

From 4 and 5: S(KO). From 2, if B(KO) then ¬S(KO); contradiction with S(KO), so ¬B(KO). From 1, if G(KO) then B(KO); but ¬B(KO), so ¬G(KO).

Question 1:
"KO is a mature stock" implies KO is a stock. So True.

Question 2:
We have KO is a stock, but ¬G(KO). So “KO is a stock and a growth stock” is False.

Question 3:
Antecedent is G(KO) ∨ B(KO), both disjuncts are false (¬G(KO) and ¬B(KO)), so the conditional is vacuously True regardless of the consequent.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: True
