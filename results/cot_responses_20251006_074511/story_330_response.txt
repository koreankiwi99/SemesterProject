Story ID: 330
Premises: All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given rules:
- W → I → P → E (well-attended ⇒ invites others ⇒ makes plans ⇒ engaged).
- From E → ¬(F ∧ P), and P → E, we get P → ¬F, hence F → ¬P, and since I → P, also I → ¬F and F → ¬I.
- The only statement about larger families is L(John) → (W(John) ∨ F(John)); it does not assert L(John).

Question 1: Whether John has a larger family (L). No premise determines L(John). Unknown.

Question 2: Whether John does not have a larger family (¬L). No premise determines ¬L(John). Unknown.

Question 3: Whether John is engaged (E). E would follow if W or I or P were known, but none are established. Also no premise forces ¬E. Unknown.

Question 4: Whether John neither has a larger family nor invites others (¬L ∧ ¬I). Neither ¬L nor ¬I is entailed by the premises. Unknown.
