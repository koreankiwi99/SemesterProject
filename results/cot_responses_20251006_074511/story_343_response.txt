Story ID: 343
Premises: No digital media are analog.
Every printed text is analog media.
All streaming services are digital media.
If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.
If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
First, derive a global fact about 1984:
- Streaming service → digital (S → D).
- No digital are analog: D → ¬A (equivalently, A → ¬D).
- Printed text → analog (P → A).
- Hardcover book → printed text (H → P).
- If 1984 is a streaming service, then it is a hardcover book: S(1984) → H(1984).

Assume 1984 is a streaming service. Then:
- S(1984) → D(1984).
- S(1984) → H(1984) → P(1984) → A(1984).
So 1984 would be both digital and analog, contradicting D → ¬A. Hence ¬S(1984): 1984 is not a streaming service.

Question 1: 1984 is printed text.
- The only route provided to printed text is via S(1984) → H(1984) → P(1984), but we have ¬S(1984). No other premises imply P(1984) or ¬P(1984). So this is not determined.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: 1984 is a streaming service.
- From the derivation above, ¬S(1984).
Answer: False.

Question 3: 1984 is not a streaming service.
- As derived, ¬S(1984).
Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
