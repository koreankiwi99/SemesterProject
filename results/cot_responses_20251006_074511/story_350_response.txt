Story ID: 350
Premises: All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- The statements distinguish between “design styles that Max adores” (Zaha or Kelly) and “designs by Max.” The only rule linking properties of designs by Max is: if a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then it is a brutalist building and evocative. Combined with “No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries,” this implies there cannot be any design by Max that he adores which also has interesting geometries. However, none of the premises assert that any particular design by Max is adored, interesting, brutalist, evocative, or dreamy; nor do they link designs by Max to Kelly styles (which would yield evocative/dreamy).

Question 1:
- To conclude a design by Max is brutalist, we would need it to be adored and have interesting geometries (to trigger the conditional). But that combination is impossible by the “no adored brutalist is interesting” rule, and there is no other route to infer brutalism. No existence of any such design is given. Therefore Unknown.

Question 2:
- Evocative and dreamy are guaranteed only for Kelly Wearstler’s design styles that Max adores. That concerns styles, not designs by Max. The only way to get evocative for a design by Max is via the impossible combination (adored and interesting), and there is no way given to get dreamy for a design by Max. Therefore Unknown.

Question 3:
- Same issue: no basis to assert that any design by Max is evocative or dreamy absent a link between designs by Max and adored Kelly styles or the impossible “adored and interesting” case. Therefore Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
