Story ID: 352
Premises: All business organizations are legal entities.
All companies are business organizations.
All private companies are companies.
All legal entities are created under law. 
All legal entities have legal obligations.
If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the premises: Private company → Company → Business organization → Legal entity. And every legal entity is created under law and has legal obligations. So for any x: PC(x) → LE(x), LE(x) → CL(x) and LE(x) → LO(x). Hence PC(x) implies both CL(x) and LO(x).
- Given: For H (the Harvard Weekly Book Club), CL(H) → ¬PC(H). Combining with PC(H) → CL(H) yields PC(H) → ¬PC(H), so ¬PC(H).

Question 1:
- To conclude H has legal obligations (LO(H)), we would need H to be a legal entity. Nothing establishes that H is a legal entity or created under law. So LO(H) cannot be concluded.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement asserts LO(H) and PC(H). We have shown ¬PC(H), so the conjunction is false regardless of LO(H).
- Answer: False.

Question 3:
- If PC(H), then H is a legal entity, hence both LO(H) and CL(H) hold. Therefore (LO(H) ∨ CL(H)) holds under the assumption.
- Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
