Premises: If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From S -> not T and C -> T, S and C cannot both hold. So not (S and C).
- Given (S and C) or (not S and not C), and not (S and C), we conclude not S and not C for Peter.
- From not S and (G -> S), infer not G (Modus Tollens).
- From F -> V and V -> C, we have F -> C. With not C, infer not F (Modus Tollens).

Question 1:
- We have not C and not S. C -> T gives no info about T from not C, and S -> not T gives no info from not S. So whether Peter is notably tidy is undetermined.

Question 2:
- We have not G and not F. Therefore G or F is false.

Question 3:
- We have not G and not F, so (G and F) is false and (not G and not F) is true. The disjunction is true.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
