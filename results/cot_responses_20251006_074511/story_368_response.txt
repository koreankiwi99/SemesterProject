Story ID: 368
Premises: If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition.
If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus.
People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.
If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters.
If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.
Hannah is at Mary's school.
Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “Hannah is at Mary’s school” and “Hannah works in student jobs on campus” with the rule “If people at Mary’s school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money,” we derive that Hannah needs to earn money.
- From “If Hannah needs to earn money, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money,” together with the derived need, we get both that Hannah is not picky and that she does not need to earn money. Thus we have both Need and ¬Need for Hannah, creating a direct conflict about whether she needs money.

Question 1:
- Since we have both Need and ¬Need, the status of “Hannah needs to earn money” is uncertain.

Question 2:
- AtSchool(Hannah) is true and ¬Picky(Hannah) is derivable as above.
- “Spends a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls” follows only if she enjoys the dining hall meals. We only know she either orders takeout or enjoys dining hall meals; we can’t conclude she enjoys them. So we cannot conclude the dining-hall-time part, and the whole conjunction is uncertain.

Question 3:
- AtSchool(Hannah) is true.
- We derived ¬Picky(Hannah), so the disjunction “not picky or, if picky, then spends a lot of time in dining halls” is satisfied by the first disjunct. Therefore the whole statement is true.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: True
