Story ID: 379
Premises: People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.
If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.
If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. 
Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the rules: Born-in-multiple → Spend-time-with-siblings → Live-at-home → Not-live-with-strangers. So Born-in-multiple implies Not-live-with-strangers.
- Luke’s given disjunction: (Born-in-multiple AND Live-with-strangers) OR (Not-born-in-multiple AND Not-live-with-strangers). The first disjunct contradicts the derived implication, so it cannot be true. Therefore, the second disjunct must be true: Luke is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.
- Q1: From Not-born-in-multiple we cannot infer whether he spends a lot of time with siblings. No rule gives Spend from the negation, so this is unknown.
- Q2: If someone complains often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings born together, hence were born in a multiple birth. Given Luke is not born in a multiple birth, by modus tollens, Luke does not complain often about annoying siblings. So the statement is false.
- Q3: We have both Not-born-in-multiple and Not-complain (from above), so the conjunction is true.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
