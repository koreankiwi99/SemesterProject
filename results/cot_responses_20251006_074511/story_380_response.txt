Story ID: 380
Premises: People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. 
Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
Let C=“in club”, P=“performs often”, A=“attends and is very engaged with school events”, I=“inactive/disinterested”, H=“chaperones dances”, S=“student at the school”, YW=“young child or teenager who wishes to further academic opportunities.”

Given for club members: 
- P → A.
- I → H and H → ¬S, so I → ¬S.
- P ∨ I.
- YW → S.

Bonnie: C and either (A ∧ S) or (¬A ∧ ¬S), i.e., A ↔ S.

From P ∨ I and the above:
- If I, then ¬S, hence ¬A (by A ↔ S), hence ¬P (since P → A). So with I: I true, H true, S false, A false, P false.
- If ¬I, then P (from P ∨ I), hence A, and thus S (by A ↔ S). Also H must be false (since H → ¬S). So with ¬I: P true, A true, S true, H false, I false.

Question 1:
P is true in the ¬I case and false in the I case. Undetermined.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
Statement antecedent: (YW ∧ H) ∨ ¬YW ≡ H ∨ ¬YW.
- If I: H true, antecedent true; consequent S ∨ I true (I true).
- If ¬I: S true, so consequent true regardless of antecedent.
Thus the implication holds.
Answer: True.

Question 3:
Antecedent: H ∨ (¬H → P) ≡ H ∨ (H ∨ P) ≡ H ∨ P. For any club member, P ∨ I and I → H imply H ∨ P is always true. Consequent: YW ∧ I is impossible for club members because I → H → ¬S while YW → S. So antecedent always true and consequent always false, making the implication false.
Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
