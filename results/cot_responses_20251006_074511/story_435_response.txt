Story ID: 435
Premises: None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department. 
All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. 
All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department. 
All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. 
All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.
James is a student working in the lab. 
James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David” and “All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course,” and “All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department,” plus “James is a student working in the lab,” we get: James takes a class with David → takes the database course → is in CS.
- The statement “James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university” is naturally read as: James does not work in the lab and does not have a university part-time job. This contradicts “James is a student working in the lab,” but it still explicitly states he does not have a part-time job. There is no statement asserting that he does have such a job.
- Therefore:
  - Q1: “James has a part-time job” is contradicted by the explicit negation, so False.
  - Q2: “James does not have a part-time job” follows directly, so True.
  - Q3: “James either takes the database course or has a part-time job” is True because we derived that he takes the database course.
  - Q4: “James takes the database course” is True via the lab → David → database chain.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
4: True
