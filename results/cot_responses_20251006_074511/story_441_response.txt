Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
All animal lovers are nice to animals.

- From Tom is a pet owner and all pet owners love animals, Tom loves animals.
- From all animal lovers are nice to animals, Tom is nice to animals.
- From no one nice to animals is also mean to animals, Tom is not mean to animals.

Question 1:
- Nothing links being nice or loving animals to not being grumpy; Tom could be grumpy or not. Unknown.

Question 2:
- Since Tom is not mean, he cannot be both grumpy and mean. True.

Question 3:
- Antecedent “Tom is not both grumpy and mean” is true (since Tom is not mean).
- Consequent “Tom is neither grumpy nor an animal lover” is false because Tom is an animal lover.
