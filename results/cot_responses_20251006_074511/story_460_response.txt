Story ID: 460
Premises: If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.
If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.
All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.
“Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is a film.
“Hachi: A dog’s Tale”  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience” and “If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages,” we have F(x) -> G(x) -> A(x), hence F(x) -> A(x).
- Given “Hachi is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages” (F(h) ∨ A(h)) and F(h) -> A(h), we conclude A(h).
- From “If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance,” A(h) -> C(h), so C(h).
- From “If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance,” E(h) -> ¬C(h). By contrapositive with C(h), we get ¬E(h).

Question 1:
- We know A(h), but G(h) -> A(h) does not allow A(h) -> G(h). We do not know F(h) either. So G(h) is not determined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement is E(h) ∨ Z(h). Since ¬E(h), this reduces to Z(h), which is not determined by the premises. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The statement (E(h) ∧ Z(h)) ∨ (¬E(h) ∧ ¬Z(h)) is equivalent to E(h) ↔ Z(h). With ¬E(h), it reduces to ¬Z(h), which is not determined. Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
