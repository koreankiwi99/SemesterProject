==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "Rockie can be spotted near the campus" and "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels," we get Rabbit(Rockie) or Squirrel(Rockie).
- From "If something is skittish, then it is not calm" and Rockie is calm, we infer Rockie is not skittish.
- From "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish" and Rockie is near but not skittish, we infer Rockie is not a squirrel.
- Therefore, Rockie is a rabbit. From "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute," Rockie is cute.
- Nothing ties Rockie to being a turtle; "Some turtles can be spotted near the campus" does not specify Rockie. Given the premises, Rockieâ€™s turtle status is undetermined.

Question 1: Rockie is a turtle.
- Undetermined from the premises. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Rockie is not a turtle.
- Also undetermined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3: Rockie is a turtle or cute.
- Rockie is cute, so the disjunction is true. Answer: True.

Question 4: If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish.
- Rockie is not a squirrel, so the antecedent holds. Rockie is cute, so the consequent holds. Answer: True.

Question 5: If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.
- Rockie is cute and calm (antecedent true), but Rockie is not skittish (consequent false), so the implication is false. Answer: False.

1: Unknown
2: Unknown
