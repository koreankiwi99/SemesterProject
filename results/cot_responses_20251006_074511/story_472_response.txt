Story ID: 472
Premises: Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. 
All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
All queen bees are bees.
Harry is a bee.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Facts we have:
  - Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates. (If Animal then Invertebrate or Vertebrate)
  - Animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
  - Vertebrate animals have a backbone.
  - Bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
  - All queen bees are bees.
  - Harry is a bee.
- From “bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating” and “animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating,” we can infer that Harry is not an animal with a backbone. However, we are not told that bees are animals, so we cannot conclude Harry is an animal, nor whether he is a vertebrate or invertebrate.

Question 1:
- We know all queen bees are bees, and Harry is a bee. This does not imply he is a queen bee. No information says all bees are queen bees or that Harry specifically is a queen bee.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- “Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee.” We cannot conclude he is an invertebrate (we don’t know he’s an animal), and we cannot conclude he is a queen bee.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- Harry is not an animal with a backbone (as argued above).
- The antecedent simplifies to: either (vertebrate and animal-with-backbone) or (not vertebrate and not animal-with-backbone). Since animal-with-backbone is false, the antecedent reduces to “not vertebrate.”
- There is no information linking “not vertebrate” to “neither invertebrate nor queen bee.” In fact, it is consistent with the premises that Harry could be an animal without a backbone (hence an invertebrate), making the consequent false while the antecedent holds. It is also consistent that we don’t know whether he’s a queen bee.
- Therefore, the truth of the conditional cannot be determined from the given facts.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown

Correct: Yes

Q2: Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee.
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: No

Q3: If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.
