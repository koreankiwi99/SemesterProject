  -- was loaned out (as Ailton) to Braga, and that Fluminense is a football club.
  -- There is no premise implying that he does not (or cannot) also play for Fluminense,
  -- nor any exclusivity constraint. Hence, the negation cannot be derived.
  -- The proof is not derivable from the provided premises.
