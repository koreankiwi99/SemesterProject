Lean Code:
axiom Person : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : Person

axiom German : Person → Prop
axiom Politician : Person → Prop
axiom MemberPrussianStateParliament : Person → Prop
axiom MemberNaziReichstag : Person → Prop

-- Premises
axiom hs_german : German HeinrichSchmidt
axiom hs_politician : Politician HeinrichSchmidt
axiom hs_member_prussian : MemberPrussianStateParliament HeinrichSchmidt
axiom hs_member_nazi : MemberNaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt

-- Target conclusion (to analyze): "No politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag."
-- Formally: ∀ x, Politician x → ¬ MemberNaziReichstag x
theorem no_politicians_in_NaziReichstag : ∀ x : Person, Politician x → ¬ MemberNaziReichstag x := by
  -- This conclusion does not follow from the premises; indeed, the premises provide a counterexample (HeinrichSchmidt).
  sorry

-- A derivable consequence of the premises showing the conclusion is false:
theorem counterexample_exists : ∃ x : Person, Politician x ∧ MemberNaziReichstag x := by
  refine Exists.intro HeinrichSchmidt ?_
  exact And.intro hs_politician hs_member_nazi

-- Hence, the negation of the conclusion is provable:
theorem not_no_politicians_in_NaziReichstag : ¬ (∀ x : Person, Politician x → ¬ MemberNaziReichstag x) := by
  intro h
  have hH : ¬ MemberNaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt := h HeinrichSchmidt hs_politician
