Premises: Barutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.
Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island.
Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands.
Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands. 
If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.
Conclusion: Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica.

-- Premises
-- Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.
axiom premise1 : NamedAfter BarutinCove BarutinSettlement

-- Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island (modeled as located in Snow Island).

-- Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands.

-- Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands.

-- Transitivity of location: if A in B and B in C then A in C.

-- Conclusion to analyze:
-- "Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica."
-- Formalized as: for all x, if x is an island and x is located in Antarctica, then BarutinCove is named after x.
theorem goal : ∀ x : Place, Island x → LocatedIn x Antarctica → NamedAfter BarutinCove x := by
  intro x hxIsland hxInAntarctica
  -- There is no premise connecting NamedAfter BarutinCove _ to arbitrary islands in Antarctica.
  -- The only naming premise is that BarutinCove is named after BarutinSettlement.
  -- Therefore, the goal cannot be derived from the given premises.
