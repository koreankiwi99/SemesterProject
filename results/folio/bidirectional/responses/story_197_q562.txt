Premises: It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
Tom lives in a single-parent family.
Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them. 
Tom is applying to take the GRE test.
Conclusion: No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something.

-- 1) ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.

-- 2) Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.

-- 5) Tom is applying to take the GRE test. (We model this as "TakingGRE Tom".)
axiom Tom_applying : TakingGRE Tom

-- From the premises, we can derive that Tom can prove economic hardship.
theorem Tom_hardship : ProvesHardship Tom := by
  have disj : LivesSingleParent Tom ∨ FewResources Tom := Or.inl Tom_single_parent
  exact hardship_rule Tom disj

-- Hence, ETS provides financial aid to Tom (a GRE applicant who can prove hardship).
theorem Tom_has_aid_from_ETS : FinancialAidBy ETS Tom := by
  exact aid_rule Tom Tom_applying Tom_hardship

-- There exists someone taking the GRE who has financial aid provided by some provider (ETS).
theorem exists_taker_with_aid : ∃ p : Person, ∃ s : Provider, TakingGRE p ∧ FinancialAidBy s p := by
  refine ⟨Tom, ETS, And.intro Tom_applying Tom_has_aid_from_ETS⟩

-- Conclusion to analyze:
-- "No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something."
-- Formalized as: ∀ p, TakingGRE p → ∀ s, ¬ FinancialAidBy s p
theorem goal :
  ∀ p : Person, TakingGRE p → ∀ s : Provider, ¬ FinancialAidBy s p := by
  -- This is not derivable from the premises; in fact, the premises yield a counterexample (Tom, ETS).
  sorry

-- We can explicitly show the conclusion is false given the premises:
theorem not_goal :
  ¬ (∀ p : Person, TakingGRE p → ∀ s : Provider, ¬ FinancialAidBy s p) := by
  intro h
  have hTom : ¬ FinancialAidBy ETS Tom := h Tom Tom_applying ETS
