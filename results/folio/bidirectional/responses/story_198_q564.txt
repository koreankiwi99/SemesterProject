-- When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox.
-- We formalize "may" as an implication (a stronger reading).
axiom A1 : ∀ b : Being, MonkeypoxVirusOccurs b → GetsMonkeypox b

-- Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals (existence of at least one such animal).
axiom A2 : ∃ b : Being, Animal b ∧ MonkeypoxVirusOccurs b

-- Humans are mammals.
axiom A3 : ∀ b : Being, Human b → Mammal b

-- Mammals are animals.
axiom A4 : ∀ b : Being, Mammal b → Animal b

-- Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.
