axiom Zelda : Game

-- Premises
-- 1. A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.
axiom premise1 : ∃ c : Company, Japanese c ∧ Created c Zelda
-- 2. All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
axiom premise2 : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → ∃ c : Company, Japanese c ∧ Created c g
-- 3. If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
axiom premise3 : ∀ g : Game, SoldOver1M g → Top10 g
-- 4. The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.
axiom premise4 : SoldOver1M Zelda

-- From premises 3 and 4, the positive conclusion follows:
theorem positive_conclusion : Top10 Zelda := by
  apply premise3
  exact premise4

-- NEGATION of the conclusion to analyze: Zelda is NOT on the Top 10 list.
-- Attempt to prove the negation from the premises (this should fail).
theorem negated_conclusion : ¬ Top10 Zelda := by
  intro hz
  -- We already derived Top10 Zelda from the premises:
  have hz' : Top10 Zelda := positive_conclusion
  -- No contradiction can be derived; the premises entail Top10 Zelda.
  -- Hence, this proof cannot be completed.
