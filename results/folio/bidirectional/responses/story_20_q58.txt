-- Conclusion to analyze: FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese video game company.
theorem goal : ∃ c : Company, JapaneseCompany c ∧ MadeBy FIFA22 c := by
  -- From the premises, we can derive that Zelda is on the Top 10 list and thus is made by a Japanese company.
  -- However, there is no information linking FIFA 22 to the Top 10 list, sales, or any company.
  -- Therefore, this conclusion does not follow from the given premises.

-- Premises:
-- 1. A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.
axiom premise1 : ∃ c : Company, Japanese c ∧ Created c Zelda

-- 2. All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
--    Interpreted as: any company that created a Top 10 game is Japanese.

-- Negation of the conclusion to analyze:
-- The conclusion claims: "FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese video game company."
-- Formalized as: ∃ c, Japanese c ∧ Created c FIFA22
-- We must prove its negation: ¬∃ c, Japanese c ∧ Created c FIFA22
theorem neg_conclusion : ¬ (∃ c : Company, Japanese c ∧ Created c FIFA22) := by
  -- Attempt to derive a contradiction from assuming FIFA22 has a Japanese creator.
  intro h
  -- From the given premises, we can deduce facts about Zelda being associated with Japanese companies,
  -- but there is no information relating FIFA22 to sales, Top10, or creators.
  -- Therefore, no contradiction can be derived from h with the provided premises.
