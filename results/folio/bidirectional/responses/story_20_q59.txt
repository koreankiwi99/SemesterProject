-- Premises
-- 1. A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.
axiom premise1 : ∃ c : Company, JapaneseCompany c ∧ Created c LegendOfZelda
-- 2. All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
axiom premise2 : ∀ g : Game, OnTop10 g → ∀ c : Company, Created c g → JapaneseCompany c
-- 3. If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
axiom premise3 : ∀ g : Game, SoldMoreThan1M g → OnTop10 g
-- 4. The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.
axiom premise4 : SoldMoreThan1M LegendOfZelda

-- From premises 3 and 4, we can derive that the Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.

-- Conclusion to analyze: The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list.
-- This does not follow from the premises (indeed, it contradicts them).
