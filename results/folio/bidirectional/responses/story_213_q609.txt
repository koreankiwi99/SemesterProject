-- A useful derived fact: French and Spanish (both in the Romance family) are related.

-- Conclusion to analyze: German is a Romance language.
theorem german_is_romance : Romance German := by
  -- Attempt: From germanRelatedSpanish and that Spanish is Romance, try to deduce Romance German.
  -- However, the premises only give: if two languages are in the same family, they are related.
  -- They do NOT give the converse: being related to a member implies being in the same family.
  -- Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the given premises.
