-- 1) All Romance languages are Indo-European languages.

-- We are asked to prove the NEGATION of the conclusion:
-- "French is an Indo-European language" negated is "French is not an Indo-European language".
-- This is not derivable from the premises (indeed, the opposite holds, as shown above).
-- We provide an attempted proof that cannot be completed.
theorem neg_conclusion : ¬ IndoEuropean French := by
  intro hIE
  -- From the premises, we can derive that French is Indo-European:
  have h' : IndoEuropean French := french_is_IE
  -- At this point, we have both hIE : IndoEuropean French (from assumption)
  -- and h' : IndoEuropean French (from premises). This does not yield a contradiction,
  -- so the negation cannot be proven from the given premises.
