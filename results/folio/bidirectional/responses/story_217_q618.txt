Premises: If George likes music, he wants to compose.
If George has access to a program, he can compose.
If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.
Conclusion: If George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose.

axiom CanCompose : Prop
axiom WillCompose : Prop

-- Premises
axiom p1 : LikesMusic → WantsCompose
axiom p2 : HasAccessProgram → CanCompose
axiom p3 : (CanCompose ∧ WantsCompose) → WillCompose

-- Conclusion: If George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose.
theorem goal : (LikesMusic ∧ HasAccessProgram) → WillCompose := by

-- We are asked to prove the NEGATION of the conclusion.
-- This is not derivable from the given premises (indeed, the conclusion is true),
-- so the proof attempt necessarily fails.

  -- Attempting to derive a contradiction from h is impossible given the premises,
