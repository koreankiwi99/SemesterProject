Lean Code:
-- We model the scenario propositionally (no need for individuals beyond George).
axiom LikesMusic : Prop        -- George likes music
axiom WantsCompose : Prop      -- George wants to compose
axiom HasAccessProgram : Prop  -- George has access to a program
axiom CanCompose : Prop        -- George can compose
axiom WillCompose : Prop       -- George will compose

axiom premise2 : HasAccessProgram → CanCompose
axiom premise3 : (CanCompose ∧ WantsCompose) → WillCompose

-- From premise3, we can derive a weaker consequence:
-- If George will not compose, then it is not the case that he both can compose and wants to compose.
-- In classical logic, this yields: ¬WillCompose → (¬CanCompose ∨ ¬WantsCompose).

-- Conclusion to analyze: If George will not compose, George cannot compose.
-- Attempted proof: This does not follow from the premises, because from premise3 we only get
-- ¬WillCompose → (¬CanCompose ∨ ¬WantsCompose), and without an assumption that WantsCompose holds,
-- we cannot derive ¬CanCompose alone.
