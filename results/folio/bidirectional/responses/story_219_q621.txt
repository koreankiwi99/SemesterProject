  -- From the given premises, this does not follow:
  -- We can derive that Beethoven is a conductor (from p5, p6, p7),
  -- and that Beethoven wrote a music piece (p3 with p1),
  -- but there is no premise that says "whoever writes a music piece is a composer"
  -- nor any link from conductors to composers.
