  /-
  Attempt: We have that Yale's endowment is valued at USD_42_3_Billion,
  but we have no comparative information about other universities' endowments
  or any axiom connecting a specific money value to “being the largest”.
  Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises provided,
  and no proof can be constructed in this formalization.
