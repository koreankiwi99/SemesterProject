Lean Code:
universe u
axiom Thing : Type u
axiom Cat : Thing → Prop
axiom Mammal : Thing → Prop
axiom Pet : Thing → Prop

-- Premises
axiom allCatsAreMammals : ∀ x : Thing, Cat x → Mammal x
axiom somePetsNotMammals : ∃ x : Thing, Pet x ∧ ¬ Mammal x

-- A consequence that does follow from the premises:
-- From "all cats are mammals" and "some pet is not a mammal",
-- we can conclude that some pet is not a cat.
theorem somePetNotCat : ∃ x : Thing, Pet x ∧ ¬ Cat x := by
  rcases somePetsNotMammals with ⟨x, hxPet, hxNotMammal⟩
  have hxNotCat : ¬ Cat x := by
    intro hxCat
    have hxMammal : Mammal x := allCatsAreMammals x hxCat
    exact hxNotMammal hxMammal
  exact ⟨x, hxPet, hxNotCat⟩

-- Conclusion to analyze: "No pets are cats"
-- This would mean: ∀ x, Pet x → ¬ Cat x
-- Attempted proof (not derivable from the given premises)
theorem noPetsAreCats : ∀ x : Thing, Pet x → ¬ Cat x := by
  intro x hxPet hxCat
  -- From hxCat and the first premise we can infer that x is a mammal.
  have hxMammal : Mammal x := allCatsAreMammals x hxCat
  -- But the premises only assert that some pet is not a mammal,
  -- not necessarily this x, so we cannot derive a contradiction.
  -- Hence the goal does not follow from the given premises.

Lean Code:
axiom Animal : Type
axiom Pet : Animal → Prop
axiom Cat : Animal → Prop
axiom Mammal : Animal → Prop

-- Premises
axiom premise1 : ∀ x : Animal, Cat x → Mammal x           -- All cats are mammals
axiom premise2 : ∃ x : Animal, Pet x ∧ ¬ Mammal x          -- Some pets are not mammals

-- A consequence we CAN derive from the premises: there exists a pet that is not a cat.
theorem exists_pet_not_cat : ∃ x : Animal, Pet x ∧ ¬ Cat x := by

-- Conclusion to analyze: "No pets are cats"
-- One formalization: ∀ x, Pet x → ¬ Cat x
-- Negation to prove (i.e., show the conclusion is false): ∃ x, Pet x ∧ Cat x
theorem negation_of_conclusion : ∃ x : Animal, Pet x ∧ Cat x := by
  -- Attempt: from premise2 we get a pet that is not a mammal.
  -- From premise1, all cats are mammals, so that particular pet is not a cat.
  -- This does NOT provide a pet that is a cat, and the premises give no further information.
  -- Hence the negation cannot be derived from the given premises.
