Lean Code:
universe u

axiom Human  : Being → Prop
axiom Mortal : Being → Prop
axiom Greek  : Being → Prop

-- Premises
axiom all_humans_mortal : ∀ x : Being, Human x → Mortal x
axiom all_greeks_human  : ∀ x : Being, Greek x → Human x

-- Conclusion to analyze: Some Greeks are mortal.
-- This is not derivable from the given premises alone in first-order logic
-- (it requires an existence premise like ∃ x, Greek x).

-- However, the following conditional is provable:
theorem some_greeks_mortal_if_exists :
  (∃ x : Being, Greek x) → ∃ x : Being, Greek x ∧ Mortal x := by
