Lean Code:
-- We model entities and relevant predicates
axiom Entity : Type
axiom Human : Entity → Prop
axiom Horse : Entity → Prop
axiom HasHooves : Entity → Prop

-- Premises:
-- 1) All horses have hooves.
axiom allHorsesHaveHooves : ∀ x : Entity, Horse x → HasHooves x
-- 2) No humans have hooves.
axiom noHumansHaveHooves : ∀ x : Entity, Human x → ¬ HasHooves x

-- A derived consequence of the premises: No human is a horse.
theorem noHumanIsHorse : ∀ x : Entity, Human x → ¬ Horse x := by
  intro x hxHuman
  intro hxHorse
  have hxHooves : HasHooves x := allHorsesHaveHooves x hxHorse
  have hxNoHooves : ¬ HasHooves x := noHumansHaveHooves x hxHuman
  exact hxNoHooves hxHooves

-- Even stronger: There does not exist an entity that is both a human and a horse.
theorem noHumanHorseExists : ¬ ∃ x : Entity, Human x ∧ Horse x := by
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨x, hxHuman, hxHorse⟩
  have : ¬ Horse x := noHumanIsHorse x hxHuman
  exact this hxHorse

-- Conclusion to analyze (claimed): Some humans are horses.
-- This states the existence of an x that is both Human and Horse.
-- From the premises we actually derived the negation of this statement above.
-- Therefore this conclusion does not follow from the premises, and is in fact
-- inconsistent with them. Proof attempt (expected to fail):
theorem someHumansAreHorses : ∃ x : Entity, Human x ∧ Horse x := by
  -- From the premises, we have proved `noHumanHorseExists`,
  -- i.e., `¬ ∃ x, Human x ∧ Horse x`, which contradicts the goal.
  -- Hence this goal is not derivable from the given premises.
