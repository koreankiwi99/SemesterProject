Premises: A hawk never swims. 
Some birds are hawks.
Conclusion: All birds swim.

-- Premises
axiom hawk_never_swims : ∀ b : Bird, Hawk b → ¬ Swims b
axiom some_birds_are_hawks : ∃ b : Bird, Hawk b

-- Conclusion to analyze (attempted)
theorem goal : ∀ b : Bird, Swims b := by
  -- This is not provable from the given premises.
  -- In fact, we can derive its negation below.

-- What actually follows from the premises:
-- Not all birds swim.
