Lean Code:
universe u

-- Domain and predicates
axiom U : Type u
axiom Affection : U → Prop
axiom Love : U → Prop
axiom Positive : U → Prop

-- Premises
axiom premise1 : ∃ x : U, Affection x ∧ Love x
axiom premise2 : ∃ x : U, Love x ∧ Positive x

-- Conclusion to analyze
theorem conclusion : ∃ x : U, Affection x ∧ Positive x := by
  -- This does not follow from the premises in general (see countermodel below).
  sorry

-- A concrete countermodel showing the argument is invalid in first-order logic:
inductive Two
| a
| b

open Two

def Aff : Two → Prop
| a => True
| b => False

def Lov : Two → Prop := fun _ => True

def Pos : Two → Prop
| a => False
| b => True

-- In this model, the premises hold:
theorem counter_premise1 : ∃ x : Two, Aff x ∧ Lov x := by
  refine ⟨a, ?_⟩
  exact And.intro True.intro True.intro

theorem counter_premise2 : ∃ x : Two, Lov x ∧ Pos x := by
  refine ⟨b, ?_⟩

-- but the conclusion fails:

-- 1) Some affection is love: ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Love x

  -- From the given premises alone, this does not follow.
  -- Attempting to derive a contradiction does not succeed.
