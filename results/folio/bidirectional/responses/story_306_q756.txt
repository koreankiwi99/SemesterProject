  -- Attempt: using the above, we know HamdenPlaza does not have many negative reviews.
  -- However, the premises give only an existential link from "no take-out" to "many negatives" for some restaurant,
  -- which is insufficient to deduce that HamdenPlaza provides take-out.
  -- Hence, a proof of ProvidesTakeOut HamdenPlaza is not derivable from the given premises.
