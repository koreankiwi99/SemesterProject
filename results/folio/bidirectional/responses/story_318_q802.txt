theorem conclusion : AirsAt8pmMonday BreakingBad := by
  -- From the premises we can derive the existence of some show airing at 8 pm Monday
  -- that gives out roses, and that such a show is an episode of The Bachelor.
  -- We can also derive that The Bachelor is reality TV.
  -- However, there is no given connection between Breaking Bad and the show that gives out roses
  -- or any link implying Breaking Bad airs at 8 pm Monday.
  -- Thus the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
