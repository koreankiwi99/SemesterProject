-- Premises:
-- 1. All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
axiom premise1 : ∀ x : Entity, Growth x → BoughtForRapidProfit x

-- 2. If a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom premise2 : ∀ x : Entity, BoughtForRapidProfit x → ¬SuitableForRetirement x

-- 3. Some stocks are growth stocks.
axiom premise3 : ∃ x : Entity, Stock x ∧ Growth x

-- 4. All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom premise4 : ∀ x : Entity, Mature x → SuitableForRetirement x

-- 5. KO is a mature stock. (We formalize this as both Mature KO and Stock KO.)
axiom premise5a : Mature KO
axiom premise5b : Stock KO

-- Negation of the conclusion to analyze: we try to show KO is not a stock.

  -- From maturity and (4), KO is suitable for retirement.
  have hSuit : SuitableForRetirement KO := premise4 KO premise5a
  -- From (1) and (2), growth implies not suitable.

    have hNotSuit : ¬SuitableForRetirement KO := hNotSuitIfGrowth KO hGrowKO
    exact hNotSuit hSuit
  -- At this point we have no way to derive a contradiction from hStockKO.
  -- The premises are consistent with KO being a stock that is mature (hence suitable)
  -- and not a growth stock. We cannot conclude False from hStockKO.
