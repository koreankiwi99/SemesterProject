Premises: All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.

If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. 
Conclusion: John does not have a larger family.

-- 1. All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, MakeWeddingPlans x → Engaged x
-- 2. All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, InviteOthersToCeremony x → MakeWeddingPlans x

axiom A4 : ∃ x : Person, WellAttendedWedding x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- 5. If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
-- Here we formalize this as: Engaged John → (¬ InviteFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakeWeddingPlans John)
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬ InviteFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakeWeddingPlans John)
-- 6. If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
