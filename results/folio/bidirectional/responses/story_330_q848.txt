Premises: All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. 
Conclusion: John is engaged.

axiom Engaged : Person → Prop
axiom MakePlans : Person → Prop
axiom InviteOthers : Person → Prop

axiom WellAttended : Person → Prop
axiom LargerFamily : Person → Prop

-- Premises
axiom p1 : ∀ x : Person, MakePlans x → Engaged x
axiom p2 : ∀ x : Person, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
axiom p3 : ∀ x : Person, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
axiom p4 : ∃ x : Person, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- Interpreting: If John is engaged, then not (InviteFriends John ∧ MakePlans John)
axiom p5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InviteFriends John ∧ MakePlans John)
axiom p6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- Useful derived lemma: Well-attended implies engaged (for any person)
lemma wellAttended_implies_engaged : ∀ x : Person, WellAttended x → Engaged x := by
  intro x hx
  have h1 : InviteOthers x := p3 x hx
  have h2 : MakePlans x := p2 x h1
  exact p1 x h2

-- From the existential premise, there exists someone engaged (not necessarily John)
lemma exists_engaged : ∃ x : Person, Engaged x := by
  rcases p4 with ⟨x, hxW, _⟩
  exact ⟨x, wellAttended_implies_engaged x hxW⟩

-- Goal: John is engaged (does not follow from the given premises)
theorem conclusion : Engaged John := by
  -- We can show: WellAttended John → Engaged John
  have hw_to_eng : WellAttended John → Engaged John := by
    intro hw
    exact wellAttended_implies_engaged John hw
  -- However, we have no premise that gives WellAttended John or LargerFamily John,
  -- and p5 only constrains John if he is engaged; it does not help derive engagement.
  -- The existential p4 does not specify John. Hence the conclusion cannot be derived.

  -- However, the premises do not provide a way to derive MakesPlans John or InvitesFriends John from Engaged John,
  -- nor do they give LargeFamily John for John to use premise6, and the existential in premise4 is not specific to John.
  -- Therefore, no contradiction can be derived from the given premises.
