Premises: All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.
Conclusion: A design by Max is a brutalist building.

-- We model entities (designs/styles) as items
axiom Item : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Adored : Item → Prop              -- Max adores the item
axiom ZahaStyle : Item → Prop           -- Item is a Zaha Hadid design style
axiom KellyStyle : Item → Prop          -- Item is a Kelly Wearstler design style
axiom Interesting : Item → Prop         -- Item has interesting geometries
axiom Brutalist : Item → Prop           -- Item is a brutalist building
axiom Evocative : Item → Prop           -- Item is evocative
axiom Dreamy : Item → Prop              -- Item is dreamy

-- Premises
-- 1. All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom p1 : ∀ x : Item, ZahaStyle x ∧ Adored x → Interesting x

-- 2. No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom p2 : ∀ x : Item, Brutalist x ∧ Adored x → ¬ Interesting x

-- 3. Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's or Kelly Wearstler's.
axiom p3 : ∀ x : Item, Adored x → ZahaStyle x ∨ KellyStyle x

-- 4. All Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
axiom p4 : ∀ x : Item, KellyStyle x ∧ Adored x → Evocative x

-- 5. All Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
axiom p5 : ∀ x : Item, KellyStyle x ∧ Adored x → Dreamy x

-- 6. If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries,
--    then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.
axiom p6 : ∀ x : Item, DesignedByMax x ∧ Adored x ∧ Interesting x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- Conclusion to analyze: A design by Max is a brutalist building.
-- We formalize this as: there exists an item that is designed by Max and is brutalist.
theorem conclusion : ∃ x : Item, DesignedByMax x ∧ Brutalist x := by
  -- From the given premises, there is no existence assumption that Max adores any item,
  -- nor that any item is designed by Max. Hence we cannot derive existence of such an item.
  -- Proof not derivable from the premises.
