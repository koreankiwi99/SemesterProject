Premises: All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.
Conclusion: A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy.

-- Conclusion to analyze (formalized): Every design by Max is evocative or dreamy.
-- We aim to prove the NEGATION of the conclusion.
theorem neg_conclusion : ¬ (∀ d : Design, ByMax d → Evocative d ∨ Dreamy d) := by
  -- Proof attempt:
  -- From the given premises, we only have constraints about designs/styles that Max adores,
  -- and a conditional about designs by Max that he adores with interesting geometries.
  -- There is no premise guaranteeing the existence of any design by Max that is neither evocative nor dreamy,
  -- nor any premise that conflicts with the universal claim about all designs by Max.
  -- Hence, the negation does not follow from the premises.
