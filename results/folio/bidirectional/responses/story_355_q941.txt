Premises: All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.
All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.
All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.
Conclusion: Taylor eats salads regularly.
