Premises: If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly
Conclusion: Peter is notably tidy.

-- Goal: prove the negation of the conclusion "Peter is notably tidy"
theorem goal : ¬ Tidy Peter := by
  -- Attempt:
  -- From the disjunction about Peter and the premises, we can derive ¬Cleanly Peter and ¬Spills Peter.
  -- However, there is no premise allowing us to conclude ¬Tidy Peter from ¬Cleanly Peter or ¬Spills Peter alone,
  -- and the available implications only give Spills → ¬Tidy and Cleanly → Tidy (no converses).
  -- Hence, the negation of the conclusion does not follow from the given premises.
