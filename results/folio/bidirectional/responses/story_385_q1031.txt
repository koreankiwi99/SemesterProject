Premises: If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. 
Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.
Conclusion: Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis.
