Premises: If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.
Conclusion: Colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above.

We model diseases and properties as predicates over a domain `Entity`.

Premises:
1. If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate.
2. Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
3. Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. (i.e., all bile duct cancers are severe cancers)
4. All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
5. Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
6. Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.

axiom A1 : ∀ x : Entity, DeadlyDisease x → LowSurvival x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Entity, SevereCancer x → DeadlyDisease x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Entity, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Entity, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Entity, MildFlu x → LowSurvival x
axiom A6 : ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvival ColorectalCancer)

Useful derived lemma: any bile duct cancer has a low survival rate (by chaining A3, A2, A1).
-/
lemma bileDuct_implies_low : ∀ x : Entity, BileDuctCancer x → LowSurvival x := by
  intro x hbdc
  have hsev : SevereCancer x := A3 x hbdc
  have hdeadly : DeadlyDisease x := A2 x hsev
  exact A1 x hdeadly

/-
From A4 and the lemma above, if ColorectalCancer were Cholangiocarcinoma,
then it would be both a bile duct cancer and have a low survival rate,
contradicting A6. Hence ¬ Cholangiocarcinoma ColorectalCancer.
-/
theorem not_cholangio_on_colorectal : ¬ Cholangiocarcinoma ColorectalCancer := by
  intro h
  have hbdc : BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer := A4 ColorectalCancer h
  have hlow : LowSurvival ColorectalCancer := bileDuct_implies_low ColorectalCancer hbdc
  exact A6 ⟨hbdc, hlow⟩

/-
Conclusion to analyze (as requested):
"Colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above."
We formalize it as:
Cholangiocarcinoma ColorectalCancer ∧ (MildFlu ColorectalCancer ∨ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer)

However, from the lemma above we have ¬ Cholangiocarcinoma ColorectalCancer, so the conclusion is incompatible with the premises and not derivable.
We include a proof attempt placeholder.
