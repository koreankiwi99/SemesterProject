-- Conclusion to analyze: "James has lunch in the company."
-- We aim to prove the NEGATION: ¬ HasLunchInCompanyBuilding James
theorem not_lunch_in_company : ¬ HasLunchInCompanyBuilding James := by
  -- Attempt: From lunch-in-company we get schedules (premise2).
  -- To derive a contradiction using other premises, we'd need links that are not provided:
  -- - No premise links lunch-in-company to appearing-today.
  -- - Premises that yield "remote" require lunch-at-home or being in other countries.
  -- - Manager/appearance facts do not contradict lunch-in-company.
  -- Therefore, the negation does not follow from the given premises.
