-- Premises
-- 1. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.

-- 7. James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
-- We model "appear in the company today" with the same predicate as "go to the company building today": AtCompanyToday.
axiom prem7 : AtCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Conclusion: James does not have lunch in the company.
theorem conclusion : ¬ HasLunchInCompanyBuilding James := by
  intro hLunch
  have hSched : SchedulesMeetingsWithCustomers James := prem2 James hLunch
  -- From here, without an assumption that James is an employee or an additional link that
  -- yields a contradiction, the given premises do not suffice to derive False.
  -- In particular, prem1 needs Employee James, which is not provided.
  -- Moreover, even with Employee James, no contradiction arises from hLunch.
