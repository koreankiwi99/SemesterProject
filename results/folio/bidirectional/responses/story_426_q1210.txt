Premises: All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. 
Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. 
Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. 
No managers work remotely from home. 
James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.
Conclusion: If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home. If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries. [contrapositive is more natural]

-- Conclusion to analyze (combined as a conjunction of the two given implications):
-- If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home.
-- If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries.

  apply And.intro
  · -- First implication
    intro h
    -- From Manager James we can derive ¬ RemoteFromHome James by premise6.
    -- But we cannot derive ¬ LunchAtHome James without additional assumptions linking LunchAtHome to RemoteFromHome for James.
    -- From InOtherCountries James (even assuming James is an employee), premise5 would give RemoteFromHome James, contradicting the desired negation.
    -- Hence this part is not derivable from the given premises.
    sorry
  · -- Second implication
    intro h
    -- From RemoteFromHome James we can conclude ¬ Manager James using premise6 (contraposition-free).
    -- However, from (LunchAtHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James) we cannot derive ¬ InOtherCountries James from the given premises:
    -- premise5 only gives InOtherCountries → RemoteFromHome (for employees), not its converse.
    -- Thus ¬ InOtherCountries James does not follow.
