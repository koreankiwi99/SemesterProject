Example ID: 1303
Premises: All aliens are extraterrestrials.
If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.
No extraterrestrials are human.
All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.
Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.
Conclusion: If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human.

  -- Therefore, this conclusion does not follow from the premises.
