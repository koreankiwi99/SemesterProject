Premises: Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.
Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs.
Heck cattle are animals.
Aurochs are animals.
Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals.
Conclusion: Some Heck cattle are artificially selected.

-- Premises formalized
-- 1. Breeding back is a form of artificial selection.
axiom premise1 : ∀ x : Entity, BredBack x → ArtificiallySelected x

-- 2. Heck cattle were bred back (we formalize this as: all Heck cattle were bred back).

-- 3. Heck cattle are animals.
axiom premise3 : ∀ x : Entity, HeckCattle x → Animal x

-- 4. Aurochs are animals.

-- Negation of the conclusion to analyze:
-- Conclusion: Some Heck cattle are artificially selected.
-- Negation: No Heck cattle are artificially selected.

  -- From the premises, we can derive that any Heck cattle are artificially selected if they exist.
  -- However, there is no contradiction derivable here to conclude False.
  -- Therefore, the negation cannot be proven from the given premises.
