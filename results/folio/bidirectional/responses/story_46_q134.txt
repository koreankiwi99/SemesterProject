Premises: Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.
Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs.
Heck cattle are animals.
Aurochs are animals.
Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals.
Conclusion: Aurochs are extinct.

-- Conclusion to analyze: Aurochs are extinct.
theorem aurochs_are_extinct : Extinct Aurochs := by
  -- From the premises we have:
  -- - HeckCattle were bred back and resemble Aurochs.
  -- - There exists some bred-back animal that resembles some extinct animal.
  -- However, nothing in the premises equates the extinct animal in the existential statement
  -- with Aurochs, nor provides a principle that targets of all bred-back resemblance are extinct.
  -- Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the given premises.
