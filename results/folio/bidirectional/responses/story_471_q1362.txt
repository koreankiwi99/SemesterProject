Example ID: 1362
Premises: All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. 
Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. 
The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
Conclusion: Rockie is not a turtle.

-- Conclusion (cannot be derived from the given premises)
theorem goal : ¬ Turtle Rockie := by
  -- From the given premises, we can deduce that Rockie is not a squirrel and hence (by A3) is a rabbit.
  -- However, there is no premise asserting that rabbits and turtles are disjoint.
  -- Therefore, the conclusion ¬ Turtle Rockie does not follow from the premises.
