-- Premises:
-- 1. Books contain tons of knowledge.
axiom premise1 : ∀ b : Book, ContainsKnowledge b
-- 2. When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.
axiom premise2 : ∀ p : Person, ∀ b : Book, Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p
-- 3. If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.
axiom premise3 : ∀ p : Person, GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p
-- 4. Harry read the book “Walden”.
axiom premise4 : Reads Harry Walden

-- Some consequences of the premises:
lemma harry_gains : GainsKnowledge Harry := by
  apply premise2
  exact premise4

lemma harry_smarter : Smarter Harry := by
  apply premise3
  exact harry_gains

-- Conclusion to analyze (formalized universally):
-- "A smarter person has gained knowledge" ≡ ∀ p, Smarter p → GainsKnowledge p
-- We aim to prove its NEGATION.
theorem neg_conclusion : ¬(∀ p : Person, Smarter p → GainsKnowledge p) := by
  intro h
  -- From h we can derive that Harry, being smarter, has gained knowledge,
  -- which is consistent with the premises and yields no contradiction.
  have : GainsKnowledge Harry := h Harry harry_smarter
  -- No contradiction can be derived from the premises; proof attempt fails.
