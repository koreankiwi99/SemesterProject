  intro h
  -- Attempt to derive a contradiction from the premises.
  -- Note: From the given premises, we have Novel FamilyHistory and WrittenBy FamilyHistory DaniShapiro,
  -- but we do NOT have Book FamilyHistory. Thus we cannot apply the key premise
  -- (book_novel_writtenby_implies_novelwriter) to derive NovelWriter DaniShapiro,
  -- and we also have no premises implying ¬NovelWriter DaniShapiro.
  -- Therefore, no contradiction can be derived.
