theorem conclusion : BornIn DaniShapiro Boston := by
  -- From the given premises, we can infer things like:
  -- - Dani Shapiro is American and a writer.

  have _ : Writer DaniShapiro := dani_writer
  -- - Dani Shapiro is a novel writer (from Family History being a novel written by Dani).

  -- - Family Secrets is a podcast, thus not a novel (but this is irrelevant to birthplace).
  have _ : ¬ Novel FamilySecrets := podcast_not_novel FamilySecrets fs_is_podcast
  -- However, none of the premises provide any information that implies Dani Shapiro was born in Boston.
  -- The only birth-related rule is one-way: BornIn p c ∧ AmericanCity c → American p.
  -- We cannot invert it to conclude BornIn from American.
