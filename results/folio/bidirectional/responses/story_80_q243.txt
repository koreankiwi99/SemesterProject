-- Premises:
-- 1) All of New Vessel Press's published books are in English.
axiom premise_all_english : ∀ b : Book, NewVesselPressPublishes b → InEnglish b
-- 2) Neapolitan Chronicles is a book published by New Vessel Press.

-- From the premises, the conclusion "Neapolitan Chronicles is an English book" is derivable:
theorem derived_conclusion : InEnglish NeapolitanChronicles := by
  apply premise_all_english
  exact premise_nc_published

-- Goal: Prove the NEGATION of the conclusion, i.e., show that
-- Neapolitan Chronicles is NOT an English book.
-- This is not derivable from the premises (indeed, the opposite is derivable, see derived_conclusion).
theorem neg_conclusion : ¬ InEnglish NeapolitanChronicles := by
  -- Attempting to prove a contradiction from the premises fails because
  -- we can already derive InEnglish NeapolitanChronicles.
  -- Hence this proof cannot be completed.
