Story ID: 83
Example ID: 254
Premises: All vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34.
Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul. 
Joe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul. 
Tom's license plate begins with the number 35. 
If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34.
Conclusion: Tom's license plate is from Istanbul.
