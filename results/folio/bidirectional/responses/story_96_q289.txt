-- The original conclusion would be:
-- ∃ s : Stable, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s

-- We can actually prove the original conclusion from the premises:
theorem conclusion_true : ∃ s : Stable, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := by
  exact ⟨DiamondMine, And.intro premise1 premise2⟩

-- NEGATION of the conclusion:
-- ¬ ∃ s : Stable, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s
-- This negation is not derivable from the premises; in fact, it leads to a contradiction:
theorem negation_implies_false :
  (¬ ∃ s : Stable, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s) → False := by
  intro hneg
  exact hneg conclusion_true

-- Equivalently, the negation of the negation holds:
theorem not_not_conclusion : ¬ (¬ ∃ s : Stable, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s) := by
  intro hneg
  exact hneg conclusion_true

-- The requested negation theorem cannot be proven from these premises.
-- We include it here to show the target statement, but we do not have a proof.
-- theorem goal_neg : ¬ ∃ s : Stable, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := by
--   -- impossible given the premises
