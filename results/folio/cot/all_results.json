The first disjunct contradicts the derived rule (multiple birth \u2192 not live with strangers), so it cannot hold. Therefore, the second disjunct must be true: Luke is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\n- Q1: Spending time with siblings follows from being in a multiple birth, but Luke is not in a multiple birth; we have no rule that not multiple birth implies not spending time.

Since BileDuct(CRC) would force Low(CRC), this yields Not BileDuct(CRC).\n- Also, since Cholangiocarcinoma -> BileDuct, we get Not Cholangio(CRC).\n- Nothing links colorectal cancer directly to being severe or to mild flu.\n\nQuestion 1:\n- We have no information that colorectal cancer is severe; Not BileDuct(CRC) does not preclude or entail severity. So this cannot be determined.\n- Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- Antecedent: BileDuct(CRC) or Cholangio(CRC). We established both are false in all models of the premises, so the antecedent is always false.\n- A conditional with a false antecedent is vacuously true.\n- Answer: True.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- The statement effectively requires CRC to be Cholangiocarcinoma (and also mild flu or bile duct cancer, or all). But Not Cholangio(CRC) and Not BileDuct(CRC) hold, so the statement is contradicted.\n- Answer: False.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: True\n3: False",

No managers are remote (M -> \u00acR). Hence M -> \u00acLh.\n- Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home (exactly one). With M -> \u00acLh and exclusivity, M -> Lcb. Thus Lcb \u2194 M for any employee, including James.\n- If not M, then not G (by G \u2194 M), so not Lcb (since Lcb -> G); by lunch exclusivity, then Lh, and thus R.\n\nQuestion 1:\n- James has lunch in the company iff he is a manager. We do not know whether James is a manager.\n- Conclusion: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- This is the negation of Question 1.

In particular, we cannot conclude Harry is a vertebrate animal.\n- We are not told that bees are animals, so we cannot conclude Harry is an animal, and thus cannot conclude he is an invertebrate from the animal partition.\n\nQuestion 1:\n- We know QueenBee \u21d2 Bee and Bee(Harry), but not Bee \u21d2 QueenBee. So we cannot conclude Harry is a queen bee; nor is it ruled out.\nAnswer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- Disjunction: \u201cHarry is an invertebrate or a queen bee.\u201d\n- We cannot conclude he is a queen bee (from Q1).\n- We also cannot conclude he is an invertebrate because we are not given that bees are animals; we only know he is not an animal-with-a-backbone and not a vertebrate animal. Without knowing he is an animal, the animal partition does not force \u201cinvertebrate.\u201d\nAnswer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- Statement: If [Harry is (vertebrate and an animal with a backbone) or (neither vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone)], then [Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee].\n- We know Harry is not an animal-with-a-backbone, so the antecedent reduces to: (not vertebrate) and (not animal-with-a-backbone). This might or might not hold, since we do not know whether Harry is (plain) vertebrate (we only ruled out \u201cvertebrate animal\u201d).\n- Even if the antecedent holds, nothing given implies Harry is not a queen bee; that remains possible. Thus the implication is not entailed by the premises. There are models consistent with the premises where the antecedent holds and Harry is a queen bee, making the consequent false. There are also models where the antecedent fails, making the implication vacuously true. Hence the truth of the conditional is not determined.\nAnswer: Unknown.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: Unknown\n3: Unknown",

    "model_response": "Reasoning:\n- From premises: US citizenship -> can register (R); can register -> can participate (P). Also, RF official -> not Taiwanese citizenship. Everyone has US or Taiwanese citizenship.\n- Vladimir: Given not Taiwanese citizenship and \"US or Taiwanese,\" he must have US citizenship. Therefore R(Vladimir) and P(Vladimir). His RF official status is not determined; we only know RF official would imply not Taiwanese, which he already lacks.\n- Ekaterina: Given R(Ekaterina) or RF official. If RF official, then not Taiwanese -> US citizenship -> R(Ekaterina). Hence in all cases R(Ekaterina) holds, so P(Ekaterina) holds.\n\nQuestion 1: Vladimir is a Russian federation official.\n- Not determined by the premises. Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2: Vladimir is not a Russian federation official.\n- Also not determined. Unknown.\n\nQuestion 3: Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 US presidential election or is a manager at Gazprom.\n- P(Ekaterina) is true; disjunction is true. True.\n\nQuestion 4: Ekaterina can participate in the 2024 US presidential election or Vladimir is a manager at Gazprom.\n- P(Ekaterina) is true; disjunction is true (also we know Vladimir is not a Gazprom manager, but not needed). True.\n\nQuestion 5: It is not true that Ekaterina can register to vote in the US and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 US presidential election.\n- R(Ekaterina) is true and P(Vladimir) is true, so the conjunction is true; its negation is false.
