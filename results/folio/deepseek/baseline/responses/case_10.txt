The context states there are six types of wild turkeys: Eastern, Osceola, Gould's, Merriam's, Rio Grande, and Ocellated. Tom is explicitly excluded from being Eastern, Osceola, Gould's, Merriam's, or Rio Grande. Since Tom is confirmed to be a wild turkey, he must be the only remaining type: Ocellated. Therefore, the statement "Tom is an Eastern wild turkey" is false.

<lean>
inductive TurkeyKind : Type
  | Eastern
  | Osceola
  | Goulds
  | Merriam
  | RioGrande
  | Ocellated

axiom TomKind : TurkeyKind

axiom notEastern : TomKind ≠ TurkeyKind.Eastern
axiom notOsceola : TomKind ≠ TurkeyKind.Osceola
axiom notGoulds : TomKind ≠ TurkeyKind.Goulds
axiom notMerriam : TomKind ≠ TurkeyKind.Merriam
axiom notRioGrande : TomKind ≠ TurkeyKind.RioGrande

theorem tom_not_eastern : TomKind ≠ TurkeyKind.Eastern := by 
  exact notEastern
</lean>

ANSWER: False
