The reasoning shows that Luke cannot complain about annoying siblings without leading to a contradiction in both possible cases of his birth and living situation. The formal proof in Lean demonstrates this by deriving a contradiction from the assumption that Luke complains, using the given axioms and logical deduction.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom MultipleBirth : obj → Prop
axiom HasSiblingBornTogether : obj → Prop
axiom ComplainAnnoyingSiblings : obj → Prop
axiom SpendTimeWithSiblings : obj → Prop
axiom LiveAtHome : obj → Prop
axiom LiveWithStrangers : obj → Prop
axiom Luke : obj

axiom A1 : ∀ x, MultipleBirth x → SpendTimeWithSiblings x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, HasSiblingBornTogether x → MultipleBirth x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, ComplainAnnoyingSiblings x → HasSiblingBornTogether x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, LiveAtHome x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, SpendTimeWithSiblings x → LiveAtHome x
axiom Luke_case : (MultipleBirth Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) ∨ (¬ MultipleBirth Luke ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke)

theorem not_complain : ¬ ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke := by
  intro h
  have h1 := A3 Luke h
  have h2 := A2 Luke h1
  have h3 := A1 Luke h2
  have h4 := A5 Luke h3
  have h5 := A4 Luke h4
  cases Luke_case with
  | inl c => 
      have : LiveWithStrangers Luke := c.2
      contradiction
  | inr c => 
      have : ¬ MultipleBirth Luke := c.1
      contradiction
</lean>

ANSWER: False
