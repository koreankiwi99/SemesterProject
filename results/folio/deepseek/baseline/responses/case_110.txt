The reasoning can be formalized in Lean as follows. The context states that all fir trees are evergreens, which translates to the axiom `ax1`. It also states that there exists at least one object of worship that is a fir tree, which translates to the axiom `ax2`. The question asks whether we can prove that some evergreens are not objects of worship, formalized as `∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ WorshipObject x`.

From `ax2`, we know there exists at least one worship object that is a fir tree (and therefore an evergreen by `ax1`). However, there is no information about:
- Whether all evergreens are objects of worship
- Whether there exist evergreens that are not fir trees
- Whether all fir trees are objects of worship

Thus, while we know of at least one evergreen that is a worship object, we cannot confirm or refute the existence of an evergreen that is not a worship object. The statement is neither provable nor disprovable from the given premises.

<lean>
constant obj : Type
constant FirTree : obj → Prop
constant Evergreen : obj → Prop
constant WorshipObject : obj → Prop

axiom ax1 : ∀ x, FirTree x → Evergreen x
axiom ax2 : ∃ x, WorshipObject x ∧ FirTree x

-- The theorem "Some evergreens are not objects of worship" (∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ WorshipObject x)
-- cannot be proven from the axioms, nor can its negation be proven.
-- Here are two possible models:

-- Model 1: Statement is false (no such evergreen exists)
--   Let there be one object 'a' with:
--      FirTree a, Evergreen a, WorshipObject a (by ax1 and ax2)
--   No non-worship evergreens exist → ∀ x, Evergreen x → WorshipObject x

-- Model 2: Statement is true (exists non-worship evergreen)
--   Let objects: {a, b}
--   a: WorshipObject a, FirTree a → Evergreen a (satisfies ax2 and ax1)
--   b: Evergreen b, not WorshipObject b, and b might or might not be a fir tree.
--      (To ensure no contradiction: if b is a fir tree, we are not forced to make it a worship object since ax2 only requires at least one)

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect declaration of predicates. In Lean, predicates must be defined with their full type signatures. The corrected code properly declares `obj` as a type and each predicate as a function from `obj` to `Prop`.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom FirTree : obj → Prop
axiom Evergreen : obj → Prop
axiom WorshipObject : obj → Prop

axiom ax1 : ∀ x : obj, FirTree x → Evergreen x
axiom ax2 : ∃ x : obj, WorshipObject x ∧ FirTree x
</lean>

**Analysis:**
- `ax1` states all fir trees are evergreens
- `ax2` states there exists at least one worship object that is a fir tree
- The query asks if we can prove: ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬WorshipObject x

**Proof status:**
1. From `ax2`, we know ∃x (WorshipObject x ∧ FirTree x). Call this object `a`.
2. By `ax1`, `FirTree a → Evergreen a`, so `a` is both Evergreen and WorshipObject.
3. However:
   - We cannot prove there exists an evergreen that is NOT a worship object (the statement)
   - We cannot prove the negation (∀x, Evergreen x → WorshipObject x) either, as:
     * Case 1: All evergreens could be worship objects (if only `a` exists)
     * Case 2: An additional evergreen `b` could exist that is not worshipped

Thus, neither the statement nor its negation is provable from the axioms.
