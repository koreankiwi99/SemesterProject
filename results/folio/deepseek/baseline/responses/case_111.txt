The reasoning involves determining if Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico based on the given context. The key points are:

1. The Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico or Texas.
2. Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.
3. The Harding Pegmatite Mine (located in the Picuris Mountains) was donated.
4. No mountain ranges in Texas have donated mines.

From (3) and (4), if the Picuris Mountains were in Texas, they could not have a donated mine. However, the mine was donated, so the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas. Therefore, by (1), they must be in New Mexico. Since Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains (2), he visited a mountain range in New Mexico.

The Lean formalization captures this logic:

<lean>
axiom State : Type
axiom NewMexico : State
axiom Texas : State

axiom MountainRange : Type
axiom Mine : Type

axiom Picuris : MountainRange
axiom HardingPegmatite : Mine

axiom inState : MountainRange → State → Prop
axiom located_in_mountain : Mine → MountainRange → Prop
axiom visited : MountainRange → Prop
axiom donated : Mine → Prop

axiom A1 : inState Picuris NewMexico ∨ inState Picuris Texas
axiom A2 : visited Picuris
axiom A3 : located_in_mountain HardingPegmatite Picuris ∧ donated HardingPegmatite
axiom A4 : ∀ (m : MountainRange), inState m Texas → ∀ (mine : Mine), located_in_mountain mine m → ¬ donated mine

theorem juan_visited_new_mexico : ∃ mr, inState mr NewMexico ∧ visited mr := by
  have : inState Picuris NewMexico := by
    cases A1 with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr h =>
        have no_donated : ∀ mine, located_in_mountain mine Picuris → ¬ donated mine := A4 Picuris h
        have h_in := A3.left
        have h_donated := A3.right
        exact absurd h_donated (no_donated HardingPegmatite h_in)
  exact ⟨Picuris, this, A2⟩
</lean>

The theorem proves there exists a mountain range in New Mexico visited by Juan de Onate (Picuris), so the statement is true.

ANSWER: True
