The reasoning involves determining if Peter is shorter than some man in Michael's class, meaning there exists a man in Michael's class taller than Peter. The key points are:
- Peter is taller than Michael (given).
- Michael is taller than every other man in his class (given).
- Taller is transitive (given).
- For any man x in Michael's class (x ≠ Michael), transitivity implies Peter is taller than x (since Peter > Michael > x).
- Michael is in the class, but Peter is taller than Michael. Without asymmetry of "taller", it's possible (though not stated) that Michael is taller than Peter, creating a cycle. However, no axiom confirms or denies this possibility.
- The other information (about blocking, Windy, jump shooting) does not relate to Peter's height relative to the class.

Thus, neither the existence of a man in the class taller than Peter nor its negation can be proven from the given axioms.

<lean>
axiom Man : Type
axiom Taller : Man → Man → Prop
axiom Michael : Man
axiom Peter : Man
axiom InClass : Man → Prop
axiom Michael_in_class : InClass Michael
axiom Michael_taller : ∀ x, InClass x → x ≠ Michael → Taller Michael x
axiom Peter_taller_Michael : Taller Peter Michael
axiom trans_taller : ∀ x y z, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z

-- The statement to prove: ∃ x, InClass x ∧ Taller x Peter
-- We cannot prove this because:
--   For any x ≠ Michael in the class, we have Taller Michael x and Taller Peter Michael, so by transitivity, Taller Peter x.
--   Thus, no x ≠ Michael is taller than Peter.
--   For Michael: We have Taller Peter Michael, but without asymmetry, we cannot assume ¬Taller Michael Peter.
--   Therefore, we cannot prove ∃ x, InClass x ∧ Taller x Peter.

-- We also cannot prove the negation ¬∃ x, InClass x ∧ Taller x Peter because:
--   It is possible (though not stated) that Taller Michael Peter holds, making Michael such an x.
--   The axioms do not forbid cycles (e.g., Taller Peter Michael and Taller Michael Peter).

-- Hence, neither the statement nor its negation is provable.
