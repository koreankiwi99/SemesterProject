The reasoning shows that the Legend of Zelda must be on the Top 10 list based on the given context. The key steps are:
1. The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies (given).
2. If a game sells more than one million copies, it is included in the Top 10 list (given).
3. Therefore, by modus ponens, the Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.

The other information (about Japanese companies) is not needed for this conclusion.
