The context provides several statements about people and wedding-related activities, but does not specify any direct information about John's engagement status. The axioms allow for scenarios where John might be engaged and scenarios where he might not be, without contradiction. Specifically:

- If John has a larger family, axiom A6 implies he either has a well-attended wedding (leading to engagement via axioms A3, A2, A1) or invites friends (which doesn't force engagement).
- If John does not have a larger family, no axioms constrain his engagement.
- Axiom A5 (if engaged, John doesn't both invite friends and make wedding plans) doesn't force engagement status, as John might avoid that combination regardless of engagement.

Since no proof exists for `Engaged John` or `¬Engaged John` from the given axioms, the statement is uncertain.

axiom obj : Type
axiom John : obj
axiom Engaged : obj → Prop
axiom WeddingPlans : obj → Prop
axiom InviteOthers : obj → Prop
axiom WellAttendedWedding : obj → Prop
axiom LargerFamily : obj → Prop
axiom InviteFriends : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, WeddingPlans x → Engaged x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, InviteOthers x → WeddingPlans x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, WellAttendedWedding x → InviteOthers x
axiom A4 : ∃ x, WellAttendedWedding x ∧ LargerFamily x
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InviteFriends John ∧ WeddingPlans John)
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → WellAttendedWedding John ∨ InviteFriends John

-- No proof exists for Engaged John or its negation

ANSWER: Uncertain
