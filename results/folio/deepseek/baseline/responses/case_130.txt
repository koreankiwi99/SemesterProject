The context provides several statements about people and wedding planning, with a focus on John. The key predicates are:
- `Engaged`: being engaged
- `WeddingPlans`: making wedding plans
- `InviteOthers`: inviting others to the ceremony
- `WellAttended`: having a well-attended wedding
- `LargerFamily`: having a larger family
- `InviteFriends`: inviting friends to the ceremony

The axioms establish relationships:
1. Wedding plans imply engagement.
2. Inviting others implies wedding plans.
3. A well-attended wedding implies inviting others.
4. Some people with well-attended weddings have larger families.
5. If John is engaged, he doesn't invite friends or make wedding plans.
6. If John has a larger family, he has a well-attended wedding or invites friends.

The question asks whether John neither has a larger family nor invites others to his wedding.

Analysis:
- From axioms 2 and 1, if John invites others, he makes wedding plans and is engaged.
- If John is engaged (from above), axiom 5 implies he doesn't make wedding plans, contradicting the initial assumption. Thus, John cannot invite others (`¬InviteOthers John` is provable).
- Axiom 3 means a well-attended wedding requires inviting others. Since John doesn't invite others, he cannot have a well-attended wedding (`¬WellAttended John`).
- Axiom 6 simplifies for John: if he has a larger family, he must invite friends (since a well-attended wedding is impossible).
- However, there is no information about John inviting friends or having a larger family. Axiom 4 confirms such people exist, but not specifically John.

Thus, while `¬InviteOthers John` is proven, `¬LargerFamily John` cannot be proven or disproven. The full statement `¬LargerFamily John ∧ ¬InviteOthers John` is therefore uncertain.
