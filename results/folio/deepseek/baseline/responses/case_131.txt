The statement "Platypuses are mammals with no teeth" is directly supported by the given context: 
- "Platypuses are mammals" (explicitly stated)
- "Platypuses have no teeth" (explicitly stated)

The additional information ("Some mammals have teeth" and "Humans have teeth") does not contradict this, as "some" implies not all mammals necessarily have teeth. Thus, the statement is true based on the context.
