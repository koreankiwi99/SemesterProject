The given context provides:
- Some mammals have teeth (∃x, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x).
- Platypuses have no teeth (¬HasTeeth Platypus).
- Platypuses are mammals (Mammal Platypus).
- Humans have teeth (HasTeeth Human).

The question asks whether humans must be mammals based on this information.

Analysis:
- The existence of mammals with teeth (e.g., some unknown mammal) and platypuses (mammals without teeth) shows that mammals can either have or lack teeth.
- Humans having teeth does not logically require them to be mammals, as there could be non-mammalian entities with teeth.
- No axiom links having teeth to being a mammal (HasTeeth x does not imply Mammal x).
- Similarly, there is no evidence that humans are not mammals.

Thus, the statement "Humans are mammals" cannot be proven true or false from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop
axiom Platypus : obj
axiom Human : obj
axiom some_mammal_has_teeth : ∃ x, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom platypus_no_teeth : ¬ HasTeeth Platypus
axiom platypus_mammal : Mammal Platypus
axiom human_has_teeth : HasTeeth Human
-- No axiom states that having teeth implies being a mammal
-- Cannot prove Mammal Human or ¬Mammal Human

ANSWER: Uncertain
