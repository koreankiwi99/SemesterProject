The context states that plungers, vacuums, and vampires all suck, while dusters do not suck. Space is explicitly stated to be a vacuum, so space sucks. Vampires also suck, but there is no information indicating that everything that sucks is a vampire. Therefore, knowing that space sucks does not imply that space is a vampire. Additionally, there are no axioms linking vacuums to vampires or excluding space from being a vampire. Thus, the statement "Space is a vampire" cannot be proven true or false from the given information.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom sucks : obj → Prop
axiom Plunger : obj → Prop
axiom Vacuum : obj → Prop
axiom Vampire : obj → Prop
axiom Duster : obj → Prop
axiom Space : obj

axiom plungers_suck : ∀ x, Plunger x → sucks x
axiom vacuums_suck : ∀ x, Vacuum x → sucks x
axiom vampires_suck : ∀ x, Vampire x → sucks x
axiom space_vacuum : Vacuum Space
axiom duster_no_suck : ∀ x, Duster x → ¬ sucks x

theorem space_sucks : sucks Space := vacuums_suck Space space_vacuum

-- No axiom states that vacuums are vampires or that sucking implies being a vampire.
-- Also, no axiom states that space is not a vampire.
-- Thus, Vampire Space is uncertain.
