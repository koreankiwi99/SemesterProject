The reasoning is based on the given context:

1. Unsupervised learning does not require labeled data.
2. The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms.
3. Reinforcement learning is not used for this model.
4. The algorithm used for training requires labeled data.

Since unsupervised learning does not require labeled data (point 1) but the training algorithm for the state-of-the-art model requires labeled data (point 4), unsupervised learning cannot be used. The model must use supervised learning (as reinforcement learning is excluded by point 3). Therefore, the statement that unsupervised learning is used is false.
