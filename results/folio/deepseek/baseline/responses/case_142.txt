The context states that breeding back is a form of artificial selection and that Heck cattle were bred back. This implies that at least some Heck cattle underwent breeding back, which is artificial selection. Therefore, the statement "Some Heck cattle are artificially selected" is true.

The compilation error occurred because the `rcases` tactic was used without importing the required mathlib. The proof has been rewritten using basic Lean 4 tactics (`cases`, `exact`, and `apply`) without external dependencies.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom isHeckCattle : obj → Prop
axiom BredBack : obj → Prop
axiom ArtificiallySelected : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, BredBack x → ArtificiallySelected x
axiom A2 : ∃ x, isHeckCattle x ∧ BredBack x

theorem some_heck_artificially_selected : ∃ x, isHeckCattle x ∧ ArtificiallySelected x := by
  cases A2 with
  | intro w hw =>
    exists w
    apply And.intro
    · exact hw.left
    · apply A1 w
      exact hw.right
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**  
1. `cases A2` decomposes the existential quantifier (∃x) into a witness `w` and evidence `hw : isHeckCattle w ∧ BredBack w`.  
2. `exists w` uses `w` as the witness for the new existential claim.  
3. `And.intro` splits the goal into two subgoals:  
   - `isHeckCattle w` (proved by `hw.left`)  
   - `ArtificiallySelected w` (proved by applying `A1 w` to `hw.right`).  

The theorem is successfully proven: The context states that breeding back implies artificial selection (A1), and Heck cattle were bred back (A2), so some Heck cattle are artificially selected.
