</lean>

After thorough analysis:
1. Vladimir lacks Taiwanese citizenship and must therefore be a US citizen (by citizenship axiom). As a US citizen, he can register to vote and consequently participate in the election.
2. Ekaterina can either register or be a Russian official. If she registers, the claim holds. If she is a Russian official, she cannot hold Taiwanese citizenship (by rf_no_taiwanese) and must therefore be a US citizen. Thus, she can register in both cases.
3. We have proven both Ekaterina can register and Vladimir can participate, making the negated statement "¬ (Ekaterina can register ∧ Vladimir can participate)" false.

ANSWER: False
