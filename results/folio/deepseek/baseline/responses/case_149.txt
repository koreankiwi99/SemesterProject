The context states that New Vessel Press publishes all its books in English, and Neapolitan Chronicles is published by New Vessel Press. Therefore, the statement "Neapolitan Chronicles is an English book" must be true. The fact that it was translated from Italian is consistent with the context but does not affect the logical conclusion.
