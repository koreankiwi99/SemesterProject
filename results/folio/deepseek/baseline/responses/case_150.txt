The context provides information about New Vessel Press and specific books it has published (Neapolitan Chronicles and Palace of Flies). However, there is no mention of Harry Potter or any exhaustive list of all published books. The axioms establish that certain books are published by New Vessel Press but do not imply that only those two books are published by them. Therefore, we cannot prove or disprove whether Harry Potter was published by New Vessel Press based on the given information.

<lean>
axiom Book : Type
axiom NVP : Book → Prop
axiom neapolitan : Book
axiom palace : Book
axiom harry_potter : Book

-- Axioms from context
axiom published_neapolitan : NVP neapolitan
axiom published_palace : NVP palace

-- No information about Harry Potter
theorem statement : NVP harry_potter := by sorry  -- Cannot prove
theorem neg_statement : ¬ NVP harry_potter := by sorry  -- Cannot disprove
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain
