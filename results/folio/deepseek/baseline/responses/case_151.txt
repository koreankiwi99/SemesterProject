Based on the provided context, the reasoning is as follows:

1. New Vessel Press publishes books translated into English.
2. Neapolitan Chronicles (published by them) was translated from Italian.
3. Palace of Flies is also published by New Vessel Press.

There is no information linking Palace of Flies to Italian specifically. While it must be translated into English (as per their specialization), the source language could be any foreign language, not necessarily Italian. The example of Neapolitan Chronicles doesn't generalize to all their books.

Lean formalization:

<lean>
axiom Book : Type
axiom PublishedByNVP : Book → Prop
axiom TranslatedFromItalian : Book → Prop
axiom NeapolitanChronicles : Book
axiom PalaceOfFlies : Book

-- Axioms from context
axiom all_english : ∀ b, PublishedByNVP b → ∃ lang, lang ≠ "English"  -- Implied specialization (not directly used)
axiom nc_published : PublishedByNVP NeapolitanChronicles
axiom nc_italian : TranslatedFromItalian NeapolitanChronicles
axiom pf_published : PublishedByNVP PalaceOfFlies

-- No axiom forces PalaceOfFlies to be from Italian
-- No axiom prevents PalaceOfFlies from being from Italian
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain
