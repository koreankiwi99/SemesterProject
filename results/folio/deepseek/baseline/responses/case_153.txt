The context provides several axioms about hydrocarbons, organic compounds, alkanes, chemical compounds, and carbon content. The mixture is described with a specific condition: it either is both a chemical compound and contains only one element, or it is neither. However, axiom 5 states that no chemical compound contains only one element. This means the mixture cannot satisfy the first disjunct (being a chemical compound and containing only one element) because that would contradict axiom 5. Therefore, the mixture must satisfy the second disjunct: it is not a chemical compound and does not contain only one element.

The question asks whether the mixture is an alkane and contains carbon. If the mixture were an alkane, then:
- By axiom 2, it would be a hydrocarbon.
- By axiom 1, it would be an organic compound.
- By axiom 3, it would be a chemical compound.

However, we have established that the mixture is not a chemical compound. Thus, the mixture cannot be an alkane. Therefore, the statement "The mixture is an alkane and contains carbon" is false because the mixture is not an alkane. The "contains carbon" part is irrelevant to the falsity of the conjunction since the first conjunct is false.

ANSWER: False

The compilation error occurred because the `cases` tactic was misapplied. In the `not_chem` theorem, when handling the `inl` case, we need to apply the contradiction between `conj.right` (proof of `ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture`) and `no_one` (proof of `¬ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture`). Similarly, for the `inr` case, we apply `conj.left` to `h` to derive the contradiction.

Here's the corrected Lean code:
