axiom obj : Type
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Mortal : obj → Prop
axiom Greek : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x : obj, Human x → Mortal x
axiom T2 : ∀ x : obj, Greek x → Human x

-- We want to check: ∃ x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x
-- However, the axioms don't guarantee any Greek exists.
-- We can prove that IF there exists a Greek, then that Greek is mortal,
-- but without existence, we cannot prove the existential claim.

-- Attempt to prove the existential statement fails:
example : ∃ x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x := by
  -- We have no way to construct a witness since no specific Greek is provided.
  sorry  -- Proof fails

-- Attempt to disprove it (prove ¬∃ x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x) also fails:
example : ¬∃ x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x := by
  intro h
  -- We cannot derive a contradiction because the axioms don't forbid Greeks from existing.
  sorry  -- Proof fails

-- Therefore, we can neither prove nor disprove the statement.
