The context includes a contradiction: James is stated to be working in the lab (A6), but also that he does not work in the lab or have a part-time job (A7). However, the specific statement "James has a part-time job" can be disproven independently using the other axioms without relying on A7. The proof shows that if James had a part-time job, it would lead to a contradiction with the chain of reasoning from him working in the lab to being in the CS department (via Professor David's class and the database course), which conflicts with the library workers not being from CS. Thus, James cannot have a part-time job.
