The reasoning involves deriving that James does not have a part-time job based on the given premises. The key steps are:
1. James works in the lab (axiom T6).
2. Working in the lab implies taking a class with Professor David (axiom T5).
3. Taking a class with Professor David implies taking the database course (axiom T4).
4. Taking the database course implies being from the computer science department (axiom T3).
5. Therefore, James is from the computer science department.
6. If James had a part-time job, he would work in the library (axiom T2).
7. Working in the library implies not being from the computer science department (axiom T1).
8. This leads to a contradiction (James cannot both be and not be from CS).
9. Thus, James cannot have a part-time job.

The seventh context statement ("James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job") is interpreted as ¬WorksInLab James ∨ ¬HasPartTimeJob James. Since James works in the lab (T6), the disjunction requires ¬HasPartTimeJob James, which aligns with the proof.
