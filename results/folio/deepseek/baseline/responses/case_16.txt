The context provides information about animals spotted near the campus, including Rockie. The axioms establish that:
- Rockie is spotted and calm.
- Spotted animals are either rabbits or squirrels.
- If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish (due to being spotted), and skittish animals are not calm, contradicting Rockie's calmness. Thus, Rockie must be a rabbit.
- There exists at least one spotted turtle, but the axioms do not specify whether rabbits and turtles are mutually exclusive categories. Without disjointness assumptions, Rockie being a rabbit does not preclude it from also being a turtle. However, there is no direct evidence that Rockie is a turtle.

Therefore, the statement "Rockie is a turtle" cannot be proven true or false from the given axioms.

-- All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute (not needed for the proof)
axiom A1 : ∀ a, Rabbit a ∧ SpottedNearCampus a → (fun _ => True) a

-- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus
axiom A2 : ∃ a, Turtle a ∧ SpottedNearCampus a

-- The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels
axiom A3 : ∀ a, SpottedNearCampus a → Rabbit a ∨ Squirrel a

-- If something is skittish, then it is not calm
axiom A4 : ∀ a, Skittish a → ¬ Calm a

-- All squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish
axiom A5 : ∀ a, Squirrel a ∧ SpottedNearCampus a → Skittish a

-- Rockie can be spotted near the campus and is calm
axiom A6 : SpottedNearCampus Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

-- Prove Rockie is a rabbit (not a squirrel)
theorem Rockie_rabbit : Rabbit Rockie := by
  have hSpot := A6.left
  have hCalm := A6.right
  have hRabSqu := A3 Rockie hSpot
  cases hRabSqu with
  | inl hRab => exact hRab
  | inr hSqu =>
      have hSkittish := A5 Rockie ⟨hSqu, hSpot⟩
      have hNotCalm := A4 Rockie hSkittish
      contradiction

-- Cannot prove Turtle Rockie
theorem cannot_prove_turtle : ¬(∀ x, Turtle x) := by
  intro h
  have hTurtleRockie := h Rockie
  -- But no contradiction arises from assuming Turtle Rockie
  -- However, we don't have evidence for it either.
  -- This theorem is just to show we don't have universal turtle, not directly about Rockie.
  -- Actually, we have A2: there exists a turtle, but not necessarily Rockie.
  -- We leave the main uncertainty reasoning in the explanation.
  admit  -- Proof not possible; placeholder

-- Cannot prove ¬Turtle Rockie either
theorem cannot_prove_not_turtle : ¬(¬Turtle Rockie) → False := by
  intro h
  -- Attempting to prove ¬¬Turtle Rockie leads to no contradiction
  -- But we cannot constructively prove ¬¬P → P without more information.
  -- This is just to illustrate we cannot disprove Turtle Rockie.
  admit  -- Proof not possible; placeholder

-- Since we cannot prove Turtle Rockie nor ¬Turtle Rockie, the answer is Uncertain.
