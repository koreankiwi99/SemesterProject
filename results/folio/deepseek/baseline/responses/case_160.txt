The reasoning involves George and predicates about his actions. The context provides implications that lead to the conclusion when George likes music and has access to a program.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom George : obj
axiom LikesMusic : obj → Prop
axiom WantsToCompose : obj → Prop
axiom HasAccessToProgram : obj → Prop
axiom CanCompose : obj → Prop
axiom WillCompose : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : LikesMusic George → WantsToCompose George
axiom A2 : HasAccessToProgram George → CanCompose George
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, (CanCompose x ∧ WantsToCompose x) → WillCompose x

theorem george_will_compose : 
    LikesMusic George ∧ HasAccessToProgram George → WillCompose George := 
  fun h => 
    have likes_music : LikesMusic George := h.left
    has_access : HasAccessToProgram George := h.right
    have wants : WantsToCompose George := A1 likes_music
    have can : CanCompose George := A2 has_access
    show WillCompose George from A3 George ⟨can, wants⟩
</lean>

The proof shows that if George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose. The premises directly support this conclusion through logical implications.

The compilation error occurred because the `has_access` line was missing the `have` keyword. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom George : obj
axiom LikesMusic : obj → Prop
axiom WantsToCompose : obj → Prop
axiom HasAccessToProgram : obj → Prop
axiom CanCompose : obj → Prop
axiom WillCompose : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : LikesMusic George → WantsToCompose George
axiom A2 : HasAccessToProgram George → CanCompose George
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, (CanCompose x ∧ WantsToCompose x) → WillCompose x

theorem george_will_compose : 
    LikesMusic George ∧ HasAccessToProgram George → WillCompose George := 
  fun h => 
    have likes_music : LikesMusic George := h.left
    have has_access : HasAccessToProgram George := h.right
    have wants : WantsToCompose George := A1 likes_music
    have can : CanCompose George := A2 has_access
    show WillCompose George from A3 George ⟨can, wants⟩
</lean>

The proof demonstrates that:
1. If George likes music (from premise), he wants to compose (by A1)
2. If George has access to a program (from premise), he can compose (by A2)
3. When George both can compose and wants to compose (conjunction), he will compose (by A3)

Thus the conclusion follows directly from the premises.

ANSWER: True
