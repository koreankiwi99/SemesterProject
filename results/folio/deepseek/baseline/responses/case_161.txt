The reasoning involves evaluating the statement "If George will not compose, George can not compose" based on the given premises. The premises are:
1. If George likes music, he wants to compose.
2. If George has access to a program, he can compose.
3. If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.

The statement to evaluate is: ¬WillCompose → ¬CanCompose.

In Lean, we formalize the propositions and axioms. However, neither the statement nor its negation can be proven from the axioms alone. This is because:
- The axioms do not force any specific truth values for LikesMusic or HasAccess.
- A counterexample exists: if George has access (so he can compose) but does not like music (so he doesn't want to compose), then he will not compose. Here, ¬WillCompose is true and ¬CanCompose is false, making the implication false.
- Conversely, if George does not have access (so he cannot compose), then ¬WillCompose may or may not hold, but the implication could hold in some scenarios.

Since the axioms do not universally validate or falsify the statement, it remains uncertain.

<lean>
axiom LikesMusic : Prop
axiom HasAccess : Prop
axiom WantsToCompose : Prop
axiom CanCompose : Prop
axiom WillCompose : Prop

axiom A1 : LikesMusic → WantsToCompose
axiom A2 : HasAccess → CanCompose
axiom A3 : CanCompose ∧ WantsToCompose → WillCompose

-- The statement to prove: ¬WillCompose → ¬CanCompose
-- We cannot prove this statement from the axioms.
-- We also cannot prove its negation (¬(¬WillCompose → ¬CanCompose), i.e., ¬WillCompose ∧ CanCompose).
-- Therefore, the truth value of the statement is uncertain.
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain
