axiom Show : Type
axiom Monday8pm : Show → Prop
axiom GivesRoses : Show → Prop
axiom Bachelor : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
axiom RealityTV : Show → Prop

-- Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.
axiom A1 : ∃ s, Monday8pm s ∧ GivesRoses s

-- If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
axiom A2 : ∀ s, GivesRoses s → Bachelor s

-- The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
axiom A3 : ∀ s, Bachelor s → PortraysRealPeople s

-- All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.
axiom A4 : ∀ s, PortraysRealPeople s → RealityTV s

axiom BreakingBad : Show
axiom A5 : ¬ RealityTV BreakingBad

-- We cannot prove Monday8pm BreakingBad nor ¬Monday8pm BreakingBad
-- Let's attempt to prove either:

-- Attempt to prove Monday8pm BreakingBad:
--   There is no axiom connecting BreakingBad to Monday8pm directly.
--   From A1, we have some show s0 with Monday8pm s0 and GivesRoses s0.
--   Then A2 gives Bachelor s0, A3 gives PortraysRealPeople s0, A4 gives RealityTV s0.
--   But A5 says BreakingBad is not RealityTV, so BreakingBad ≠ s0 (if we had injectivity, but we don't).
--   However, multiple shows can air at Monday8pm, so no contradiction.

-- Attempt to prove ¬Monday8pm BreakingBad:
--   Assume Monday8pm BreakingBad. This does not contradict any axiom.
--   We know BreakingBad is not RealityTV (A5), but the show from A1 is RealityTV.
--   There is no axiom stating that only one show can air at Monday8pm or that non-reality shows cannot air then.

-- Therefore, neither is provable.
