The context provides information about Heinrich Schmidt: he was a German politician, a member of the Prussian State Parliament, and a member of the Nazi Reichstag. The question asks whether some German politician was part of both legislative bodies. Since Heinrich Schmidt satisfies all three conditions (being a German politician, in the Prussian State Parliament, and in the Nazi Reichstag), he serves as an existential witness proving the statement.
