The context states that Heinrich Schmidt was a politician and a member of the Nazi Reichstag. The statement "No politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag" claims that no politician is a member, which is contradicted by Heinrich Schmidt being both a politician and a member. Therefore, the statement is false.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : obj
axiom Politician : obj → Prop
axiom MemberOfNaziReichstag : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : Politician HeinrichSchmidt
axiom T2 : MemberOfNaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt

theorem not_no_politicians : ¬ (∀ x, Politician x → ¬ MemberOfNaziReichstag x) := by
  intro H
  have H1 := H HeinrichSchmidt
  have H2 := H1 T1
  exact H2 T2
</lean>

The Lean code proves the negation of the universal statement "No politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag" by showing it leads to a contradiction with the given axioms. Thus, the original statement is false.

ANSWER: False
