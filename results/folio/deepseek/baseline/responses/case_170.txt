The reasoning involves translating the given context into logical axioms and proving the statement about colorectal cancer. The context provides:

1. If something is a deadly disease, it has a low survival rate: `∀x, DeadlyDisease x → LowSurvivalRate x`
2. Severe cancers are deadly diseases: `∀x, SevereCancer x → DeadlyDisease x`
3. Bile duct cancer is a severe cancer: `∀x, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x`
4. Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer: `∀x, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x`
5. Mild flu has a low survival rate: `∀x, MildFlu x → LowSurvivalRate x`
6. Colorectal cancer is not both bile duct cancer and low survival rate: `¬(BileDuctCancer CRC ∧ LowSurvivalRate CRC)`

The question asks whether:  
If colorectal cancer is bile duct cancer or cholangiocarcinoma, then it is bile duct cancer and mild flu.  
Logical form: `(BileDuctCancer CRC ∨ Cholangiocarcinoma CRC) → (BileDuctCancer CRC ∧ MildFlu CRC)`

Proof strategy:  
- Assume `BileDuctCancer CRC ∨ Cholangiocarcinoma CRC`.  
- If `BileDuctCancer CRC`:  
  - Then `SevereCancer CRC` (from axiom 3).  
  - Then `DeadlyDisease CRC` (from axiom 2).  
  - Then `LowSurvivalRate CRC` (from axiom 1).  
  - But this contradicts axiom 6 (`¬(BileDuctCancer CRC ∧ LowSurvivalRate CRC)`).  
- If `Cholangiocarcinoma CRC`:  
  - Then `BileDuctCancer CRC` (from axiom 4).  
  - Same as above, leading to contradiction.  
- Thus, the assumption leads to a contradiction, proving the implication (since `False` implies anything).

The Lean code formalizes this and proves the theorem.
