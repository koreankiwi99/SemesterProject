Based on the given context and reasoning, the Lean proof shows that the statement about Taylor is true.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
constant Taylor : obj
constant E : obj → Prop  -- eats salads regularly
constant C : obj → Prop  -- very conscious about health
constant H : obj → Prop  -- grew up in health-conscious home
constant N : obj → Prop  -- fulfills daily nutritional intakes
constant D : obj → Prop  -- disregards physical well-being
constant G : obj → Prop  -- visits gym at least once daily

axiom A1 : ∀ x, E x → C x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, H x → E x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, N x → H x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, D x → ¬ C x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, G x → N x
axiom TaylorDisj : H Taylor ∧ D Taylor ∨ ¬ H Taylor ∧ ¬ D Taylor

theorem taylor_neither : ¬ H Taylor ∧ ¬ G Taylor := by
  cases TaylorDisj with
  | inl hd =>
      have ⟨hH, hD⟩ := hd
      have hE := A2 Taylor hH
      have hC := A1 Taylor hE
      have hNotC := A4 Taylor hD
      contradiction
  | inr nhnd =>
      have ⟨nh, nd⟩ := nhnd
      apply And.intro nh
      intro g
      have hN := A5 Taylor g
      have hH := A3 Taylor hN
      contradiction
</lean>

ANSWER: True

ITERATION 2

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect syntax for declaring constants and axioms in Lean 4. Specifically:
1. `constant` was used incorrectly for predicates - they should be declared as functions (`obj → Prop`)
2. Axioms applied to `Taylor` needed explicit type annotations
3. Case analysis syntax required pattern matching adjustments

Here's the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Taylor : obj
axiom E : obj → Prop  -- eats salads regularly
axiom C : obj → Prop  -- very conscious about health
axiom H : obj → Prop  -- grew up in health-conscious home
axiom N : obj → Prop  -- fulfills daily nutritional intakes
axiom D : obj → Prop  -- disregards physical well-being
axiom G : obj → Prop  -- visits gym at least once daily

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, E x → C x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, H x → E x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, N x → H x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, D x → ¬ C x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, G x → N x
axiom TaylorDisj : H Taylor ∧ D Taylor ∨ ¬ H Taylor ∧ ¬ D Taylor

theorem taylor_neither : ¬ H Taylor ∧ ¬ G Taylor := by
  cases TaylorDisj with
  | inl hd =>
      have hH : H Taylor := hd.1
      have hD : D Taylor := hd.2
      have hE : E Taylor := A2 Taylor hH
      have hC : C Taylor := A1 Taylor hE
      have hNotC : ¬ C Taylor := A4 Taylor hD
      contradiction
  | inr nhnd =>
      have nh : ¬ H Taylor := nhnd.1
      have nd : ¬ D Taylor := nhnd.2
      apply And.intro nh
      intro g
      have hN : N Taylor := A5 Taylor g
      have hH : H Taylor := A3 Taylor hN
      contradiction
</lean>

The proof shows:
1. The first case (Taylor has health-conscious home but disregards health) leads to contradiction via axioms A1-A4
2. The second case (Taylor has no health-conscious home and doesn't disregard health) proves:
   - ¬H Taylor directly
   - ¬G Taylor by showing G would imply H via A5 and A3, contradicting ¬H

Thus the statement "Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym daily" is true.
