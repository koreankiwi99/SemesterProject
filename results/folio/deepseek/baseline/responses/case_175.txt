The context provides information about the summer Olympic games being a sporting event and details about its last occurrence in Tokyo. However, there is no mention of the world championships or any relationship between the summer Olympic games and the world championships. Without any axioms connecting these entities, it is impossible to determine whether the world championships is a sporting event based solely on the given context.

axiom SportingEvent : Event → Prop
axiom T1 : SportingEvent SummerOlympicGames
-- No information about WorldChampionships
-- Cannot prove SportingEvent WorldChampionships or ¬SportingEvent WorldChampionships
