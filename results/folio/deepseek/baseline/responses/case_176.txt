The context explicitly states that "The last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo." The question asks whether the statement "The last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo" is true, false, or uncertain based on this context. Since the context directly contradicts this statement, the statement must be false.

In Lean, we model the last summer Olympic games as a specific event and define the property of being in Tokyo. The axiom `in_Tokyo_last` directly asserts that the last summer Olympic games were in Tokyo. This allows us to prove that the negation of this statement (i.e., the claim that the games were not in Tokyo) is false.

<lean>
axiom Event : Type
axiom last_summer_olympic : Event
axiom in_Tokyo : Event → Prop
axiom in_Tokyo_last : in_Tokyo last_summer_olympic

theorem not_not_in_Tokyo : ¬¬in_Tokyo last_summer_olympic := 
  fun h => h in_Tokyo_last

theorem statement_false : ¬(¬in_Tokyo last_summer_olympic) := 
  not_not_in_Tokyo
</lean>

The Lean proof demonstrates that the statement "The last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo" leads to a contradiction given the axiom, confirming it is false.

ANSWER: False
