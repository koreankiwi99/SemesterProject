The context states that the last summer Olympic games was held in Tokyo and that the United States won the most medals in Tokyo. Since the event in Tokyo is explicitly identified as the last summer Olympic games, the statement "The United States won the most medals in the last summer Olympic games" directly follows from the given information.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom lastSummerOlympics : obj
axiom Tokyo : obj
axiom UnitedStates : obj
axiom wonMostMedals : obj → obj → Prop  -- (country, event)
axiom heldIn : obj → obj → Prop         -- (event, place)
axiom A1 : heldIn lastSummerOlympics Tokyo
axiom A2 : wonMostMedals UnitedStates lastSummerOlympics

theorem US_won_last : wonMostMedals UnitedStates lastSummerOlympics := by
  exact A2
</lean>

ANSWER: True
