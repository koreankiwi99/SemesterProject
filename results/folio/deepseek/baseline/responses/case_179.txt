The context states that Susan flies to LGA airport, meaning she arrives at LGA. The constraint specifies that for any flight, the departure and arrival airports must be different. Therefore, for Susan's flight to LGA, her departure airport cannot be LGA. However, the context does not specify that Susan has only one flight. It is possible that Susan has multiple flights: one arriving at LGA (from a different airport) and another departing from LGA (to a different airport). Since the information does not rule out multiple flights, it is uncertain whether Susan flies from LGA airport in a separate flight.

<lean>
axiom Airport : Type
axiom Person : Type
axiom Susan : Person
axiom John : Person
axiom LGA : Airport
axiom Flight : Person → Airport → Airport → Prop
axiom susan_flight : ∃ d, Flight Susan d LGA
axiom john_flight : ∃ a, Flight John LGA a
axiom constraint : ∀ (p : Person) (d a : Airport), Flight p d a → d ≠ a
-- Cannot prove ∃ a, Flight Susan LGA a (she might have another flight departing from LGA)
-- Cannot prove ¬∃ a, Flight Susan LGA a (she might have only one flight, which arrives at LGA but doesn't depart from it, or she might have a second flight from LGA)

ANSWER: Uncertain
