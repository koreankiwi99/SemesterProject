The context provides information about Susan and John's flights but does not specify all possible flights. Susan flies to LGA, and John flies from LGA. The rule states that for any flight, departure and arrival airports must differ. However, John might have multiple flights. The given flight from LGA proves John departs from LGA to some other airport (not LGA), but it does not preclude another flight where John arrives at LGA. Thus, we cannot determine if John flies to LGA based solely on the provided information.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Airport : Type
axiom LGA : Airport
axiom Susan : Person
axiom John : Person
axiom Flight : Person → Airport → Airport → Prop

-- Susan flies to LGA (arrives at LGA)
axiom susan_flight : ∃ (s_dep : Airport), Flight Susan s_dep LGA

-- John flies from LGA (departs from LGA)
axiom john_flight : ∃ (j_arr : Airport), Flight John LGA j_arr

-- Departure and arrival cannot be the same for any flight
axiom no_self_flight : ∀ (p : Person) (dep arr : Airport), Flight p dep arr → dep ≠ arr

-- We cannot prove that John flies to LGA (∃ a, Flight John a LGA) nor its negation
-- Reason: John might have another flight arriving at LGA, or might not.
