1. Family History is a novel (explicitly stated).
2. Dani Shapiro wrote Family History (explicitly stated).
3. The rule states: If a book is a novel and written by a person, then that person is a novel writer.
4. Since Family History is a novel and Dani Shapiro wrote it, Dani Shapiro must be a novel writer.

The additional information about podcasts, American cities, and Dani Shapiro's other attributes does not affect this conclusion. The Lean formalization and proof are provided below.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom DS : obj  -- Dani Shapiro
axiom FH : obj  -- Family History

axiom Novel : obj → Prop
axiom Wrote : obj → obj → Prop
axiom NovelWriter : obj → Prop

-- Family History is a novel
axiom novel_FH : Novel FH

-- Dani Shapiro wrote Family History
axiom wrote_DS_FH : Wrote DS FH

-- Rule: If a book is a novel and written by a person, then that person is a novel writer.
axiom novel_writer_rule : ∀ (book author : obj), Novel book → Wrote author book → NovelWriter author

-- Proof that Dani Shapiro is a novel writer
