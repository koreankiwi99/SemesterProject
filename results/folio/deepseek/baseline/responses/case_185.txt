The reasoning involves determining whether "Family Secrets is a novel" based on the given context. The key elements are:

1. "A podcast is not a novel" establishes that podcasts cannot be novels: ∀w, Podcast w → ¬Novel w.
2. "Dani Shapiro created a podcast called Family Secrets" directly states that Family Secrets is a podcast: Podcast FamilySecrets.
3. Combining these, Family Secrets being a podcast implies it is not a novel.

The other statements about American cities, novel writers, and Family History are irrelevant to the conclusion about Family Secrets, as they do not provide any connection that could alter the status of Family Secrets as a podcast.

Lean formalization:
- Define a type `Work` for entities like podcasts and novels.
- Introduce `FamilySecrets` as a constant of type `Work`.
- Define predicates `Podcast` and `Novel` on works.
- State the axiom that podcasts are not novels.
- State that Family Secrets is a podcast.
- The theorem proves that Family Secrets is not a novel, refuting the statement "Family Secrets is a novel."

<lean>
constant Work : Type
constant FamilySecrets : Work

axiom Podcast : Work → Prop
axiom Novel : Work → Prop

The error occurred because the theorem name contained an apostrophe, which is not permitted in Lean identifiers. For the corrected code, the theorem name is changed to avoid special characters. The proof remains valid.

<lean>
axiom Work : Type
axiom FamilySecrets : Work
axiom Podcast : Work → Prop
axiom Novel : Work → Prop
axiom podcast_not_novel : ∀ w : Work, Podcast w → ¬ Novel w
axiom fs_podcast : Podcast FamilySecrets

theorem familysecrets_not_novel : ¬ Novel FamilySecrets := by
  exact podcast_not_novel FamilySecrets fs_podcast
</lean>

**Explanation of the proof:**
1. **Axioms**: 
   - `podcast_not_novel`: States that if something is a podcast, it cannot be a novel.
   - `fs_podcast`: States that Family Secrets is a podcast.
2. **Theorem**: 
   - Applies `podcast_not_novel` to `FamilySecrets` with evidence `fs_podcast`, proving that Family Secrets is not a novel.

**Conclusion**:  
The statement "Family Secrets is a novel" is **false**, as Family Secrets is a podcast, and no podcast is a novel.

ANSWER: False
