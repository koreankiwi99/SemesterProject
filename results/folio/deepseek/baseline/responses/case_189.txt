The given context allows us to deduce that Yuri is not a professional basketball player. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context: "All professional basketball players can do jump shots" and "If someone can do jump shots, they leap straight into the air" and "If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles." This forms a chain:  
Professional basketball player → Can do jump shots → Leap straight into air → Activate leg muscles.

2. We know "Yuri does not activate his leg muscles." Therefore, by contrapositive of the chain, Yuri cannot be a professional basketball player.

3. The question asks whether "Yuri is an American professional basketball player." Since we've established that Yuri is not a professional basketball player, this statement is false regardless of his nationality.

Lean proof:
- We define the necessary predicates and axioms.
- Prove that Yuri is not a professional basketball player (`yuri_not_professional`).
- The statement "Yuri is an American professional basketball player" requires both professional status and American nationality. Since the professional part is false, the entire statement is false (`neg_statement`).

ANSWER: False
