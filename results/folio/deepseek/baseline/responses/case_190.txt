The given context and the statement about Yuri are analyzed using predicate logic in Lean. The axioms represent the context:
- There exists a professional basketball player who is not an American national.
- All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
- Doing jump shots implies leaping straight into the air.
- Leaping straight into the air implies activating leg muscles.
- Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

The statement to evaluate is: "If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player."

From the axioms:
- Since Yuri does not activate his leg muscles, he does not leap straight into the air (by axiom 4 and modus tollens).
- If Yuri were a professional basketball player, he would do jump shots (by axiom 2) and thus leap straight into the air (by axiom 3), contradicting the fact that he does not leap. Therefore, Yuri cannot be a professional basketball player.
- The consequent of the implication (Yuri is an American professional basketball player) requires Yuri to be a professional basketball player, which is false.
- The implication has a true antecedent (Yuri does not leap) and a false consequent, making the entire implication false.

The Lean code formalizes the axioms and proves the negation of the given statement, confirming it is false.
