The reasoning involves determining if KiKi is terricolous based on the given premises. The key steps are:

1. **Premises Analysis**:
   - Jane dislikes barking animals: ∀x, Bark x → ¬Likes x
   - All dogs bark: ∀x, Dog x → Bark x
   - Jane likes jumping animals: ∀x, Jump x → Likes x
   - Legged animals jump: ∀x, Legs x → Jump x
   - Terricolous animals have legs: ∀x, Terricolous x → Legs x
   - KiKi-specific premise: ¬Jump KiKi ∧ ¬Legs KiKi → Terricolous KiKi ∨ Legs KiKi

2. **Derived Facts**:
   - **KiKi must jump**: 
     - Assume KiKi doesn't jump and has no legs. Then by KiKi's premise, KiKi is terricolous or has legs. Terricolous implies legs (contradicting no legs), and having legs directly contradicts the assumption. Thus, the assumption is false, so KiKi jumps or has legs. If KiKi has legs, it jumps. Either way, KiKi jumps.
   - **Jane likes KiKi**: Since KiKi jumps, Jane likes KiKi.
   - **KiKi doesn't bark**: If KiKi barked, Jane wouldn't like KiKi, but she does, so KiKi doesn't bark.
   - **KiKi isn't a dog**: If KiKi were a dog, it would bark, but it doesn't, so KiKi isn't a dog.

3. **Terricolous Status**:
   - Terricolous implies legs and jumping (already true for KiKi).
   - However, jumping does not require legs or terricolous status (e.g., a dolphin jumps without legs).
   - No premises force or preclude KiKi being terricolous. Examples:
     - Terricolous: A cat (terricolous, legs, jumps, doesn't bark).
     - Non-terricolous: A dolphin (not terricolous, no legs, jumps, doesn't bark).

Thus, KiKi being terricolous is **uncertain**.

The compilation error occurred due to the use of `by_contra` without proper handling of classical logic. The proof has been rewritten using `by_cases` for case analysis instead. The key steps are:

1. **Proving KiKi jumps**:
   - Case 1: If KiKi jumps, we're done
   - Case 2: If KiKi doesn't jump:
     - Subcase 2a: If KiKi has legs → must jump (contradiction)
     - Subcase 2b: If KiKi has no legs:
       - Use axiom A6: ¬Jump ∧ ¬Legs → Terricolous ∨ Legs
       - Both options lead to contradiction (Terricolous → Legs → contradiction)

2. **Jane likes KiKi** follows directly from jumping

3. **Terricolous status**:
   - No axioms connect jumping to terricolous
   - Terricolous implies legs, but legs aren't required for jumping
   - Counterexamples exist: terricolous (e.g., dog) vs non-terricolous (e.g., dolphin)
