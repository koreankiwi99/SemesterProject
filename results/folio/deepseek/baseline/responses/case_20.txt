The given context provides several axioms about animals spotted near the campus, including Rockie. The statement to evaluate is: "If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle."

Using the axioms:
1. Rockie is spotted near the campus and calm (A6).
2. Animals spotted near the campus are either rabbits or squirrels (A3).
3. If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish (A5), and skittish animals are not calm (A4). This contradicts Rockie being calm, so Rockie must be a rabbit (proven in `is_rabbit`).
4. Rabbits spotted near the campus are cute (A1), so Rockie is cute (proven in `cute_rockie`).
5. Thus, Rockie is cute and calm (antecedent is true).
6. However, Rockie cannot be skittish (proven in `not_skittish`) because skittish would imply not calm, contradicting A6. Therefore, the consequent (skittish turtle) is false.

The implication (true → false) is false. The Lean code proves the negation of the statement, confirming it is false.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors were addressed by fixing syntax issues, particularly with lambda expressions and lemma references. The corrected Lean code proves the negation of the statement "If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle" because:
1. Rockie is calm and spotted near campus (A6)
2. Animals spotted near campus are rabbits or squirrels (A3)
3. Rockie cannot be a squirrel (leads to contradiction with calmness via A4, A5)
4. Thus Rockie must be a rabbit (is_rabbit)
5. Rabbits near campus are cute (A1), so Rockie is cute
6. Rockie is calm and cute (antecedent true)
7. But Rockie cannot be skittish (contradicts calmness via A4)
8. The consequent (skittish turtle) is false
9. Therefore, the implication (true → false) is false

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors were resolved by using tactic mode for all lemmas and theorems, ensuring proper sequencing and avoiding lambda expression issues. The corrected Lean code proves that the statement "If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle" is false because:
1. Rockie is spotted near campus and calm (A6)
2. Animals spotted near campus are rabbits or squirrels (A3)
3. Rockie cannot be a squirrel (contradiction with calmness via A4 and A5)
4. Thus Rockie must be a rabbit (is_rabbit)
5. Rabbits near campus are cute (A1), so Rockie is cute
6. Therefore Rockie is cute and calm (antecedent true)
7. But Rockie cannot be skittish (contradicts calmness via A4)
8. The consequent (skittish turtle) is false
9. The implication (true → false) is false
