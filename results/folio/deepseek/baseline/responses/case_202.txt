Based on the context, we translate the reasoning into Lean:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom AiltonSilva : obj
axiom Braga : obj
axiom Nautico : obj
axiom Fluminense : obj

axiom FootballPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom PlaysFor : obj → obj → Prop
axiom LoanedOutTo : obj → obj → Prop
axiom FootballClub : obj → Prop

-- Ailton Silva is commonly known as Ailton (same entity)
axiom T1 : FootballPlayer AiltonSilva
axiom T2 : LoanedOutTo AiltonSilva Braga
axiom T3 : PlaysFor AiltonSilva Nautico
axiom T4 : FootballClub Nautico
axiom T5 : FootballClub Braga  -- From "Náutico is a football club along with Braga"
axiom T6 : FootballClub Fluminense

theorem loaned_to_club : ∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedOutTo AiltonSilva c :=
  by
    exists Braga
    exact ⟨T5, T2⟩
</lean>

The context explicitly states that Ailton Silva was loaned to Braga ("Ailton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga"). It also confirms Braga is a football club ("Náutico is a football club along with Braga"). Therefore, we can prove ∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedOutTo AiltonSilva c by using Braga as the witness.

ANSWER: True
