The reasoning involves translating the given context into Lean and proving whether Karen will share "Stranger Things" with Lisa.

**Key Points from Context:**
1. "Stranger Things" is popular.
2. Popular Netflix shows are binge-watched by Karen.
3. Binge-watching occurs if and only if downloading occurs.
4. Karen does not download "Black Mirror".
5. "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show.
6. Binge-watching leads to sharing with Lisa.

**Analysis:**
- From (1) and (2): Karen binge-watches "Stranger Things".
- From (6): Binge-watching implies sharing with Lisa.
- Therefore, Karen will share "Stranger Things" with Lisa.

The information about "Black Mirror" (points 4-5) is not needed for this conclusion, as it only establishes that "Black Mirror" is not binge-watched (via the biconditional in point 3), which does not affect "Stranger Things".

**Lean Translation and Proof:**
<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom StrangerThings : obj
axiom BlackMirror : obj
axiom Popular : obj → Prop
axiom BingeWatch : obj → Prop
axiom Download : obj → Prop
axiom Share : obj → Prop  -- Karen shares the show with Lisa

-- Context axioms
axiom popular_ST : Popular StrangerThings
axiom popular_implies_binge : ∀ x : obj, Popular x → BingeWatch x
axiom binge_iff_download : ∀ x : obj, BingeWatch x ↔ Download x
axiom no_download_BM : ¬ Download BlackMirror
axiom binge_implies_share : ∀ x : obj, BingeWatch x → Share x

-- Proving Karen shares "Stranger Things" with Lisa
theorem share_ST : Share StrangerThings := by
  -- Karen binge-watches "Stranger Things" because it's popular
  have binge_ST : BingeWatch StrangerThings := popular_implies_binge StrangerThings popular_ST
  -- Binge-watching implies sharing with Lisa
  exact binge_implies_share StrangerThings binge_ST
</lean>

The proof is successful without using the information about "Black Mirror", confirming the statement is true.

ANSWER: True
