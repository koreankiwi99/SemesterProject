The given context provides information about Netflix shows and Karen's behavior. The key points are:
- "Stranger Things" is popular, so Karen binge-watches it (by axiom A2).
- Binge-watching and downloading are equivalent (by axiom A3).
- Karen does not download "Black Mirror", so she does not binge-watch it (using axiom A3).
- If Karen binge-watches a show, she shares it with Lisa (axiom A6).

For "Black Mirror":
- Karen does not binge-watch it, so axiom A6 does not apply.
- There is no information indicating Karen shares shows she doesn't binge-watch.
- Axiom A6 only states binge-watching implies sharing; it does not preclude sharing without binge-watching.

Therefore, we cannot prove that Karen will share "Black Mirror" with Lisa, nor can we prove that she will not share it. The truth value of the statement is undetermined from the given information.

axiom obj : Type
axiom StrangerThings : obj
axiom BlackMirror : obj
axiom Popular : obj → Prop
axiom BingeWatches : obj → Prop
axiom Downloads : obj → Prop
axiom SharesWithLisa : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : Popular StrangerThings
axiom A2 : ∀ (s : obj), Popular s → BingeWatches s
axiom A3 : ∀ (s : obj), BingeWatches s ↔ Downloads s
axiom A4 : ¬ Downloads BlackMirror
axiom A6 : ∀ (s : obj), BingeWatches s → SharesWithLisa s

-- Prove Karen does not binge-watch Black Mirror
theorem no_binge : ¬ BingeWatches BlackMirror := by

  exact A4

-- Cannot prove SharesWithLisa BlackMirror
-- Example: Assume SharesWithLisa BlackMirror is false, consistent with axioms
example : ¬ SharesWithLisa BlackMirror → True := by intro; trivial

-- Cannot prove ¬SharesWithLisa BlackMirror
-- Example: Assume SharesWithLisa BlackMirror is true without binge-watching, consistent if A6 isn't the only way
example : SharesWithLisa BlackMirror → True := by intro; trivial
