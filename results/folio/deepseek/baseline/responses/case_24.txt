The context states that Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and that Beijing has hosted the Winter Olympics (without specifying a year). The question asks whether Beijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics. Since the Winter Olympics hosting is not restricted to a specific year, the conjunction holds: Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics (explicitly stated) and hosted at least one Winter Olympics (explicitly stated). Therefore, the statement is true.
