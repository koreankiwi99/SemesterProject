The context explicitly states that "Beijing is located in Northern China." The question asks whether Beijing is located in southern China. While Northern China and southern China are typically understood as distinct regions, the provided context does not include any information about southern China or explicitly state that these regions are mutually exclusive. Without an axiom establishing that a location cannot be in both Northern China and southern China, we cannot prove that Beijing is not in southern China. Conversely, there is no information supporting that Beijing is in southern China. Therefore, neither the statement nor its negation can be proven from the given context.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Beijing : obj
axiom LocatedInNorthernChina : obj → Prop
axiom LocatedInSouthernChina : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : LocatedInNorthernChina Beijing

-- No axiom connecting Northern and Southern China regions
-- Cannot prove LocatedInSouthernChina Beijing or ¬LocatedInSouthernChina Beijing
