The context provides information about Beijing being the capital, its location, hosting Olympics, and having prestigious universities, but it does not mention anything about its size relative to other Chinese cities. There is no information about population rankings, city sizes, or comparisons with other cities like Shanghai or Guangzhou. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Beijing is the second largest Chinese city based solely on the given context.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Beijing : obj
axiom ChineseCity : obj → Prop
axiom SecondLargestChineseCity : obj → Prop

-- Context facts (not relevant to size ranking)
axiom capital : ChineseCity Beijing
axiom hosted_olympics : ChineseCity Beijing
axiom has_universities : ChineseCity Beijing

-- No axioms about city size comparisons exist in context
