The reasoning involves analyzing the given context to determine if James has lunch in the company building. The logical relationships are formalized in Lean, but the proof shows that the available information does not conclusively determine James's lunch location.

<lean>
axiom Employee : Type
constant James : Employee

axiom SchedulesMeeting : Employee → Prop
axiom GoesToBuilding : Employee → Prop
axiom HasLunchInBuilding : Employee → Prop
axiom HasLunchAtHome : Employee → Prop
axiom WorkingRemotely : Employee → Prop
axiom IsManager : Employee → Prop

axiom ax1 : ∀ e, SchedulesMeeting e → GoesToBuilding e
axiom ax2 : ∀ e, HasLunchInBuilding e → SchedulesMeeting e
axiom ax3 : ∀ e, HasLunchInBuilding e ∨ HasLunchAtHome e
axiom ax4 : ∀ e, HasLunchAtHome e → WorkingRemotely e
axiom ax6 : ∀ e, IsManager e → ¬ WorkingRemotely e
axiom ax7 : GoesToBuilding James ↔ IsManager James

-- Neither `HasLunchInBuilding James` nor its negation is provable
-- Example 1: Assume James is a manager
example : IsManager James → HasLunchInBuilding James := by
  intro hMgr
  have hGoes := (ax7.1 hMgr) -- James goes to building
  have noRemote := ax6 James hMgr -- James does not work remotely
  cases ax3 James with
  | inl hLunch => exact hLunch
  | inr hHome =>
      have remote := ax4 James hHome
      contradiction

-- Example 2: Assume James is not a manager
example : ¬ IsManager James → ¬ HasLunchInBuilding James := by
  intro notMgr
  have noGoes : ¬ GoesToBuilding James := ax7.2 notMgr
  intro hLunch
  have meets := ax2 James hLunch
  have goes := ax1 James meets
  contradiction

-- Since James's manager status is unknown, the lunch location is undetermined
</lean>

The Lean code shows:
- If James is a manager, he must have lunch in the building (to avoid contradicting the "no remote work" rule).
- If James is not a manager, he cannot have lunch in the building (to avoid forcing an appearance at the building).
Since the context does not specify James's manager status, neither outcome is provable. Hence, the statement "James has lunch in the company" is uncertain.

ITERATION 2

The errors in the original Lean code were due to missing type annotations for the universally quantified employees (`e`) in the axioms. By adding `: Employee` to each `∀ e` quantifier, the type inference is resolved. The corrected code demonstrates:

1. If James is a manager:
   - He must appear at the building (ax7)
   - Managers cannot work remotely (ax6)
   - If he had lunch at home, he'd be working remotely (ax4) - contradiction
   - Thus, he must have lunch in the building (from ax3)

2. If James is not a manager:
   - He does not appear at the building (ax7)
   - If he had lunch in the building, he would:
     * Schedule meetings (ax2)
     * Appear at the building (ax1) - contradiction
   - Thus, he cannot have lunch in the building

Since the axioms don't specify James's manager status, neither conclusion can be proven unconditionally. Therefore, the statement "James has lunch in the company" is uncertain.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect usage of the biconditional axiom `ax7`. Specifically:
1. For `ax7 : GoesToBuilding James ↔ IsManager James`:
   - `ax7.mp` proves `GoesToBuilding James → IsManager James`
   - `ax7.mpr` proves `IsManager James → GoesToBuilding James`
2. The original code used nonexistent projections `.1`/`.2` instead of `.mp`/`.mpr`
3. The second theorem incorrectly tried to apply `ax7.2` to a negation

The corrected code properly uses:
- `ax7.mpr` to derive building access from manager status
- Contraposition to derive absence of building access from non-manager status

-- Neither HasLunchInBuilding James nor its negation is unconditionally provable
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**
- **If James is a manager**: 
  - He goes to the building (ax7.mpr)
  - Cannot work remotely (ax6)
  - If he lunched at home, he'd be remote (ax4) → contradiction
  - Thus must lunch in building (ax3)
- **If James is not a manager**:
  - If he lunched in building, he'd schedule meetings (ax2)
  - Thus go to building (ax1)
  - But then he'd be a manager (ax7.mp) → contradiction
  - Thus cannot lunch in building

Since manager status is unknown, lunch location is undetermined.
