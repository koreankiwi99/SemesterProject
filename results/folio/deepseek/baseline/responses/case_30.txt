The information provided does not allow us to conclusively determine whether Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion. Here's why:

1. Djokovic is at the mixer, so he must be either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor (or both).
2. If Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion:
   - He must be a professional tennis player → athlete → famous
   - Given the specific condition about Djokovic, if he is a famous athlete, he must be well-paid
3. If Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor:
   - He must be a celebrity → well-paid
   - But this path doesn't require him to be a Grand Slam champion

The axioms don't provide any information that would:
- Force Djokovic to be a Grand Slam champion
- Prevent Djokovic from being an Oscar-nominated actor instead
- Establish mutual exclusivity between the two categories

Therefore, while we can deduce that Djokovic must be famous and well-paid regardless of which category he falls into, we cannot determine his specific status as a Grand Slam champion.
