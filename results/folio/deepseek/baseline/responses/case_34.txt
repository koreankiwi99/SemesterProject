Based on the given context, I model the entities and relationships as follows:

<lean>
axiom entity : Type
axiom diamond_mine : entity
axiom roderick_strong : entity
axiom creed_brothers : entity
axiom ivy_nile : entity
axiom imperium : entity

axiom leads : entity → entity → Prop
axiom includes : entity → entity → Prop
axiom feuds_with : entity → entity → Prop

axiom T1 : leads roderick_strong diamond_mine
axiom T2 : includes diamond_mine creed_brothers
axiom T3 : includes diamond_mine ivy_nile
axiom T4 : feuds_with imperium diamond_mine

-- No axiom connecting "leads stable" to "leads included subgroups/members"
theorem question : leads roderick_strong creed_brothers := by
  -- Cannot prove from given axioms
  sorry

-- Also cannot prove negation since no contradictory information exists
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

Explanation:
- While Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine and Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers, there's no explicit axiom stating that leading a stable implies leading every included subgroup or member.
- Without such a connecting axiom, we cannot prove that Strong leads the Creed Brothers.
- The negation also cannot be proven as there's no information contradicting the possibility.
- The feud with Imperium is irrelevant to the leadership question.
