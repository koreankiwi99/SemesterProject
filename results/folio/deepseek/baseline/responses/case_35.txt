The context states that Diamond Mine includes Ivy Nile and Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine. Therefore, Imperium has a feud with a stable (Diamond Mine) that includes Ivy Nile. The statement "Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile" is false because such a feud exists.

axiom Stable : Type

axiom Imperium : Stable
axiom IvyNile : Wrestler
axiom includes : Stable → Wrestler → Prop
axiom hasFeud : Stable → Stable → Prop

axiom includes_DM_Ivy : includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom feud_Imp_DM : hasFeud Imperium DiamondMine

  by
    apply Exists.intro DiamondMine
    constructor
    . exact feud_Imp_DM
    . exact includes_DM_Ivy

-- This proves ∃ s, hasFeud Imperium s ∧ includes s IvyNile
-- Therefore, the negation (the statement) is false.
