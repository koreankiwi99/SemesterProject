The context provides:
- Symphony No. 9 is a music piece.
- Vienna Music Society premiered Symphony No. 9.
- Vienna Music Society is an orchestra.

This directly shows that Vienna Music Society (an orchestra) premiered Symphony No. 9 (a music piece). Therefore, there exists at least one orchestra (Vienna Music Society) that premiered at least one music piece (Symphony No. 9). The other statements about Beethoven and conductors are irrelevant to this conclusion.
