The provided context does not determine whether James is a manager or whether he goes to the building. This leads to two possible scenarios:

1. If James is a manager, then:
   - He goes to the building (by A7)
   - He cannot work remotely (by A6)
   - Therefore, he cannot have lunch at home (since that implies remote work by A4)
   - So he must have lunch in the building

2. If James is not a manager, then:
   - He does not go to the building (by A7)
   - If he had lunch in the building, he would schedule meetings (by A2) and thus go to the building (by A1), contradicting ¬go_to_building James
   - Therefore, he must have lunch at home

Since there is no information about James's manager status or whether he goes to the building, the statement "James does not have lunch in the company" cannot be definitively proven or disproven.

<lean>
axiom Employee : Type
axiom James : Employee
axiom schedules_meeting : Employee → Prop
axiom go_to_building : Employee → Prop
axiom lunch_in_building : Employee → Prop
axiom lunch_at_home : Employee → Prop
axiom remote : Employee → Prop
axiom manager : Employee → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ e, schedules_meeting e → go_to_building e
axiom A2 : ∀ e, lunch_in_building e → schedules_meeting e
axiom A3 : ∀ e, lunch_in_building e ∨ lunch_at_home e
axiom A4 : ∀ e, lunch_at_home e → remote e
axiom A6 : ∀ e, manager e → ¬ remote e
axiom A7 : go_to_building James ↔ manager James

-- The statement to evaluate: ¬lunch_in_building James
-- We cannot prove or disprove it from the axioms
