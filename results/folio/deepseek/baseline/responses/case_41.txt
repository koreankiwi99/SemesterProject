The context provides information about design styles that Max adores and their properties. The reasoning shows that for any design style adored by Max, it must be either Zaha Hadid's or Kelly Wearstler's style. However, Zaha Hadid styles adored by Max lead to a contradiction due to the axioms (this style cannot both have and not have interesting geometries). Thus, any style adored by Max must be Kelly Wearstler's style, meaning it is both evocative and dreamy. Therefore, for any design style adored by Max, it is either evocative or dreamy. The query statement "A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy" is interpreted as referring to designs (styles) adored by Max, based on the given context.

-- All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A1 : ∀ s : obj, ZahaHadid s ∧ Adores s → InterestingGeometries s

-- No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A2 : ∀ s : obj, Brutalist s ∧ Adores s → ¬ InterestingGeometries s

-- Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's or Kelly Wearstler's.
axiom A3 : ∀ s : obj, Adores s → ZahaHadid s ∨ Wearstler s

-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
axiom A4 : ∀ s : obj, Wearstler s ∧ Adores s → Evocative s

-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
axiom A5 : ∀ s : obj, Wearstler s ∧ Adores s → Dreamy s

-- If a design (style) adored by Max has interesting geometries, then it is brutalist and evocative.
axiom A6 : ∀ s : obj, Adores s ∧ InterestingGeometries s → Brutalist s ∧ Evocative s
