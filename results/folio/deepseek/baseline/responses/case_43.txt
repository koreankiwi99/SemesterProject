The reasoning involves determining if Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal based on the given context. The key points are:

1. Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.
2. All players are either female or male.
3. All female players lost to Iga Świątek (and are WTA highly ranked per axiom).
4. All male players lost to Rafael Nadal.
5. If Coco is WTA highly ranked or lost to Rafael, then they are not male.

Through reasoning:
- Assuming Coco is male leads to a contradiction (due to axiom 5 and the loss to Rafael).
- Thus, Coco must be female, has lost to Iga, and is WTA highly ranked.
- However, there's no information forcing or preventing Coco (female) from losing to Rafael. The context does not specify that female players cannot play against male players, so the possibility of such a loss remains open but unconfirmed.

Therefore, it is uncertain whether Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal.
