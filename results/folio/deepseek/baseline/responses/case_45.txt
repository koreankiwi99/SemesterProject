The context states that all cats are mammals and some pets are not mammals. The question asks whether "No pets are cats" is true, false, or uncertain based on this information.

- From "all cats are mammals", any cat must be a mammal.
- From "some pets are not mammals", there exists at least one pet that is not a mammal, and therefore cannot be a cat (since cats are mammals).
- However, this does not preclude the possibility that some pets are mammals and could potentially be cats. The context does not provide information about whether any pets are cats or whether all non-mammalian pets exhaust the entire pet category.
- Thus, "No pets are cats" (i.e., all pets are not cats) cannot be proven true or false from the given information.

Lean formalization:
<lean>
axiom U : Type
axiom Cat : U → Prop
axiom Mammal : U → Prop
axiom Pet : U → Prop

axiom all_cats_mammals : ∀ x, Cat x → Mammal x
axiom some_pet_not_mammal : ∃ x, Pet x ∧ ¬ Mammal x

-- The statement "No pets are cats" is: ∀ x, Pet x → ¬ Cat x
-- We cannot prove this universal statement because:
--   We know ∃ x, Pet x ∧ ¬ Mammal x, and for such x, ¬ Cat x (since if Cat x then Mammal x, contradiction).
--   But for other x that are Pet and Mammal, we don't know if they could be Cat.
-- We also cannot prove the negation (∃ x, Pet x ∧ Cat x) from the axioms.
