The reasoning shows that assuming "1984 is a streaming service" leads to a contradiction. Specifically:
- If 1984 is a streaming service (by axiom 5), it must be a hardcover book.
- As a hardcover book (by axiom 4), it is printed text.
- As printed text (by axiom 2), it is analog media.
- But as a streaming service (by axiom 3), it is digital media.
- By axiom 1, digital media cannot be analog, contradicting the analog conclusion.

Thus, "1984 is a streaming service" must be false.
