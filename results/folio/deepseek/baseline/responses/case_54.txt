The context establishes that Robert Lewandowski is a striker and that all strikers are soccer players. The information about leaving Bayern Munchen and no longer playing for them does not affect the property of being a soccer player, as that is defined by the position (striker) rather than team affiliation.

axiom obj : Type
axiom RobertLewandowski : obj

axiom Striker : obj → Prop
axiom SoccerPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom Left : obj → obj → Prop
axiom PlaysFor : obj → obj → Prop

-- Given axioms
axiom T1 : Striker RobertLewandowski
axiom T2 : ∀ x, Striker x → SoccerPlayer x
axiom T3 : Left RobertLewandowski BayernMunchen
axiom R1 : ∀ (player team : obj), Left player team → ¬ PlaysFor player team
