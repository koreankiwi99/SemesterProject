The context states that international students have either an F1 or J1 visa, and F1 visa holders must apply for CPT or OPT to work. Mike is an international student who must apply for CPT if he wants to work. However, there is no information about J1 visa requirements. The requirement for CPT application could apply to both visa types, so we cannot determine Mike's visa type from the given information.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mike : obj
axiom F1 : obj → Prop
axiom J1 : obj → Prop
axiom Work : obj → Prop
axiom ApplyCPT : obj → Prop
axiom ApplyOPT : obj → Prop

axiom visa_types : ∀ x, F1 x ∨ J1 x
axiom F1_work_rule : ∀ x, F1 x → (Work x → ApplyCPT x ∨ ApplyOPT x)
axiom mike_rule : Work Mike → ApplyCPT Mike

-- Cannot prove F1 Mike or ¬F1 Mike from the axioms
