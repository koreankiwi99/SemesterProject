Based on the context and reasoning, the Lean code is structured as follows:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom BrownSwiss : obj → Prop
axiom Cow : obj → Prop
axiom Pet : obj → Prop
axiom Domesticated : obj → Prop
axiom Alligator : obj → Prop
axiom Ted : obj

-- All Brown Swiss cattle are cows
axiom A1 : ∀ x, BrownSwiss x → Cow x
-- Some pets are Brown Swiss cattle
axiom A2 : ∃ x, Pet x ∧ BrownSwiss x
-- All cows are domesticated animals
axiom A3 : ∀ x, Cow x → Domesticated x
-- Alligators are not domesticated animals
axiom A4 : ∀ x, Alligator x → ¬ Domesticated x
-- Ted is an alligator
axiom A5 : Alligator Ted

-- We cannot prove Pet Ted
-- We cannot prove ¬Pet Ted either
-- Reasoning:
-- 1. Ted is an alligator → ¬Domesticated Ted (by A4 and A5)
-- 2. Some pet exists that is BrownSwiss (by A2), which implies:
--    ∃ x, Pet x ∧ BrownSwiss x → Cow x → Domesticated x (via A1 and A3)
-- 3. However, no axiom links alligators to pet status:
--    - A4 only denies domestication, not pet status
--    - A2 doesn't require all pets to be domesticated
--    - Ted being undomesticated doesn't prevent him from being a pet
--    - No axiom says "all pets are domesticated" or "alligators can't be pets"
