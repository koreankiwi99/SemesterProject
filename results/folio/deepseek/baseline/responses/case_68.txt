The context states that "The Working title 'The Secret Dude Society' was used for Badults" and "Andrew Collins was the script editor for Badults." Therefore, Badults is a series with the working title "The Secret Dude Society," and Andrew Collins was its script editor. This directly supports the statement that Andrew Collins was the script editor for a series with that working title.
