The context states that Badults stars members of Pappy's and was piloted on BBC Three. This directly contradicts the statement that "No members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three" because at least one show (Badults) starring members of Pappy's piloted on BBC Three. Therefore, the statement is false.

The compilation error occurred because the proof incorrectly used `left` when attempting to prove the disjunction `pilotedOn s BBC_Two ∨ pilotedOn s BBC_Three`. Since `badults_piloted` provides evidence for `pilotedOn Badults BBC_Three`, the correct approach is to use `right` followed by `exact badults_piloted` to select the right disjunct of the OR statement.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Show : Type
axiom Channel : Type
axiom BBC_Two : Channel
axiom BBC_Three : Channel

axiom Pappys : Person → Prop
axiom starredIn : Person → Show → Prop
axiom pilotedOn : Show → Channel → Prop

axiom Badults : Show
axiom badults_piloted : pilotedOn Badults BBC_Three
axiom stars_members : ∃ p : Person, Pappys p ∧ starredIn p Badults

theorem not_no_members : 
    ¬ (∀ p : Person, Pappys p → ¬ ∃ s : Show, starredIn p s ∧ (pilotedOn s BBC_Two ∨ pilotedOn s BBC_Three)) := 
  by
  intro h
  rcases stars_members with ⟨p, hp, hstar⟩
  have hcontra := h p hp
  apply hcontra
  exists Badults
  constructor
  · exact hstar
  · right
    exact badults_piloted
</lean>

**Explanation of the proof:**
1. We assume the universal claim `h` (that no Pappy's member starred in shows piloted on BBC Two/Three).
2. From `stars_members`, we obtain a specific person `p` in Pappy's who starred in Badults.
3. Applying `h` to `p` gives `hcontra`, which claims no such show exists for `p`.
4. We contradict `hcontra` by proving there exists a show (Badults) where:
   - `p` starred in it (`hstar`)
   - It piloted on BBC Three (`badults_piloted`), using `right` to select the correct OR branch.

The context states that Badults (starring Pappy's members) piloted on BBC Three, directly contradicting the claim that "no members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three". Therefore, the statement is false.
