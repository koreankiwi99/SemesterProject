The statement to evaluate is: "KO is a stock and a growth stock."

From the context:
1. All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.  
   (∀x, GrowthStock x → BoughtForProfit x)
2. If a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.  
   (∀x, BoughtForProfit x → ¬SuitableForRetirement x)
3. Some stocks are growth stocks.  
   (∃x, Stock x ∧ GrowthStock x)
4. All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.  
   (∀x, MatureStock x → SuitableForRetirement x)
5. KO is a mature stock.  
   (MatureStock KO)

Analysis:
- From (5) and (4), KO is suitable for a retirement fund (SuitableForRetirement KO).
- If KO were a growth stock, then by (1) it would be bought for profit (BoughtForProfit KO), and by (2) it would not be suitable for a retirement fund, contradicting the above.
- Thus, KO cannot be a growth stock: ¬GrowthStock KO.
- The statement requires KO to be both a stock and a growth stock. Since KO is not a growth stock, the conjunction is false regardless of whether KO is a stock (as one conjunct is false).

In Lean, we formalize the predicates and prove the negation of the statement.

The Lean proof shows the statement "KO is a stock and a growth stock" is false. Thus, the answer is False.

ANSWER: False

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors in the previous Lean code were related to the `¬` operator in axiom A2. Lean parsed `¬ SuitableForRetirement x` as `(¬ SuitableForRetirement) x` instead of `¬ (SuitableForRetirement x)`, causing a type mismatch. Adding parentheses around `SuitableForRetirement x` resolves this issue. The logic remains unchanged - KO is proven not to be a growth stock, making the statement "KO is a stock and a growth stock" false.

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Stock : obj → Prop
axiom GrowthStock : obj → Prop
axiom MatureStock : obj → Prop
axiom BoughtForProfit : obj → Prop
axiom SuitableForRetirement : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, GrowthStock x → BoughtForProfit x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, BoughtForProfit x → ¬ (SuitableForRetirement x)
axiom A3 : ∃ x, Stock x ∧ GrowthStock x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, MatureStock x → SuitableForRetirement x

constant KO : obj
axiom A5 : MatureStock KO

theorem not_growth_KO : ¬ GrowthStock KO := by
  intro h
  have h1 : BoughtForProfit KO := A1 KO h
  have h2 : ¬ SuitableForRetirement KO := A2 KO h1
  have h3 : SuitableForRetirement KO := A4 KO A5
  apply h2 h3

theorem false_statement : ¬ (Stock KO ∧ GrowthStock KO) :=
  fun ⟨_, hg⟩ => not_growth_KO hg
</lean>

The proof shows:
1. `not_growth_KO` proves KO is not a growth stock using:
   - A1: Growth stocks are bought for profit (contrapose: growth → profit)
   - A2: Stocks bought for profit aren't retirement-suitable (profit → ¬suitable)
   - A4: Mature stocks are retirement-suitable (mature → suitable)
   - A5: KO is mature
   → Contradiction if KO were a growth stock

2. `false_statement` proves the negation of "KO is stock ∧ growth stock" by:
   - Taking the growth stock case to `not_growth_KO`
   - The stock status is irrelevant since one conjunct is false

ANSWER: False

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to missing type annotations for quantified variables. In Lean, explicit type annotations are required for variables in axioms to resolve ambiguities. The corrected code adds `(x : obj)` to all quantified variables, ensuring proper type inference. The logic remains unchanged: KO is proven not to be a growth stock, making the statement "KO is a stock and a growth stock" false.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Stock : obj → Prop
axiom GrowthStock : obj → Prop
axiom MatureStock : obj → Prop
axiom BoughtForProfit : obj → Prop
axiom SuitableForRetirement : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ (x : obj), GrowthStock x → BoughtForProfit x
axiom A2 : ∀ (x : obj), BoughtForProfit x → ¬ (SuitableForRetirement x)
axiom A3 : ∃ (x : obj), Stock x ∧ GrowthStock x
axiom A4 : ∀ (x : obj), MatureStock x → SuitableForRetirement x

constant KO : obj
axiom A5 : MatureStock KO

theorem not_growth_KO : ¬ GrowthStock KO := by
  intro h
  have h1 : BoughtForProfit KO := A1 KO h
  have h2 : ¬ SuitableForRetirement KO := A2 KO h1
  have h3 : SuitableForRetirement KO := A4 KO A5
  exact h2 h3

theorem false_statement : ¬ (Stock KO ∧ GrowthStock KO) :=
  fun ⟨_, hg⟩ => not_growth_KO hg
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**  
1. `not_growth_KO` proves KO cannot be a growth stock:  
   - If KO were a growth stock (assumption `h`),  
   - A1 implies KO is bought for profit (`h1`),  
   - A2 implies KO is not retirement-suitable (`h2`),  
   - But A4+A5 prove KO is retirement-suitable (`h3`),  
   - Contradiction (`h2 h3`).  
2. `false_statement` negates the conjunction:  
   - The growth stock component (`hg`) directly contradicts `not_growth_KO`.

ANSWER: False
