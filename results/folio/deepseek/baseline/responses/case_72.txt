ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The reasoning involves analyzing the given statements and the provided conclusion about the stock KO. The context establishes:

1. All growth stocks are bought for rapid price appreciation.
2. If a stock is bought for rapid price appreciation, it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
3. Some stocks are growth stocks.
4. All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
5. KO is a mature stock.

The statement to evaluate is:  
If KO is a growth stock or bought for rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor volatile.

Key insights:
- KO is a mature stock (A5), so it is suitable for a retirement fund (via A4).
- If KO were a growth stock, it would be bought for rapid price appreciation (A1), making it unsuitable for a retirement fund (A2), contradicting its maturity-based suitability.
- Similarly, if KO were bought for rapid price appreciation, it would be unsuitable for retirement (A2), again contradicting A4.
- Thus, the antecedent (KO being a growth stock or bought for appreciation) is **false**, making the entire implication **true** regardless of the consequent.

The Lean code models these relationships and proves the result. Volatility is included for symmetry with the statement but is irrelevant to the proof.
