Based on the given context, we formalize the entities and predicates in Lean and prove the statement.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom DriedThaiChilies : obj
axiom BakedSweet : obj → Prop
axiom Spicy : obj → Prop
axiom Cupcake : obj → Prop
axiom MalaHotpot : obj → Prop
axiom BakedByMelissa : obj → Prop

axiom no_baked_spicy : ∀ x, BakedSweet x → ¬ Spicy x
axiom all_cupcakes_baked : ∀ x, Cupcake x → BakedSweet x
axiom all_mala_spicy : ∀ x, MalaHotpot x → Spicy x
axiom all_bbm_cupcakes : ∀ x, BakedByMelissa x → Cupcake x
axiom dtc_property : Spicy DriedThaiChilies ∨ MalaHotpot DriedThaiChilies ∨ ¬ BakedSweet DriedThaiChilies

theorem result : ¬ BakedByMelissa DriedThaiChilies ∧ ¬ BakedSweet DriedThaiChilies := by
  -- First prove ¬BakedSweet DriedThaiChilies
  have no_bs : ¬ BakedSweet DriedThaiChilies := by
    intro h
    cases dtc_property with
    | inl spicy => exact no_baked_spicy DriedThaiChilies h spicy
    | inr mala_or_not =>
      cases mala_or_not with
      | inl mala => exact no_baked_spicy DriedThaiChilies h (all_mala_spicy DriedThaiChilies mala)
      | inr not_bs => exact not_bs h
  -- Now prove ¬BakedByMelissa DriedThaiChilies
  have no_bbm : ¬ BakedByMelissa DriedThaiChilies := by
    intro h
    have cupcake := all_bbm_cupcakes DriedThaiChilies h
    have baked := all_cupcakes_baked DriedThaiChilies cupcake
    exact no_bs baked
  exact ⟨no_bbm, no_bs⟩
</lean>

The Lean proof demonstrates that the statement "Dried Thai chilies are neither products of Baked by Melissa nor baked sweets" is true. The proof shows:
1. ¬BakedSweet(DriedThaiChilies) is established by case analysis of the disjunction (spicy/mala/¬baked), where both spicy cases contradict "no baked sweets are spicy".
2. ¬BakedByMelissa(DriedThaiChilies) follows because if it were true, it would imply baked sweet via cupcake, contradicting the first result.

ANSWER: True
