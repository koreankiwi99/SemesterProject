The context states:
1. Every NLP task is either a language generation task or a language understanding task.
2. If an NLP task outputs a text sequence, it is a language generation task.
3. Machine translation is an NLP task.
4. Machine translation outputs a text sequence.

From axiom 2 and 4: Since machine translation outputs a text sequence, it must be a language generation task. This directly follows from the conditional statement. The first axiom (about tasks being either generation or understanding) is not needed for this proof, as the second axiom provides a sufficient condition for generation tasks.

<lean>
axiom Task : Type
axiom Gen : Task → Prop
axiom Under : Task → Prop
axiom output_text : Task → Prop
axiom MT : Task
axiom R1 : ∀ t : Task, output_text t → Gen t
axiom T1 : output_text MT
theorem mt_gen : Gen MT := by apply R1 MT T1
</lean>

The theorem `Gen MT` is proven using `R1` (axiom 2) applied to `MT` with evidence `T1` (axiom 4). Therefore, the statement "Machine translation is a language generation task" is true.

ITERATION 2

The compilation error occurred because `Task` is a reserved keyword in Lean (related to asynchronous programming). To fix this, I renamed the type to `NLPTask` to avoid conflicts.

Corrected Lean code:
<lean>
axiom NLPTask : Type
axiom Gen : NLPTask → Prop
axiom Under : NLPTask → Prop
axiom output_text : NLPTask → Prop
axiom MT : NLPTask
axiom R1 : ∀ t : NLPTask, output_text t → Gen t
axiom T1 : output_text MT
theorem mt_gen : Gen MT := by apply R1 MT T1
</lean>

The proof demonstrates that machine translation is a language generation task:
1. `R1` states that any task with text output is a generation task
2. `T1` confirms machine translation has text output
3. Applying `R1` to `MT` with evidence `T1` proves the theorem

ANSWER: True
