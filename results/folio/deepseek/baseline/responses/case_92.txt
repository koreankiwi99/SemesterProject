The reasoning involves determining if Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden based on the given context. The key points are:

- The Olive Garden is a managed building with monthly rent of $2000.
- Security deposit at any managed building is at least the monthly rent, so at Olive Garden it is ≥ $2000.
- $2000 > $1500, so the security deposit at Olive Garden is > $1500.
- Tom will rent in a managed building only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy and the security deposit ≤ $1500.
- Since the deposit condition fails (> $1500), Tom's renting condition is not satisfied for Olive Garden.
- However, the context does not state that Tom will *only* rent when these conditions are met. It provides a sufficient condition but not a necessary one. There might be other unstated reasons for Tom to rent.
- No information forces Tom to rent or not rent at Olive Garden when the condition fails.

Thus, it is impossible to prove that Tom will rent at Olive Garden or that he will not. The result is uncertain.

The compilation error occurred because Lean couldn't resolve the typeclass instance for the comparison operators (≤, ≥) due to metavariables. The solution involves:

1. Using `Nat` instead of `ℕ` for natural numbers
2. Adding explicit axioms for number comparisons
3. Modeling all entities and relationships from the context

The corrected Lean code properly represents:
- Managed buildings and their properties
- Rent/deposit amounts as natural numbers
- Tom's rental conditions
- Pet policy implications

Key insights:
1. Olive Garden's deposit is ≥ $2000 (from deposit_ge_rent)
2. $2000 > $1500 (explicit axiom)
3. Tom requires deposit ≤ $1500 AND Fluffy allowance
4. Deposit condition fails ($2000 > $1500 → deposit > $1500)
5. But we don't know if Tom rents when conditions fail
6. We also don't know Olive Garden's pet policy

Thus we can neither prove Tom will rent nor that he won't rent.
