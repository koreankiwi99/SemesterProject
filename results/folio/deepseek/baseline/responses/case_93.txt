The context states that pets are allowed in some managed buildings, but it does not specify whether The Olive Garden allows pets. The rule about moving in with pets only applies if the building allows pets. Since we don't know the pet policy of The Olive Garden, we cannot determine whether Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy. Additionally, the deposit requirement and Tom's rental conditions do not provide information about the pet policy.

axiom ManagedBuilding : Type
axiom Pet : Type
axiom Fluffy : Pet
axiom OliveGarden : ManagedBuilding
axiom AllowsPets : ManagedBuilding → Prop
axiom monthlyRent : ManagedBuilding → Nat
axiom securityDeposit : ManagedBuilding → Nat
axiom AllowedToMoveInWith : ManagedBuilding → Pet → Prop

axiom allows_pets_some : ∃ b : ManagedBuilding, AllowsPets b
axiom deposit_ge_rent : ∀ b : ManagedBuilding, securityDeposit b ≥ monthlyRent b
axiom rent_OliveGarden : monthlyRent OliveGarden = 2000
axiom move_in_rule : ∀ b : ManagedBuilding, AllowsPets b → ∀ p : Pet, AllowedToMoveInWith b p

-- No information about whether OliveGarden allows pets
-- Cannot prove AllowedToMoveInWith OliveGarden Fluffy or its negation
