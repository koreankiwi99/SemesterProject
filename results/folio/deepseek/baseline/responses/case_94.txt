The context states that the security deposit at a managed building is at least the monthly rent. Since the Olive Garden is a managed building with a monthly rent of $2000, the security deposit must be $2000 or more. This is directly provable from the given axioms.

<lean>
axiom Building : Type
axiom Person : Type
axiom Pet : Type
axiom Tom : Person
axiom Fluffy : Pet
axiom OliveGarden : Building

axiom Managed : Building → Prop
axiom MonthlyRent : Building → Nat
axiom SecurityDeposit : Building → Nat
axiom deposit_rule : ∀ b : Building, Managed b → SecurityDeposit b ≥ MonthlyRent b
axiom olive_managed : Managed OliveGarden
axiom olive_rent : MonthlyRent OliveGarden = 2000

theorem security_deposit_OG : SecurityDeposit OliveGarden ≥ 2000 := by
  have h := deposit_rule OliveGarden olive_managed
  rw [olive_rent] at h
  exact h
</lean>

ANSWER: True
