Based on the given context and question, I will formalize the reasoning in Lean and then determine whether "Harry is a queen bee" is true, false, or uncertain.

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom Harry : Animal
axiom Invertebrate : Animal → Prop
axiom Vertebrate : Animal → Prop
axiom HasBackbone : Animal → Prop
axiom ReproduceByMating : Animal → Prop
axiom Bee : Animal → Prop
axiom QueenBee : Animal → Prop

-- Axioms from context:
axiom animal_classification : ∀ a : Animal, Invertebrate a ∨ Vertebrate a
axiom backbone_reproduction : ∀ a : Animal, HasBackbone a → ReproduceByMating a
axiom vertebrate_backbone : ∀ a : Animal, Vertebrate a → HasBackbone a
axiom bee_no_mating : ∀ a : Animal, Bee a → ¬ ReproduceByMating a
axiom queenbee_bee : ∀ a : Animal, QueenBee a → Bee a
axiom harry_bee : Bee Harry

-- We cannot prove QueenBee Harry or ¬QueenBee Harry from the axioms
</lean>

**Analysis:**
1. From `harry_bee` and `bee_no_mating`, Harry does not reproduce by mating: `¬ReproduceByMating Harry`.
2. From `backbone_reproduction`, if Harry had a backbone, he would reproduce by mating. Since he doesn't, Harry has no backbone: `¬HasBackbone Harry`.
3. From `vertebrate_backbone`, if Harry were vertebrate, he would have a backbone. Since he doesn't, Harry is not vertebrate: `¬Vertebrate Harry`.
4. From `animal_classification`, Harry must be invertebrate (since he's not vertebrate).
5. However, there are no axioms linking bee/queen bee status to invertebrate/vertebrate classification or any other distinguishing properties.
6. We know queen bees are bees (`queenbee_bee`), but not all bees are queen bees. There is no information to confirm or deny Harry's queen bee status.

**Conclusion:** The statement "Harry is a queen bee" is uncertain based on the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain
