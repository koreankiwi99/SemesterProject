The premises state that Tom is a wild turkey and specifically deny that Tom is any of the first five types (Eastern, Osceola, Gould's, Merriam's, Rio Grande). The conclusion claims Tom is an Eastern wild turkey. Since the premises directly contradict this conclusion via axiom `T1`, we can prove the negation of the conclusion. Thus, the statement "Tom is an Eastern wild turkey" is false.

<lean>
inductive TurkeyType where
  | Eastern
  | Osceola
  | Gould
  | Merriam
  | RioGrande
  | Ocellated

axiom Tom : TurkeyType

axiom T1 : Tom ≠ TurkeyType.Eastern
axiom T2 : Tom ≠ TurkeyType.Osceola
axiom T3 : Tom ≠ TurkeyType.Gould
axiom T4 : Tom ≠ TurkeyType.Merriam ∧ Tom ≠ TurkeyType.RioGrande

theorem tom_not_eastern : ¬(Tom = TurkeyType.Eastern) := T1
</lean>

ANSWER: False
