The context explicitly states that the GRE test costs $205, which is cheaper than $300. This directly establishes that the cost is below $300. The additional information about Tom's financial situation and ETS aid is irrelevant to the fixed cost of the test. Therefore, the statement "It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test" is true, and its negation cannot be proven from the premises.

<lean>
axiom GRE_cost : Nat
axiom cost_fact : GRE_cost = 205

-- Attempt to prove negation: ¬(GRE_cost < 300) ≡ GRE_cost ≥ 300
-- Substituting GRE_cost = 205: 205 ≥ 300 → false
-- No axioms support 205 ≥ 300; computation proves 205 < 300
-- Therefore, negation is unprovable
