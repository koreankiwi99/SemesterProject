The context provides information about Tom and the types of wild turkeys, but does not mention Joey. While Tom is a wild turkey that does not belong to any of the six listed types, this does not imply anything about Joey. There is no information connecting Joey to the predicates or entities in the context. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that Joey is not a wild turkey.

<lean>
axiom Turkey : Type
axiom Tom : Turkey
axiom Joey : Turkey
axiom IsWildTurkey : Turkey → Prop
axiom Eastern : Turkey → Prop
axiom Osceola : Turkey → Prop
axiom Gould : Turkey → Prop
axiom Merriam : Turkey → Prop
axiom RioGrande : Turkey → Prop
axiom Ocellated : Turkey → Prop

axiom A1 : ¬ Eastern Tom
axiom A2 : ¬ Osceola Tom
axiom A3 : ¬ Gould Tom
axiom A4 : ¬ Merriam Tom ∧ ¬ RioGrande Tom
axiom A5 : IsWildTurkey Tom

-- No information about Joey exists in the premises
-- Cannot prove ¬IsWildTurkey Joey
