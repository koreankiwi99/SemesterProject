The premises state that all fir trees are evergreens and that some objects of worship are fir trees. The conclusion claims that some evergreens are not objects of worship. To prove this conclusion false, we would need to show that every evergreen is an object of worship. However, the premises only guarantee that fir trees (which are evergreens) exist among objects of worship, but do not preclude the existence of non-fir-tree evergreens that are not worshipped. Thus, we cannot prove the negation of the conclusion from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom FirTree : obj → Prop
axiom Evergreen : obj → Prop
axiom ObjectOfWorship : obj → Prop
axiom all_fir_evergreen : ∀ x, FirTree x → Evergreen x
axiom some_worship_fir : ∃ x, ObjectOfWorship x ∧ FirTree x

-- The conclusion to disprove: ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ObjectOfWorship x
-- Its negation: ∀ x, Evergreen x → ObjectOfWorship x
-- Attempt to prove the negation fails because:
--   We know of at least one worshipped fir tree (which is evergreen),
--   but have no information about non-fir evergreens.

-- Example countermodel: 
--   Let obj have two elements: [a, b]
--   Let FirTree(a) = True, FirTree(b) = False
--   Let Evergreen(a) = True, Evergreen(b) = True
--   Let ObjectOfWorship(a) = True, ObjectOfWorship(b) = False
-- Then:
--   all_fir_evergreen holds (only a is fir and evergreen)
--   some_worship_fir holds (a is worshipped fir)
--   But ∀ x, Evergreen x → ObjectOfWorship x is false (b is evergreen but not worshipped)
