The context provides several premises about men, their heights, blocking abilities, and shooting behaviors. The statement to evaluate is "Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class," meaning there exists a man in Michael's class taller than Peter. To disprove this, we attempt to prove its negation: no man in Michael's class is taller than Peter.

### Key Premises:
1. **Transitivity of Taller**: If x is taller than y and y is taller than z, then x is taller than z.
2. **Michael's Height**: Michael is taller than every other man in his class.
3. **Peter's Height**: Peter is taller than Michael.
4. **Blocking Rules**: 
   - If a man is taller than another, he can block his shooting.
   - Michael can block any man's shooting if the shooter does not jump.
   - Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
5. **Jumping Shooters**: Any shooter who jumps is a great shooter.

### Attempted Proof:
- **Peter's Height Relative to Michael's Class**:  
  Let `m` be any man in Michael's class.  
  - If `m = Michael`, then Peter is taller than Michael (`Taller Peter Michael`).  
  - If `m ≠ Michael`, then Michael is taller than `m` (`Taller Michael m`). By transitivity with `Taller Peter Michael`, we get `Taller Peter m`.  
  Thus, Peter is taller than every man in Michael's class (`Taller Peter m` for all `m` in the class).  

- **Negation of the Statement**:  
  We aim to prove:  
  `∀ m, ClassMember m → Man m → ¬Taller m Peter`  
  (No man `m` in Michael's class is taller than Peter).  

- **Critical Gap**:  
  While we have `Taller Peter m` for all `m`, we **cannot** derive `¬Taller m Peter` because:  
  - The premises lack **asymmetry** of `Taller` (i.e., no axiom states that if `Taller x y`, then `¬Taller y x`).  
  - Without asymmetry, we cannot rule out `Taller m Peter` even when `Taller Peter m` holds.  

- **Blocking Axioms Do Not Help**:  
  The blocking axioms (e.g., `Taller x y → CanBlock x y`) do not introduce asymmetry or contradiction in this context. Windy's case only shows she jumps and is a great shooter, which is unrelated to Peter or height comparisons.  

### Conclusion:
The negation of the statement cannot be proven from the given premises due to the absence of asymmetry in the `Taller` relation. Thus, we cannot conclude that Peter is not shorter than some man in Michael's class.
