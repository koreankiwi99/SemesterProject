The context provides several premises, and the goal is to prove that "Windy is a great shooter" is false (i.e., ¬GreatShooter Windy). However, analysis shows:

1. From axiom A5: ∀ y, ¬JumpWhenShooting y → CanBlock Michael y  
2. From axiom A6: ¬CanBlock Michael Windy  
3. By contraposition on A5: ¬CanBlock Michael Windy → ¬¬JumpWhenShooting Windy  
   This simplifies to: ¬CanBlock Michael Windy → JumpWhenShooting Windy  
4. Thus, JumpWhenShooting Windy (from A6 and the above)  
5. From axiom A7: ∀ x, JumpWhenShooting x → GreatShooter x  
6. Therefore, GreatShooter Windy  

The premises entail GreatShooter Windy, so ¬GreatShooter Windy cannot be proven. The additional axioms (A1-A4) about height and blocking do not provide contradictions or relevant connections to Windy's status.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Michael : Person
axiom Peter : Person
axiom Windy : Person
axiom Taller : Person → Person → Prop
axiom CanBlock : Person → Person → Prop
axiom JumpWhenShooting : Person → Prop
axiom GreatShooter : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x y, Taller x y → CanBlock x y
axiom Class : Person → Prop
axiom Michael_in_class : Class Michael
axiom A2 : ∀ y, Class y → y ≠ Michael → Taller Michael y
axiom A3 : ∀ x y z, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z
axiom A4 : Taller Peter Michael
axiom A5 : ∀ y, ¬ JumpWhenShooting y → CanBlock Michael y
axiom A6 : ¬ CanBlock Michael Windy
axiom A7 : ∀ x, JumpWhenShooting x → GreatShooter x

-- Cannot prove ¬GreatShooter Windy from the axioms
