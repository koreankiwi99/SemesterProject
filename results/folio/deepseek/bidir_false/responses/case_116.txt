The goal is to prove that the negation of the statement "Peter can block Windy's shooting" follows from the premises. After translating the context into Lean axioms, we derive that Windy jumps when shooting (from Michael's inability to block Windy). However, there is no axiom linking Windy's jumping to Peter's blocking ability. The blocking rule (A1) requires both entities to be men and the blocker to be taller. While Peter is a man, Windy's status as a man is unknown, and Peter's height relative to Windy is undetermined (transitivity cannot be applied without knowing Michael's height relative to Windy). Thus, we cannot prove ¬Block Peter Windy.

The compilation error occurred because the `intro` tactic was used incorrectly in the proof of `windy_jumps`. The goal `JumpWhenShooting Windy` is a positive statement, so proof by contradiction should be used instead of `intro`. The corrected proof uses `by_contra` to assume the negation and derive a contradiction.

Regarding the main statement: We cannot prove that Peter cannot block Windy's shooting (¬Block Peter Windy) because:
1. The blocking rule requires both persons to be men, but Windy's status as a man is unknown
2. While Peter is taller than Michael, we don't know Michael's height relative to Windy (Windy may not be in Michael's class)
3. No axioms connect Peter's blocking ability to Windy's jumping behavior

Thus, the negation cannot be proven from the given premises.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred due to an incorrect tactic in the proof of `windy_jumps`. The proof has been corrected using a term-style proof instead of tactics. However, the main issue remains: we cannot prove the negation of "Peter can block Windy's shooting" (¬Block Peter Windy) because:

1. Windy's status as a man is unknown, and the blocking rule requires both parties to be men
2. Peter's height relative to Windy is unknown (we only know Peter > Michael, but Michael's height relative to Windy is undetermined)
3. No axioms connect Peter's blocking ability to Windy's jumping behavior

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Michael : Person
axiom Peter : Person
axiom Windy : Person

axiom Taller : Person → Person → Prop
axiom Block : Person → Person → Prop
axiom JumpWhenShooting : Person → Prop
axiom Shooter : Person → Prop
axiom man : Person → Prop

axiom blocking_rule : ∀ x y, man x → man y → Taller x y → Block x y
axiom transitivity : ∀ x y z, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z
axiom peter_taller_michael : Taller Peter Michael
axiom michael_blocks_non_jumpers : ∀ y, ¬ JumpWhenShooting y → Block Michael y
axiom michael_cannot_block_windy : ¬ Block Michael Windy
axiom windy_shooter : Shooter Windy
axiom jumpers_are_great : ∀ y, Shooter y → JumpWhenShooting y → True
axiom man_michael : man Michael
axiom man_peter : man Peter

-- Corrected proof that Windy jumps when shooting
theorem windy_jumps : JumpWhenShooting Windy := 
  fun h => michael_cannot_block_windy (michael_blocks_non_jumpers Windy h)

-- Still cannot prove ¬Block Peter Windy because:
-- 1. Windy's man-status is unknown (blocking_rule requires both to be men)
-- 2. Peter's height relative to Windy is unknown
-- 3. No axioms connect Peter's blocking to Windy's jumping
