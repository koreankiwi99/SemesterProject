The goal is to prove that the statement "Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica" is false using the given premises. However, after formalizing the context in Lean, we find that:

1. We know Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.
2. We know Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are islands located in the South Shetland Islands.
3. Antarctica is also located in the South Shetland Islands.
4. Transitivity of "located in" is given.

Crucially:
- There is no evidence that any island is located *within* Antarctica (only that both islands and Antarctica are in the South Shetland Islands).
- We cannot derive that Snow Island (or others) are located in Antarctica using transitivity because Antarctica and the islands share a common container (South Shetland) without hierarchical nesting.
- The naming axiom only specifies Barutin Cove is named after Barutin settlement, not that it is exclusively named after it or unrelated to islands.

Thus, we cannot prove the existence of an island in Antarctica that Barutin Cove is *not* named after. The statement might be vacuously true (if no islands exist in Antarctica) or true/false depending on unstated naming properties. The negation cannot be proven from the premises.

-- Statement: Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica (∀ island, Island island → LocatedIn island Antarctica → NamedAfter Barutin_Cove island)
-- We attempt to prove its negation: ∃ island, Island island ∧ LocatedIn island Antarctica ∧ ¬NamedAfter Barutin_Cove island

-- Failure: No axiom proves any island is in Antarctica, and no contradiction in naming is derivable.
