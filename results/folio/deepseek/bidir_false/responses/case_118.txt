The goal is to prove the negation of the statement: "There is at least one cove in Antarctica named after a place in Bulgaria." This requires showing that no such cove exists based on the premises. However, the premises do not provide enough information to conclude that Barutin Cove is in Antarctica or to disprove the existence of other coves meeting the criteria.

- Barutin Cove is a cove named after a Bulgarian place (premise).
- Barutin Cove is located in Snow Island (premise).
- Snow Island is located in the South Shetland Islands (premise).
- Antarctica is also located in the South Shetland Islands (premise).
- The transitivity axiom states that if A is in B and B is in C, then A is in C.

Using transitivity:
- Barutin Cove is in Snow Island, and Snow Island is in the South Shetland Islands, so Barutin Cove is in the South Shetland Islands.
- Antarctica is in the South Shetland Islands.

However, both being in the South Shetland Islands does not imply that Barutin Cove is in Antarctica. They could be distinct regions within the South Shetland Islands. There is no premise stating that Snow Island is part of Antarctica or that all coves in the South Shetland Islands are in Antarctica. Additionally, no other coves are mentioned, so the existence of other coves meeting the criteria cannot be disproven.

Thus, the negation cannot be proven from the given premises.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to the use of `constant` declarations instead of `axiom`, which caused type resolution issues. The corrected code uses `axiom` consistently and removes the unnecessary theorem to avoid proof complications. The premises establish that Barutin Cove is a cove named after a Bulgarian settlement and located in Snow Island, which is part of the South Shetland Islands. Antarctica is also located in the South Shetland Islands, but there is no premise stating that Snow Island (or Barutin Cove) is part of Antarctica or that all coves in the South Shetland Islands are in Antarctica. Additionally, no axioms preclude the existence of other coves meeting the criteria. Therefore, the negation of the statement cannot be proven.
