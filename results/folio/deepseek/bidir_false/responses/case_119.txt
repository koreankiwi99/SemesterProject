The provided context states:
- Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island, interpreted as "Barutin Cove is located in Snow Island".
- Snow Island is located in the South Shetland Islands.
- Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands, interpreted as "Antarctica is located in the South Shetland Islands".
- Transitivity: If A is in B and B is in C, then A is in C.

The statement to evaluate: "Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica". To refute this, we must prove that Barutin Cove **is** located in Antarctica.

Chain of location:
1. Barutin Cove is in Snow Island.
2. Snow Island is in South Shetland Islands → Barutin Cove is in South Shetland Islands (by transitivity).
3. Antarctica is in South Shetland Islands.

This gives:
- Barutin Cove ∈ South Shetland Islands
- Antarctica ∈ South Shetland Islands

No axiom allows chaining locations "downward" from South Shetland Islands to Antarctica. The premises do **not** state that South Shetland Islands is in Antarctica (only the reverse). Thus, we cannot prove that Barutin Cove is in Antarctica.

-- Attempt to prove LocatedIn barutin_cove antarctica (to refute the statement)
example : LocatedIn barutin_cove antarctica := by
  have bc_in_shetland : LocatedIn barutin_cove south_shetland := transitive barutin_cove snow_island south_shetland on_coast snow_in_shetland
  -- Stuck here: antarctica_in_shetland shows Antarctica INSIDE South Shetland, not vice versa.
  -- No axiom links south_shetland to antarctica for reverse containment.
  apply transitive barutin_cove south_shetland antarctica bc_in_shetland ?_  -- Missing: LocatedIn south_shetland antarctica
  admit  -- No such axiom exists, so proof fails

-- Since the goal is unprovable, we conclude Failure
