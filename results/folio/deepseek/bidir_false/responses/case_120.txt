axiom obj : Type
axiom Affection : obj → Prop
axiom Love : obj → Prop
axiom Positive : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Love x
axiom T2 : ∃ x, Love x ∧ Positive x

-- We attempt to prove ¬∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x
-- However, the premises do not force the same object to have both Affection and Positive.
-- We can have:
--   Object a: Affection and Love (from T1) but not Positive
--   Object b: Love and Positive (from T2) but not Affection
-- Thus, we cannot prove that no Affection is Positive.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation of the statement.
