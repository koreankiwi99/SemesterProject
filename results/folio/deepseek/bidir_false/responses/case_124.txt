The reasoning involves analyzing the given premises to determine if the negation of the conclusion "Rock is a monkey" can be proven. The premises are:

1. All of Peter's pets that are mammals are animals.
2. All monkeys are mammals.
3. Peter's pets are either monkeys or birds.
4. Peter's birds can fly.
5. All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
6. If a pet can fly, it has wings.
7. Rock is Peter's pet.
8. Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.

The conclusion to negate is "Rock is a monkey". The Lean formalization shows:
- `Rock` is a constant of type `obj`.
- Predicates include `Pet`, `Mammal`, `Animal`, `Monkey`, `Bird`, `Fly`, `Breathe`, and `HasWings`.
- Axioms correspond to the premises.

Key insights from the analysis:
- From `A3` and `A7`, Rock is either a monkey or a bird.
- If Rock is a monkey, then:
  - It is a mammal (`A2`), hence an animal (`A1`), so it breathes (`A5`).
  - Premise `A8` reduces to "Fly Rock ∨ Bird Rock" (since breathing is true).
  - In both subcases (Bird Rock or not), flying holds (directly from `A4` if a bird, or from the reduced `A8` if not).
  - Thus, Rock flies and has wings (`A6`), but no contradiction arises (monkeys having wings isn't prohibited).
- If Rock is a bird, it flies (`A4`) and has wings (`A6`), but no contradiction occurs.
- The premises do not require monkeys and birds to be disjoint (Rock could be both), and no axiom prohibits a monkey from flying or having wings.

Since assuming "Rock is a monkey" does not lead to a contradiction, and the premises do not force Rock to be a non-monkey, the negation cannot be proven. Thus, the proof fails.
