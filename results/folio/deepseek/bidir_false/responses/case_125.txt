  -- Therefore, we have proved ¬HasWings Rock → false, meaning ¬HasWings Rock is false? 
  -- But we are required to prove ¬HasWings Rock from the axioms. We have instead used ¬HasWings Rock and derived false, which proves that ¬HasWings Rock is false? 
  -- This means the axioms imply HasWings Rock, so ¬HasWings Rock cannot be proven.

-- Since the above theorem proves ¬HasWings Rock leads to contradiction, 
-- it demonstrates that ¬HasWings Rock is inconsistent with the axioms. 
-- But we cannot prove ¬HasWings Rock positively without assumptions? 
-- Actually, the attempt fails because we assumed ¬HasWings Rock and got contradiction, 
-- meaning the negation of ¬HasWings Rock (i.e., HasWings Rock) is true. 
-- Therefore, we cannot prove ¬HasWings Rock as a standalone theorem from the axioms alone.

-- Conclusion: The attempt to prove ¬HasWings Rock fails.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the `contradiction` tactic failed to automatically detect contradictions in certain branches. The proof has been revised to explicitly apply the hypothesis `h_wings` (which assumes `HasWings Rock`) to derived proofs of `HasWings Rock` in most branches, and to directly contradict `CanBreathe Rock` with `¬CanBreathe Rock` in one branch.

However, after careful analysis, the axioms actually imply that Rock must have wings. Therefore, it's impossible to prove the negation `¬HasWings Rock`. The revised Lean code reflects this by removing the failed proof attempt and adding explanatory comments.

axiom A8 : CanFly Rock ∨ Bird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock

-- Attempt to prove ¬HasWings Rock fails because:
-- 1. Rock is a pet (A7)
-- 2. Rock is either monkey or bird (A3)
--   - If monkey: Proves CanBreathe Rock, forcing A8 to yield either 
--     CanFly Rock (direct wings) or Bird Rock (implies CanFly → wings)
--   - If bird: Directly proves CanFly Rock → wings
-- Thus, axioms imply HasWings Rock, making ¬HasWings Rock unprovable.
