The reasoning shows that Rock must have wings based on the given premises. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Premises**:
   - All Peter's mammal pets are animals.
   - All monkeys are mammals.
   - Peter's pets are monkeys or birds.
   - Peter's birds can fly.
   - All animal pets can breathe.
   - If a pet can fly, it has wings.
   - Rock is Peter's pet.
   - Rock can fly, or is a bird, or cannot breathe.

2. **Case analysis on Rock's status**:
   - **If Rock can fly**: Directly from premise 6, Rock has wings.
   - **If Rock is a bird**: From premise 4, birds that are Peter's pets can fly, so Rock can fly, and thus has wings (premise 6).
   - **If Rock cannot breathe**:
     - Rock is either a monkey or bird (premise 3).
     - **Monkey case**: Monkeys are mammals (premise 2), so Rock is an animal (premise 1). Then Rock must breathe (premise 5), contradicting "cannot breathe".
     - **Bird case**: Same as above – Rock can fly (premise 4) and thus has wings.

In all cases, Rock has wings, proving the conclusion "Rock does not have wings" false.
