The goal is to prove that "John has a larger family" is false from the given premises. After analyzing the context and attempting a proof in Lean, it is determined that the negation of the conclusion cannot be proven from the axioms. Here's the reasoning:

- Premises establish chains: Well-attended wedding → Invite others → Wedding plans → Engaged.
- Premise 4 states someone has a well-attended wedding and larger family, but not necessarily John.
- Premise 5 links engagement to not inviting friends while making wedding plans.
- Premise 6 states larger family implies well-attended wedding or inviting friends.
- Assuming John has a larger family leads to two cases:
  1. John has a well-attended wedding → John is engaged → John cannot invite friends while making wedding plans. However, inviting friends is not required in this case, and no contradiction arises.
  2. John invites friends → No engagement requirement → No contradiction with other premises.
- The existential (premise 4) does not constrain John specifically.
- No contradiction is derivable from the premises under the assumption that John has a larger family.

Thus, the negation of "John has a larger family" cannot be proven.

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the proof attempts used placeholders (`?_`) that couldn't be synthesized. Specifically:
1. In the first branch (`Or.inl`), there was no proof of `InviteFriends John` to create the conjunction for `hNotBoth`
2. In the second branch (`Or.inr`), there was no evidence to derive `False`

After re-examining the premises:
- The distinction between "invite others" (ceremony guests) and "invite friends" is crucial
- Premises chain: Well-attended → Invite others → Wedding plans → Engaged
- A5 forbids engaged individuals from both inviting friends AND making wedding plans
- Assuming John has a larger family leads to two cases:
  1. Well-attended wedding: Forces engagement and wedding plans, but doesn't require inviting friends (no contradiction)
  2. Inviting friends: No premises force engagement or wedding plans (no contradiction)

No contradiction emerges in either case. The existential in A4 doesn't constrain John. Thus, the negation can't be proven.
