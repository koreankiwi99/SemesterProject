The goal is to prove that the statement "John does not have a larger family" is false, meaning we need to prove that John has a larger family (`LargerFamily John`) from the given premises. After formalizing the context in Lean, we analyze the axioms:

- There exists some person with a well-attended wedding and a larger family (`A4`).
- Axioms `A1`, `A2`, and `A3` establish implications: well-attended weddings → inviting others → wedding plans → being engaged.
- Axioms `A5` and `A6` are conditional statements about John (or any person universally quantified).

However, the existential in `A4` does not specify that John is the person with a well-attended wedding and larger family. The universally quantified axioms (`A5`, `A6`) apply to John but do not provide direct evidence about John's family size. There is no premise linking John specifically to the existential witness. Thus, we cannot derive `LargerFamily John`.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
constant John : Person
axiom WeddingPlans : Person → Prop
axiom Engaged : Person → Prop
axiom InviteOthers : Person → Prop
axiom WellAttended : Person → Prop
axiom LargerFamily : Person → Prop
axiom InviteFriends : Person → Prop

-- All people who make wedding plans are engaged
axiom A1 : ∀ x, WeddingPlans x → Engaged x
-- Inviting others implies making wedding plans
axiom A2 : ∀ x, InviteOthers x → WeddingPlans x
-- Well-attended weddings imply inviting others
axiom A3 : ∀ x, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
-- Some people with well-attended weddings have larger families
axiom A4 : ∃ x, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- If engaged, John does not both invite friends and make wedding plans
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InviteFriends John ∧ WeddingPlans John)
-- If John has a larger family, he has a well-attended wedding or invites friends
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- Attempt to prove LargerFamily John fails due to insufficient links to John
</lean>

The compilation errors occurred due to missing type annotations for quantified variables and incorrect declaration syntax. Here's the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom John : Person
axiom WeddingPlans : Person → Prop
axiom Engaged : Person → Prop
axiom InviteOthers : Person → Prop
axiom WellAttended : Person → Prop
axiom LargerFamily : Person → Prop
axiom InviteFriends : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ (x : Person), WeddingPlans x → Engaged x
axiom A2 : ∀ (x : Person), InviteOthers x → WeddingPlans x
axiom A3 : ∀ (x : Person), WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
axiom A4 : ∃ (x : Person), WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InviteFriends John ∧ WeddingPlans John)
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- Attempt to prove ¬¬(LargerFamily John) (equivalent to LargerFamily John)
theorem goal : ¬¬LargerFamily John := by
  intro h  -- Assume ¬LargerFamily John
  -- We have A4: ∃ witness with well-attended wedding and larger family
  -- But no axioms link this witness to John
  -- A5 and A6 provide conditional information about John only
  -- No contradiction derived from h (¬LargerFamily John)
  -- Cannot prove LargerFamily John from premises
  show False  -- Attempt to derive contradiction
  sorry       -- Proof fails

-- Since we cannot prove the goal, we conclude Failure
</lean>

**Analysis**:  
- A4 shows some person has a well-attended wedding and larger family, but this isn't John  
- A6 states that *if* John has a larger family, then certain conditions hold, but doesn't force him to have one  
- A5 constrains John's behavior when engaged, but we have no premises about John's engagement status  
- No axioms connect the existential witness in A4 to John  
- The assumption `¬LargerFamily John` doesn't contradict any premises  

Since we cannot prove `LargerFamily John` (which would falsify the statement "John does not have a larger family"), we conclude:

ANSWER: Failure
