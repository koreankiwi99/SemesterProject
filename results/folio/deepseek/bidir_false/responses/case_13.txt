The context provides information about the Legend of Zelda and general rules regarding game sales and the Top 10 list, but it does not mention FIFA 22. Therefore, there is no information to prove or disprove that FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese company. The premises allow us to conclude that the Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list and made by a Japanese company, but they do not constrain FIFA 22's status.

<lean>
axiom Game : Type
axiom zelda : Game
axiom fifa22 : Game
axiom Top10 : Game → Prop
axiom SellsOver1M : Game → Prop
axiom MadeByJapanese : Game → Prop

axiom CreatedByJapanese : MadeByJapanese zelda
axiom Top10Japanese : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → MadeByJapanese g
axiom SalesCondition : ∀ g : Game, SellsOver1M g → Top10 g
axiom ZeldaSales : SellsOver1M zelda

-- We can prove properties about zelda:
theorem ZeldaTop10 : Top10 zelda := SalesCondition zelda ZeldaSales
theorem ZeldaJapanese : MadeByJapanese zelda := CreatedByJapanese  -- Alternatively: Top10Japanese zelda ZeldaTop10

-- However, there is no information about fifa22:
-- No axiom about fifa22's sales, Top10 status, or manufacturer.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove ¬MadeByJapanese fifa22.
