axiom obj : Type
axiom John : obj
axiom Engaged : obj → Prop
axiom MakesWeddingPlans : obj → Prop
axiom InvitesOthers : obj → Prop
axiom HasWellAttendedWedding : obj → Prop
axiom HasLargerFamily : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, MakesWeddingPlans x → Engaged x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, InvitesOthers x → MakesWeddingPlans x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, HasWellAttendedWedding x → InvitesOthers x
axiom A4 : ∃ x, HasWellAttendedWedding x ∧ HasLargerFamily x
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InvitesOthers John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)
axiom A6 : HasLargerFamily John → (HasWellAttendedWedding John ∨ InvitesOthers John)

-- We are to prove that "John neither has a larger family nor invites others" is false
-- This means proving: ¬(¬HasLargerFamily John ∧ ¬InvitesOthers John)
-- Which is equivalent to: HasLargerFamily John ∨ InvitesOthers John

theorem target : HasLargerFamily John ∨ InvitesOthers John :=
  -- Attempt to prove using available axioms
  -- From A6, if John has a larger family, we get the disjunction directly
  -- But we have no axiom forcing John to have a larger family
  -- Consider existential (A4): there exists someone with well-attended wedding and larger family
  -- For that person: by A3 they invite others, by A2 they make wedding plans, by A1 they are engaged
  -- But this doesn't constrain John
  -- Now examine A5: if John is engaged, then ¬(InvitesOthers John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)
  -- Since A2 says InvitesOthers John → MakesWeddingPlans John, if John were to invite others, 
  -- he would make wedding plans, creating a contradiction with A5 if he is engaged.
  -- However, we don't know if John is engaged. If John is not engaged, A5 doesn't apply.
  -- We have no information about John's engagement status or well-attended wedding.
  -- Therefore, we cannot prove the disjunction.
  sorry   -- Proof incomplete

-- Since we cannot prove the target, we cannot refute the original statement
