The premises state that platypuses are mammals and have no teeth. The statement to evaluate is "Platypuses are mammals with no teeth," which is directly supported by these premises. There is no contradiction with the other premises, since the existence of other mammals with teeth (e.g., humans) does not conflict with platypuses lacking teeth. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that the statement is false.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Platypus : obj
axiom Human : obj
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop

axiom Premise1 : ∃ x : obj, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom Premise2 : ¬ HasTeeth Platypus
axiom Premise3 : Mammal Platypus
axiom Premise4 : HasTeeth Human

-- The statement "Platypuses are mammals with no teeth" is:
--   Mammal Platypus ∧ ¬ HasTeeth Platypus
-- This is proven true by Premise3 and Premise2.
-- Negating this statement gives: ¬(Mammal Platypus ∧ ¬HasTeeth Platypus)
-- Attempting to prove this negation:

theorem negate_conclusion : ¬(Mammal Platypus ∧ ¬HasTeeth Platypus) :=
  fun h => 
    have ⟨hMammal, hNoTeeth⟩ := h 
    -- We know ¬HasTeeth Platypus (Premise2) and Mammal Platypus (Premise3)
    -- so applying hNoTeeth to Premise2 would require HasTeeth Platypus to be false and true, which it isn't.
    -- However, there is no contradiction because:
    --   hNoTeeth : ¬HasTeeth Platypus (assumed in the conjunction)
    --   Premise2 : ¬HasTeeth Platypus (given)
    -- So they agree. Similarly, Mammal Platypus is given.
    -- The premises do not provide any contradiction to h.

    -- Also, Premise1 and Premise4 show there is a mammal with teeth (though not necessarily Human being a mammal),
    -- but this doesn't contradict Platypus being a mammal without teeth.

    -- Therefore, no contradiction can be derived.
    False.elim (hNoTeeth Premise2) -- This doesn't fail because hNoTeeth and Premise2 are the same, so no contradiction occurs here.

-- Alternatively, we can show the attempt fails by noting that:
-- The negation cannot be proven as the original conjunction is true.

-- Formal proof of the original statement:
theorem platypus_property : Mammal Platypus ∧ ¬HasTeeth Platypus := 
  And.intro Premise3 Premise2

-- Since the original statement is true, its negation is false and cannot be proven from the premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Platypus : obj
axiom Human : obj
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop

axiom Premise1 : ∃ x : obj, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom Premise2 : ¬ HasTeeth Platypus
axiom Premise3 : Mammal Platypus
axiom Premise4 : HasTeeth Human

-- Attempt to prove ¬(Mammal Platypus ∧ ¬HasTeeth Platypus)
-- Assume the conjunction: 
--   h : Mammal Platypus ∧ ¬HasTeeth Platypus
-- Then we have:
--   h_left : Mammal Platypus
--   h_right : ¬HasTeeth Platypus
-- But these match Premise3 and Premise2 exactly. 
-- Premise1 (∃ mammal with teeth) and Premise4 (Human has teeth) 
-- provide no contradiction since:
--   (1) Premise1 doesn't specify all mammals have teeth
--   (2) Premise4 doesn't state Human is a mammal
-- Thus no contradiction can be derived.
