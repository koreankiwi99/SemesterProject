The goal is to prove that the statement "Supervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model" is false. The context provides several premises:

1. Machine learning algorithms are categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
2. Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
3. The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms.
4. Reinforcement learning is not used for this model.
5. The machine learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.

The key reasoning is:
- The state-of-the-art model is trained with some algorithm (call it `A`).
- Since `A` trains a text summarization model, it requires labeled data (from premise 5).
- `A` cannot be unsupervised because unsupervised algorithms do not require labeled data (premise 2), contradicting the requirement.
- `A` is not reinforcement learning (premise 4).
- Therefore, `A` must be supervised learning (the only remaining category).

This means the statement is true, so its negation cannot be proven from the premises.

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect handling of the existential axiom `trained_with_ml` and improper case analysis in the proofs. The corrected Lean code uses the existential quantifier directly without introducing an arbitrary algorithm `A`, and properly handles the case analysis to show that the negation cannot be proven.
