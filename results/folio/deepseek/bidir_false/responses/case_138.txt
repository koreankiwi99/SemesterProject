The reasoning involves proving that the statement "Unsupervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model" is false based on the given context. The key steps are:

1. **Premises**:
   - Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
   - The algorithm used for training the state-of-the-art text summarization model requires labeled data.
   - If an algorithm requires labeled data, it cannot be unsupervised (contradiction).

2. **Lean Formalization**:
   - Define `Algo` as the type for machine learning algorithms.
   - Predicates: `unsupervised` (algorithm category), `requires_labeled` (data requirement), `sota_trained_by` (trains the specific model).
   - Axioms capture the context:
     - Unsupervised algorithms never require labeled data.
     - Any algorithm training the state-of-the-art model requires labeled data.
   - Theorem proves the negation: No unsupervised algorithm trains the model.

3. **Proof**:
   - Assume an unsupervised algorithm trains the model (for contradiction).
   - This implies it doesn't require labeled data (by axiom).
   - But it must require labeled data (since it trains the model).
   - Contradiction proves the statement false.
