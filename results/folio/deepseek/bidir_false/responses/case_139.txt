The goal is to prove the negation of the statement: "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is rated General Audience. After formalizing the premises in Lean, we analyze whether ¬RatedGA Hachi can be derived.

- From P7, Hachi is either FamilyFriendlyAnimated or AppropriateForAllAges.
- If FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi, then by P4, RatedGA Hachi (contradicting ¬RatedGA).
- If AppropriateForAllAges Hachi, there is no axiom forcing RatedGA Hachi (P3 only states the converse).
- No premises link AppropriateForAllAges to ¬RatedGA or provide information about excessive content for Hachi.
- Thus, ¬RatedGA Hachi cannot be proven from the axioms.

      have : RatedGA Hachi := P4 Hachi hFFA
      contradiction

      -- No contradiction: AppropriateForAllAges does not imply ¬RatedGA
      -- No premise forces RatedGA here, but also no contradiction with hRatedGA
      -- Cannot derive False

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was used incorrectly. In the `inl` branch, having both `hRatedGA` and `this` as proofs of `RatedGA Hachi` does not constitute a contradiction since they are both positive assertions of the same proposition. After re-examining the premises:

1. There is no axiom linking `AppropriateForAllAges` to `¬RatedGA`
2. No information about `ContainsExcessiveContent` for Hachi exists
3. The disjunction in P7 doesn't force a contradiction with `RatedGA Hachi`

Thus, it's impossible to derive `¬RatedGA Hachi` from the given axioms.

axiom Film : Type
axiom Hachi : Film
axiom AppropriateForAllAges : Film → Prop
axiom CanWatchWithoutGuidance : Film → Prop
axiom ContainsExcessiveContent : Film → Prop
axiom RatedGA : Film → Prop
axiom FamilyFriendlyAnimated : Film → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ f : Film, AppropriateForAllAges f → CanWatchWithoutGuidance f
axiom P2 : ∀ f : Film, ContainsExcessiveContent f → ¬ CanWatchWithoutGuidance f
axiom P3 : ∀ f : Film, RatedGA f → AppropriateForAllAges f
axiom P4 : ∀ f : Film, FamilyFriendlyAnimated f → RatedGA f
axiom P7 : FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi

-- Attempt to prove ¬RatedGA Hachi fails in both cases
example : ¬RatedGA Hachi := by
  intro hRatedGA
  have hAppropriate := P3 Hachi hRatedGA
  cases P7 with
  | inl hFFA =>
      -- Have RatedGA Hachi via P4, but no contradiction with hRatedGA
      sorry  -- Cannot derive False
  | inr hAppropriate' =>
      -- Have AppropriateForAllAges, but no premise forces contradiction
      sorry  -- Cannot derive False
