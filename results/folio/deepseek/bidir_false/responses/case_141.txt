The goal is to prove that the statement about "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" is false based on the given premises. The statement is:  
"Hachi: A dog's Tale" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the "Frozen" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the "Frozen" series.

In logical terms, for film `Hachi`:  
- Let `A` = `ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi`  
- Let `B` = `InFrozenSeries Hachi`  
The statement is `S := (A ∧ B) ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬B)`.  
We aim to prove `¬S` (i.e., the statement is false).

From the premises, we derive:  
1. `FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi` (given).  
2. Both cases lead to `AppropriateForAllAges Hachi` (via premises 3 and 4, or directly).  
3. Thus, `CanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi` (premise 1).  
4. Therefore, `¬ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi` (contraposition of premise 2).  

So `A` is false. Substituting into `S`:  
`S = (false ∧ B) ∨ (true ∧ ¬B) = ¬B`.  
Thus, `¬S` is equivalent to `B` (i.e., `InFrozenSeries Hachi`).  

However, no premise forces `Hachi` to be in the "Frozen" series. Premise 5 only states that *if* a film is in the "Frozen" series, it is family-friendly animated, but not the converse. Premise 7 does not provide information about `InFrozenSeries Hachi`. Hence, `B` cannot be proven.

Since `¬S` (equivalent to `B`) is unprovable, the statement `S` cannot be proven false.

-- ¬S is equivalent to InFrozenSeries Hachi (after simplifying with no_excessive), but we cannot prove InFrozenSeries Hachi.
