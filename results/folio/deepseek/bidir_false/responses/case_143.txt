The context states that Heck cattle were bred back to resemble aurochs, and some animals that are bred back resemble extinct animals. However, there is no information indicating that aurochs are extinct. The existence of animals bred back to resemble extinct animals does not specify which extinct animals are resembled, and Heck cattle resembling aurochs does not imply aurochs' extinction status. Therefore, we cannot prove that aurochs are extinct or that they are not extinct from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom heck_cattle : Animal
axiom aurochs : Animal
axiom BredBack : Animal → Prop
axiom Resemble : Animal → Animal → Prop
axiom Extinct : Animal → Prop

axiom T1 : BredBack heck_cattle
axiom T2 : Resemble heck_cattle aurochs
axiom T3 : ∃ (x : Animal), BredBack x ∧ ∃ (e : Animal), Extinct e ∧ Resemble x e

-- Attempt to prove ¬Extinct aurochs fails because:
-- 1. T3 only states there exists some bred-back animal resembling some extinct animal, not necessarily aurochs.
-- 2. T2 shows heck_cattle resembles aurochs, but without knowing aurochs' extinction status.
-- 3. No axiom links resemblance to aurochs with extinction.
-- Thus, no contradiction under assumption Extinct aurochs, and no proof of ¬Extinct aurochs.
