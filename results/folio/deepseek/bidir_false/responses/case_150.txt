The context provides information about New Vessel Press and specific books it published (Neapolitan Chronicles and Palace of Flies), but it does not mention Harry Potter at all. There are no premises stating that Harry Potter is not published by New Vessel Press or any constraints that would exclude Harry Potter from being published by them. The specialization in translated literature and the requirement that all their books are in English do not provide evidence against Harry Potter being published by them, as Harry Potter could potentially be an English-language book meeting these conditions. Therefore, the negation of the statement cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Book : Type
axiom PublishedByNVP : Book → Prop
axiom harry_potter : Book

-- Premises from context:
axiom all_english : ∀ b : Book, PublishedByNVP b → ∃ lang, lang = "English"  -- All NVP books are in English
axiom neapolitan : Book
axiom palace : Book
axiom pub_nap : PublishedByNVP neapolitan
axiom pub_palace : PublishedByNVP palace
axiom trans_nap : ∃ lang, lang = "Italian"  -- Neapolitan Chronicles translated from Italian (irrelevant to Harry Potter)

-- No premise mentions Harry Potter. Cannot prove ¬PublishedByNVP harry_potter.
