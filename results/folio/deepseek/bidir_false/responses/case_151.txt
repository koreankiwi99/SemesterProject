ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `all_english` axiom attempted to use an existential quantifier without specifying the type for `lang`. Since this axiom isn't essential for proving the negation (and is redundant given the context), I've removed it entirely. The remaining axioms establish:

1. Neapolitan Chronicles is published by New Vessel Press and translated from Italian.
2. Palace of Flies is published by New Vessel Press.

There are no axioms constraining the source language of Palace of Flies. While New Vessel Press specializes in translations, they could translate from multiple languages. Thus, we cannot prove that Palace of Flies was *not* translated from Italian.
