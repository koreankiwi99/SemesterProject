The context provides information about hydrocarbons, organic compounds, alkanes, chemical compounds, and their properties. The mixture is described with a specific disjunction: it is either (a chemical compound and contains only one element) or (not a chemical compound and not containing only one element). However, the axiom that no chemical compound contains only one element makes the first option impossible. Thus, the mixture must not be a chemical compound and must not contain only one element.

The statement to evaluate is "The mixture contains carbon." While the context states that all organic compounds contain carbon, it does not state that only organic compounds contain carbon. Since the mixture is not a chemical compound (and therefore not an organic compound), there is no basis to conclude that it contains carbon. However, there is also no information to prove that it does not contain carbon. Therefore, the negation of the statement cannot be proven from the given premises.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic couldn't automatically detect the contradiction in the `inl` branch. This happened because the contradictory hypotheses (`ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture` and `¬ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture`) weren't both directly available as top-level hypotheses. The fix involves explicitly extracting `ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture` from the conjunction before applying `contradiction`.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, ChemicalCompound x → ¬ ContainsOnlyOneElement x
axiom MixtureAxiom : 
  (ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture) ∨

      have he : ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture := h.2

      contradiction
  | inr h => exact h.1

theorem mixture_not_organic : ¬ OrganicCompound Mixture := 
  fun h => mixture_not_chemical (A3 Mixture h)

-- Attempt to prove ¬ContainsCarbon Mixture fails because:
-- 1. A4 only states organic compounds contain carbon (not that non-organic compounds lack carbon)
-- 2. No axiom prohibits non-organic compounds from containing carbon
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

Explanation of failure:
- We successfully proved the mixture is not a chemical compound (`mixture_not_chemical`) and therefore not organic (`mixture_not_organic`)
- However, axiom A4 only states that organic compounds contain carbon - it doesn't say that non-organic compounds cannot contain carbon
- There are no axioms requiring non-organic compounds to lack carbon
- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation of "The mixture contains carbon"
