The goal is to prove the negation of the statement:  
"If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane."  
This negation is:  
"(The mixture contains only one element or contains carbon) and (the mixture is a chemical compound or is an alkane)."  

From the premises:  
- The mixture must either be a chemical compound and contain only one element, or neither (axiom A6).  
- If it is a chemical compound, it cannot contain only one element (axiom A5), making the first case impossible. Thus, the mixture is not a chemical compound and does not contain only one element (theorem `case2`).  
- If the mixture were an alkane, it would be a hydrocarbon (A2), then an organic compound (A1), then a chemical compound (A3), contradicting `¬ChemicalCompound Mixture`. Hence, it cannot be an alkane (theorem `not_alkane`).  

The second part of the negation, `ChemicalCompound Mixture ∨ Alkane Mixture`, is false because both disjuncts are false. Therefore, the entire conjunction (the negation) is false and cannot be proven.
