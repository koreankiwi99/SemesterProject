The premises lead to a contradiction with the interpretation of the last statement, but after resolving the ambiguity, we can derive that James takes the database course and does not have a part-time job. The conclusion "James either takes the database course or has a part-time job" is true because James takes the database course. Therefore, we cannot prove the negation of the conclusion.

axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj
axiom WorksInLibrary : obj → Prop
axiom FromCS : obj → Prop
axiom PartTimeJob : obj → Prop
axiom TakesDatabase : obj → Prop
axiom TakesClassWithDavid : obj → Prop
axiom WorksInLab : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x, WorksInLibrary x → ¬ FromCS x
axiom T2 : ∀ x, PartTimeJob x → WorksInLibrary x
axiom T3 : ∀ x, TakesDatabase x → FromCS x
axiom T4 : ∀ x, TakesClassWithDavid x → TakesDatabase x
axiom T5 : ∀ x, WorksInLab x → TakesClassWithDavid x
axiom T6 : WorksInLab James
axiom T7 : ¬ WorksInLab James ∨ ¬ PartTimeJob James

theorem not_job : ¬ PartTimeJob James := by
  cases T7
  case inl not_lab => 
    have lab : WorksInLab James := T6
    contradiction
  case inr not_job => exact not_job

theorem takes_db : TakesDatabase James := by
  have takesDavid : TakesClassWithDavid James := T5 James T6
  exact T4 James takesDavid

-- The conclusion is: TakesDatabase James ∨ PartTimeJob James
-- We have takes_db, so the disjunction holds
-- Cannot prove ¬(TakesDatabase James ∨ PartTimeJob James)
