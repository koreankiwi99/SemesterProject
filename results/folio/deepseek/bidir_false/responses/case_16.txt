The premises establish that Rockie is spotted and calm. Since Rockie is spotted, by the third premise, Rockie must be either a rabbit or a squirrel. If Rockie were a squirrel, then by the fifth premise, Rockie would be skittish, and by the fourth premise, Rockie would not be calm, contradicting the calmness in the sixth premise. Therefore, Rockie must be a rabbit. However, the premises do not include any disjointness between rabbits and turtles. While Rockie is a rabbit, it is possible (given the axioms) for Rockie to also be a turtle without contradiction, as no premise links turtlehood to calmness or directly forbids overlap between rabbits and turtles. The existence of some spotted turtle (second premise) does not force Rockie to be that turtle nor preclude Rockie from being both a rabbit and a turtle. Thus, the negation of "Rockie is a turtle" cannot be proven.
