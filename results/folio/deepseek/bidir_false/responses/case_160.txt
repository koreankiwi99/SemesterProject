axiom A1 : LikesMusic → WantsCompose
axiom A2 : AccessProgram → CanCompose
axiom A3 : CanCompose ∧ WantsCompose → WillCompose

-- Attempt to prove negation of the statement: ¬((LikesMusic ∧ AccessProgram) → WillCompose)
-- This is equivalent to: (LikesMusic ∧ AccessProgram) ∧ ¬WillCompose

    have w : WantsCompose := A1 hL
    have c : CanCompose := A2 hA
    exact A3 ⟨c, w⟩
  -- We cannot prove ¬((LikesMusic ∧ AccessProgram) → WillCompose) because A1-A3 imply the statement holds
  -- Therefore, we cannot construct a proof of False from the axioms
  sorry  -- This placeholder indicates we cannot complete the proof

-- Since we cannot fill the 'sorry' with a valid proof, we conclude:
