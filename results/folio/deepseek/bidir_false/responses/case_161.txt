The goal is to prove that the statement "If George will not compose, George can not compose" is false by deriving its negation from the given premises. The negation of the conclusion "¬WillCompose → ¬CanCompose" is "¬WillCompose ∧ CanCompose". However, the premises do not provide sufficient information to prove "¬WillCompose ∧ CanCompose". Specifically:

- Premise 1: If George likes music, he wants to compose (`LikesMusic → WantsCompose`)
- Premise 2: If George has access to a program, he can compose (`HasProgram → CanCompose`)
- Premise 3: If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose (`CanCompose ∧ WantsCompose → WillCompose`)

These premises allow scenarios where George can compose but does not want to (e.g., if he has a program but does not like music), leading to him not composing. However, they do not force such a scenario, nor do they provide evidence that George specifically has the program or dislikes music. Thus, we cannot prove "¬WillCompose ∧ CanCompose" from the premises.

<lean>
axiom LikesMusic : Prop
axiom HasProgram : Prop
axiom WantsCompose : Prop
axiom CanCompose : Prop
axiom WillCompose : Prop

axiom P1 : LikesMusic → WantsCompose
axiom P2 : HasProgram → CanCompose
axiom P3 : CanCompose ∧ WantsCompose → WillCompose

-- The conclusion to disprove: ¬WillCompose → ¬CanCompose
-- Its negation: ¬WillCompose ∧ CanCompose
-- Attempt to prove ¬WillCompose ∧ CanCompose fails because:
--   - No axiom forces ¬WillCompose (P3 only ensures WillCompose under specific conditions).
--   - No axiom forces CanCompose without HasProgram, which is not asserted.
-- Thus, we cannot construct a proof of ¬WillCompose ∧ CanCompose.
