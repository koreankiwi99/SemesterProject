Based on the given context and the statement to evaluate, I formalized the problem in Lean. The key insight is that if Breaking Bad gave out roses on TV, it would have to be an episode of The Bachelor (from premise 2). Since The Bachelor portrays real people (premise 3), any episode of it would portray real people. All such shows are reality TV shows (premise 4), but Breaking Bad is explicitly not a reality TV show (premise 6). This leads to a contradiction, proving the statement false.

<lean>
axiom Show : Type
axiom breakingBad : Show
axiom AirsOnMondayAt8 : Show → Prop
axiom GivesOutRosesOnTV : Show → Prop
axiom IsEpisodeOfTheBachelor : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
axiom IsRealityTVShow : Show → Prop

axiom T1 : ∃ s : Show, AirsOnMondayAt8 s ∧ GivesOutRosesOnTV s
axiom T2 : ∀ s : Show, GivesOutRosesOnTV s → IsEpisodeOfTheBachelor s
axiom T3 : ∀ s : Show, IsEpisodeOfTheBachelor s → PortraysRealPeople s
axiom T4 : ∀ s : Show, PortraysRealPeople s → IsRealityTVShow s
axiom T5 : ¬IsRealityTVShow breakingBad

theorem breakingBad_not_rose_monday : ¬(AirsOnMondayAt8 breakingBad ∧ GivesOutRosesOnTV breakingBad) := by
  intro ⟨hAir, hRose⟩
  have hBachelor : IsEpisodeOfTheBachelor breakingBad := T2 breakingBad hRose
  have hPortray : PortraysRealPeople breakingBad := T3 breakingBad hBachelor
  have hReality : IsRealityTVShow breakingBad := T4 breakingBad hPortray
  exact T5 hReality
</lean>

ANSWER: False
