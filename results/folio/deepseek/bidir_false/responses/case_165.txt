-- Attempt to prove the negation of the statement: 
-- ¬(GivesRoses BreakingBad → AiringMonday8pm BreakingBad)
-- Which is equivalent to: GivesRoses BreakingBad ∧ ¬AiringMonday8pm BreakingBad

theorem prove_negation : GivesRoses BreakingBad ∧ ¬AiringMonday8pm BreakingBad → False :=
  fun ⟨h_roses, _⟩ => 
    have h_bachelor : IsBachelor BreakingBad := R1 BreakingBad h_roses
    have h_real : PortraysRealPeople BreakingBad := R2 BreakingBad h_bachelor
    have h_reality : RealityTV BreakingBad := R3 BreakingBad h_real
    T5 h_reality

-- Since we cannot construct a proof of (GivesRoses BreakingBad ∧ ¬AiringMonday8pm BreakingBad) 
-- without deriving False, we cannot prove the negation of the original statement.
-- The lemma above only shows that the negation leads to contradiction, but doesn't prove the negation exists.
