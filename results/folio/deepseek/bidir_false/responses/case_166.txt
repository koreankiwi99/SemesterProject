-- Alternatively, we can show that the statement is true:

-- Since we can prove the statement true, we cannot prove its negation (false).

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The initial attempt to prove the negation contained a type error by incorrectly assigning the disjunction as its own negation. After correction, the Lean code shows that the negation cannot be proven because the premises directly establish that Heinrich Schmidt is German, making the disjunction (German or Russian) true. There are no axioms contradicting Russian nationality, but the German fact alone suffices to make the disjunction true. Thus, proving the negation is impossible.

-- Attempt to prove ¬(German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt)
theorem disprove_statement : ¬(German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt) :=
  fun h_disjunction =>

    -- Since h_disjunction is the disjunction we want to refute,

    -- However, h_disjunction could be true via German, which matches h_german.
    -- No contradiction exists because:
    --   1. The German fact is consistent with the disjunction
    --   2. No axiom prohibits Russian nationality
    -- Thus, we cannot extract False:

        -- This matches h_disjunction, but provides no contradiction.
