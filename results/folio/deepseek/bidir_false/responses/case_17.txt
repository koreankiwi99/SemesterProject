The goal is to prove that the statement "Rockie is not a turtle" is false, which requires proving "Rockie is a turtle" from the given premises. The premises establish:

1. Rockie is spotted near the campus and calm.
2. Any spotted animal is a rabbit or squirrel.
3. If a squirrel is spotted, it is skittish.
4. Skittish animals are not calm.
5. Rockie's calmness implies it cannot be a squirrel (due to contradiction with skittishness).
6. Therefore, Rockie must be a rabbit.

However, there is no premise stating that rabbits cannot be turtles. While Rockie is proven to be a rabbit, the premises allow for the possibility that Rockie is both a rabbit and a turtle (as categories are not mutually exclusive). Thus, "Rockie is a turtle" cannot be proven from the axioms.

axiom Premise4 : ∀ x, (Squirrel x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x) → Skittish x
