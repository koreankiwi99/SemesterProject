Below is the Lean code that formalizes the given context and proves that the statement about colorectal cancer is false.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom colorectal_cancer : obj
axiom DeadlyDisease : obj → Prop
axiom LowSurvival : obj → Prop
axiom SevereCancer : obj → Prop
axiom BileDuctCancer : obj → Prop
axiom Cholangiocarcinoma : obj → Prop
axiom MildFlu : obj → Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, DeadlyDisease x → LowSurvival x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, SevereCancer x → DeadlyDisease x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, MildFlu x → LowSurvival x
axiom A5 : ¬ (BileDuctCancer colorectal_cancer ∧ LowSurvival colorectal_cancer)

theorem disprove_statement : ¬ (Cholangiocarcinoma colorectal_cancer ∧ (MildFlu colorectal_cancer ∨ BileDuctCancer colorectal_cancer)) := 
  fun ⟨h_chol, h_or⟩ => 
    have h_bile : BileDuctCancer colorectal_cancer := A1 _ h_chol
    have h_low : LowSurvival colorectal_cancer := 
      R1 _ (A2 _ (A3 _ h_bile))
    A5 ⟨h_bile, h_low⟩
</lean>

**Explanation:**  
We assume the statement holds (via `fun ⟨h_chol, h_or⟩ => ...`). From the first component `h_chol` (colorectal cancer is Cholangiocarcinoma), we derive:  
1. `BileDuctCancer colorectal_cancer` via axiom A1.  
2. `LowSurvival colorectal_cancer` via the chain:  
   `A3` (BileDuctCancer → SevereCancer) →  
   `A2` (SevereCancer → DeadlyDisease) →  
   `R1` (DeadlyDisease → LowSurvival).  
This yields `BileDuctCancer colorectal_cancer ∧ LowSurvival colorectal_cancer`, directly contradicting axiom A5. Hence, the statement is false.  

The disjunction `(MildFlu colorectal_cancer ∨ BileDuctCancer colorectal_cancer)` is not used in the proof, as the first conjunct alone leads to a contradiction.

ANSWER: False
