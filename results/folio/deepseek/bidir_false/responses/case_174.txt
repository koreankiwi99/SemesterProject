The goal is to prove that the statement "Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day" is false. After formalizing the premises in Lean, we attempt to prove the negation of this statement, which is equivalent to "Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious home or visits the gym daily." However, case analysis on Taylor's disjunctive condition (A6) shows:

- **Case 1**: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious home and disregards her well-being.  
  Here, `GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor` holds, so the disjunction is true (left branch).

- **Case 2**: Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious home and does not disregard her well-being.  
  From `¬GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor`, contrapositives of axioms A3 and A5 imply `¬VisitsGymDaily Taylor`. Thus, neither disjunct holds (`¬GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor` and `¬VisitsGymDaily Taylor`), so the disjunction cannot be proven.

Attempts to derive a contradiction from assuming the original statement also fail in Case 2, as the context remains consistent. Therefore, the negation of the statement cannot be proven.
