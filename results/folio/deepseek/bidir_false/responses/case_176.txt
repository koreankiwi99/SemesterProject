axiom obj : Type
constant last_summer_olympic_games : obj
constant Tokyo : obj
axiom WasIn : obj → obj → Prop
axiom in_tokyo : WasIn last_summer_olympic_games Tokyo

</lean>

The context explicitly states "The last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo." We model this as an axiom `in_tokyo`. The statement to evaluate ("The last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo") is represented as `¬ WasIn last_summer_olympic_games Tokyo`. 

We prove the negation of this statement (¬¬ P) by showing that assuming ¬P leads to a contradiction with the axiom `in_tokyo` (using function application: `h in_tokyo`). Therefore, we have successfully disproved the statement.

Note: The other contextual elements (sporting event, medal information) are irrelevant to the location claim and are not used in the proof.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After analyzing the compilation errors, I identified two main issues:
1. The original declaration `axiom obj : Type` was causing universe level conflicts
2. The theorem name contained hyphens which are invalid in Lean identifiers

Here's the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom Entity : Type
axiom last_summer_olympic_games : Entity
axiom Tokyo : Entity
axiom WasIn : Entity → Entity → Prop
axiom in_tokyo : WasIn last_summer_olympic_games Tokyo
theorem not_not_in_tokyo : ¬¬ WasIn last_summer_olympic_games Tokyo := 
  fun h => h in_tokyo
</lean>

Explanation of fixes:
1. Changed `obj` to `Entity` to avoid universe conflicts
2. Removed type annotation from lambda variable for cleaner syntax
3. Kept core logic intact: proof shows that assuming "not in Tokyo" leads to contradiction with the axiom

The proof demonstrates that the statement "The last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo" is false, as it directly contradicts the given premise "The last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo". The other context elements (sporting event, medal count) remain irrelevant to this location claim.

ANSWER: False
