The premises state that all horses have hooves and no humans have hooves. The statement claims that some humans are horses. However, if there existed an entity that is both human and horse, it would need to have hooves (because it's a horse) but also not have hooves (because it's human), leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the statement "Some humans are horses" is false.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Horse : obj → Prop
axiom Hooves : obj → Prop

axiom all_horses_have_hooves : ∀ x, Horse x → Hooves x
axiom no_humans_have_hooves : ∀ x, Human x → ¬ Hooves x

theorem no_human_horse : ¬∃ x, Human x ∧ Horse x :=
  fun ⟨x, hx_human, hx_horse⟩ => 
    no_humans_have_hooves x hx_human (all_horses_have_hooves x hx_horse)

ANSWER: False
