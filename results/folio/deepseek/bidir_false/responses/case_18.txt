The reasoning involves analyzing the premises to determine if the conclusion "Rockie is a turtle or cute" can be proven false. The premises establish:

1. Spotted animals near campus are only rabbits or squirrels.
2. Rockie is spotted and calm.
3. If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish (from premise 5), leading to a contradiction with calmness (premise 4).
4. Thus, Rockie must be a rabbit (from 1 and 3).
5. Rabbits spotted near campus are cute (premise 1), so Rockie is cute.
6. Therefore, the conclusion "Rockie is a turtle or cute" holds (since Rockie is cute).

Attempting to prove the conclusion false (i.e., ¬(Turtle Rockie ∨ Cute Rockie)) leads to a contradiction:
- Rockie is spotted, so it must be a rabbit or squirrel.
- If squirrel: skittish → not calm, contradicting calmness.
- If rabbit: cute, contradicting ¬Cute Rockie.

This shows the negation of the conclusion is inconsistent with the premises, meaning the conclusion itself must be true. Thus, it is impossible to prove the conclusion false.
