The goal is to prove that the statement "Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals" is false. This requires proving that Tom is both grumpy and mean to animals. However, from the given premises:

1. Tom is a pet owner → Animal lover → Nice to animals → Not mean to animals (by axioms A4, A3, A1).
2. There exists some grumpy person who is mean to animals (A2), but this does not imply Tom is grumpy or mean.

Specifically, we can prove Tom is not mean to animals, making it impossible for him to be both grumpy and mean. Thus, the original statement holds, and its negation cannot be proven.

axiom obj : Type
axiom NiceToAnimals : obj → Prop
axiom MeanToAnimals : obj → Prop
axiom Grumpy : obj → Prop
axiom AnimalLover : obj → Prop
axiom PetOwner : obj → Prop
axiom Tom : obj

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, NiceToAnimals x → ¬ MeanToAnimals x
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Grumpy x ∧ MeanToAnimals x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, AnimalLover x → NiceToAnimals x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, PetOwner x → AnimalLover x
axiom A5 : PetOwner Tom

-- Prove Tom is not mean to animals
theorem Tom_not_mean : ¬ MeanToAnimals Tom := by
  have h1 : AnimalLover Tom := A4 Tom A5
  have h2 : NiceToAnimals Tom := A3 Tom h1
  exact A1 Tom h2

-- Attempt to prove Tom is both grumpy and mean (to falsify the conclusion)
theorem prove_negation : Grumpy Tom ∧ MeanToAnimals Tom := by
  -- We have no axiom linking Tom to grumpiness, and we know Tom is not mean
  have : ¬ MeanToAnimals Tom := Tom_not_mean
  -- Thus, the conjunction is unprovable
  sorry

-- Since the negation cannot be proven, we return Failure
