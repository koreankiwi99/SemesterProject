The goal is to prove the negation of "Dani Shapiro is a novel writer" from the given premises. After analyzing the context:

1. **Premises**:
   - A podcast is not a novel: `∀x, Podcast x → ¬Novel x`
   - If born in an American city, then American: `∀p, Person p → (∃c, AmericanCity c ∧ BornIn p c) → American p`
   - If a book is a novel and written by a person, the person is a novel writer: `∀b p, Book b → Novel b → Person p → WrittenBy b p → NovelWriter p`
   - Dani Shapiro is American and a writer: `American DaniShapiro`, `Writer DaniShapiro`
   - Family History is written by Dani Shapiro: `WrittenBy FamilyHistory DaniShapiro`
   - Family History is a novel: `Novel FamilyHistory`
   - Dani Shapiro created the podcast Family Secrets: `CreatedPodcast DaniShapiro FamilySecrets`, `Podcast FamilySecrets`
   - Boston is an American city: `AmericanCity Boston`

2. **Key observations**:
   - `FamilyHistory` is a novel, but there is no axiom stating it is a book (`Book FamilyHistory` is missing).
   - `DaniShapiro` is not explicitly stated to be a person (`Person DaniShapiro` is missing).
   - Without `Book FamilyHistory` and `Person DaniShapiro`, axiom `A3` cannot be applied to prove `NovelWriter DaniShapiro`.
   - Creating a podcast (`FamilySecrets`) does not contradict being a novel writer, as no axiom links podcast creation to novel writing.
   - There are no premises that directly or indirectly prove `¬NovelWriter DaniShapiro`.

3. **Conclusion**: The negation of "Dani Shapiro is a novel writer" cannot be proven from the given premises.
