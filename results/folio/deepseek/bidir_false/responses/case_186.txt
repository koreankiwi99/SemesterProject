axiom A1 : ∀ x, IsPodcast x → ¬ IsNovel x
axiom A2 : ∀ p c, BornIn p c ∧ AmericanCity c → American p
axiom A3 : ∀ b p, IsNovel b ∧ WrittenBy b p → NovelWriter p

axiom T8 : AmericanCity Boston

-- Attempt to prove ¬BornIn DaniShapiro Boston
theorem disprove_born_in_boston : ¬ BornIn DaniShapiro Boston := by
  -- Assume DaniShapiro was born in Boston
  intro h
  -- From T8 and h, we get American DaniShapiro via A2
  have h_american : American DaniShapiro := A2 DaniShapiro Boston ⟨h, T8⟩
  -- But T3 already states American DaniShapiro, so no contradiction
  -- Check for other contradictions
  -- From T4 and T5, DaniShapiro is a novel writer
  have h_novel_writer : NovelWriter DaniShapiro := A3 FamilyHistory DaniShapiro ⟨T5, T4⟩
  -- From T6 and T7, FamilySecrets is a podcast
  -- A1 says no podcast is a novel, but FamilyHistory is a novel (T5) and FamilySecrets is a podcast (T7), different objects
  -- No axiom relates birthplace to writing or podcast creation
  -- No contradiction found
  -- We cannot derive False
  admit

-- Since we cannot complete the proof without admitting, we conclude Failure.
