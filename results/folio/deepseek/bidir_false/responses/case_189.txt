The compilation error occurred due to an unnecessary `end` statement without a corresponding `namespace` or `section`. The corrected Lean code removes this statement while maintaining all logical proofs.

ANSWER: False

**Explanation:**  
We successfully proved the negation of the conclusion ("Yuri is an American professional basketball player"):
1. If Yuri were a basketball player, he would activate his leg muscles (via jump shots → leap → muscle activation)
2. Yuri does NOT activate his leg muscles (axiom T5)
3. Thus, Yuri cannot be a basketball player (`yuri_not_player`)
4. Therefore, the conjunction (basketball player ∧ American) must be false (`false_conclusion`)

Since the conclusion's negation is provable from the premises, the answer is **False**.
