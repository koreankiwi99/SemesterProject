The premises do not provide enough information to prove that Descampe is not in the six-way tie. Specifically:
- There exists at least one Belgian in the six-way tie, but it could be Descampe or another individual.
- Descampe is Belgian and on the leaderboard, but this does not force him to be in the tie.
- The winner (Steinhauer) is not in the tie, but this doesn't affect Descampe's status.
- No premises restrict the number of Belgians or force Descampe to be the only Belgian candidate for the tie.

Thus, the negation of the statement cannot be proven from the given premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Steinhauer : obj
axiom Descampe : obj

axiom Winner : obj → Prop
axiom OnLeaderboard : obj → Prop
axiom InSixWayTie : obj → Prop
axiom FromBelgium : obj → Prop
axiom Participated1992 : obj → Prop

axiom winner_steinhauer : Winner Steinhauer
axiom steinhauer_participated : Participated1992 Steinhauer
axiom belgian_in_tie : ∃ x, InSixWayTie x ∧ FromBelgium x
axiom descampe_belgium : FromBelgium Descampe
axiom descampe_leaderboard : OnLeaderboard Descampe
axiom all_leaderboard_participated : ∀ x, OnLeaderboard x → Participated1992 x

-- Additional reasonable assumption: winner is not in a tie (common in tournaments)
axiom winner_not_in_tie : ∀ x, Winner x → ¬InSixWayTie x

-- Cannot prove ¬InSixWayTie Descampe because:
-- 1. belgian_in_tie guarantees ∃ Belgian in tie, but doesn't specify identity
-- 2. descampe_belgium doesn't force Descampe to be that Belgian
-- 3. No premise prevents multiple Belgians on leaderboard
-- 4. No premise links Descampe exclusively to the tie
