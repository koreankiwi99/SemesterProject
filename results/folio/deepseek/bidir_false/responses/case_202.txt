-- Premises from context
axiom loaned_to_Braga : LoanedOutTo AiltonSilva Braga
axiom Braga_football : FootballClub Braga
axiom Nautico_football : FootballClub Nautico
axiom Fluminense_football : FootballClub Fluminense

-- Statement: Ailton Silva was loaned out to a football club (∃ club, FootballClub club ∧ LoanedOutTo AiltonSilva club)
-- Attempt to prove the negation: ¬∃ club, FootballClub club ∧ LoanedOutTo AiltonSilva club
theorem disprove_statement : ¬∃ club, FootballClub club ∧ LoanedOutTo AiltonSilva club :=
  fun h => 
    match h with
    | ⟨w, hClub, hLoan⟩ =>
      -- We know AiltonSilva was loaned to Braga (loaned_to_Braga) and Braga is a FootballClub (Braga_football)
      -- This directly contradicts the negation since we have evidence for the existential
      -- No contradiction can be derived from the premises
      False.elim (by sorry) -- Cannot derive contradiction

-- Since we cannot complete the proof without 'sorry', we conclude failure
