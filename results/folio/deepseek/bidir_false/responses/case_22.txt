The reasoning involves proving that "Black Mirror" is not popular based on the given premises. The key steps are:

1. From the premise "If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it", we derive that for any show, binge-watching by Karen is equivalent to downloading by Karen.
2. Given "Karen does not download 'Black Mirror'", we conclude Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror".
3. From "If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it", we use contraposition: if Karen does not binge-watch a show, it is not popular.
4. Applying this to "Black Mirror" gives ¬Popular BlackMirror.

The unused premise about sharing with Lisa does not affect the proof.

</lean>

ANSWER: False

The compilation error occurred due to mixing `constant` and `axiom` declarations. In Lean 4, consistency in declaration types is required. The solution is to use `axiom` for all declarations, including the type and constants.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Show : Type
axiom StrangerThings : Show
axiom BlackMirror : Show
axiom Popular : Show → Prop
axiom BingeWatchKaren : Show → Prop
axiom DownloadKaren : Show → Prop
axiom ShareWithLisa : Show → Prop

axiom T1 : Popular StrangerThings
axiom T2 : ∀ s : Show, Popular s → BingeWatchKaren s
axiom T3 : ∀ s : Show, BingeWatchKaren s ↔ DownloadKaren s
axiom T4 : ¬ DownloadKaren BlackMirror
axiom T5 : ∀ s : Show, BingeWatchKaren s → ShareWithLisa s

theorem black_mirror_not_popular : ¬ Popular BlackMirror :=
  fun h : Popular BlackMirror =>
  have binge : BingeWatchKaren BlackMirror := T2 BlackMirror h
  have download : DownloadKaren BlackMirror := (T3 BlackMirror).mp binge
  show False from T4 download
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**  
We prove that "Black Mirror" is not popular by contradiction:
1. Assume `Popular BlackMirror` (hypothesis `h`)
2. By `T2`, this implies Karen binge-watches it (`binge`)
3. By `T3` (biconditional), binge-watching implies downloading (`download`)
4. But `T4` states Karen doesn't download Black Mirror, contradicting `download`

The unused premise `T5` (about sharing with Lisa) doesn't affect the proof. Since we derived `False` from the premises, the negation is proven.

ANSWER: False
