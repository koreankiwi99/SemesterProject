The context states that "Beijing is located in Northern China," but does not provide any information about whether Northern China and southern China are mutually exclusive regions. Without an explicit axiom stating that a city cannot be in both Northern China and southern China simultaneously, we cannot prove the negation of the statement "Beijing is located in southern China" from the given premises. The other context details (about Olympics, universities, etc.) are irrelevant to the location claim.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Beijing : obj
axiom LocatedInNorthernChina : obj → Prop
axiom LocatedInSouthernChina : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : LocatedInNorthernChina Beijing

-- No axiom provided that Northern and Southern China are mutually exclusive.
-- Cannot prove ¬LocatedInSouthernChina Beijing from given premises.
