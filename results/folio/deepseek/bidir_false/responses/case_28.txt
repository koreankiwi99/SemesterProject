The statement "Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars" cannot be proven false from the given premises. While the first case of Marvin's origin (from both Earth and Mars) would make the statement false, the second case (from neither) is consistent with the statement being true. Specifically:

- In the "from neither" case, Marvin is not from Earth (triggering Premise 7: extraterrestrial)
- As an extraterrestrial, Marvin cannot be human (Premise 3)
- Marvin is also not from Mars (by case definition)
- Thus, Marvin is neither human nor from Mars in this scenario

Since the premises allow a scenario where the statement is true, we cannot prove its negation.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because in the second branch of the case analysis, I incorrectly attempted to derive a contradiction by applying `¬Human Marvin` to itself, which is logically invalid. After re-examining the premises:

1. In the first branch (Marvin from both Earth and Mars):
   - `FromMars Marvin` contradicts the hypothesis `¬FromMars Marvin`
   - This branch is inconsistent

2. In the second branch (Marvin from neither):
   - `¬FromEarth Marvin` implies `Extraterrestrial Marvin` (via P7)
   - `Extraterrestrial Marvin` implies `¬Human Marvin` (via P3)
   - This matches both parts of the hypothesis `(¬Human Marvin ∧ ¬FromMars Marvin)`
   - No contradiction exists here

The premises allow the second scenario where Marvin is neither human nor from Mars, making the statement true. Therefore, its negation cannot be proven.
