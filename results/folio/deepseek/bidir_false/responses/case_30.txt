The context does not provide sufficient information to prove that Djokovic is not a Grand Slam champion. While Djokovic must be either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor, both possibilities remain consistent with the premises. The derivation of Djokovic being well-paid (and living in a tax haven) occurs in both cases, but this does not force either outcome. Since no contradiction arises from assuming Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, the negation cannot be proven.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Djokovic : Person
axiom AtMixer : Person → Prop
axiom GSC : Person → Prop
axiom ONA : Person → Prop
axiom PTP : Person → Prop
axiom Celebrity : Person → Prop
axiom Athlete : Person → Prop
axiom WellPaid : Person → Prop
axiom Famous : Person → Prop
axiom TaxHaven : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → GSC p ∨ ONA p
axiom A2 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → GSC p → PTP p
axiom A3 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → ONA p → Celebrity p
axiom A4 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → PTP p → Athlete p
axiom A5 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → Celebrity p → WellPaid p
axiom A6 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → Athlete p → Famous p
axiom A7 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → WellPaid p → TaxHaven p
axiom A8 : AtMixer Djokovic
axiom A9 : Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic → WellPaid Djokovic

-- Attempt to prove ¬GSC Djokovic fails
-- No contradiction emerges from assuming GSC Djokovic
-- Case 1: GSC Djokovic leads to WellPaid Djokovic via PTP → Athlete → Famous → WellPaid (using A9)
-- Case 2: ONA Djokovic leads to WellPaid Djokovic via Celebrity
-- Both paths are consistent
