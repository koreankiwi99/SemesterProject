The context establishes that Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable and Roderick Strong leads it. Therefore, the statement "Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable" is true. Attempting to prove its negation (¬∃ s, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s) fails because Diamond Mine serves as a counterexample satisfying both properties.

axiom obj : Type
axiom RoderickStrong : obj
axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom ProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj → Prop
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom T1 : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
axiom T2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine

-- Attempt to prove negation of the statement: ¬∃ s, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s
example : ¬∃ s, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | intro s hstable =>
    -- We know DiamondMine satisfies both properties, so no contradiction can be derived
    have witness : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine ∧ Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine := ⟨T1, T2⟩
    -- Cannot derive False from existential since evidence exists
    admit  -- Proof fails here

-- Since negation cannot be proven, we conclude Failure

ANSWER: Failure
