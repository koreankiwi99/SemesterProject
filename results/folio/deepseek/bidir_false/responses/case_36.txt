The goal is to prove the negation of "Beethoven is a composer" from the given premises. After formalizing the context:

- Symphony No. 9 is a music piece.
- Composers write music pieces (but this does not imply that only composers write music pieces).
- Beethoven wrote Symphony No. 9.
- Vienna Music Society premiered Symphony No. 9.
- Vienna Music Society is an orchestra.
- Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society.
- Orchestras are led by conductors (meaning anyone leading an orchestra is a conductor).

The Lean formalization shows:
- Beethoven wrote a music piece (Symphony No. 9).
- Beethoven leads an orchestra (Vienna Music Society), so Beethoven is a conductor.
- However, there is no axiom stating that conductors cannot be composers, or that writing a music piece doesn't imply being a composer.
- The premise "Composers write music pieces" is an implication (if someone is a composer, they write music pieces), not a biconditional (writing a music piece does not necessarily make someone a composer).
- Crucially, there is no contradiction or exclusion between being a conductor and a composer in the axioms.

Thus, it is impossible to prove ¬Composer Beethoven from the given premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom S9 : obj
axiom Beethoven : obj
axiom VMS : obj
axiom MusicPiece : obj → Prop
axiom Composer : obj → Prop
axiom Wrote : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Premiered : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Orchestra : obj → Prop
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Conductor : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : MusicPiece S9
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Composer x → ∃ y : obj, MusicPiece y ∧ Wrote x y
axiom A3 : Wrote Beethoven S9
axiom A4 : Premiered VMS S9
axiom A5 : Orchestra VMS
axiom A6 : Leads Beethoven VMS
axiom A7 : ∀ (o c : obj), Orchestra o → Leads c o → Conductor c

-- Attempt to prove ¬Composer Beethoven fails because:
-- 1. A3 shows Beethoven wrote a music piece, but A2 doesn't force composers to be the only writers.
-- 2. A6 and A7 prove Conductor Beethoven, but no axiom prohibits Beethoven from being both conductor and composer.
-- No contradiction is derivable.
