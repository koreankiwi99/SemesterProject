The statement to evaluate is "A design by Max is a brutalist building," which is ambiguous. It could be interpreted existentially (there exists a design by Max that is brutalist) or universally (every design by Max is brutalist). The premises only constrain designs that Max adores, not all designs by Max. There is no information about designs Max does not adore. Therefore, the negation of either interpretation cannot be proven from the premises.

axiom Designer : Type
axiom Building : Type
axiom ZahaHadid : Designer
axiom KellyWearstler : Designer
axiom Max_des : Designer
axiom Adores : Building → Prop
axiom InterestingGeometries : Building → Prop
axiom Brutalist : Building → Prop
axiom Evocative : Building → Prop
axiom Dreamy : Building → Prop
axiom designedBy : Building → Designer → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ b : Building, designedBy b ZahaHadid ∧ Adores b → InterestingGeometries b
axiom A2 : ∀ b : Building, Brutalist b ∧ Adores b → ¬ InterestingGeometries b
axiom A3 : ∀ b : Building, Adores b → designedBy b ZahaHadid ∨ designedBy b KellyWearstler
axiom A4 : ∀ b : Building, designedBy b KellyWearstler ∧ Adores b → Evocative b
axiom A5 : ∀ b : Building, designedBy b KellyWearstler ∧ Adores b → Dreamy b
axiom A6 : ∀ b : Building, designedBy b Max_des ∧ Adores b ∧ InterestingGeometries b → Brutalist b ∧ Evocative b

-- The statement "A design by Max is a brutalist building" is ambiguous.
-- Existential interpretation: ∃ b, designedBy b Max_des ∧ Brutalist b
-- Universal interpretation: ∀ b, designedBy b Max_des → Brutalist b
-- Premises only constrain adored designs, so neither interpretation's negation can be proven.
