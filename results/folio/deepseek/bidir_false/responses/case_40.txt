The goal is to prove the negation of the statement: "A design by Max is evocative and dreamy." This statement is interpreted existentially: there exists a design by Max that is evocative and dreamy. After formalizing the context and attempting a proof, it is determined that the negation cannot be proven from the given premises. Specifically:

- For designs by Max that he adores and are in Kelly Wearstler's style, the premises imply they are both evocative and dreamy (via axioms A4 and A5). 
- There is no premise preventing the existence of such designs, nor is there a contradiction derived for this case. 
- While Zaha Hadid's designs lead to contradictions when assumed to be dreamy (due to conflicts between axioms A1, A2, and A6), this does not disprove the existence of evocative and dreamy designs in Kelly Wearstler's style.

Thus, the negation of the existential statement cannot be proven.

axiom Design : Type
axiom Max_adores : Design → Prop
axiom ZH_design : Design → Prop
axiom KW_design : Design → Prop
axiom Brutalist : Design → Prop
axiom hasInterestingGeometry : Design → Prop
axiom isEvocative : Design → Prop
axiom isDreamy : Design → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ d : Design, ZH_design d → Max_adores d → hasInterestingGeometry d
axiom A2 : ∀ d : Design, Brutalist d → Max_adores d → ¬ hasInterestingGeometry d
axiom A3 : ∀ d : Design, Max_adores d → ZH_design d ∨ KW_design d
axiom A4 : ∀ d : Design, KW_design d → Max_adores d → isEvocative d
axiom A5 : ∀ d : Design, KW_design d → Max_adores d → isDreamy d
axiom A6 : ∀ d : Design, Max_adores d → hasInterestingGeometry d → Brutalist d ∧ isEvocative d

-- Attempt to prove ¬∃ d, Max_adores d ∧ isEvocative d ∧ isDreamy d
-- Proof fails: KW_design case remains consistent
