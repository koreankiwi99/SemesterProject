The goal is to prove that the statement "Coco Gauff is among the most active Grand-Slam players" (interpreted as `Active Coco`) is false from the given premises. After formalizing the context in Lean, we attempt to prove `¬Active Coco`. However, the axioms imply that `Active Coco` must be true:

1. Coco is at Roland Garros 2022 (`AtRG22 Coco`).
2. By axiom R4, Coco is either female or male.
3. If Coco is female:
   - `Female Coco ∧ AtRG22 Coco` implies `LostToIga Coco` (by R3).
   - `LostToIga Coco` implies `WTA_high Coco` (by R2).
   - `WTA_high Coco` implies `Active Coco` (by R1).
4. If Coco is male:
   - `Male Coco ∧ AtRG22 Coco` implies `LostToRafael Coco` (by R5).
   - `LostToRafael Coco` satisfies the disjunction in R6, implying `¬(Male Coco ∧ AtRG22 Coco)`.
   - But `Male Coco ∧ AtRG22 Coco` holds, leading to a contradiction. Thus, Coco cannot be male.

Therefore, Coco must be female, leading to `Active Coco`. Since we can prove `Active Coco`, we cannot prove its negation (`¬Active Coco`). The attempt to prove the statement false fails.
