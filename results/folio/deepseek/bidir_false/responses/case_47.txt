axiom FavoriteSeason : Student → Season → Prop
axiom WantsLongVacation : Student → Prop

axiom seasons_distinct : ∀ (s : Student) (a b : Season), FavoriteSeason s a → FavoriteSeason s b → a = b
axiom all_long_vacation_like_summer : ∀ (s : Student), WantsLongVacation s → FavoriteSeason s Season.Summer
axiom emma_fav_summer : FavoriteSeason Student.Emma Season.Summer
axiom mia_not_same_as_emma : ¬ FavoriteSeason Student.Mia Season.Summer
axiom james_wants_vacation : WantsLongVacation Student.James

-- Attempt to prove that Mia's favorite season is NOT spring
theorem mia_not_spring : ¬ FavoriteSeason Student.Mia Season.Spring :=
  fun (h : FavoriteSeason Student.Mia Season.Spring) =>
  -- We know Mia doesn't like summer (mia_not_same_as_emma)
  -- But we have no information forcing Mia's favorite to be something other than spring
  -- In fact, Mia could have Spring as favorite without contradicting any axiom
  -- Therefore, we cannot derive a contradiction
  -- Let's check possible contradictions:
  -- 1. Does James' vacation preference help? No, it only tells us James likes summer.
  -- 2. Does Emma's preference help? Only tells us Emma likes summer and Mia doesn't.
  -- 3. The distinctness axiom requires Mia to have one favorite, but doesn't forbid spring.
  -- No contradiction found
  -- Explicitly: We have mia_not_same_as_emma showing ¬FavoriteSeason Mia Summer,
  -- but h shows FavoriteSeason Mia Spring. These are consistent since Spring ≠ Summer.
  -- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation.
  -- We must admit failure to prove ¬FavoriteSeason Mia Spring
  -- Since we cannot construct the proof, we leave it unproven
  sorry -- Indicates we cannot prove the theorem

-- Since we cannot prove mia_not_spring without sorry, we conclude Failure
