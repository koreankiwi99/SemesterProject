The goal is to prove that the given statement is false, which translates to proving `P ∧ Q` where:
- `P` is "James is a manager or in other countries"
- `Q` is "James has lunch at home or works remotely from home"

However, the premises do not provide sufficient information to prove `P ∧ Q`. Specifically:
- There is no information about James being in other countries (`InOtherCountries James`).
- There is no information forcing James to be a manager (`Manager James`).
- While `A3` states James has lunch either in the building or at home, we cannot derive `HasLunchAtHome James` without additional constraints.
- `WorksRemotelyFromHome James` cannot be proven without knowing if James has lunch at home or is in other countries.

Thus, `P ∧ Q` cannot be proven from the axioms. The statement to evaluate cannot be proven false.

axiom Employee : Type
axiom James : Employee

axiom SchedulesMeeting : Employee → Prop
axiom GoesToBuilding : Employee → Prop
axiom HasLunchInBuilding : Employee → Prop
axiom HasLunchAtHome : Employee → Prop
axiom WorksRemotelyFromHome : Employee → Prop
axiom InOtherCountries : Employee → Prop
axiom Manager : Employee → Prop
axiom AppearsToday : Employee → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ (x : Employee), SchedulesMeeting x → GoesToBuilding x
axiom A2 : ∀ (x : Employee), HasLunchInBuilding x → SchedulesMeeting x
axiom A3 : ∀ (x : Employee), HasLunchInBuilding x ∨ HasLunchAtHome x
axiom A4 : ∀ (x : Employee), HasLunchAtHome x → WorksRemotelyFromHome x
axiom A5 : ∀ (x : Employee), InOtherCountries x → WorksRemotelyFromHome x
axiom A6 : ∀ (x : Employee), Manager x → ¬ WorksRemotelyFromHome x
axiom A7 : AppearsToday James ↔ Manager James

def P : Prop := Manager James ∨ InOtherCountries James
def Q : Prop := HasLunchAtHome James ∨ WorksRemotelyFromHome James

-- The statement to evaluate is false if P ∧ Q holds
-- However, P ∧ Q cannot be proven from the axioms
