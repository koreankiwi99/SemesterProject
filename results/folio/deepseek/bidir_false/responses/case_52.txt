The goal is to prove that "German is a Romance language" is false based on the given premises. After formalizing the context in Lean, we attempt to derive a contradiction by assuming `Romance German`. However, the axioms do not lead to a contradiction:

- `Romance German` implies `Related German Spanish` via `A2` (since Spanish is Romance), but this is already stated in `A5`.
- Basque is proven not to be Romance (if it were, it would be related to Spanish, contradicting `A6`), but this doesn't affect German.
- There are no axioms forcing non-Romance languages to be unrelated to Romance languages, so `Related German Spanish` (given) is consistent with German not being Romance.
- No other contradictions arise from the premises.

Thus, we cannot prove `¬Romance German`.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the proof attempted to use `A6` without proving that Spanish and Basque are distinct. Adding an axiom for distinctness resolves this, but it doesn't help prove the main goal. After fixing this, the proof attempt for `¬Romance German` still fails because the premises don't provide a contradiction when assuming `Romance German`:

1. Assuming `Romance German` allows deriving `Related German Spanish` via `A2`, but this is consistent with `A5` (which already states this relation).
2. There are no axioms connecting German's relation to Spanish with Romance status in a way that forces contradiction.
3. The Basque-related proof (now fixed) doesn't interact with German.

Thus, we cannot prove `¬Romance German`.
