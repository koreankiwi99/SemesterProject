The statement "Robert Lewandowski is a soccer player" is directly supported by the premises:  
- He is a striker (given)  
- Strikers are soccer players (given)  

The information about leaving Bayern Munchen and ceasing to play for them does not contradict his status as a soccer player. Therefore, we **cannot prove the negation** of the statement.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Lewandowski : obj
axiom BayernMunchen : obj
axiom Striker : obj → Prop
axiom SoccerPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom Leaves : obj → obj → Prop
axiom NoLongerPlayFor : obj → obj → Prop

axiom T1 : Striker Lewandowski
axiom T2 : ∀ x : obj, Striker x → SoccerPlayer x
axiom T3 : Leaves Lewandowski BayernMunchen
axiom T4 : ∀ x y : obj, Leaves x y → NoLongerPlayFor x y

-- We can prove SoccerPlayer Lewandowski from T1 and T2
theorem positive_proof : SoccerPlayer Lewandowski := T2 Lewandowski T1

-- Attempt to prove ¬SoccerPlayer Lewandowski fails because:
-- 1. Premises confirm SoccerPlayer Lewandowski
-- 2. Leaving a team doesn't revoke player status
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure
