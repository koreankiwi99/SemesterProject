To evaluate the statement "Robert Lewandowski plays for Bayern Munchen" given the context, we translate the premises into Lean axioms and attempt to prove the negation of the statement. The key premises are:
1. Robert Lewandowski left Bayern Munchen.
2. If a player leaves a team, they no longer play for that team.

We define:
- `obj` as the type of entities.
- `lewandowski` and `bayern` as specific objects.
- `Leaves : obj → obj → Prop` (where `Leaves x y` means "x leaves y").
- `PlaysFor : obj → obj → Prop` (where `PlaysFor x y` means "x plays for y").

The critical axiom is:  
`∀ (player team : obj), Leaves player team → ¬ PlaysFor player team`  

Given that `Leaves lewandowski bayern` is true, we can directly derive `¬ PlaysFor lewandowski bayern`.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom lewandowski : obj
axiom bayern : obj
axiom Leaves : obj → obj → Prop
axiom PlaysFor : obj → obj → Prop
axiom T1 : Leaves lewandowski bayern
axiom R1 : ∀ (player team : obj), Leaves player team → ¬ PlaysFor player team
theorem not_plays_for : ¬ PlaysFor lewandowski bayern := R1 lewandowski bayern T1
</lean>

ANSWER: False
