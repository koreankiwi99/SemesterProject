The task requires proving the negation of the statement: "A private Ivy League research university moved to New Haven." The context provides Yale University as an example of such a university that moved to New Haven. Since Yale satisfies both conditions, the existential statement is true. Attempting to prove its negation (that no such university exists) leads to a contradiction with the premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Yale : obj
axiom PrivateIvyLeagueResearchUniversity : obj → Prop
axiom MovedToNewHaven : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : PrivateIvyLeagueResearchUniversity Yale
axiom T2 : MovedToNewHaven Yale

-- Negation of the statement: ∀x, PrivateIvyLeagueResearchUniversity x → ¬MovedToNewHaven x
theorem prove_negation : ¬∃ x, PrivateIvyLeagueResearchUniversity x ∧ MovedToNewHaven x := by
  intro h
  match h with
  | ⟨w, hw⟩ =>
    have h1 := hw.left
    have h2 := hw.right
    -- We cannot derive a contradiction without additional premises about exclusivity.
    -- Since we know Yale satisfies both properties, the existential is true.
    -- But we have no axiom stating Yale is the only such university.
    -- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation.
    admit

-- Since we cannot complete the proof without admitting, we conclude Failure.
