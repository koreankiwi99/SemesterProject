The context states that "The Secret Dude Society" was the working title for Badults, and Andrew Collins was the script editor for Badults. This directly supports the statement that Andrew Collins was the script editor for a series (Badults) with that working title. Attempting to prove the negation (that no such series exists) leads to a contradiction with the given premises, as the existence of Badults serves as a counterexample. Since the negation cannot be proven from the axioms, the result is Failure.

  -- This proof shows the negation leads to contradiction, meaning we cannot prove the negation

-- Since we proved the negation implies False, but the negation itself isn't provable from axioms alone, we have:
-- The attempt to prove the negation fails because premises support the original statement

The error occurred because the proof incorrectly applied the existential hypothesis `h` as a function. The corrected proof uses the equivalence between the negation of an existential and a universal negation. By deriving a universal negation from the assumed existential, applying it to the Badults series, and using the axioms to show a contradiction, we successfully prove the negation of the statement. This results in a proof of `False`, indicating the premises are inconsistent with the original conclusion.

      h (Exists.intro x hx)

ANSWER: False

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the proof incorrectly attempted to apply the existential hypothesis `h` as a function. After reevaluation, the axioms directly support the original statement: Badults serves as a witness proving that Andrew Collins was the script editor for a series with the working title "The Secret Dude Society". Therefore, the negation of this statement cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Series : Type
axiom Person : Type
axiom Badults : Series
axiom AndrewCollins : Person
axiom hasWorkingTitle : Series → String → Prop
axiom scriptEditor : Series → Person → Prop

axiom working_title_Badults : hasWorkingTitle Badults "The Secret Dude Society"
axiom script_editor_Badults : scriptEditor Badults AndrewCollins

-- Attempt to prove ¬∃ x, scriptEditor x AndrewCollins ∧ hasWorkingTitle x "The Secret Dude Society"
-- We have a concrete witness: Badults satisfies both conditions
-- Therefore, the existential is true and its negation cannot be proven
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure
