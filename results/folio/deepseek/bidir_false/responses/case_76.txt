The premises lead to a contradiction, specifically regarding Hannah's need for money. From the axioms:

1. Hannah works in campus jobs (`A7.1`).
2. Working in campus jobs implies needing money (`A1`), so Hannah needs money.
3. However, `A7.2` states that if Hannah needs money, she does not need money (and is not picky), creating a contradiction when combined with the previous deduction.

This contradiction (`False`) proves that the premises are inconsistent, allowing us to derive any conclusion, including the negation of the target statement. Therefore, the conclusion is false.
