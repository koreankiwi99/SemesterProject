The reasoning involves attempting to prove that "Dried Thai chilies are a mala hotpot" is false from the given premises. The axioms establish:
- No baked sweets are spicy (A1).
- Cupcakes are baked sweets (A2).
- Mala hotpots are spicy (A3).
- Products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes (A4).
- Dried Thai chilies (DTC) are spicy, or mala hotpots, or not baked sweets (A5).

To prove ¬MalaHotpot(DTC), assume MalaHotpot(DTC). By A3, this implies Spicy(DTC). If DTC were a baked sweet, A1 would yield ¬Spicy(DTC), contradicting Spicy(DTC). However, A5 allows ¬BakedSweet(DTC) as a valid alternative when Spicy(DTC) holds, meaning no contradiction arises. Thus, ¬MalaHotpot(DTC) cannot be proven from the axioms.

axiom obj : Type
axiom DTC : obj
axiom BakedSweet : obj → Prop
axiom Spicy : obj → Prop
axiom Cupcake : obj → Prop
axiom MalaHotpot : obj → Prop
axiom FromBakedByMelissa : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, BakedSweet x → ¬Spicy x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Cupcake x → BakedSweet x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, MalaHotpot x → Spicy x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, FromBakedByMelissa x → Cupcake x
axiom A5 : Spicy DTC ∨ MalaHotpot DTC ∨ ¬BakedSweet DTC

-- Attempt to prove ¬MalaHotpot DTC fails because:
-- Assuming MalaHotpot DTC implies Spicy DTC (A3). 
-- If BakedSweet DTC were true, A1 would yield ¬Spicy DTC → contradiction.
-- But A5 allows ¬BakedSweet DTC when Spicy DTC holds, so no contradiction.
