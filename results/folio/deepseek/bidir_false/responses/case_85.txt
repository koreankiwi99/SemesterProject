The goal is to prove that the statement "The Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service" is false, meaning we need to prove that the Hamden Plaza store does provide take-out service. However, after analyzing the premises, it is not possible to prove this.

**Lean Analysis:**
<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom H : obj  -- Hamden Plaza Subway store
axiom Listed : obj → Prop
axiom ManyNegativeReviews : obj → Prop
axiom RatingGreaterThanFour : obj → Prop
axiom PopularAmongLocals : obj → Prop
axiom TakeOutService : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ r : obj, Listed r → ¬ ManyNegativeReviews r
axiom A2 : ∀ r : obj, RatingGreaterThanFour r → Listed r
axiom A3 : ∃ r : obj, ¬ TakeOutService r ∧ ManyNegativeReviews r
axiom A4 : ∀ r : obj, PopularAmongLocals r → RatingGreaterThanFour r
axiom A5 : RatingGreaterThanFour H ∨ PopularAmongLocals H

-- Prove H does not have many negative reviews
theorem no_many_neg_reviews_H : ¬ ManyNegativeReviews H := by
  cases A5 with
  | inl rating_high => 
      apply A1 H
      apply A2 H rating_high
  | inr popular => 
      have rating_high := A4 H popular
      apply A1 H
      apply A2 H rating_high

-- Attempt to prove TakeOutService H (to refute ¬TakeOutService H)
-- But cannot be proven: A3 shows existence of a non-take-out restaurant with negative reviews,
-- but H has no negative reviews, so it doesn't force H to provide take-out service.
</lean>

**Explanation:**
- From `A5`, the Hamden Plaza store either has a rating >4 or is popular, leading (via `A4` and `A2`) to it being listed (`Listed H`).
- From `A1`, this implies it does not have many negative reviews (`¬ManyNegativeReviews H`).
- `A3` states there exists some restaurant without take-out service that has many negative reviews, but this does not constrain the Hamden Plaza store, which has no negative reviews.
- There is no premise linking take-out service to ratings, popularity, or reviews in a way that forces the Hamden Plaza store to provide take-out service. Thus, we cannot prove `TakeOutService H`.
