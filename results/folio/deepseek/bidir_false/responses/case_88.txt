ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was used without an actual contradiction in the context. While we have two proofs of `BecomesSmarter Harry` (the assumption `h` and the derived proof `smarter`), this doesn't create a contradiction since both are consistent with the axioms. In fact, the axioms directly imply `BecomesSmarter Harry`, making the negation unprovable.

Here's the corrected Lean analysis:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Book : Type
axiom Harry : Person
axiom Walden : Book
axiom Reads : Person → Book → Prop
axiom GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop
axiom BecomesSmarter : Person → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p
axiom T2 : ∀ (p : Person), GainsKnowledge p → BecomesSmarter p
axiom T3 : Reads Harry Walden

-- Prove the positive statement (for demonstration)
theorem harry_is_smarter : BecomesSmarter Harry := 
  T2 Harry (T1 Harry Walden T3)

-- Attempt to prove the negation (¬BecomesSmarter Harry) fails
theorem cannot_disprove : ¬BecomesSmarter Harry → False := by
  intro h_neg
  have h_true : BecomesSmarter Harry := T2 Harry (T1 Harry Walden T3)
  exact h_neg h_true  -- Contradiction found here via explicit application

-- But note: This proves that ¬BecomesSmarter Harry leads to contradiction,
-- meaning the negation is false. However, we were required to prove the negation
-- directly from premises (without assuming it). Since the premises imply the positive,
-- the negation CANNOT be proven directly.
</lean>

**Key Insight**:  
While `cannot_disprove` shows that assuming the negation leads to contradiction (proving the statement must be true), we cannot construct a direct proof of `¬BecomesSmarter Harry` from the axioms alone. The premises entail that Harry became smarter, making the negation unprovable.
