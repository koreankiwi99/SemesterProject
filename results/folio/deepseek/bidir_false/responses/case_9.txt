The premises state that Tom is a wild turkey and there are exactly six types. The axioms explicitly rule out Tom being any of the first five types (Eastern, Osceola, Gould, Merriam, Rio Grande). Since the context specifies that these six types are exhaustive for wild turkeys, Tom must be the sixth type: Ocellated. Therefore, the statement "Tom is an Ocellated wild turkey" is true, and its negation cannot be proven from the given premises.

======================================================================

The error in the previous Lean code occurred because the proof attempted to apply a term of type `Ocellated Tom` as if it were a function, which is invalid. After re-evaluating the context, it's clear that the premises imply Tom must be an Ocellated wild turkey:

1. There are exactly six turkey types (exhaustively listed).
2. Tom is explicitly ruled out as any of the first five types.
3. Tom is confirmed to be a wild turkey.

Thus, the statement "Tom is an Ocellated wild turkey" is necessarily **true**, making its negation (`¬Ocellated Tom`) **unprovable** from the given premises. The corrected Lean code declares the axioms but cannot prove the negation.
