axiom obj : Type
axiom MT : obj
axiom Generation : obj → Prop
axiom Understanding : obj → Prop
axiom OutputTextSequence : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ t : obj, Generation t ∨ Understanding t
axiom A2 : ∀ t : obj, OutputTextSequence t → Generation t
axiom A3 : OutputTextSequence MT

-- We attempt to prove ¬Understanding MT
theorem not_understanding_MT : ¬Understanding MT := by
  have gen_MT : Generation MT := A2 MT A3
  -- We have Generation MT, but A1 allows both Generation and Understanding to hold simultaneously
  -- No axiom states that Generation and Understanding are mutually exclusive
  -- Therefore, we cannot derive a contradiction from Understanding MT
  -- Hence, we cannot prove ¬Understanding MT
  admit

-- Since the proof requires admission (cannot be completed), we conclude failure
