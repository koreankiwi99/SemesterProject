The statement to evaluate is: "The security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more." This translates to the deposit being ≥ $2000. The context includes:
- Managed buildings require a deposit ≥ monthly rent.
- Olive Garden is a managed building with rent $2000.
- Thus, the deposit at Olive Garden must be ≥ $2000.

Attempting to prove the negation (deposit < $2000) leads to a contradiction with the deposit rule. However, the premises do not provide any information that forces the deposit to be less than $2000. Specifically:
- Tom's rental conditions (requiring deposit ≤ $1500) apply only if he rents there, but there is no premise stating Tom rents at Olive Garden.
- Olive Garden's deposit is constrained to be ≥ $2000 by the deposit rule and its rent.
- No other premises override this constraint.

Therefore, the negation cannot be proven from the given premises.

-- Attempt to prove ¬(deposit olive_garden ≥ 2000) i.e., deposit olive_garden < 2000
theorem neg_deposit_goal : deposit olive_garden < 2000 := by
  -- From R1 and T1, we have deposit olive_garden ≥ rent olive_garden = 2000
  have H_deposit_ge : deposit olive_garden ≥ rent olive_garden := R1 olive_garden T1
  rw [T2] at H_deposit_ge
  -- This gives deposit olive_garden ≥ 2000, which contradicts deposit olive_garden < 2000
  -- However, we cannot prove the strict inequality < 2000 from the premises
  -- No tactics can resolve this contradiction without additional assumptions forcing deposit < 2000
  sorry  -- Proof failure

-- Since the negation cannot be proven, we conclude Failure
