The goal is to prove the negation of the statement: "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law." The negation is: "The Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company and it does not have legal obligations and it is not created under law." However, the premises lead to contradictions when assuming this negation:

1. If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company:
   - It is a company (by premise 3).
   - It is a business organization (by premise 2).
   - It is a legal entity (by premise 1).
   - It is created under law (by premise 4).
   - It has legal obligations (by premise 5).

2. Premise 6 states that if it is created under law, then it is not a private company, contradicting the initial assumption.

Thus, the negation leads to contradictions, meaning it cannot be proven from the premises. Therefore, the answer is Failure.

axiom P4 : ∀ x, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom P5 : ∀ x, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom P6 : ∀ x, CreatedUnderLaw x → ¬PrivateCompany x

-- Attempt to prove the negation: PrivateCompany Harvard ∧ ¬HasLegalObligations Harvard ∧ ¬CreatedUnderLaw Harvard
-- This leads to contradictions:
--   1. PrivateCompany Harvard → LegalEntity Harvard (via P3, P2, P1)
--   2. LegalEntity Harvard → CreatedUnderLaw Harvard (P4) and HasLegalObligations Harvard (P5)
--   3. CreatedUnderLaw Harvard → ¬PrivateCompany Harvard (P6), contradicting the initial PrivateCompany Harvard
-- Therefore, the negation is unprovable.
