The goal is to prove that "Harry is a queen bee" is false from the given premises. The premises state:

1. All animals are invertebrates or vertebrates.
2. All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
3. All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
4. All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
5. All queen bees are bees.
6. Harry is a bee.

The conclusion to disprove is: "Harry is a queen bee."

In Lean, we formalize the entities and predicates. Note that "bees" are not explicitly stated to be animals, so we cannot assume `Bee x → Animal x`. The axioms are:

- `Animal x`: x is an animal.
- `Invertebrate x`: x is an invertebrate.
- `Vertebrate x`: x is a vertebrate.
- `Backbone x`: x has a backbone.
- `Reproduce x`: x reproduces by male-and-female mating.
- `Bee x`: x is a bee.
- `QueenBee x`: x is a queen bee.
- `Harry`: a specific individual.

Axioms:
1. `∀ x, Animal x → (Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x)`
2. `∀ x, Animal x → Backbone x → Reproduce x`
3. `∀ x, Animal x → Vertebrate x → Backbone x`
4. `∀ x, Bee x → ¬ Reproduce x`
5. `∀ x, QueenBee x → Bee x`
6. `Bee Harry`

To prove `¬ QueenBee Harry`, we assume `QueenBee Harry` and seek a contradiction. From `QueenBee Harry` and axiom 5, we get `Bee Harry` (already known). From axiom 4, `¬ Reproduce Harry`. However, we have no information that Harry is an animal (`Animal Harry` is not given). Without `Animal Harry`, we cannot use axioms 1-3 to derive a requirement for Harry to reproduce or have a backbone. Thus, no contradiction arises, and we cannot prove the negation.

ITERATION 2

After analyzing the reasoning text, I realize the key issue is that we lack the premise that bees are animals. Without knowing Bee x → Animal x, we cannot apply the vertebrate/invertebrate classification to Harry. Here's the corrected Lean formalization:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom Bee : obj → Prop
axiom QueenBee : obj → Prop
axiom Reproduce : obj → Prop
axiom Vertebrate : obj → Prop
axiom Backbone : obj → Prop
axiom Harry : obj

axiom A1 : ∀ x, Animal x → Vertebrate x ∨ ¬Vertebrate x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Animal x → Backbone x → Reproduce x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, Animal x → Vertebrate x → Backbone x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, Bee x → ¬ Reproduce x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, QueenBee x → Bee x
axiom A6 : Bee Harry

-- Attempt to prove ¬QueenBee Harry
theorem disprove : ¬ QueenBee Harry := 
  fun hQueen : QueenBee Harry =>
  have hBee : Bee Harry := A5 Harry hQueen
  have no_rep : ¬ Reproduce Harry := A4 Harry hBee
  -- Cannot progress without Animal Harry
  -- Show animal classification would be required for contradiction
  have : Animal Harry → False := fun hAnimal =>
    have vert_or_not : Vertebrate Harry ∨ ¬Vertebrate Harry := A1 Harry hAnimal
    vert_or_not.elim
      (fun hVert : Vertebrate Harry =>
        have has_backbone : Backbone Harry := A3 Harry hAnimal hVert
        have must_rep : Reproduce Harry := A2 Harry hAnimal has_backbone
        no_rep must_rep)
      (fun notVert => ?u) -- No contradiction for invertebrates
  sorry  -- Missing Animal Harry premise

-- Since proof requires non-existent Animal Harry, our attempt fails
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

Explanation: We cannot prove "Harry is a queen bee" is false because:
1. We know Harry is a bee and bees don't reproduce via mating
2. But we don't know if Harry is an animal
3. The reproduction constraints only apply to animals
4. Without Animal Harry, we cannot derive a contradiction from him being a queen bee
The missing animal classification prevents completing the proof.

======================================================================
ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the proof attempted to handle the case where Harry is not a vertebrate but did not provide a contradiction for that branch. After careful analysis, I confirm that **no contradiction can be derived** because:

1. The axioms do not state that bees are animals
2. Without `Animal Harry`, we cannot apply vertebrate/invertebrate classification
3. Even if Harry were an animal, invertebrates have no reproduction constraints
4. Harry being a queen bee introduces no contradiction with the given axioms

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom Bee : obj → Prop
axiom QueenBee : obj → Prop
axiom Reproduce : obj → Prop
axiom Vertebrate : obj → Prop
axiom Backbone : obj → Prop
axiom Harry : obj

axiom A1 : ∀ x, Animal x → (Vertebrate x ∨ ¬Vertebrate x)
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Animal x → Backbone x → Reproduce x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, Animal x → Vertebrate x → Backbone x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, Bee x → ¬ Reproduce x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, QueenBee x → Bee x
axiom A6 : Bee Harry

-- Cannot prove ¬QueenBee Harry because:
-- 1. Missing Animal Harry premise
-- 2. No contradiction for invertebrate case
-- 3. QueenBee Harry doesn't force reproduction constraints
