The context states that Tom is a wild turkey and explicitly rules out five of the six possible types: Eastern, Osceola, Gould's, Merriam, and Rio Grande. This leaves Ocellated as the only remaining possibility. The statement to evaluate claims Tom is an Eastern wild turkey, which directly contradicts the premise "Tom is not an Eastern wild turkey." Therefore, it is impossible to prove the statement from the given premises.

<lean>
inductive TurkeyKind : Type
  | Eastern
  | Osceola
  | Goulds
  | Merriam
  | RioGrande
  | Ocellated

axiom Turkey : Type

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the Ocellated branch in the proof attempt did not produce a contradiction. However, the key issue is that the premises directly contradict the conclusion. The context explicitly states "Tom is not an Eastern wild turkey" while the conclusion attempts to prove that Tom is Eastern. This is impossible given the axioms.

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
inductive TurkeyKind : Type
  | Eastern
  | Osceola
  | Goulds
  | Merriam
  | RioGrande
  | Ocellated

axiom Turkey : Type
axiom kind : Turkey → TurkeyKind
axiom Tom : Turkey

axiom not_Eastern : kind Tom ≠ TurkeyKind.Eastern
axiom not_Osceola : kind Tom ≠ TurkeyKind.Osceola
axiom not_Goulds : kind Tom ≠ TurkeyKind.Goulds
axiom not_Merriam : kind Tom ≠ TurkeyKind.Merriam
axiom not_RioGrande : kind Tom ≠ TurkeyKind.RioGrande

-- Attempt to prove Tom is Eastern wild turkey
theorem tom_is_Eastern : kind Tom = TurkeyKind.Eastern := 
  by
    -- Directly use the contradiction axiom
    exact not_Eastern.elim (id (α := kind Tom = TurkeyKind.Eastern))
</lean>

**Compilation Result:**  
The code still fails to compile because `not_Eastern.elim` expects a proof of `kind Tom = TurkeyKind.Eastern` to derive a contradiction, but no such proof exists. The term `id (α := kind Tom = TurkeyKind.Eastern)` is insufficient to prove the equality.

**Conclusion:**  
The premises directly contradict the conclusion ("Tom is an Eastern wild turkey") via the axiom `not_Eastern`. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given context.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the Ocellated branch in the proof attempt couldn't resolve the goal. The context explicitly states that Tom is not an Eastern turkey (via `not_Eastern`), while the conclusion requires proving Tom is Eastern. This is impossible given the axioms. The proof fails because:
1. Tom must be Ocellated (the only unruled-out type)
2. Ocellated cannot be proven equal to Eastern (distinct constructors)
3. The conclusion directly contradicts axiom `not_Eastern`

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
inductive TurkeyKind : Type
  | Eastern
  | Osceola
  | Goulds
  | Merriam
  | RioGrande
  | Ocellated

axiom Turkey : Type
axiom kind : Turkey → TurkeyKind
axiom Tom : Turkey

axiom not_Eastern : kind Tom ≠ TurkeyKind.Eastern
axiom not_Osceola : kind Tom ≠ TurkeyKind.Osceola
axiom not_Goulds : kind Tom ≠ TurkeyKind.Goulds
axiom not_Merriam : kind Tom ≠ TurkeyKind.Merriam
axiom not_RioGrande : kind Tom ≠ TurkeyKind.RioGrande

theorem tom_is_Eastern : kind Tom = TurkeyKind.Eastern := by
  cases h : kind Tom
  . exact (not_Eastern h).elim  -- Contradiction: Eastern case
  . exact (not_Osceola h).elim  -- Contradiction: Osceola case
  . exact (not_Goulds h).elim   -- Contradiction: Goulds case
  . exact (not_Merriam h).elim  -- Contradiction: Merriam case
  . exact (not_RioGrande h).elim  -- Contradiction: RioGrande case
  . -- Ocellated case: 
    apply not_Eastern  -- Attempt to show contradiction
    rw [h]            -- Now need Ocellated = Eastern
    sorry              -- Cannot prove distinct constructors equal
</lean>
