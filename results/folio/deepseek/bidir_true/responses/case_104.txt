The reasoning involves proving that ETS provides financial aid to Tom based on the given context. The key steps are:

1. Tom is applying for the GRE test (given)
2. Tom lives in a single-parent family (given)
3. Tom has few resources (given)
4. Axiom: Anyone living in a single-parent family OR having few resources can prove economic hardship
5. Since Tom satisfies both conditions (single-parent family AND few resources), he proves economic hardship
6. Axiom: ETS provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship
7. Therefore, ETS provides financial aid to Tom

The cost comparison ($205 vs $300) is irrelevant to the logical deduction about Tom's eligibility.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Tom : Person
axiom GREApplicant : Person → Prop
axiom FinancialAid : Person → Prop
axiom EconomicHardship : Person → Prop
axiom SingleParentFamily : Person → Prop
axiom FewResources : Person → Prop

axiom ets_rule : ∀ (p : Person), GREApplicant p → EconomicHardship p → FinancialAid p
axiom hardship_rule : ∀ (p : Person), SingleParentFamily p ∨ FewResources p → EconomicHardship p
axiom tom_applicant : GREApplicant Tom
axiom tom_family : SingleParentFamily Tom
axiom tom_resources : FewResources Tom

theorem tom_aid : FinancialAid Tom := by
  apply ets_rule Tom
  · exact tom_applicant
  · apply hardship_rule Tom
    exact Or.inl tom_family  -- Tom satisfies single-parent condition

ANSWER: True
