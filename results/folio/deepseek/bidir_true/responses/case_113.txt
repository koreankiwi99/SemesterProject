The reasoning involves determining the location of the Harding Pegmatite Mine based on the given premises. The key points are:
1. The Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico or Texas.
2. The mine is located in the Picuris Mountains and was donated.
3. No Texas mountain range has donated mines.

Since the mine is donated and located in the Picuris Mountains, the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas (as that would violate premise 3). Therefore, they must be in New Mexico. Thus, the mine is located in a mountain range in New Mexico. The statement claims the mine is *not* located in a mountain range in New Mexico, which contradicts the derived conclusion. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven true from the premises.

-- Attempt to prove the statement: "The Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico"
-- This would require proving: ¬ ∃ r, InNewMexico r ∧ located_in HardingPegmatiteMine r
-- But we have evidence that it IS located in New Mexico:
theorem mine_in_new_mexico_range : ∃ r, InNewMexico r ∧ located_in HardingPegmatiteMine r := by
  exists PicurisMountains
  exact ⟨in_new_mexico, mine_location⟩

-- Since we proved ∃ r, InNewMexico r ∧ located_in HardingPegmatiteMine r, 
-- its negation (the statement) cannot be proven. Thus, we return Failure.
