ANSWER: True

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to the use of the `by_contra` tactic without classical reasoning support. To resolve this, I've added the law of excluded middle as an axiom and restructured the proof to use case analysis. This allows us to prove that Windy jumps when shooting by contradiction, which then enables us to conclude that Windy is a great shooter.

Here's the corrected Lean code:
