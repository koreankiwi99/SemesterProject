The premises state:
- Barutin Cove is located in Snow Island (from being on its coast).
- Snow Island is located in the South Shetland Islands.
- Antarctica is located in the South Shetland Islands (interpreted from "located on").
- Transitivity: If A is in B and B is in C, then A is in C.

The goal is to prove: Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica.

Using transitivity:
- Barutin Cove → Snow Island → South Shetland Islands (proven).
- Antarctica → South Shetland Islands (given).

No premise states that South Shetland Islands is contained within Antarctica or that locations within South Shetland Islands are mutually exclusive. Thus, Barutin Cove and Antarctica both being in South Shetland Islands does not imply Barutin Cove is in Antarctica. However, there is also no evidence to prove the negation (that Barutin Cove is NOT in Antarctica). The transitivity axiom cannot force this negative conclusion without additional premises about Antarctica's containment structure or disjointness.

The errors in the previous Lean code were due to inconsistent naming and the presence of an unnecessary intermediate theorem. Here's the corrected version:

<lean>
axiom Place : Type
axiom Barutin_Cove : Place
axiom Snow_Island : Place
axiom South_Shetland_Islands : Place
axiom Antarctica : Place
axiom located_in : Place → Place → Prop

axiom A1 : located_in Barutin_Cove Snow_Island
axiom A2 : located_in Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands
axiom A3 : located_in Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands
axiom Trans : ∀ (A B C : Place), located_in A B → located_in B C → located_in A C

-- Attempt to prove ¬located_in Barutin_Cove Antarctica
example : ¬located_in Barutin_Cove Antarctica := 
  by
    -- No available premises to derive a contradiction
    -- or establish negative relationship. Proof fails.
    sorry
</lean>

### Explanation:
1. **Consistent Naming**: Fixed the typo `land_Islands` → `South_Shetland_Islands`
2. **Removed Intermediate Theorem**: The unnecessary `Barutin_in_SSI` was causing compilation issues
3. **Proof Attempt**: 
   - `example` directly targets the negation statement
   - The proof fails since premises only confirm:
     - Barutin_Cove → Snow_Island → South_Shetland_Islands
     - Antarctica → South_Shetland_Islands
   - Neither disjointness nor containment properties exist to prove `¬located_in Barutin_Cove Antarctica`

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because `Trans` is a reserved name in Lean 4 (used for typeclass resolution). Renaming the transitivity axiom resolves the issue. The premises establish:
- Barutin Cove → Snow Island → South Shetland Islands
- Antarctica → South Shetland Islands

No axioms exist to prove mutual exclusivity or containment relationships that would support the negation. The proof attempt fails.
