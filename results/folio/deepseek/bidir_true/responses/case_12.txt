The reasoning focuses on the key premises: if a game sells over one million copies, it is on the Top 10 list, and The Legend of Zelda sold over one million copies. The Japanese company information is irrelevant to this conclusion. The Lean proof directly applies the third premise to the fourth premise.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom zelda : obj
axiom OnTop10 : obj → Prop
axiom SellsOver1M : obj → Prop
axiom over1M_in_top10 : ∀ g : obj, SellsOver1M g → OnTop10 g
axiom zelda_sold_over_1M : SellsOver1M zelda
theorem zelda_top10 : OnTop10 zelda := by
  exact over1M_in_top10 zelda zelda_sold_over_1M
</lean>

ANSWER: True
