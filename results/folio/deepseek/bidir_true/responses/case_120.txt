axiom obj : Type
axiom Affection : obj → Prop
axiom Love : obj → Prop
axiom Positive : obj → Prop
axiom premise1 : ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Love x
axiom premise2 : ∃ y, Love y ∧ Positive y

-- The conclusion we want is: ∃ z, Affection z ∧ Positive z
-- However, there is no connection between the x from premise1 and y from premise2.
-- We cannot assume they are the same object. Therefore, we cannot prove the conclusion.

-- Attempt to prove fails because:
-- Let a be the witness from premise1 (Affection a ∧ Love a)
-- Let b be the witness from premise2 (Love b ∧ Positive b)
-- Without knowing a = b, we cannot combine Affection a with Positive b.

theorem desired_conclusion : ∃ z, Affection z ∧ Positive z := by
  cases premise1 with | intro a ha =>
  cases premise2 with | intro b hb =>
  -- We have ha : Affection a ∧ Love a, hb : Love b ∧ Positive b
  -- But no way to relate a and b
  -- Cannot produce a witness that is both Affection and Positive
  -- Therefore, proof fails
  sorry -- This indicates we cannot prove it

-- Since we cannot fill the proof, we conclude Failure.
