-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then it is not a one-seater
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, TransportMultiple x → ¬ OneSeater x

-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, TeslaModel3 x → TransportMultiple x

-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x

-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x

-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car
axiom A5 : ¬ TeslaModel3 johns_car → (¬ TeslaModel3 johns_car ∨ SingleSeatElectricCar johns_car)

-- Attempt to prove: John's car is not a Solo EV

  -- We have no information about John's car type
  -- Cannot derive a contradiction or direct proof from given axioms
  sorry -- Proof fails
