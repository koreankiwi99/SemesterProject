The premises lead to the conclusion that Rock has wings, making it impossible to prove that Rock does not have wings. The reasoning is as follows:

- Rock is Peter's pet (A7).
- Peter's pets are either monkeys or birds (A3), so Rock is a monkey or a bird.
- If Rock is a bird (A4): Peter's birds can fly → Rock can fly → by A6, Rock has wings.
- If Rock is a monkey (A2): Monkeys are mammals → Rock is a mammal → by A1, Rock is an animal → by A5, Rock can breathe. A8 states: Rock can fly ∨ Rock is a bird ∨ ¬Rock can breathe. Since Rock is a monkey (not a bird) and can breathe, A8 forces Rock can fly → by A6, Rock has wings.
- In all cases, Rock has wings, so ¬HasWings(Rock) is false and cannot be proven.
