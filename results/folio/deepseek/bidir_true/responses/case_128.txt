-- All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, WeddingPlans x → Engaged x
-- All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, InviteOthers x → WeddingPlans x
-- Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, WellAttendedWedding x → InviteOthers x
-- Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families. (Not needed for John)
axiom A4 : ∃ x : Person, WellAttendedWedding x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InviteFriends John ∧ WeddingPlans John)
-- If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttendedWedding John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- Attempt to prove: John does not have a larger family (¬LargerFamily John)
theorem john_no_larger_family : ¬LargerFamily John := by
  -- Assume John has a larger family for contradiction
  intro hLarger
  -- Apply A6 to get two cases
  have hCases := A6 hLarger
  cases hCases with
  | inl hWellAttended =>
    -- Case 1: John has a well-attended wedding
    have hInviteOthers := A3 John hWellAttended
    have hWeddingPlans := A2 John hInviteOthers
    have hEngaged := A1 John hWeddingPlans
    -- Now use A5: Engaged John implies ¬(InviteFriends John ∧ WeddingPlans John)
    have hNoBoth := A5 hEngaged
    -- We have WeddingPlans John, so if we had InviteFriends John, it would be a contradiction
    -- But we don't have InviteFriends John, and there's no contradiction here
    -- This path doesn't produce a contradiction
    sorry
  | inr hInviteFriends =>
    -- Case 2: John invites friends
    -- There are no axioms that connect InviteFriends to contradictions with other predicates
    -- Specifically, no axiom prevents John from having a larger family while inviting friends
    -- Thus, no contradiction in this branch
    sorry
  -- Both branches fail to produce a contradiction
