The context provides several premises about people and their wedding-related activities, but none of them directly or indirectly force John to be engaged. The existential statement in premise 4 confirms that *some* person with a well-attended wedding has a larger family, but this person is not necessarily John. Premises 5 and 6 describe conditional relationships specific to John, but without additional information (e.g., whether John has a larger family or a well-attended wedding), we cannot derive that John is engaged. Thus, the statement "John is engaged" cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom John : Person
axiom engaged : Person → Prop
axiom makes_wedding_plans : Person → Prop
axiom invites_others : Person → Prop
axiom has_well_attended_wedding : Person → Prop
axiom has_larger_family : Person → Prop
axiom invites_friends : Person → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x : Person, makes_wedding_plans x → engaged x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : Person, invites_others x → makes_wedding_plans x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : Person, has_well_attended_wedding x → invites_others x
axiom P4 : ∃ x : Person, has_well_attended_wedding x ∧ has_larger_family x
axiom P5 : engaged John → ¬ (invites_friends John ∧ makes_wedding_plans John)
axiom P6 : has_larger_family John → (has_well_attended_wedding John ∨ invites_friends John)

-- No axioms force John to be engaged. 
-- P4 shows some person is engaged, but not necessarily John.
-- P5 and P6 describe implications about John but do not provide sufficient conditions to prove engagement.
