The context provides information about Legend of Zelda and general rules regarding game sales and the Top 10 list. However, there is no information about FIFA 22 in the premises. Specifically:

- We know Legend of Zelda was created by a Japanese company, sold over one million copies, and thus is on the Top 10 list.
- We know all games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese companies.
- But FIFA 22 is never mentioned – we have no data about its sales, its inclusion in the Top 10 list, or its developer.

Therefore, we cannot prove that FIFA 22 was made by a Japanese company based solely on the given premises.

axiom Game : Type
axiom zelda : Game
axiom fifa22 : Game
axiom Top10 : Game → Prop
axiom MadeByJapanese : Game → Prop
axiom SellsOver1M : Game → Prop

axiom created_zelda_japanese : MadeByJapanese zelda
axiom top10_japanese : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → MadeByJapanese g
axiom sales_implies_top10 : ∀ g : Game, SellsOver1M g → Top10 g
axiom zelda_sales : SellsOver1M zelda

-- No information about FIFA 22's sales or Top 10 status
-- Cannot prove MadeByJapanese fifa22
