The compilation errors occurred because the `contradiction` tactic couldn't automatically resolve the contradictions in the proof. Specifically:
1. In the unsupervised branch: `A3` (requires labeled data) contradicts `h_no_label` (doesn't require labeled data)
2. In the reinforcement branch: `A2` (not reinforcement) contradicts `h_reinf` (reinforcement)

The fix involves explicitly:
1. Using `exfalso` to change the goal to `False` when contradictions occur
2. Directly applying the contradictory hypotheses to derive `False`

Here's the corrected Lean code:
