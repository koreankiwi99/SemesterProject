The context and premises lead to the following reasoning:

1. The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with a machine learning algorithm (premise 3).
2. This algorithm requires labeled data (premise 5).
3. Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data (premise 2).
4. Therefore, the algorithm used cannot be unsupervised (since it requires labeled data).
5. Additionally, reinforcement learning is explicitly excluded (premise 4).
6. By process of elimination, the algorithm must be supervised learning (from categorization in premise 1).

The statement claims unsupervised learning is used, but we've deduced it cannot be unsupervised. Thus, we cannot prove the statement.
