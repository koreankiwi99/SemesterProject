The reasoning involves determining if "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" must be rated General Audience based on the given premises. The key premises are:
- All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
- "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for all ages.

However:
- If it is a family-friendly animated film, then it must be rated General Audience (directly from the premises).
- If it is only appropriate for all ages (without being family-friendly animated), there is no premise stating that appropriateness for all ages implies a General Audience rating. The only relevant implication is that General Audience rating implies appropriateness for all ages (the converse is not provided).

Since the disjunction does not guarantee that "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" is a family-friendly animated film, and appropriateness for all ages alone does not entail a General Audience rating, the conclusion cannot be proven.

axiom Film : Type
axiom AppropriateForAllAges : Film → Prop
axiom CanWatchWithoutGuidance : Film → Prop
axiom ContainsExcessiveContent : Film → Prop
axiom RatedGA : Film → Prop
axiom FamilyFriendlyAnimated : Film → Prop
axiom InFrozenSeries : Film → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ f : Film, AppropriateForAllAges f → CanWatchWithoutGuidance f
axiom A2 : ∀ f : Film, ContainsExcessiveContent f → ¬ CanWatchWithoutGuidance f
axiom A3 : ∀ f : Film, RatedGA f → AppropriateForAllAges f
axiom A4 : ∀ f : Film, FamilyFriendlyAnimated f → RatedGA f
axiom A5 : ∀ f : Film, InFrozenSeries f → FamilyFriendlyAnimated f
axiom Hachi : Film
axiom A7 : FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi

theorem goal : RatedGA Hachi := by
  cases A7 with
  | inl h => exact A4 Hachi h
  | inr h => 
      -- Cannot prove RatedGA Hachi from AppropriateForAllAges Hachi alone.
      -- A3 only provides RatedGA → AppropriateForAllAges, not the converse.
