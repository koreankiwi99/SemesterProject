The reasoning involves analyzing the premises to determine if the statement about "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" can be proven. The key steps are:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - If a film is appropriate for all ages, children can watch it without guidance (`P1`).
   - If a film contains excessive content, children cannot watch it without guidance (`P2`).
   - General Audience rating implies appropriate for all ages (`P3`).
   - Family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience (`P4`).
   - Frozen series films are family-friendly animated (`P5`).
   - Hachi is either family-friendly animated or appropriate for all ages (`P6`).

2. **Deduction for Hachi**:
   - From `P6`, Hachi is family-friendly animated or appropriate for all ages.
   - Both cases lead to `CanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi` (via `P4`/`P3`/`P1` or directly `P1`).
   - `P2` implies that if a film has excessive content, it cannot be watched without guidance. Since Hachi can be watched without guidance, it cannot have excessive content (`¬ContainsExcessive Hachi`).

3. **Statement Evaluation**:
   - The statement is: `(ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ InFrozenSeries Hachi) ∨ (¬ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi)`.
   - Since `ContainsExcessive Hachi` is false, the first disjunct is false.
   - The second disjunct requires `¬InFrozenSeries Hachi`, but no premise provides information about whether Hachi is in the Frozen series.
   - Without evidence that Hachi is not in the Frozen series, the second disjunct cannot be proven.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The statement cannot be proven from the premises, resulting in "Failure".

  have hNoExcessive := no_excessive
  -- We have ¬ContainsExcessive Hachi, but we have no information about InFrozenSeries Hachi.
  -- We cannot prove ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi, so the second conjunct of the right disjunct is missing.
  -- Therefore, we cannot complete the proof.
  sorry -- This indicates we cannot prove the theorem
