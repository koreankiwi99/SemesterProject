The reasoning involves translating the given context and statement into logical predicates and proving the statement using Lean.

**Key Points:**
1. "Breeding back is a form of artificial selection" implies that anything bred back is artificially selected: `∀x, BredBack x → ArtificiallySelected x`.
2. "Heck cattle were bred back" implies there exists at least one Heck cattle that was bred back: `∃x, HeckCattle x ∧ BredBack x`.
3. Combining these, we can prove there exists a Heck cattle that is artificially selected: `∃x, HeckCattle x ∧ ArtificiallySelected x`.

The unused premises ("Heck cattle are animals", "Aurochs are animals", and "Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals") are irrelevant to the conclusion.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HeckCattle : obj → Prop
axiom BredBack : obj → Prop
axiom ArtificiallySelected : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, BredBack x → ArtificiallySelected x
axiom A2 : ∃ x, HeckCattle x ∧ BredBack x

theorem some_heck_selected : ∃ x, HeckCattle x ∧ ArtificiallySelected x := by
  rcases A2 with ⟨w, hw₁, hw₂⟩
  exists w
  exact ⟨hw₁, A1 w hw₂⟩

ANSWER: True
