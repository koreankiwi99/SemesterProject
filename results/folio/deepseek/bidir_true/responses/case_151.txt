The context states that New Vessel Press publishes books translated into English, but it does not specify that all their books are translated from Italian. While Neapolitan Chronicles was translated from Italian, Palace of Flies could have been translated from a different language. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Book : Type
axiom NewVesselPress : Book → Prop
axiom TranslatedFromItalian : Book → Prop
axiom neapolitanChronicles : Book
axiom palaceOfFlies : Book
axiom published_nvc : NewVesselPress neapolitanChronicles
axiom translated_nvc : TranslatedFromItalian neapolitanChronicles
axiom published_pof : NewVesselPress palaceOfFlies
-- No axiom links NewVesselPress publication to Italian translation universally
-- Counterexample: Palace of Flies could be translated from French
