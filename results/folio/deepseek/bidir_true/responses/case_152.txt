The context provides information about hydrocarbons, organic compounds, chemical compounds, and their properties. The mixture is introduced with a specific disjunction: it is either (a chemical compound and contains only one element) or (not a chemical compound and not containing only one element). However, axiom 5 states that no chemical compound contains only one element, making the first disjunct impossible. Therefore, the mixture must not be a chemical compound and must not contain only one element.

The statement to evaluate is whether the mixture contains carbon. Axiom 4 states that all organic compounds contain carbon, but organic compounds are a subset of chemical compounds (by axioms 1 and 3). Since the mixture is not a chemical compound, it cannot be an organic compound. There are no axioms stating that non-chemical compounds must contain carbon or that everything containing carbon must be a chemical compound. Thus, there is insufficient information to prove that the mixture contains carbon.

  -- Attempting to use A4 requires OrganicCompound mixture, which requires ChemicalCompound mixture (A3), contradiction

  have : ¬ OrganicCompound mixture := fun h => this (A3 mixture h)
