The reasoning in the context leads to a proof of the statement. Here's the Lean formalization:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mixture : obj
axiom Hydrocarbon : obj → Prop
axiom OrganicCompound : obj → Prop
axiom Alkane : obj → Prop
axiom ChemicalCompound : obj → Prop
axiom ContainsCarbon : obj → Prop
axiom ContainsOnlyOneElement : obj → Prop

-- Context axioms
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Hydrocarbon x → OrganicCompound x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Alkane x → Hydrocarbon x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, OrganicCompound x → ChemicalCompound x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, OrganicCompound x → ContainsCarbon x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, ChemicalCompound x → ¬ ContainsOnlyOneElement x
axiom A6 : (ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture) ∨ (¬ ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ¬ ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture)

-- Prove: (ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture ∨ ContainsCarbon Mixture) → (¬ ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ¬ Alkane Mixture)
theorem statement_proof : (ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture ∨ ContainsCarbon Mixture) → (¬ ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ¬ Alkane Mixture) :=
  fun h_antecedent => 
  have h_case : ¬ ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ¬ ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture := by
    cases A6 with
    | inl h => 
      have := A5 Mixture h.left
      contradiction
    | inr h => exact h

  have h_not_chem := h_case.left
  have h_not_alkane : ¬ Alkane Mixture := by
    intro h_alkane
    have h_hc : Hydrocarbon Mixture := A2 Mixture h_alkane
    have h_org : OrganicCompound Mixture := A1 Mixture h_hc
    have h_chem : ChemicalCompound Mixture := A3 Mixture h_org
    contradiction

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic failed to resolve the contradiction in the `inl` branch. The error happened when trying to prove `¬ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ¬ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture` from contradictory premises (both `ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture` and its negation). The fix involves explicitly using `False.elim` with the contradiction derived from the axioms.

Here is the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mixture : obj
axiom Hydrocarbon : obj → Prop
axiom OrganicCompound : obj → Prop
axiom Alkane : obj → Prop
axiom ChemicalCompound : obj → Prop
axiom ContainsCarbon : obj → Prop
axiom ContainsOnlyOneElement : obj → Prop

-- Context axioms
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Hydrocarbon x → OrganicCompound x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Alkane x → Hydrocarbon x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, OrganicCompound x → ChemicalCompound x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, OrganicCompound x → ContainsCarbon x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, ChemicalCompound x → ¬ ContainsOnlyOneElement x
axiom A6 : (ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture) ∨ (¬ ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ¬ ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture)

-- Prove: (ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture ∨ ContainsCarbon Mixture) → (¬ ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ¬ Alkane Mixture)
theorem statement_proof : (ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture ∨ ContainsCarbon Mixture) → (¬ ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ¬ Alkane Mixture) :=
  fun _ =>  -- Antecedent unused since consequent is provable unconditionally
  have h_case : ¬ ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ¬ ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture := by
    cases A6 with
    | inl h => exact False.elim (A5 Mixture h.left h.right)
    | inr h => exact h

  have h_not_chem := h_case.left
  have h_not_alkane : ¬ Alkane Mixture := by
    intro h_alkane
    have h_hc : Hydrocarbon Mixture := A2 Mixture h_alkane
    have h_org : OrganicCompound Mixture := A1 Mixture h_hc
    have h_chem : ChemicalCompound Mixture := A3 Mixture h_org
    exact h_not_chem h_chem

  ⟨h_not_chem, h_not_alkane⟩
</lean>

The proof demonstrates that:
1. From `A6` and `A5`, we derive `¬ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ¬ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture` unconditionally (using `False.elim` in the contradictory case).
2. Assuming `Alkane Mixture` leads to `ChemicalCompound Mixture` (via `A2`, `A1`, `A3`), contradicting `¬ChemicalCompound Mixture`.
3. The antecedent `ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture ∨ ContainsCarbon Mixture` is unused since the consequent holds unconditionally from the axioms.

Thus, the statement is provable.
