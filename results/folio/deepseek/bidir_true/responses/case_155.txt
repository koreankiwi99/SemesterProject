The reasoning involves evaluating whether "Some Greeks are mortal" follows from the premises "All humans are mortal" and "All Greeks are humans". 

- The premises establish universal implications:  
  1. ∀x, Human x → Mortal x  
  2. ∀x, Greek x → Human x  
- These imply that any Greek is mortal (via transitivity: Greek → Human → Mortal).  
- However, the conclusion requires existential quantification: ∃x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x.  
- The premises do not assert the existence of any Greek individual. Without an existential premise (e.g., ∃x, Greek x), the conclusion cannot be proven.  

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Greek : obj → Prop
axiom Mortal : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : ∀ x, Human x → Mortal x
axiom T2 : ∀ x, Greek x → Human x

-- No proof exists for ∃x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x without an existential premise.
-- Example countermodel: empty domain (no objects) makes premises vacuously true but conclusion false.
