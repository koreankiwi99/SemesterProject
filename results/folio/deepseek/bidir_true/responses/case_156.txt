The context includes a contradiction: James is stated to be working in the lab (Premise 6), but also stated to not work in the lab or have a part-time job (Premise 7). This contradiction allows us to prove any statement, including the claim that James has a part-time job, through the principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet).

axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj
axiom WorksInLibrary : obj → Prop
axiom FromCS : obj → Prop
axiom HasPTJob : obj → Prop
axiom TakesDatabase : obj → Prop
axiom TakesClassWithDavid : obj → Prop
axiom WorksInLab : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x, WorksInLibrary x → ¬ FromCS x
axiom P2 : ∀ x, HasPTJob x → WorksInLibrary x
axiom P3 : ∀ x, TakesDatabase x → FromCS x
axiom P4 : ∀ x, TakesClassWithDavid x → TakesDatabase x
axiom P5 : ∀ x, WorksInLab x → TakesClassWithDavid x
axiom P6 : WorksInLab James
axiom P7 : ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasPTJob James)

theorem james_has_job : HasPTJob James := by
  have H : False := P7 (Or.inl P6)
  exact False.elim H

ANSWER: True
