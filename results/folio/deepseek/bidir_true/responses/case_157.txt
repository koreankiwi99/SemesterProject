The premises lead to a contradiction because James is stated to work in the lab (A6), but the last premise (A7) claims he does not work in the lab or have a part-time job. Despite this inconsistency, the conclusion that James does not have a part-time job can be directly derived from A7 alone, as the negation of a disjunction implies both conjuncts are false. Thus, the statement is provable from the given axioms.

<lean>
axiom Student : Type
axiom James : Student
axiom worksInLibrary : Student → Prop
axiom fromCS : Student → Prop
axiom hasUniPartTimeJob : Student → Prop
axiom takingDatabase : Student → Prop
axiom takingClassWithDavid : Student → Prop
axiom worksInLab : Student → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ s, worksInLibrary s → ¬ fromCS s
axiom A2 : ∀ s, hasUniPartTimeJob s → worksInLibrary s
axiom A3 : ∀ s, takingDatabase s → fromCS s
axiom A4 : ∀ s, takingClassWithDavid s → takingDatabase s
axiom A5 : ∀ s, worksInLab s → takingClassWithDavid s
axiom A6 : worksInLab James
axiom A7 : ¬ (worksInLab James ∨ hasUniPartTimeJob James)

theorem james_no_job : ¬ hasUniPartTimeJob James := by
  exact (not_or.mp A7).2
