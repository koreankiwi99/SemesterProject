The premises lead to a contradiction. Specifically, axiom A6 states that James works in the lab, while axiom A7 states that James does not work in the lab or have a part-time job. Since James works in the lab (A6), the disjunction in A7 is true, contradicting A7. From this contradiction, any conclusion follows, including the statement that James either takes the database course or has a part-time job.

axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj

axiom WorkInLibrary : obj → Prop
axiom CSDepartment : obj → Prop
axiom HasPartTimeJob : obj → Prop
axiom TakesDatabase : obj → Prop
axiom TakesClassWithDavid : obj → Prop
axiom WorksInLab : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, WorkInLibrary x → ¬ CSDepartment x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, HasPartTimeJob x → WorkInLibrary x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, TakesDatabase x → CSDepartment x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, TakesClassWithDavid x → TakesDatabase x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, WorksInLab x → TakesClassWithDavid x
axiom A6 : WorksInLab James
axiom A7 : ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasPartTimeJob James)

  have H : WorksInLab James ∨ HasPartTimeJob James := Or.inl A6

ANSWER: True
