The premises establish that Rockie is spotted near the campus and calm. By the third premise, any spotted animal must be a rabbit or squirrel. If Rockie were a squirrel, the fifth premise would imply it is skittish, and the fourth premise would then contradict its calmness. Thus, Rockie must be a rabbit. However, the second premise states that some turtle is spotted, but this does not necessitate that Rockie is that turtle. Without additional axioms (e.g., disjoint animal types or identification of Rockie with the turtle), "Rockie is a turtle" cannot be proven from the given premises.

axiom Animal : Type
axiom Rockie : Animal
axiom SpottedNearCampus : Animal → Prop
axiom Rabbit : Animal → Prop
axiom Squirrel : Animal → Prop
axiom Turtle : Animal → Prop
axiom Cute : Animal → Prop
axiom Skittish : Animal → Prop
axiom Calm : Animal → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ a : Animal, Rabbit a ∧ SpottedNearCampus a → Cute a
axiom A2 : ∃ a : Animal, Turtle a ∧ SpottedNearCampus a
axiom A3 : ∀ a : Animal, SpottedNearCampus a → Rabbit a ∨ Squirrel a
axiom A4 : ∀ a : Animal, Skittish a → ¬ Calm a
axiom A5 : ∀ a : Animal, Squirrel a ∧ SpottedNearCampus a → Skittish a
axiom A6 : SpottedNearCampus Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

theorem rockie_is_turtle : Turtle Rockie := by
  -- Rockie is spotted and calm (A6)
  have hSpot : SpottedNearCampus Rockie := A6.left
  have hCalm : Calm Rockie := A6.right
  -- By A3, Rockie is rabbit or squirrel
  have hRabbitOrSquirrel : Rabbit Rockie ∨ Squirrel Rockie := A3 Rockie hSpot
  -- Eliminate squirrel case: leads to contradiction
  have hNotSquirrel : ¬ Squirrel Rockie := by

    have hSkittish : Skittish Rockie := A5 Rockie hSqSpot
    have hNotCalm : ¬ Calm Rockie := A4 Rockie hSkittish
    exact hNotCalm hCalm
  -- Thus, Rockie must be rabbit
  have hRabbit : Rabbit Rockie := by
    cases hRabbitOrSquirrel with

    | inr h => exact absurd h hNotSquirrel
  -- A2 provides a spotted turtle, but no link to Rockie
  -- Cannot prove Turtle Rockie from given axioms
