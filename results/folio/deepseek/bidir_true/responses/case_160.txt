Based on the context and statement, I'll translate the reasoning into Lean 4 code. The key predicates are: liking music, wanting to compose, having program access, being able to compose, and composing. The axioms establish conditional relationships between these properties.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom George : obj
axiom LikesMusic : obj → Prop
axiom WantsToCompose : obj → Prop
axiom HasAccessToProgram : obj → Prop
axiom CanCompose : obj → Prop
axiom WillCompose : obj → Prop

-- If George likes music, he wants to compose
axiom A1 : ∀ x, LikesMusic x → WantsToCompose x

-- If George has access to a program, he can compose
axiom A2 : ∀ x, HasAccessToProgram x → CanCompose x

-- If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose
axiom A3 : ∀ x, CanCompose x ∧ WantsToCompose x → WillCompose x

-- Theorem: If George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose
theorem george_composes : 
  LikesMusic George ∧ HasAccessToProgram George → WillCompose George := 
  fun h => 
  have likes_music : LikesMusic George := h.left
  has_access : HasAccessToProgram George := h.right
  have wants : WantsToCompose George := A1 George likes_music
  have can : CanCompose George := A2 George has_access
  show WillCompose George from A3 George ⟨can, wants⟩
</lean>

The proof shows the conclusion follows from the premises:
1. Assume George likes music and has program access
2. By axiom A1, he wants to compose
3. By axiom A2, he can compose
4. By axiom A3 (with both conditions satisfied), he will compose

ANSWER: True

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect syntax in the term mode proof. Specifically, the `has_access` line was missing the `have` keyword, causing Lean to misinterpret the colon as a type ascription in an invalid context. 

The corrected version uses tactic mode with explicit `have` statements and proper structure. The proof demonstrates that the conclusion follows logically from the premises:
1. Assume George likes music and has program access (introduction of hypothesis `h`)
2. Derive that George wants to compose (via axiom A1)
3. Derive that George can compose (via axiom A2)
4. Combine these facts to show George will compose (via axiom A3)
