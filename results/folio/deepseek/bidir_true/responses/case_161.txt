The statement "If George will not compose, George can not compose" does not logically follow from the given premises. The premises establish conditions under which George will compose (requiring both ability and desire), but do not preclude scenarios where George has the ability to compose but lacks the desire (resulting in no composition without inability).

The compilation error occurred because `not_and_or.mp` is not a built-in Lean theorem. The proof attempt has been restructured without this lemma. The goal is to prove that if George will not compose, then he cannot compose. However, after careful analysis, the proof cannot be completed due to insufficient information about George's desire to compose.
