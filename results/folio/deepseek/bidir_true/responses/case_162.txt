The premises state that hawks never swim and that some birds are hawks. This implies there exists at least one bird (a hawk) that does not swim. Therefore, the conclusion "All birds swim" cannot be true, as we have a counterexample (a hawk that is a bird but does not swim). Attempting to prove the universal statement fails due to this contradiction.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Hawk : obj → Prop
axiom Bird : obj → Prop
axiom Swims : obj → Prop
axiom P1 : ∀ x, Hawk x → ¬ Swims x
axiom P2 : ∃ x, Bird x ∧ Hawk x
theorem all_birds_swim : ∀ x, Bird x → Swims x := by
  intro x hBird
  -- We need to show Swims x, but we have no axiom connecting Bird x to Hawk x for arbitrary x
  -- From P2, we know there exists some y with Bird y and Hawk y, and by P1, ¬ Swims y
  -- This provides a counterexample, so we cannot prove the theorem
