The context provides premises that allow us to reason about shows, roses, and reality TV. The key points are:
1. There exists a show airing Monday at 8 pm that gives out roses.
2. Any show giving out roses is an episode of The Bachelor.
3. The Bachelor portrays real people.
4. Shows portraying real people are reality TV shows.
5. Breaking Bad is a show but not a reality TV show.

The statement claims Breaking Bad gives out roses on Monday at 8 pm. However, if Breaking Bad gave out roses, it would be an episode of The Bachelor (by premise 2). This would imply it portrays real people (premise 3) and thus is a reality TV show (premise 4). But premise 5 states Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, Breaking Bad cannot give out roses, making the statement unprovable.

The compilation error occurred because the placeholder proof attempted to use `by assumption` without having the required hypothesis in the context. After analysis, the conclusion cannot be proven from the premises. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Show : Type

axiom AirsMonday8 : Show → Prop
axiom GivesRoses : Show → Prop
axiom IsBachelorEpisode : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
axiom RealityTV : Show → Prop

axiom breaking_bad : Show

axiom A1 : ∃ s : Show, AirsMonday8 s ∧ GivesRoses s
axiom A2 : ∀ s : Show, GivesRoses s → IsBachelorEpisode s
axiom A3 : ∀ s : Show, IsBachelorEpisode s → PortraysRealPeople s
axiom A4 : ∀ s : Show, PortraysRealPeople s → RealityTV s
axiom A5 : ¬ RealityTV breaking_bad

-- Attempt to prove: GivesRoses breaking_bad ∧ AirsMonday8 breaking_bad
-- First, prove that Breaking Bad cannot give out roses
theorem no_roses : ¬ GivesRoses breaking_bad := 
  fun h : GivesRoses breaking_bad => 
    have h1 : IsBachelorEpisode breaking_bad := A2 breaking_bad h
    have h2 : PortraysRealPeople breaking_bad := A3 breaking_bad h1
    have h3 : RealityTV breaking_bad := A4 breaking_bad h2
    A5 h3

-- Since GivesRoses breaking_bad is false, the conjunction cannot be true
-- No proof exists for the original statement
</lean>
