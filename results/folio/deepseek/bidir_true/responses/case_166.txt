The context states that Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician, confirming he was German. The statement "Heinrich Schmidt was German or Russian or both" is logically equivalent to "He was German or Russian." Since we know he was German, this satisfies the disjunction (German ∨ Russian) regardless of whether he was Russian. Thus, the statement follows from the premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : obj
axiom German : obj → Prop
axiom Russian : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : German HeinrichSchmidt  -- From "German politician"
theorem statement : German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt :=
