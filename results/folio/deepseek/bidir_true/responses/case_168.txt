The context provides that Heinrich Schmidt is a politician and a member of the Nazi Reichstag. The statement claims that no politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag. However, Heinrich Schmidt serves as a counterexample: he is both a politician and a member of the Nazi Reichstag. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : obj
axiom Politician : obj → Prop
axiom MemberOfNaziReichstag : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : Politician HeinrichSchmidt
axiom P2 : MemberOfNaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt

-- Attempt to prove: ∀ x, Politician x → ¬ MemberOfNaziReichstag x
-- Counterexample: HeinrichSchmidt violates this universal claim.
-- Thus, the statement cannot be proven.
</lean>
