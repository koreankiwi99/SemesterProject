The given context does not provide sufficient information to prove that colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer. The premises establish relationships between deadly diseases, low survival rates, severe cancers, bile duct cancers, and cholangiocarcinoma. However, the only information about colorectal cancer is that it is not both a bile duct cancer and associated with a low survival rate. There are no premises linking colorectal cancer directly to severe cancers or providing any positive indication that colorectal cancer must be severe. The absence of such a connection means the conclusion cannot be derived from the given axioms.

axiom obj : Type

axiom DeadlyDisease : obj → Prop
axiom LowSurvivalRate : obj → Prop
axiom SevereCancer : obj → Prop
axiom BileDuctCancer : obj → Prop
axiom Cholangiocarcinoma : obj → Prop
axiom ColorectalCancer : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, DeadlyDisease x → LowSurvivalRate x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, SevereCancer x → DeadlyDisease x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x
axiom P6 : ∀ x : obj, ColorectalCancer x → ¬ (BileDuctCancer x ∧ LowSurvivalRate x)

-- No axioms force ColorectalCancer to imply SevereCancer
-- Attempted proof sketch:
--   Assume `hCC : ColorectalCancer x` for some `x`.
--   From `P6 x hCC`, we know it cannot be both bile duct cancer and low survival.
--   But no premise links colorectal cancer to severe cancer (directly or indirectly).
--   Without additional connections, the theorem fails.
