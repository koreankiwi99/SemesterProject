The reasoning involves analyzing the given premises to determine if "Rockie is not a turtle" can be proven. The key steps are:

1. **Premises analysis**:
   - Rockie is spotted and calm (given).
   - All spotted animals are rabbits or squirrels (premise 3).
   - If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish (premise 5), leading to not calm (premise 4), contradicting Rockie's calmness.
   - Thus, Rockie must be a rabbit.

2. **Proof attempt for "Rockie is not a turtle"**:
   - While Rockie is proven to be a rabbit, there is no premise stating rabbits cannot be turtles.
   - Premise 2 confirms some turtle is spotted, but it may not be Rockie.
   - No premise links turtles to calmness/skittishness in a way that creates a contradiction for Rockie being both rabbit and turtle.
   - Without disjointness between animal types (not provided), Rockie being a rabbit does not preclude it from being a turtle.

3. **Conclusion**: The statement "Rockie is not a turtle" cannot be proven from the premises.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect syntax in axiom declarations and theorem proofs. The primary issues were:
1. Using `constant` instead of `axiom` for declarations
2. Missing parentheses in quantified statements
3. Incorrect case syntax in the proof

After correction, the Lean code compiles and proves that Rockie is a rabbit, but cannot prove that Rockie is not a turtle due to:
- No disjointness axiom between animal types
- No premise linking turtles to calmness/skittishness
- Premise 2 (some turtle spotted) doesn't involve Rockie

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because I used the `fail` tactic instead of `sorry` to indicate an incomplete proof. After correcting this, the Lean code compiles successfully. The analysis shows:

1. Rockie is proven to be a rabbit (not a squirrel) because:
   - Rockie is spotted and calm
   - If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish (premise 5)
   - Skittish implies not calm (premise 4), contradicting Rockie's calmness

2. However, "Rockie is not a turtle" cannot be proven because:
   - No premise states rabbits cannot be turtles
   - Premise 2 confirms some turtle is spotted, but not Rockie specifically
   - No connection between turtles and calmness/skittishness
   - Animal types aren't mutually exclusive
