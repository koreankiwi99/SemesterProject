The context provides information about the summer Olympic games being a sporting event and details about its last occurrence in Tokyo, but it does not mention the world championships or establish any logical connection between the summer Olympic games and the world championships. There are no axioms that allow inferring properties about the world championships from the given premises. Therefore, the statement "The world championships is a sporting event" cannot be proven from the context.

<lean>
axiom entity : Type
axiom SummerOlympicGames : entity
axiom WorldChampionships : entity
axiom Tokyo : entity
axiom UnitedStates : entity

axiom IsSportingEvent : entity → Prop
axiom LastHeldIn : entity → entity → Prop
axiom WonMostMedals : entity → entity → Prop

axiom T1 : IsSportingEvent SummerOlympicGames
axiom T2 : LastHeldIn SummerOlympicGames Tokyo
axiom T3 : WonMostMedals UnitedStates SummerOlympicGames

-- No axiom links WorldChampionships to SummerOlympicGames or IsSportingEvent
-- Cannot prove IsSportingEvent WorldChampionships from given premises
