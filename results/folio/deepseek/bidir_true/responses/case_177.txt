The reasoning involves connecting the location "Tokyo" to the specific event "the last summer Olympic games" and then applying the medal-winning fact. The premises establish that the last summer Olympic games occurred in Tokyo, and that the United States won the most medals in Tokyo (interpreted as winning at the event held in Tokyo). Since the last games were in Tokyo, the medal achievement applies directly to that event.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom last_game : obj  -- Represents the last summer Olympic games
axiom Tokyo : obj
axiom UnitedStates : obj
axiom location : obj → obj → Prop  -- location(game, city)
axiom won_most_medals : obj → obj → Prop  -- won_most_medals(country, game)

axiom last_game_in_tokyo : location last_game Tokyo
axiom US_won_in_tokyo : ∀ g : obj, location g Tokyo → won_most_medals UnitedStates g

theorem US_won_in_last_game : won_most_medals UnitedStates last_game := 
  US_won_in_tokyo last_game last_game_in_tokyo
</lean>

ANSWER: True
