The reasoning involves deducing that Rockie must be a rabbit (and thus cute) based on the premises. Since Rockie is spotted near the campus (from context), and the only animals spotted are rabbits or squirrels (premise 3), Rockie must be either a rabbit or a squirrel. If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish (premise 5), leading to not being calm (premise 4), contradicting the calmness given. Thus, Rockie must be a rabbit, making it cute (premise 1). Therefore, "Rockie is a turtle or cute" holds because Rockie is cute.
