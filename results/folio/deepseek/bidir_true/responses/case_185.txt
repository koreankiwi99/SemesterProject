The context provides information about podcasts, novels, and various entities. Specifically, it states that a podcast is not a novel, and Family Secrets is explicitly identified as a podcast created by Dani Shapiro. Therefore, Family Secrets cannot be a novel. The statement "Family Secrets is a novel" contradicts the given premises, so it cannot be proven.

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `fail` tactic was used without completing the proof. Since we cannot prove that "Family Secrets is a novel" (as it contradicts the axiom that podcasts are not novels), we should not declare the theorem at all. Instead, we'll only declare the axioms and entities, then comment on why the proof is impossible.
