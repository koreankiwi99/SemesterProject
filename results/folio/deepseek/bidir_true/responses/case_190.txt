The reasoning involves translating the given context into Lean and evaluating the statement. The context includes:
- Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
- All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
- Jump shots imply leaping straight into the air.
- Leaping straight into the air implies activating leg muscles.
- Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

The statement to evaluate is: "If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player."

In Lean:
- Define a type `Person` and predicates for the properties.
- Axioms capture the context:
  1. There exists a professional basketball player who is not American.
  2. Professional basketball players can do jump shots.
  3. Jump shots imply leaping straight.
  4. Leaping straight implies activating leg muscles.
  5. Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

From the axioms:
- Using contraposition on axiom 4, if someone does not activate leg muscles, they do not leap straight. Thus, Yuri does not leap straight (proven as `not_leap_yuri`).
- If Yuri were a professional basketball player, he could do jump shots (axiom 2), leading to leaping straight (axiom 3), contradicting `not_leap_yuri`. Thus, Yuri is not a professional basketball player (proven as `not_pro_yuri`).

The statement to evaluate is an implication: ¬LeapStraight Yuri → (American Yuri ∧ ProBasketballPlayer Yuri). Since ¬LeapStraight Yuri is true (proven), the implication reduces to proving American Yuri ∧ ProBasketballPlayer Yuri. However, ProBasketballPlayer Yuri is false (proven), making the conjunction false. Thus, the implication does not hold (it is equivalent to True → False, which is False). Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the premises.

-- Statement to evaluate: ¬LeapStraight Yuri → (American Yuri ∧ ProBasketballPlayer Yuri)
