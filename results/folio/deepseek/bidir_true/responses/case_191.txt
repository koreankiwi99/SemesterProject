The statement to evaluate is: "If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player." This translates to the implication: ¬(P(Yuri) ∧ A(Yuri)) → P(Yuri), where:
- P(x): x is a professional basketball player
- A(x): x is an American national

From the premises:
1. All professional basketball players can do jump shots: ∀x, P(x) → J(x)
2. Jump shots imply leaping: ∀x, J(x) → L(x)
3. Leaping implies muscle activation: ∀x, L(x) → M(x)
4. Yuri does not activate muscles: ¬M(Yuri)

By contrapositive on the chain:
- ¬M(Yuri) → ¬L(Yuri) → ¬J(Yuri) → ¬P(Yuri)

Thus, we prove ¬P(Yuri). Now, the implication becomes:
- Antecedent: ¬(P(Yuri) ∧ A(Yuri)) ≡ ¬P(Yuri) ∨ ¬A(Yuri) (which is true since ¬P(Yuri))
- Consequent: P(Yuri) (which is false)

This makes the entire implication false. Since the premises yield a counterexample (antecedent true, consequent false), the statement does not follow.

-- The statement: ¬(ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ AmericanNational Yuri) → ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri
-- Since ¬ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri is proven, the antecedent is true and consequent is false.
-- Therefore, the implication is false and cannot be proven from the axioms.
