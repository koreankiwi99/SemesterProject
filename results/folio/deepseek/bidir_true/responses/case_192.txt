axiom Event : Type
axiom happy : Event → Prop
axiom sad : Event → Prop
axiom disjunction : ∀ (e : Event), happy e ∨ sad e
axiom exists_happy : ∃ (e : Event), happy e

-- We attempt to prove that all events are sad
theorem all_sad : ∀ (e : Event), sad e :=
  fun e =>
  -- For an arbitrary event e, we need to show sad e
  -- We know e is either happy or sad from disjunction
  match disjunction e with
  | Or.inl h => 
    -- Case where e is happy. We have no information that happy implies not sad, 
    -- nor any contradiction from happy e. We cannot prove sad e here.
    sorry
  | Or.inr s => s  -- If sad, we can return s

-- Since the happy case cannot be resolved, the proof is incomplete
