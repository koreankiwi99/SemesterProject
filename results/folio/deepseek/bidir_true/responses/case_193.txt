The context explicitly states that Steinhauer was the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic. The statement to evaluate claims Steinhauer was not the winner, which directly contradicts the given context. The additional information about Descampe and the leaderboard does not provide any evidence to refute Steinhauer being the winner. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Steinhauer : obj
axiom Descampe : obj
axiom Won : obj → Prop
axiom Participated : obj → Prop
axiom FromBelgium : obj → Prop
axiom OnLeaderboard : obj → Prop

axiom winner_steinhauer : Won Steinhauer
axiom steinhauer_participated : Participated Steinhauer
axiom descampe_belgium_leaderboard : FromBelgium Descampe ∧ OnLeaderboard Descampe
axiom leaderboard_participated : ∀ x, OnLeaderboard x → Participated x

-- The statement to prove: ¬ Won Steinhauer
-- This contradicts axiom winner_steinhauer, so it cannot be proven
