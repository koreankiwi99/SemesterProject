-- Predicates
axiom Winner : Player → Prop
axiom Participated : Player → Prop
axiom OnLeaderboard : Player → Prop
axiom FromBelgium : Player → Prop
axiom InTie : Player → Prop  -- Being in the six-way tie

-- Axioms from context
axiom winner_steinhauer : Winner steinhauer
axiom steinhauer_participated : Participated steinhauer
axiom exists_belgian_in_tie : ∃ p, InTie p ∧ FromBelgium p
axiom descampe_belgian : FromBelgium descampe
axiom descampe_on_leaderboard : OnLeaderboard descampe
axiom tie_on_leaderboard : ∀ p, InTie p → OnLeaderboard p
axiom leaderboard_participated : ∀ p, OnLeaderboard p → Participated p

-- We need to prove: InTie descampe

-- However, there is no information that the Belgian in the tie is unique or that Descampe must be that Belgian.
-- We know there exists at least one Belgian in the tie, but there might be multiple Belgians on the leaderboard.
-- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Descampe is in the tie.

-- Attempt to prove fails because:
-- 1. We know ∃ p, InTie p ∧ FromBelgium p (some Belgian in the tie)
-- 2. We know FromBelgium descampe and OnLeaderboard descampe
-- 3. But without knowing that descampe is the *only* Belgian on the leaderboard, or that the tie contains all Belgians, we cannot link descampe to the tie.

-- Since no additional axioms force Descampe into the tie, the proof fails.
