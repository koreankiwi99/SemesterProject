The context states that Ailton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Náutico. This directly contradicts the statement "No one playing for Nautico is Brazilian," as Ailton serves as a counterexample. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given context.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Club : Type
axiom ailton : Person
axiom braga : Club
axiom nautico : Club
axiom fluminense : Club

axiom playsFor : Person → Club → Prop
axiom brazilian : Person → Prop
axiom A1 : playsFor ailton nautico
axiom A2 : brazilian ailton

    intro p h
    -- We know Ailton plays for Nautico and is Brazilian, but have no information about other players.
    -- The universal claim cannot be proven since we lack axioms about all players at Nautico.
    -- Specifically, we cannot show that an arbitrary player `p` (who might be Ailton) is not Brazilian.
    sorry -- Proof incomplete
