The context states that Ailton was loaned out to Braga, and Braga is a football club. Therefore, Ailton was loaned out to a football club, which directly contradicts the statement "Ailton was not loaned out to a football club." Since the premises prove the opposite of the conclusion, it is impossible to prove the given statement.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom ailton : obj
axiom braga : obj
axiom nautico : obj
axiom fluminense : obj

axiom FootballPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom LoanedOutTo : obj → obj → Prop
axiom FootballClub : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : FootballPlayer ailton
axiom A2 : LoanedOutTo ailton braga
axiom A3 : FootballClub braga
axiom A4 : FootballClub nautico
axiom A5 : FootballClub fluminense

-- The conclusion "Ailton was not loaned out to a football club" is ¬∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedOutTo ailton c
-- However, we have LoanedOutTo ailton braga and FootballClub braga, so ∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedOutTo ailton c
-- This contradicts the conclusion. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be proven.
