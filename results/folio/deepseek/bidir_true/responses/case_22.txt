The context provides several premises about Netflix shows and Karen's behavior. The goal is to prove that "Black Mirror" is popular based on these premises.

- "Stranger Things" is popular and a Netflix show.
- If a Netflix show is popular, Karen binge-watches it.
- Karen downloads a Netflix show if and only if she binge-watches it.
- Karen does not download "Black Mirror."
- "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show.
- If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she shares it with Lisa (this premise is not relevant to the conclusion).

From the premises:
1. Since Karen does not download "Black Mirror" and "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show, by the biconditional (if and only if), Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror."
2. If "Black Mirror" were popular, then Karen would binge-watch it (because it's a Netflix show). However, we know Karen does not binge-watch it, so "Black Mirror" cannot be popular.

Thus, the premises imply that "Black Mirror" is not popular. Therefore, the statement ""Black Mirror" is popular" cannot be proven from the given premises; in fact, the premises prove its negation. Since we cannot prove the conclusion, the result is Failure.

axiom obj : Type
axiom StrangerThings : obj
axiom BlackMirror : obj
axiom IsNetflixShow : obj → Prop
axiom Popular : obj → Prop
axiom KarenBingeWatches : obj → Prop
axiom KarenDownloads : obj → Prop
axiom SharesWithLisa : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : IsNetflixShow StrangerThings
axiom T2 : IsNetflixShow BlackMirror
axiom T3 : Popular StrangerThings
axiom T4 : ¬ KarenDownloads BlackMirror

axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, IsNetflixShow x → (Popular x → KarenBingeWatches x)
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, IsNetflixShow x → (KarenBingeWatches x ↔ KarenDownloads x)
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, IsNetflixShow x → (KarenBingeWatches x → SharesWithLisa x)

-- Attempt to prove Popular BlackMirror leads to contradiction:
--   Assume Popular BlackMirror.
--   Then KarenBingeWatches BlackMirror (by R1 and T2).
--   Then KarenDownloads BlackMirror (by R2 and T2).
--   But this contradicts T4.
-- Therefore, the statement cannot be proven.
