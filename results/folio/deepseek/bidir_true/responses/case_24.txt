The statement claims that Beijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics. The context provides:
- "Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics" (directly stated)
- "Beijing has hosted the Summer and Winter Olympics" (implies Beijing hosted at least one Winter Olympics)

The statement requires:
1. Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics (directly supported)
2. Beijing hosted the Winter Olympics (inferred from hosting "Summer and Winter Olympics")

Thus, the statement follows from the context.

<lean>
axiom HostedSummer2008 : Prop
axiom HostedWinterOlympics : Prop
theorem beijing_hosted_both : HostedSummer2008 ∧ HostedWinterOlympics := 
  ⟨HostedSummer2008, HostedWinterOlympics⟩
</lean>

ANSWER: True

The compilation error occurred because I attempted to use the propositions `HostedSummer2008` and `HostedWinterOlympics` as proofs of themselves, which is invalid. In Lean, propositions are types, and we need explicit proofs (terms inhabiting those types) to establish truth. Here's the corrected approach:

1. Declare the propositions separately from their proofs
2. Provide axioms for the proofs based on context
3. Construct the conjunction using proof terms

<lean>
axiom HostedSummer2008 : Prop
axiom HostedWinterOlympics : Prop
axiom hosted_summer_2008 : HostedSummer2008    -- Proof from context
axiom hosted_winter : HostedWinterOlympics     -- Proof from context
theorem beijing_hosted_both : HostedSummer2008 ∧ HostedWinterOlympics := 
  And.intro hosted_summer_2008 hosted_winter
</lean>

**Justification:**
- Context explicitly states "Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics" → `hosted_summer_2008`
- Context states "Beijing has hosted ... Winter Olympics" → `hosted_winter`
- The theorem combines these proofs using `And.intro`

ANSWER: True
