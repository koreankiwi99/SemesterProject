The reasoning involves analyzing the premises and checking if the conclusion "If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human" follows. The premises are:

1. **All aliens are extraterrestrials.**  
   ∀x, Alien x → Extraterrestrial x  
2. **If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.**  
   ∀x, FromMars x → Alien x  
3. **No extraterrestrials are human.**  
   ∀x, Extraterrestrial x → ¬Human x  
4. **All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.**  
   ∀x, HighlyIntelligent x → FromEarth x → Human x  
5. **Marvin is highly intelligent.**  
   HighlyIntelligent Marvin  
6. **Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or from neither.**  
   (FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin) ∨ (¬FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬FromMars Marvin)  
7. **If Marvin is not from Earth, then he is an extraterrestrial.**  
   ¬FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin  

The conclusion to evaluate is:  
**If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human.**  
¬FromMars Marvin → Human Marvin  

### Analysis:  
- From premise 6, there are two cases:  
  **Case 1**: Marvin is from both Earth and Mars.  
    - If Marvin is not from Mars (antecedent is false), the implication holds (false implies anything is true).  
  **Case 2**: Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars.  
    - ¬FromEarth Marvin holds. By premise 7, Marvin is an extraterrestrial. By premise 3, Marvin is not human.  
    - Antecedent ¬FromMars Marvin is true, but consequent Human Marvin is false.  
    - Thus, the implication ¬FromMars Marvin → Human Marvin is **false**.  

Since Case 2 provides a scenario where the premises hold but the conclusion fails, the conclusion cannot be proven from the premises.

### Lean Formalization:
The formalization defines the entities and predicates, and the axioms corresponding to the premises. The theorem `target` is not proven, as the second case of premise `A6` leads to a contradiction with the conclusion.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Marvin : obj
axiom Extraterrestrial : obj → Prop
axiom Alien : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom FromMars : obj → Prop
axiom FromEarth : obj → Prop
axiom HighlyIntelligent : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, Alien x → Extraterrestrial x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, FromMars x → Alien x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, Extraterrestrial x → ¬ Human x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, HighlyIntelligent x → FromEarth x → Human x
axiom A5 : HighlyIntelligent Marvin
axiom A6 : (FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin) ∨ (¬ FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬ FromMars Marvin)
axiom A7 : ¬ FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin

-- Attempted proof of ¬ FromMars Marvin → Human Marvin fails:
-- Case 1 (both Earth and Mars) closes by contradiction if ¬FromMars is assumed.
-- Case 2 (neither) leads to ¬Human Marvin, making the implication unprovable.
