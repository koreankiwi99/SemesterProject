The reasoning involves proving that Beethoven is a composer based on the given context. The key premises are:
1. Symphony No. 9 is a music piece.
2. Composers write music pieces (interpreted as: if someone writes a music piece, they are a composer).
3. Beethoven wrote Symphony No. 9.

From these, we directly conclude Beethoven is a composer. The other information about Vienna Music Society and orchestras is irrelevant to this conclusion.
