The reasoning involves determining if Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal based on the given premises. The key steps are:

1. Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022 (premise).
2. All players there are female or male (premise).
3. If male, then lost to Rafael Nadal (premise).
4. However, if Coco Gauff is male, then:
   - Lost to Rafael Nadal (from 3).
   - This triggers the disjunction in the conditional premise: "ranked highly or lost to Rafael" → not male.
   - Contradiction: male and not male.
5. Thus, Coco Gauff cannot be male → must be female.
6. As female, lost to Iga Świątek (premise) → ranked highly by WTA.
7. But no premise links being female to losing to Rafael Nadal.
8. Therefore, "lost to Rafael Nadal" cannot be proven.
