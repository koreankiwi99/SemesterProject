The reasoning involves translating the given context and statement into Lean and attempting a proof. The context states that all cats are mammals and some pets are not mammals. The conclusion claims no pets are cats.

In Lean:
- Define a type `obj` for objects.
- Define predicates `Cat`, `Mammal`, and `Pet`.
- Axiom 1: All cats are mammals (`∀x, Cat x → Mammal x`).
- Axiom 2: Some pets are not mammals (`∃x, Pet x ∧ ¬Mammal x`).
- Conclusion: No pets are cats (`∀x, Pet x → ¬Cat x`).

Attempted proof:
- Assume an arbitrary object `a` that is a pet (`Pet a`).
- Goal: Show `¬Cat a` (i.e., `Cat a → False`).
- Assume `Cat a` for contradiction.
- By Axiom 1, `Cat a → Mammal a`, so `Mammal a`.
- By Axiom 2, there exists some `b` such that `Pet b ∧ ¬Mammal b`.
- However, `a` and `b` are distinct; `Mammal a` (from `a` being a cat) and `¬Mammal b` (from the second axiom) do not contradict each other.
- No contradiction arises for `a` being both a pet and a cat.

The premises allow for:
- A cat that is a pet (and mammal).
- A separate pet that is not a mammal (and not a cat).
Thus, the conclusion does not follow. The proof fails.
