The reasoning involves analyzing the given premises to determine if "1984 is printed text" logically follows. The premises are:
1. No digital media are analog: ∀x, DigitalMedia x → ¬Analog x
2. Every printed text is analog media: ∀x, PrintedText x → Analog x
3. All streaming services are digital media: ∀x, StreamingService x → DigitalMedia x
4. Hardcover books are printed text: ∀x, HardcoverBook x → PrintedText x
5. If 1984 is a streaming service, then it is a hardcover book: StreamingService obj1984 → HardcoverBook obj1984

To prove "PrintedText obj1984", we need evidence that 1984 is a hardcover book (from Axiom 4) or directly printed text. However:
- Axiom 5 only provides a conditional: if 1984 is a streaming service, then it is a hardcover book.
- If we assume 1984 is a streaming service:
  - By Axiom 3, it would be digital media.
  - By Axiom 1, digital media are not analog, so 1984 would not be analog.
  - But by Axiom 5 and 4, 1984 would be printed text → analog (Axiom 2), contradicting ¬Analog.
- This contradiction proves 1984 cannot be a streaming service (¬StreamingService obj1984).
- However, this only falsifies the antecedent of Axiom 5; it does not provide evidence that 1984 is a hardcover book or printed text.

No other premises mention 1984 or provide a path to prove "PrintedText obj1984". Thus, the statement cannot be proven from the given context.
