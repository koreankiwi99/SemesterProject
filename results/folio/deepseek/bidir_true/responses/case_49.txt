The context provides several premises about digital and analog media, printed text, streaming services, and hardcover books. The statement to evaluate is "1984 is a streaming service." However, the premises do not directly assert that 1984 is a streaming service. The only premise mentioning 1984 is a conditional: if it is a streaming service, then it is a hardcover book. Without additional information about 1984, this conditional alone does not allow us to prove that 1984 is indeed a streaming service. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given context.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom NineteenEightyFour : obj
axiom DigitalMedia : obj → Prop
axiom AnalogMedia : obj → Prop
axiom PrintedText : obj → Prop
axiom StreamingService : obj → Prop
axiom HardcoverBook : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, DigitalMedia x → ¬ AnalogMedia x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, PrintedText x → AnalogMedia x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, StreamingService x → DigitalMedia x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, HardcoverBook x → PrintedText x
axiom A5 : StreamingService NineteenEightyFour → HardcoverBook NineteenEightyFour

-- There is no axiom or derivation proving StreamingService NineteenEightyFour.
-- The conditional A5 requires the antecedent to be true, which is not provided.
