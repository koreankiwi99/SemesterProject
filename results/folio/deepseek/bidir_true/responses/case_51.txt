The context states that Basque is not related to any other language, while Romance languages are a family where all members are related to each other. French and Spanish are Romance languages, so if Basque were a Romance language, it would be related to French and Spanish. However, since Basque is not related to any other language (including French and Spanish), this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Basque cannot be a Romance language. The statement "Basque is a Romance language" does not follow from the premises and is in fact disproven.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred due to the axiom `all_romance_indo_european` using `∃ F, True` without specifying the type of `F`. Since this axiom is not used in proving or disproving the statement about Basque, it can be safely removed. The core reasoning relies on:

1. Romance languages forming a family (all related)
2. French/Spanish being Romance
3. Basque being unrelated to any other language
4. French/Spanish ≠ Basque

The statement "Basque is a Romance language" cannot be proven from the axioms. In fact, attempting to assume it leads to contradiction (since Basque would be related to French/Spanish, violating `basque_not_related`), but this negation proof is not required for the task. The requirement is solely to prove the original statement, which is impossible.

Corrected Lean code:

axiom Language : Type
axiom french : Language
axiom spanish : Language
axiom basque : Language
axiom Romance : Language → Prop
axiom Related : Language → Language → Prop

axiom romance_family : ∀ L1 L2 : Language, Romance L1 → Romance L2 → Related L1 L2
axiom french_romance : Romance french
axiom spanish_romance : Romance spanish
axiom basque_not_related : ∀ L : Language, L ≠ basque → ¬ Related basque L

axiom french_ne_basque : french ≠ basque
axiom spanish_ne_basque : spanish ≠ basque

-- No axioms allow proving "Romance basque"
-- Attempting to prove it would require either:
-- 1. Direct evidence (no axiom states Romance basque)
-- 2. Indirect evidence (contradicts basque_not_related)
