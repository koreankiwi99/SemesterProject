-- All Romance languages are Indo-European

-- Romance languages form a language family: all are mutually related
axiom ax2 : ∀ x y : Language, Romance x ∧ Romance y → Related x y

-- French and Spanish are Romance languages
axiom ax3 : Romance french ∧ Romance spanish

-- German is related to Spanish
axiom ax4 : Related german spanish

-- Basque is not related to any other language
axiom ax5 : ∀ l : Language, l ≠ basque → ¬ Related basque l

-- Attempt to prove German is a Romance language
theorem german_romance : Romance german :=
  -- We have no axiom stating that if a language is related to a Romance language, it must be Romance.
  -- Specifically, ax2 only says that Romance languages are mutually related, not that any language related to a Romance language is Romance.
  -- We know German is related to Spanish (ax4), but Spanish being Romance does not imply German is Romance.
  -- There is no axiom connecting "Related" to "Romance" in the reverse direction.
  -- Therefore, we cannot prove Romance german.
  by
    admit  -- Explicitly indicating we cannot prove it

-- Since the proof is incomplete, we conclude Failure
