The context provides several premises:
1. All Romance languages are Indo-European languages.
2. Romance languages form a language family.
3. All languages within a language family are related to each other.
4. French and Spanish are Romance languages.
5. German is related to Spanish.
6. Basque is unrelated to any other language.

The statement to evaluate is: "French is an Indo-European language."

Proof:
- From premise 4, French is a Romance language.
- From premise 1, all Romance languages are Indo-European languages.
- Therefore, French must be an Indo-European language.

The additional premises about language families and relations (premises 2, 3, 5, 6) are not required for this conclusion, as the proof relies solely on the direct classification of Romance languages as Indo-European and French being Romance.
