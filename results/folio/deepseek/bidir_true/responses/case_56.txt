The context provides information about Robert Lewandowski being a striker, strikers being soccer players, him leaving Bayern Munchen, and the implication that leaving a team means no longer playing for that team. However, there is no mention of the property "star" or any axioms connecting the given predicates to being a star. Therefore, the statement "Robert Lewandowski is a star" cannot be proven from the premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom RobertLewandowski : obj
axiom BayernMunchen : obj
axiom Striker : obj → Prop
axiom SoccerPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom PlaysFor : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Left : obj → obj → Prop

axiom T1 : Striker RobertLewandowski
axiom T2 : ∀ x : obj, Striker x → SoccerPlayer x
axiom T3 : Left RobertLewandowski BayernMunchen
axiom T4 : ∀ (player team : obj), Left player team → ¬ PlaysFor player team

axiom Star : obj → Prop  -- Introduced for the statement, but no supporting axioms

-- No axioms link Striker/SoccerPlayer/Left to Star property
theorem lewandowski_star : Star RobertLewandowski := by
  sorry  -- No proof possible from given premises
