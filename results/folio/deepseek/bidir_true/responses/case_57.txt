The statement "Butte and St Pierre are in the same state" is evaluated based on the given context. Butte is explicitly stated to be in Montana, while St Pierre is explicitly stated not to be in Montana. Additionally, the rule that a city can only be in one state (with exceptions for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma, and Union City) applies since neither Butte nor St Pierre are among the exception cities. Therefore, Butte cannot be in any state other than Montana, and St Pierre cannot be in Montana. This implies they cannot be in the same state, making the statement false. Since the premises disprove the statement rather than prove it, the conclusion cannot be proven true.

The compilation error occurred because the `Exists.elim` tactic was used incorrectly. The goal was to prove an existential statement (`∃ s, ...`), but `Exists.elim` is used to eliminate an existential quantifier in the hypotheses, not to prove one. Since the statement "Butte and St Pierre are in the same state" is false based on the premises, it cannot be proven true. The Lean code now properly declares the axioms and includes comments explaining why the proof is impossible.

-- Proof goal: ∃ s, InState Butte s ∧ InState StPierre s
-- Attempted proof strategy:
-- 1. Butte must be exclusively in Montana (by unique_state and butte_in_montana)
-- 2. Thus any shared state s must be Montana
-- 3. But St Pierre is not in Montana (contradiction by st_pierre_not_montana)
-- Conclusion: No such state exists → theorem is unprovable
