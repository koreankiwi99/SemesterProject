The context states: "Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals." This implies the existence of at least one animal. Additionally, "Humans are mammals" and "Mammals are animals" establish that humans are animals, but since no specific human is mentioned, we rely on the virus axiom for existence. The statement "There is an animal" is directly provable from the axiom derived from the virus context.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom mammal_animal : ∀ x : obj, Mammal x → Animal x
axiom human_mammal : ∀ x : obj, Human x → Mammal x
-- "Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals" implies ∃ animal
axiom virus_animal : ∃ x : obj, Animal x
theorem animal_exists : ∃ x : obj, Animal x := by exact virus_animal

ANSWER: True
