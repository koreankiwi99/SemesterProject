The context provides information about Yale University, including its endowment value of $42.3 billion. However, it does not provide any information about the endowments of other educational institutions. To prove that Yale has the largest endowment, we would need comparative data showing that all other institutions have endowments less than or equal to $42.3 billion, which is absent from the context. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given information.

<lean>
axiom Institution : Type
axiom Yale : Institution
axiom endowment : Institution → ℝ
axiom yale_endowment : endowment Yale = 42300000000  -- $42.3 billion

-- No information about other institutions' endowments
-- Cannot prove ∀ (other : Institution), endowment Yale ≥ endowment other
