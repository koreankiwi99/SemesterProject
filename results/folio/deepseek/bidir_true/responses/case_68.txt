The context provides the following information:
- Badults is a series.
- Badults had the working title "The Secret Dude Society".
- Andrew Collins was the script editor for Badults.

The statement to evaluate is: "Andrew Collins was the script editor for a series with the working title 'The Secret Dude Society'." This means we must prove there exists some series (which is Badults) that has the working title and for which Andrew Collins was the script editor.

In Lean:
- We define a type `obj` for entities.
- Introduce constants `Badults` (the series) and `AndrewCollins` (the person).
- Define predicates:
  - `has_working_title_secret_dude : obj → Prop` (true for series with the specific working title)
  - `is_script_editor_for : obj → obj → Prop` (first argument: person, second: series)
- Axioms:
  - `A1`: Badults has the working title.
  - `A2`: Andrew Collins is the script editor for Badults.
- The theorem proves the existential: there exists a series `s` with the working title where Andrew Collins is the script editor for `s`.

The proof uses `Badults` as the witness and applies the axioms directly.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Badults : obj
axiom AndrewCollins : obj
axiom has_working_title_secret_dude : obj → Prop
axiom is_script_editor_for : obj → obj → Prop

axiom A1 : has_working_title_secret_dude Badults
axiom A2 : is_script_editor_for AndrewCollins Badults

theorem statement : ∃ s : obj, has_working_title_secret_dude s ∧ is_script_editor_for AndrewCollins s :=
  ⟨Badults, A1, A2⟩
</lean>

ANSWER: True
