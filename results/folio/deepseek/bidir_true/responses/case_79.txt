The reasoning involves proving that Dried Thai chilies are not products of Baked by Melissa based on the given premises. The key steps are:

1. If Dried Thai chilies were products of Baked by Melissa, they would be cupcakes (by axiom T4).
2. Cupcakes are baked sweets (T2), so they would be baked sweets.
3. No baked sweets are spicy (T1), so they would not be spicy.
4. However, Dried Thai chilies must be either spicy, mala hotpots, or not baked sweets (T5):
   - If spicy: contradicts step 3
   - If mala hotpot: then spicy (T3), contradicts step 3
   - If not baked sweets: contradicts step 2
5. All cases lead to contradiction, so the assumption is false.
