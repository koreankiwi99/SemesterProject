The context provides information about Monkeypox symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness. It also establishes relationships between beings, animals, mammals, and humans, and mentions tiredness in relation to the flu. However, there is no information connecting Monkeypox to coughing. The listed symptoms do not include coughing, and no inference rules link Monkeypox to coughing through the given premises. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven.

The compilation error occurred due to the undefined predicate `HasSymptom`. After reevaluation, here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Symptom : Type
axiom fever : Symptom
axiom headache : Symptom
axiom muscle_pains : Symptom
axiom tiredness : Symptom
axiom coughing : Symptom

axiom MonkeypoxSymptom : Symptom → Prop

axiom T1 : MonkeypoxSymptom fever
axiom T2 : MonkeypoxSymptom headache
axiom T3 : MonkeypoxSymptom muscle_pains
axiom T4 : MonkeypoxSymptom tiredness

theorem cough_symptom : MonkeypoxSymptom coughing := by sorry
</lean>

**Reasoning:**  
1. The context explicitly lists Monkeypox symptoms (fever, headache, muscle pains, tiredness), but coughing is not mentioned
2. No axioms link Monkeypox symptoms to flu symptoms or establish any relationship involving coughing
3. Animal/mammal/human relationships don't connect to symptoms
4. Context about flu-related tiredness doesn't help since it's irrelevant to Monkeypox symptoms  
Thus, the statement "Symptoms of Monkeypox include coughing" cannot be proven from the given premises.
