The reasoning involves proving that Tom must be an Ocellated wild turkey given that he is a wild turkey but not any of the other five types. The Lean code formalizes the turkeys as a type with predicates for each kind, an exhaustive axiom stating every turkey belongs to one of the six types, and negations for Tom being the first five types. The proof proceeds by case analysis on the exhaustive disjunction, using contradiction for the first five cases (since they directly contradict the negation axioms) and accepting the sixth case as the conclusion.

The compilation errors occurred because the `contradiction` tactic requires both a hypothesis and its negation to be present in the local context. However, the negation axioms (e.g., `not_Eastern`) were not brought into the local context during case analysis. The solution is to directly use the negation axioms to derive `False` in each contradictory branch via `exact not_axiom hypothesis`, which proves any goal since `False` implies any proposition.

Here is the corrected Lean code:

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the `exact` tactic was used with a term of type `False` (from the negation applications) where a term of type `Ocellated Tom` was expected. To resolve this, `False.elim` is used to derive any proposition (including `Ocellated Tom`) from a `False` term. The proof structure remains valid: exhaustive case analysis covers all turkey types, contradictions are derived for the first five types using their respective negation axioms, and the final case directly proves the goal.
