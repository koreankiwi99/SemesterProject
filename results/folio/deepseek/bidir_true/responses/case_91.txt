The context states that every NLP task is either a language generation task or a language understanding task (inclusive "or"). It also establishes that any task with a text sequence output is a generation task. Machine translation has a text sequence output, so it must be a generation task. However, there is no information indicating that generation and understanding are mutually exclusive, nor any rule forcing generation tasks to also be understanding tasks. Therefore, we cannot prove that machine translation is an understanding task.

<lean>
axiom Task : Type
axiom IsGeneration : Task → Prop
axiom IsUnderstanding : Task → Prop
axiom OutputIsTextSequence : Task → Prop
axiom MachineTranslation : Task

axiom A1 : ∀ t : Task, IsGeneration t ∨ IsUnderstanding t
axiom A2 : ∀ t : Task, OutputIsTextSequence t → IsGeneration t
axiom A3 : OutputIsTextSequence MachineTranslation

theorem MT_generation : IsGeneration MachineTranslation := by
  apply A2 MachineTranslation A3

-- No information forces generation tasks to be understanding tasks
-- A1 allows tasks to be both, but doesn't require it
-- Cannot prove IsUnderstanding MachineTranslation

The compilation errors occurred because `Task` is a reserved keyword in Lean 4. To fix this, I replaced `Task` with `NLP_Task` as the type name. The logical analysis remains unchanged: while we can prove that machine translation is a language generation task (using axiom A2 and A3), we cannot prove it's a language understanding task. Axiom A1 uses inclusive OR (∨), meaning tasks could be both generation and understanding, but there's no axiom forcing generation tasks to be understanding tasks. Thus, the statement "Machine translation is a language understanding task" cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom NLP_Task : Type
axiom IsGeneration : NLP_Task → Prop
axiom IsUnderstanding : NLP_Task → Prop
axiom OutputIsTextSequence : NLP_Task → Prop
axiom MachineTranslation : NLP_Task

axiom A1 : ∀ t : NLP_Task, IsGeneration t ∨ IsUnderstanding t
axiom A2 : ∀ t : NLP_Task, OutputIsTextSequence t → IsGeneration t
axiom A3 : OutputIsTextSequence MachineTranslation

theorem MT_generation : IsGeneration MachineTranslation := by 
  exact A2 MachineTranslation A3

-- No axiom links generation to understanding, and A1 allows overlap without requiring it.
-- Cannot prove IsUnderstanding MachineTranslation from given premises.
