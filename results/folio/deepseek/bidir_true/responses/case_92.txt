The reasoning involves determining if Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden based on the given context. The key conditions for Tom to rent in any managed building are:
1. He must be allowed to move in with Fluffy (his cat).
2. The security deposit must be no more than $1500.

From the context:
- The Olive Garden is a managed building with a monthly rent of $2000.
- The security deposit at any managed building is at least the monthly rent (so ≥ $2000 for The Olive Garden).
- $2000 > $1500, so the security deposit at The Olive Garden exceeds $1500, violating condition 2.

Even if The Olive Garden allows pets (which would satisfy condition 1 via the pet move-in rule), the security deposit condition fails. Since both conditions must hold for Tom to rent, and condition 2 is false, Tom will not rent at The Olive Garden. Therefore, the statement "Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden" cannot be proven from the premises.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The Lean code has been corrected to avoid compilation errors. The key issue was in the handling of the security deposit condition. The proof attempt for `TomRentsIn OliveGarden` fails because:
1. The security deposit at Olive Garden is at least $2000 (monthly rent), which exceeds $1500
2. Tom's rental condition requires a security deposit ≤ $1500
3. There's no information about whether pets are allowed at Olive Garden

The corrected code uses proper rewriting and leaves unprovable goals as `sorry`. Since the statement "Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden" cannot be proven from the premises, the answer is Failure.
