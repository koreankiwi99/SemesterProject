After modeling the problem in Lean with the given premises, I attempted to prove that the statement to evaluate is false by formalizing its negation and deriving a contradiction. The statement is:

"If Bonnie is either (a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and chaperones high school dances) or (neither a young child/teenager nor wishing to further her academic career), then Bonnie is either a student or an inactive/disinterested community member."

The negation of this statement requires:
1. The antecedent must hold for Bonnie.
2. The consequent must be false for Bonnie.

The antecedent has two cases:
- **Case 1**: Bonnie is young/teenager, wishes to further her career, and chaperones.
- **Case 2**: Bonnie is not young/teenager and does not wish to further her career.

**Analysis**:
- In **Case 1**, we encounter a contradiction from the axioms:  
  `T5` forces Bonnie to be a student (due to y/t and wishes), but `T3` forces her not to be a student (due to chaperoning).
- **Case 2** shows no contradiction:  
  Bonnie is not young/teenager, doesn't wish to further her career, is not inactive (`T4` not triggered), and is not a student (`T5` not triggered).  
  `T2` forces her to either perform often or be inactive. Since she's not inactive, she must perform often, leading to being engaged (`T1`). No axioms force chaperoning or additional constraints that contradict the scenario.

Since **Case 2** remains consistent with the premises, no contradiction arises from the negation of the statement. Therefore, I cannot prove that the statement is false.
