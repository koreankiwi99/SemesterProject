The reasoning involves translating the natural language statements into logical axioms and attempting to prove that the conditional statement is false. The premises are interpreted as follows:
- Every animal is either an invertebrate or a vertebrate.
- Animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
- Vertebrate animals have backbones.
- Bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
- Queen bees are bees.
- Harry is a bee.

The conditional statement to evaluate is:  
If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.

The negation of this conditional requires proving that the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. The analysis shows:
- Harry is provably not a vertebrate (since vertebrates require animal classification and reproduction by mating, contradicting bee properties).
- The antecedent simplifies to Harry not having a backbone (since he is not a vertebrate).
- However, there is no premise confirming Harry lacks a backbone, as bees are not explicitly defined as animals, and non-animals may have backbones without contradiction.
- The negation of the consequent requires Harry to be either an invertebrate or a queen bee, but this cannot be proven due to lack of information about Harry being an animal or a queen bee.

Thus, the required antecedent and negation of consequent cannot be simultaneously proven from the premises. The conditional statement is not provably false.

The compilation errors occurred due to an invalid theorem name starting with '¬' and incorrect handling of the equivalence proof. The corrected code:

1. Renames the theorem to a valid identifier
2. Provides a manual proof for the equivalence using propositional logic

ANSWER: Failure

Explanation:
1. The negation of the conditional requires proving both:
   - Antecedent: Harry has no backbone (unprovable - bees' backbone status undefined)
   - ¬Consequent: Harry is invertebrate or queen bee (unprovable - bees aren't necessarily animals/queens)

2. Premises constrain only animals' properties, but Harry's animal status is unknown
3. No premise connects beehood to invertebrate status or backbone presence
4. Queen bee status for Harry is unspecified
Thus the conditional's falsehood cannot be proven.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incomplete proofs in the equivalence theorem and the negation proof attempt. After careful analysis, the corrected Lean code focuses on the premises and proven facts without attempting unprovable statements. The key insight is that while Harry is provably not a vertebrate, there is insufficient information to determine:
1. Whether Harry has a backbone (premises only constrain animals)
2. Harry's invertebrate status (requires animal classification)
3. Harry's queen bee status (no premise specifies this)

Thus, the negation of the conditional statement cannot be proven from the premises.
