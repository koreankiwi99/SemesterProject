The premises and the disjunction about Luke are translated into Lean, but attempting to prove that Luke does not spend time with his siblings leads to a dead end. The disjunction for Luke states he is either (1) born together and lives with strangers or (2) not born together and does not live with strangers. If we assume Luke spends time with his siblings, it leads to Luke living at home (from premise 5) and thus not living with strangers (from premise 4). This contradicts case (1) of the disjunction, but case (2) remains consistent. In case (2), Luke is not born together and does not live with strangers, and the premises do not prevent him from spending time with siblings that were not part of a multiple birth (e.g., older siblings). Thus, the negation cannot be proven.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors were due to incorrect handling of the conjunction patterns in the `cases` tactic. The angle brackets `⟨...⟩` caused parsing issues. The corrected code uses nested `cases` to destructure the conjunctions properly. Additionally, `admit` was replaced with `sorry` to handle the incomplete branch, but the proof still fails because the second branch cannot be resolved.
