The reasoning context has been translated into Lean. The axioms establish that:
- ETS provides financial aid to applicants who prove economic hardship.
- Applicants living in single-parent families or having few resources can prove economic hardship.
- Tom lives in a single-parent family and has few resources.

From these premises, we can prove `FinancialAid Tom` using the provided axioms. Specifically:
1. `SingleParentFamily Tom` (axiom T1) satisfies the disjunction in R2.
2. R2 proves `ProveEconomicHardship Tom`.
3. R1 then proves `FinancialAid Tom`.

Since we can prove the statement "ETS provides financial aid to Tom" is true, we cannot prove its negation (¬FinancialAid Tom). Therefore, the attempt to prove the negation fails.

axiom Applicant : Type
axiom Tom : Applicant
axiom ProveEconomicHardship : Applicant → Prop
axiom FinancialAid : Applicant → Prop
axiom SingleParentFamily : Applicant → Prop
axiom FewResources : Applicant → Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ a : Applicant, ProveEconomicHardship a → FinancialAid a
axiom R2 : ∀ a : Applicant, (SingleParentFamily a ∨ FewResources a) → ProveEconomicHardship a
axiom T1 : SingleParentFamily Tom
axiom T2 : FewResources Tom
