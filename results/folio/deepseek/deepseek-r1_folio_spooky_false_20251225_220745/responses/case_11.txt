The natural language reasoning text provides information about the types of wild turkeys and specifically states that Tom is a wild turkey but not any of the first five types, implying Tom must be an Ocellated wild turkey. However, the statement to evaluate concerns Joey: "Joey is a wild turkey." There are no premises about Joey's type or status. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that Joey is not a wild turkey (the negation of the conclusion), as there is no information constraining Joey.

Lean 4 formalization:

axiom Turkey : Type
axiom Tom : Turkey
axiom Joey : Turkey

axiom IsWildTurkey : Turkey → Prop
axiom Eastern : Turkey → Prop
axiom Osceola : Turkey → Prop
axiom Goulds : Turkey → Prop
axiom Merriam : Turkey → Prop
axiom RioGrande : Turkey → Prop
axiom Ocellated : Turkey → Prop

axiom notEastern : ¬ Eastern Tom
axiom notOsceola : ¬ Osceola Tom
