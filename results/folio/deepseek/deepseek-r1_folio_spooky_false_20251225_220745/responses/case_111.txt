The reasoning involves translating the natural language premises into Lean 4 and attempting to prove the negation of the statement "Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico." The premises establish that the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico or Texas, Juan de Onate visited them, the Harding Pegmatite Mine (located in the Picuris Mountains) was donated, and no Texas mountain range has donated mines. 

From these, it is deduced that the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas (because they contain a donated mine, contradicting the premise about Texas). Thus, they must be in New Mexico. Since Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains, the statement "Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico" is true. Consequently, its negation cannot be proven.

The compilation errors were due to incorrect handling of constant declarations and lemma dependencies. The corrected code properly declares all entities and predicates, and ensures lemmas are proven without relying on `contradiction` tactics that caused resolution failures. The key steps are:

1. `notInTexas` lemma proves Picuris Mountains aren't in Texas using axiom A4 and the donated mine (A3)
2. `inNewMexico` lemma uses disjunction from A1 and `notInTexas` to establish New Mexico location
3. `statement_true` proves the original statement using Picuris as witness
4. `target` attempts to prove the negation but fails since the statement is true

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors were resolved by:
1. Correcting lemma dependencies (defining `inNewMexico` before use)
2. Fixing the disjunction case in `inNewMexico` using `absurd`
3. Removing the invalid proof attempt in `target`
4. Using `sorry` to admit unprovability of the negation

The premises prove the statement true:
- Picuris Mountains contain donated mine (A3)
- No Texas mountain ranges have donated mines (A4)
- Therefore Picuris must be in New Mexico
- Juan de Onate visited Picuris (A2)
- Thus the statement "Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico" is true

Since the statement is true, its negation cannot be proven from the premises.
