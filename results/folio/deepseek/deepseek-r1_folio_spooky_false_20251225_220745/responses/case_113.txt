The reasoning involves proving that the statement "The Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico" is false. The premises establish that the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico or Texas, the mine is located there and donated, and no Texas mountain ranges have donated mines. Since the mine's donation contradicts the Texas premise, the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico, proving the mine is in a New Mexico mountain range.
