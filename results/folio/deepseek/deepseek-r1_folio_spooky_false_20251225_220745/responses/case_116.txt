The reasoning involves translating the given premises into Lean axioms and attempting to prove the negation of the statement "Peter can block Windy's shooting". The premises are formalized as follows:

- `Man`, `Taller`, `Block`, `JumpWhenShooting`, `Shooter`, and `InClass` are predicates.
- `Michael`, `Peter`, and `Windy` are objects.
- Premise 1: If a man is taller than another man, the taller can block the shorter's shooting (`P1`).
- Premise 2: Michael is a man taller than everyone else in his class (`Man_Michael`, `T2`).
- Premise 3: Taller relation is transitive (`Trans`).
- Premise 4: Peter is a man taller than Michael (`Man_Peter`, `T3`).
- Premise 5: Michael can block any non-jumping shooter (`P5`).
- Premise 6: Michael cannot block Windy's shooting (`T6`).
- Premise 7: Jumping shooters are great shooters (`P7`), though unused.
- `Shooter_Windy` is assumed since Windy shoots.

From `P5`, `T6`, and `Shooter_Windy`, we prove `Windy_jumps` (Windy jumps when shooting). However, there is no premise linking jumping to blocking by Peter, nor information on whether Windy is a man or her height relative to Peter. Thus, we cannot prove `¬Block Peter Windy` (Peter cannot block Windy's shooting), as required premises are missing.

</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

Explanation:
1. Fixed name collision: Renamed `Trans` to `TransTaller`
2. Added missing `GreatShooter` axiom to satisfy P7
3. Corrected the proof of `Windy_jumps` using `by_contra`
4. The negation proof fails because:
   - Windy's man/woman status is unknown (P1 requires both to be men)
   - Windy's height relative to Peter is unknown
   - No premises link jumping to Peter's blocking ability
   - Windy's class membership is unknown (prevents height comparisons)
   - P5 only defines Michael's blocking conditions

Critical missing information prevents proving that Peter cannot block Windy's shooting.

======================================================================
ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors in the `Windy_jumps` theorem were due to incorrect handling of the `by_contra` tactic and explicit hypothesis naming. The corrected implementation properly uses proof by contradiction to establish that Windy jumps when shooting.

For the main goal of proving ¬Block Peter Windy (Peter cannot block Windy's shooting):
- Premise P1 requires both objects to be men for blocking to occur.
- Windy's gender status is unknown (no axiom states Man Windy).
- Peter's height relative to Windy is unknown (no transitivity chain connects Peter to Windy).
- Windy's class membership (InClass) is unknown, preventing use of height comparisons.
- P5 only defines blocking conditions for Michael, not Peter.

Since necessary preconditions remain unprovable, we cannot demonstrate that Peter cannot block Windy's shooting. The logical negation remains unprovable.
