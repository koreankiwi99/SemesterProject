The goal is to prove that the statement "Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica" is false. However, after modeling the premises in Lean, we find that:

1. The premises establish locations within the South Shetland Islands, but do not place any island inside Antarctica.
2. Antarctica is located *in* the South Shetland Islands (per premise 4), not vice versa.
3. Transitivity cannot link islands (e.g., Snow Island) to Antarctica because there is no premise showing the South Shetland Islands are contained within Antarctica.
4. Without evidence of any island in Antarctica, the universal statement holds vacuously (true if there are no counterexamples).
5. The naming premise does not preclude Barutin Cove being named after multiple entities, so even if an island existed in Antarctica, no contradiction arises.

Thus, we cannot construct a counterexample or derive a contradiction. The negation of the statement remains unprovable.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `sorry` tactic was used incorrectly within a proof block. After re-evaluating the premises and the statement, it is determined that the negation of the statement cannot be proven due to insufficient information about islands being located in Antarctica. Below is the corrected Lean code without any proof attempts, as no complete proof of negation can be constructed.
