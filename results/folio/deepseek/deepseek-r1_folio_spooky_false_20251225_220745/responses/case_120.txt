ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was unable to find a contradiction in the given context. This is expected because the premises do not provide enough information to connect the witnesses and derive a contradiction. Specifically:
- Premise 1: There exists some `a` with Affection and Love
- Premise 2: There exists some `b` with Love and Positive
- Assumption: There exists some `w` with Affection and Positive

No relationship is established between `a`, `b`, and `w`. The object `w` might be different from both `a` and `b`, and there are no premises requiring that:
- The loving object from Premise 1 must be positive
- The loving object from Premise 2 must have affection
- Any object with affection must have love, or vice versa

Thus, it's possible to have a model where:
- Object A has Affection and Love (satisfying Premise 1)
- Object B has Love and Positive (satisfying Premise 2)
- No object has both Affection and Positive (making the conclusion false)

But it's also possible to have a model where:
- Object C has Affection, Love, and Positive (satisfying all premises and making the conclusion true)

Since the premises don't force either scenario, we cannot prove the negation of the conclusion.
