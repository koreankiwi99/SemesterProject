The reasoning problem is translated into Lean 4, and it is possible to prove that "John's car is a Solo EV" is false based on the given premises. The key steps are:

1. If John's car is a Solo EV, it must be a single-seat electric car (premise 4).
2. If it's a single-seat electric car, it's a one-seater (premise 3).
3. Premise 5 (properly interpreted) implies that if John's car isn't a Tesla Model 3, then it also isn't a single-seat electric car. Thus, if it is a single-seat electric car, it must be a Tesla Model 3 (contrapositive).
4. If it is a Tesla Model 3, it can transport multiple passengers (premise 2), meaning it can't be a one-seater (premise 1).
5. This results in a contradiction: the car is both a one-seater and not a one-seater.

Therefore, the assumption that John's car is a Solo EV must be false.
