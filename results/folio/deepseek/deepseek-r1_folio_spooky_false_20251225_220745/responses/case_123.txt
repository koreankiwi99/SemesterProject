axiom obj : Type
axiom john_car : obj  -- John's car

axiom TransportMultiPassenger : obj → Prop
axiom OneSeater : obj → Prop
axiom TeslaModel3 : obj → Prop
axiom SingleSeatElectricCar : obj → Prop
axiom SoloEV : obj → Prop

-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
axiom P1 : ∀ x, TransportMultiPassenger x → ¬OneSeater x

-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
axiom P2 : ∀ x, TeslaModel3 x → TransportMultiPassenger x

-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
axiom P3 : ∀ x, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x

-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
axiom P4 : ∀ x, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x

-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
-- Literal translation (tautology, adds no information):
axiom P5 : ¬TeslaModel3 john_car → (¬TeslaModel3 john_car ∨ SingleSeatElectricCar john_car)

-- Attempt to prove the negation of: "John's car is not a Solo EV"
-- This requires proving: SoloEV john_car
theorem prove_negation : SoloEV john_car := by
  -- The premises do not constrain john_car sufficiently
  -- We cannot derive that john_car must be a SoloEV
  -- Strategy fails to find proof
