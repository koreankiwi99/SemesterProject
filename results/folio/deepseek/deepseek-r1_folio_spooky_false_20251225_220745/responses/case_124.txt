The reasoning involves attempting to prove that "Rock is a monkey" is false based on the given premises. After translating the natural language statements into Lean axioms, a proof of `¬Monkey Rock` is attempted. The proof strategy assumes `Monkey Rock` and derives:
1. `Mammal Rock` (from P2)
2. `Animal Rock` (from P1 and P7)
3. `CanBreathe Rock` (from P5)
4. Simplification of P8 to `CanFly Rock ∨ Bird Rock` (using `CanBreathe Rock`)

However, no contradiction emerges:
- If `CanFly Rock`, P6 yields `HasWings Rock` (no contradiction with monkey properties).
- If `Bird Rock`, P4 yields `CanFly Rock` (no contradiction with monkey properties).

The premises do not establish mutual exclusivity between monkeys and birds, nor do they prohibit monkeys from flying or having wings. Thus, both cases remain consistent with `Monkey Rock`. Since no contradiction is found, the negation cannot be proven.
