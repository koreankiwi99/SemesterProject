The Lean code represents the given premises and attempts to prove the negation of the statement that John has a larger family. The premises are translated into axioms, and a theorem `not_John_larger_family` is defined to prove `¬ HasLargerFamily John`. The proof proceeds by assuming `HasLargerFamily John` and using axiom `A6` to split into two cases: John has a well-attended wedding or John invites friends. 

- In the first case, if John has a well-attended wedding, axioms `A3`, `A2`, and `A1` imply John is engaged. Axiom `A5` then states that John cannot both invite friends and make wedding plans. However, since there is no premise forcing John to invite friends in this scenario, no contradiction is derived.
- In the second case, if John invites friends, no premises link this action to a contradiction, as John might not be engaged or making wedding plans.

Additionally, the existential in `A4` does not involve John directly, providing no useful information. Both branches of the proof require `admit` (temporary acceptance) due to unresolved goals, indicating failure to prove the negation.

axiom A4 : ∃ x, HasWellAttendedWedding x ∧ HasLargerFamily x
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InvitesFriends John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)
axiom A6 : HasLargerFamily John → HasWellAttendedWedding John ∨ InvitesFriends John
