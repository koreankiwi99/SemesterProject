ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After analyzing the reasoning text and attempting to prove that "John does not have a larger family" is false (i.e., that John has a larger family), I found that the premises do not provide sufficient information to establish this conclusion. 

Key observations:
1. Premise P4 states that some person has both a well-attended wedding and larger family, but this person is not necessarily John
2. John-specific premises (P5 and P6) are conditional statements that:
   - Don't force John to have a larger family
   - Don't create contradictions with other premises
3. No premise links family size to engagement, wedding plans, or attendance
4. John could satisfy all premises without having a larger family

The Lean code below formalizes the reasoning but cannot prove the goal. The `sorry` tactic indicates where the proof fails.
