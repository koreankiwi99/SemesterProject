</lean>

We cannot prove that humans are not mammals because:
- Premises explicitly state that some mammals have teeth
- Platypus being a toothless mammal shows that tooth status varies among mammals
- No premise links teeth possession exclusively to mammals or non-mammals
- Human having teeth is consistent with both mammal and non-mammal possibilities

Thus, we cannot prove the negation (¬Mammal Human).

ITERATION 2

The compilation error occurred due to an invalid `show` statement in the tactic proof. After removing it, the Lean code compiles but remains incomplete as there's no contradiction derived from the premises. The corrected code and explanation follow.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop
axiom Platypus : obj
axiom Human : obj

axiom some_mammals_teeth : ∃ x : obj, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom platypus_no_teeth : ¬ HasTeeth Platypus
axiom platypus_mammal : Mammal Platypus
axiom human_teeth : HasTeeth Human

theorem human_not_mammal : ¬ Mammal Human :=
  fun h_human_mammal : Mammal Human =>   -- Assume Human is a mammal
  -- Derive known facts: Mammal Human (assumption) and HasTeeth Human (axiom)
  -- But this conflicts with NO premise. Specifically:
  --   Platypus is Mammal and ¬HasTeeth Platypus shows mammals can lack teeth
  --   ∃x (Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x) allows tooth-having mammals (plausibly Human)
  -- Thus: Mammal Human + HasTeeth Human is perfectly consistent
  -- No contradiction exists → proof fails
  by contradiction  -- Attempted tactic still fails to find contradiction
  sorry  -- Required since no actual contradiction found
</lean>

**Analysis**:  
The premises establish:  
1. Tooth existence varies among mammals (Platypus: no teeth; ∃ some mammals: teeth)  
2. Humans have teeth – compatible with both mammal status (via 1) and non-mammal status (no premise forbids non-mammals from having teeth).  
The negation of "Humans are mammals" cannot be proven.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic requires an obvious contradiction in the context, but none exists between human teeth possession and mammal status. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop
axiom Platypus : obj
axiom Human : obj

axiom some_mammals_teeth : ∃ x : obj, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom platypus_no_teeth : ¬ HasTeeth Platypus
axiom platypus_mammal : Mammal Platypus
axiom human_teeth : HasTeeth Human

theorem human_not_mammal : ¬Mammal Human := by
  intro h_human_mammal  -- Assume human is mammal
  -- Known facts: 
  --     Mammal Human (assumed), HasTeeth Human (axiom)
  --     Mammal Platypus (axiom), ¬HasTeeth Platypus (axiom)
  -- No contradiction found because:
  --   - Premises allow mammals both with (∃x) and without teeth (platypus)
  --   - Human teeth status doesn't conflict with mammal status
  sorry  -- Proof fails here - no contradiction
</lean>

**Verification:**
1. The premises establish variability: 
   - Some mammals have teeth (general existence)
   - Platypus = mammalian counterexample (mammal without teeth)
   - Humans have teeth but no premise requires teeth to imply non-mammal status
2. Human teeth possession is consistent with both mammal status (like other toothed mammals) and non-mammal status (since non-mammals could have teeth too)

No valid proof exists since the premises don't constrain tooth possession exclusively to mammals/non-mammals.
