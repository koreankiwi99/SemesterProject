The Lean code models the premises and attempts to prove that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is not rated General Audience. However, the disjunction in premise P7 creates two cases:

1. If Hachi is a family-friendly animated film, then by P4 it must be rated GA (valid case where the conclusion holds).
2. If Hachi is appropriate for all ages, there is no premise forcing it to be rated GA (but also no contradiction).

Since case 1 directly proves IsRatedGA(hachi) and case 2 doesn't yield a contradiction, the negation ¬IsRatedGA(hachi) cannot be proven. The attempt results in admitted cases, indicating failure.
