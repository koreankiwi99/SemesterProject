The reasoning begins by defining the necessary types and predicates based on the context. The type `Book` represents books, with constants `neapolitanChronicles` and `palaceOfFlies` as specific books. The predicate `PublishedByNVP` identifies books published by New Vessel Press, and `IsEnglishBook` indicates books in English. The predicate `TranslatedFrom` captures the original language of a book, but only for `neapolitanChronicles` being translated from Italian is provided.

Axioms are established:
1. All books published by New Vessel Press are in English (`all_nvp_english`).
2. Both `neapolitanChronicles` and `palaceOfFlies` are published by New Vessel Press (`nc_published`, `palace_published`).
3. `neapolitanChronicles` was translated from Italian (`nc_translated`).

The statement to evaluate is "Neapolitan Chronicles is an English book," formalized as `IsEnglishBook neapolitanChronicles`. Using the axiom `all_nvp_english` and `nc_published`, the theorem `nc_english` proves this statement true. Therefore, the negation (`¬IsEnglishBook neapolitanChronicles`) cannot be proven, as there is no contradiction with the premises (being translated does not preclude being an English book after translation).

axiom Book : Type
axiom neapolitanChronicles : Book
axiom palaceOfFlies : Book
axiom PublishedByNVP : Book → Prop
axiom IsEnglishBook : Book → Prop
axiom TranslatedFrom : Book → String → Prop

axiom all_nvp_english : ∀ b : Book, PublishedByNVP b → IsEnglishBook b
axiom nc_published : PublishedByNVP neapolitanChronicles
axiom palace_published : PublishedByNVP palaceOfFlies
axiom nc_translated : TranslatedFrom neapolitanChronicles "Italian"

theorem nc_english : IsEnglishBook neapolitanChronicles := 
  all_nvp_english neapolitanChronicles nc_published

-- Attempt to prove ¬IsEnglishBook neapolitanChronicles fails since it is provably true.
-- No contradiction arises from translation; translated books are English by axioms.
