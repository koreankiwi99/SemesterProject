The premises provide information about New Vessel Press and specific books it published, but they do not mention Harry Potter. The key premises are:
1. All books published by New Vessel Press are in English.
2. Neapolitan Chronicles and Palace of Flies are published by New Vessel Press.
3. Neapolitan Chronicles was translated from Italian.

There is no premise stating that New Vessel Press exclusively publishes translated works or any information about Harry Potter's language or publication status. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that Harry Potter was not published by New Vessel Press based solely on the given premises.

theorem not_published_by_new_vessel : ¬ PublishedBy harryPotter :=
  fun h : PublishedBy harryPotter =>
  -- We know `InEnglish harryPotter` from `all_english h`, but this doesn't contradict anything.
  -- No premise links Harry Potter to non-English or restricts New Vessel Press to translations only.
  -- Thus, we cannot derive a contradiction.
  -- Attempting to prove ¬PublishedBy harryPotter fails due to insufficient premises.
  False.elim (by
    -- We have no information to generate a contradiction from `h`.
    -- Therefore, the proof cannot be completed.
    admit  -- This is a placeholder; in reality, no tactic sequence works.
