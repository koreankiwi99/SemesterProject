The Lean code below formalizes the given premises and attempts to prove that "The mixture contains carbon" is false. The reasoning involves:

1. Defining the necessary types and predicates
2. Formalizing the premises as axioms:
   - All hydrocarbons are organic
   - All organic compounds are chemical compounds
   - All organic compounds contain carbon
   - No chemical compound contains only one element
   - The mixture is either (chemical compound ∧ contains one element) or (¬chemical compound ∧ ¬contains one element)

3. Proving intermediate results:
   - The mixture cannot be a chemical compound (since chemical compounds cannot contain one element, contradicting the first disjunct)
   - The mixture cannot be organic (since organic compounds are chemical compounds)

4. Attempting to prove the mixture does not contain carbon:
   - While we know organic compounds contain carbon, there is no premise stating that *only* organic compounds contain carbon
   - The mixture's non-organic status doesn't preclude it from containing carbon via other means
   - No contradiction emerges from assuming the mixture contains carbon

Since the negation of "The mixture contains carbon" cannot be proven from the premises, the result is Failure.

  -- We know ¬IsOrganic Mixture, but no premise links non-organic status to carbon absence
  -- Attempt to derive contradiction from ContainsCarbon Mixture:
  intro hCarbon
  -- No available premises connect carbon containment to organic/chemical status for non-organic entities
  -- Cannot derive contradiction
