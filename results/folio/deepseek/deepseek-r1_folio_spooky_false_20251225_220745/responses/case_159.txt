The premises lead to a contradiction. Specifically:
- Premise 6 states that James works in the lab.
- Premise 7 states that James does not work in the lab or have a part-time job.
- These directly contradict each other because James working in the lab (premise 6) would imply he works in the lab OR has a part-time job, which is negated by premise 7.

Since the premises are inconsistent, any conclusion can be derived, including the negation of "James takes the database course." The Lean proof demonstrates this contradiction without needing other premises.
