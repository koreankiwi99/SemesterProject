The Lean code formalizes the given premises and attempts to prove that "Rockie is a turtle" is false. The premises are translated into axioms, and the proof shows that Rockie must be a rabbit (not a squirrel) based on the calmness and spotting conditions. However, there is no premise stating that rabbits cannot be turtles, so the proof cannot establish that Rockie is not a turtle. Therefore, the negation of the statement cannot be proven.

axiom Animal : Type
axiom Rockie : Animal
axiom Spotted : Animal → Prop
axiom Rabbit : Animal → Prop
axiom Squirrel : Animal → Prop
axiom Turtle : Animal → Prop
axiom Cute : Animal → Prop
axiom Skittish : Animal → Prop
axiom Calm : Animal → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ a, Rabbit a ∧ Spotted a → Cute a
axiom P2 : ∃ a, Turtle a ∧ Spotted a
axiom P3 : ∀ a, Spotted a → Rabbit a ∨ Squirrel a
axiom P4 : ∀ a, Skittish a → ¬ Calm a
axiom P5 : ∀ a, Squirrel a ∧ Spotted a → Skittish a
axiom P6a : Spotted Rockie
axiom P6b : Calm Rockie

theorem rockie_not_squirrel : ¬ Squirrel Rockie :=
  fun h : Squirrel Rockie =>
  have H : Squirrel Rockie ∧ Spotted Rockie := ⟨h, P6a⟩
  have skittish_rockie : Skittish Rockie := P5 Rockie H
  have not_calm : ¬ Calm Rockie := P4 Rockie skittish_rockie
  not_calm P6b

theorem rockie_rabbit : Rabbit Rockie :=
  have H : Spotted Rockie → Rabbit Rockie ∨ Squirrel Rockie := P3 Rockie
  have H1 : Rabbit Rockie ∨ Squirrel Rockie := H P6a
  Or.elim H1
    (fun rabbit : Rabbit Rockie => rabbit)
    (fun squirrel : Squirrel Rockie => absurd squirrel rockie_not_squirrel)

-- Attempt to prove Rockie is not a turtle fails due to lack of disjointness
theorem rockie_not_turtle : ¬ Turtle Rockie :=
  fun h : Turtle Rockie =>
  -- No contradiction derived: Rabbit and Turtle may overlap
  False.elim ( -- Placeholder for contradiction
    have rabbit : Rabbit Rockie := rockie_rabbit
    -- Missing axiom: Rabbit and Turtle are disjoint
