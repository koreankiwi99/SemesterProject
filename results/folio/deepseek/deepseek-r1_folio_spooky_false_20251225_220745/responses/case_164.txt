The reasoning involves proving that the statement about Breaking Bad is false. The key steps are:
1. If Breaking Bad gave out roses, it would be The Bachelor (Premise 2)
2. The Bachelor portrays real lives (Premise 3)
3. Shows portraying real lives are reality TV (Premise 4)
4. Thus, Breaking Bad would be reality TV if it gave roses
5. But Breaking Bad is not reality TV (Premise 6)
6. Therefore, Breaking Bad cannot give out roses
7. The conclusion requires both airing at Monday 8pm and giving roses
8. Since giving roses is false, the entire statement is false

axiom Show : Type
axiom BreakingBad : Show

axiom GivesRoses : Show → Prop
axiom IsBachelor : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysReal : Show → Prop
axiom IsRealityTV : Show → Prop

axiom Premise1 : ∃ s : Show, AiringAtMonday8pm s ∧ GivesRoses s
axiom Premise2 : ∀ s : Show, GivesRoses s → IsBachelor s
axiom Premise3 : ∀ s : Show, IsBachelor s → PortraysReal s
axiom Premise4 : ∀ s : Show, PortraysReal s → IsRealityTV s
axiom Premise6 : ¬ IsRealityTV BreakingBad

theorem not_roses : ¬ GivesRoses BreakingBad :=
  fun h : GivesRoses BreakingBad =>

  have h2 : PortraysReal BreakingBad := Premise3 BreakingBad h1
  have h3 : IsRealityTV BreakingBad := Premise4 BreakingBad h2

ANSWER: False
