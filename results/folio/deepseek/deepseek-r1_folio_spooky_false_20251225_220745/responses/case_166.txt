ANSWER: Failure

**Explanation:**
- We defined all relevant predicates and entities from the context.
- The premise `P1` establishes that Heinrich Schmidt was German.
- The premise `P2` about parliamentary memberships is irrelevant for disproving the disjunction about nationality.
- The attempted proof of `False` fails because:
  - To disprove "German ∨ Russian", we must show NEITHER holds.
  - But `P1` directly proves "German" is true.
  - This forces the disjunction to be true, making its negation impossible to prove.
- No axioms connect parliamentary membership to nationality exclusions, so `P2` doesn't help disprove Russian nationality.
- Thus, while the Lean syntax is valid, the proof fails logically since we cannot derive a contradiction. Final output: Failure.

After analyzing the errors, I've corrected the Lean code to properly reflect the logical structure and ensure it compiles. The key issue was attempting to prove False without having the negation of the conclusion as an explicit assumption.

The corrected approach:
1. Defines the domain object and predicates
2. States the premises (P1: Heinrich was German, P2: His parliamentary memberships)
3. Attempts a theorem to prove the conclusion false by:
   - Assuming the negation of the conclusion (¬(German ∨ Russian))
   - Showing this leads to contraction with P1 (German is true)
4. This successfully proves a contradiction when given the negation, but does NOT prove the conclusion false outright

ANSWER: Failure

Explanation:
While we can prove ¬(German∨Russian) → False (showing the conclusion must be true), we cannot directly prove ¬(German∨Russian) from the premises. There is no path from P1 or P2 to the conclusion's negation, as P2 provides no nationality restrictions. Therefore, we output Failure.
