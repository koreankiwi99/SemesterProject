The premises state that Heinrich Schmidt is a politician and a member of the Nazi Reichstag. The statement to evaluate claims that no politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag. In logic, the statement is a universal negation: ∀x, Politician x → ¬MemberOfNaziReichstag x. The negation of this statement (∃x, Politician x ∧ MemberOfNaziReichstag x) is witnessed by Heinrich Schmidt, making the original statement false.

Here is the Lean proof:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
constant HeinrichSchmidt : obj
axiom Politician : obj → Prop
axiom MemberOfNaziReichstag : obj → Prop
axiom A1 : Politician HeinrichSchmidt
axiom A2 : MemberOfNaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt
theorem conclusion_false : ¬ (∀ x, Politician x → ¬ MemberOfNaziReichstag x) :=
  fun h => h HeinrichSchmidt A1 A2
</lean>

ANSWER: False

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect handling of the universe levels and syntax. The initial declaration `axiom obj : Type` introduced `obj` as a term of type `Type`, but subsequent declarations treated it as a type. This inconsistency caused universe level mismatches. The solution is to declare `Person` as a concrete type using `axiom Person : Type` and adjust all declarations accordingly.

Here is the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : Person
axiom Politician : Person → Prop
axiom MemberOfNaziReichstag : Person → Prop
axiom A1 : Politician HeinrichSchmidt
axiom A2 : MemberOfNaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt
theorem statement_false : ¬(∀ x, Politician x → ¬MemberOfNaziReichstag x) := 
  fun h => (h HeinrichSchmidt A1) A2
</lean>

**Explanation:**
1. `Person` is declared as a type (using `axiom Person : Type`)
2. `HeinrichSchmidt` is declared as a term of type `Person`
3. Predicates (`Politician`, `MemberOfNaziReichstag`) are defined on `Person`
4. Premises `A1` and `A2` establish that Heinrich Schmidt is both a politician and a member
5. The theorem proves the negation of "no politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag":
   - Assume the universal claim `h`
   - Apply `h` to `HeinrichSchmidt` with evidence `A1` to get `¬MemberOfNaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt`
   - This contradicts premise `A2`, producing `False`

The proof successfully demonstrates the contradiction, confirming that the statement "No politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag" is false.
