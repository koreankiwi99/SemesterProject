The reasoning involves formalizing the given premises and the statement to evaluate in Lean. The key steps are:

1. **Premises**:
   - Deadly diseases have low survival rates.
   - Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
   - Bile duct cancer is a severe cancer.
   - Cholangiocarcinoma is a type of bile duct cancer.
   - Mild flu has a low survival rate.
   - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is not both bile duct cancer and low-survival.

2. **Deductions**:
   - Bile duct cancer (for any object) implies severe cancer (→ deadly disease → low survival).
   - For CRC: By the last premise and the deduction above, CRC cannot be bile duct cancer (proof `not_bile`). Otherwise, it would have low survival, contradicting the premise.
   - Since Cholangiocarcinoma implies bile duct cancer, CRC also cannot be Cholangiocarcinoma (proof `not_cholang`).
   - Thus, the antecedent of the conditional ("CRC is bile duct cancer or Cholangiocarcinoma") is false (proof `ante_false`).

3. **Evaluation of the statement**:
   - The statement is: `(BileDuctCancer CRC ∨ Cholangiocarcinoma CRC) → (BileDuctCancer CRC ∧ MildFlu CRC)`.
   - Since the antecedent is false, the entire conditional is *true* (a false premise implies anything). 
   - However, the task is to **prove the statement is false** (i.e., disprove the conditional).
   - Proving it false requires showing the antecedent is true AND the consequent is false. We proved the antecedent false, making the conditional true.
   - Therefore, we cannot prove the statement is false.

The Lean code formalizes the premises and proves key intermediate facts, but no proof of the statement's falsehood (i.e., `False`) is possible. We return `Failure`.

-- Since we cannot remove `sorry`, we have no proof of the goal's falsehood
