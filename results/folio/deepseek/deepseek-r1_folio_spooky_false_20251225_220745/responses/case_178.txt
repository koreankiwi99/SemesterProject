The reasoning is based on the premises that all horses have hooves and no humans have hooves. If there existed a human who is a horse, that individual would have hooves (from being a horse) but also not have hooves (from being human), leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the statement "Some humans are horses" must be false.

    have no_hooves : ¬HasHooves x := no_humans_have_hooves x hx_human
    exact no_hooves has_hooves
</lean>

The proof shows that the existence of a human horse leads to a contradiction, proving the statement false.
