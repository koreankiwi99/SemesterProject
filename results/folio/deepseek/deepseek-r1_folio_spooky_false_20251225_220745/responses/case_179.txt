The reasoning involves proving that Susan does not fly from LGA airport. The premises state:
1. Susan flies to LGA (so her arrival is LGA).
2. For any flight, departure and arrival airports must differ.
3. John flies from LGA.

If Susan were to fly from LGA, her departure and arrival would both be LGA, violating premise 2. Thus, the statement "Susan flies from LGA" must be false.

<lean>
constant Airport : Type
constant Person : Type
constant LGA : Airport
constant Susan : Person
constant John : Person
constant departure : Person → Airport
constant arrival : Person → Airport
axiom arrival_susan : arrival Susan = LGA
axiom different_airports : ∀ p : Person, departure p ≠ arrival p
axiom john_departure : departure John = LGA

theorem susan_not_from_LGA : ¬ (departure Susan = LGA) := by
  intro h
  have key := different_airports Susan
  rw [arrival_susan, h] at key
  exact key rfl
</lean>

ANSWER: False

ITERATION 2

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect declaration of `departure` and `arrival` as constants rather than functions. The corrected code properly defines them as functions from `Person` to `Airport`. The proof shows that if Susan departed from LGA, her departure and arrival would both be LGA, violating the axiom that departure and arrival must differ.

<lean>
axiom Airport : Type
axiom Person : Type
axiom LGA : Airport
axiom Susan : Person
axiom John : Person
axiom departure : Person → Airport
axiom arrival : Person → Airport
axiom arrival_susan : arrival Susan = LGA
axiom different_airports : ∀ p : Person, departure p ≠ arrival p
axiom john_departure : departure John = LGA

theorem susan_not_from_LGA : ¬ (departure Susan = LGA) := by
  intro h
  have same_airport : departure Susan = arrival Susan := by rw [h, arrival_susan]
  exact different_airports Susan same_airport

ANSWER: False
