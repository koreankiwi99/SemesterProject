The premises lead to a contradiction only if Rockie is a squirrel, but Rockie could be a rabbit without contradiction. Specifically:
- Rockie is spotted and calm.
- From premise 3, Rockie is either a rabbit or a squirrel.
- If Rockie is a squirrel, then by premise 5, Rockie is skittish, which contradicts premise 4 given Rockie's calmness.
- If Rockie is a rabbit, then by premise 1, Rockie is cute, which is consistent with all premises.

The statement to evaluate is: "If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish." When Rockie is a rabbit:
- Rockie is not a squirrel (assuming disjoint types, though not explicitly stated), so the antecedent is true.
- Rockie is cute, so the consequent is true, making the statement true.

Thus, the negation of the statement cannot be proven from the premises. The premises do not entail a contradiction (as the rabbit case is consistent), so proving the statement's negation is impossible.

The Lean code attempts to prove the negation of the statement "If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish" from the given premises. However, the premises imply that Rockie must be a rabbit (not a squirrel) and is cute, making the statement true. The negation cannot be proven, and no contradiction arises from the premises.

The compilation errors occurred due to mixing term-style proofs with tactic proofs improperly and attempting to prove lemmas that aren't directly needed. The key issue is that the negation of the statement cannot be proven from the premises. Below is corrected Lean code:
