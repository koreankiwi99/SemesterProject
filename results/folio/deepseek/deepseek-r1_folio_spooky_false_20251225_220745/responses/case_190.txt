The statement to evaluate is: "If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player." This is represented as the implication `¬Leap Yuri → (BasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri)`. 

From the premises:
1. All basketball players can do jump shots (`∀x, BasketballPlayer x → JumpShots x`)
2. Jump shots imply leaping (`∀x, JumpShots x → Leap x`)
3. Leaping implies activating leg muscles (`∀x, Leap x → ActivateLegMuscles x`)
4. Yuri does not activate his leg muscles (`¬ActivateLegMuscles Yuri`)

We derive:
- By contraposition on (3), Yuri does not leap (`¬Leap Yuri`)
- If Yuri were a basketball player, he would activate his leg muscles (through chain 1-2-3), contradicting premise 4. Thus, Yuri is not a basketball player (`¬BasketballPlayer Yuri`)

Therefore:
- The antecedent `¬Leap Yuri` is true
- The consequent `BasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri` is false (due to `¬BasketballPlayer Yuri`)
- This makes the entire implication false
