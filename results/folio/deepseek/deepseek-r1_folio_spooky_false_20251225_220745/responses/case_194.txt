    cases tie_has_belgian with | intro w hw =>
    -- w is in the tie and Belgian. But we have no information forcing w to be Descampe.
    -- Descampe being in the tie (h_descampe_in_tie) and w being in the tie doesn't conflict.
    -- There might be multiple Belgians, so w may or may not be Descampe.
    -- We have no premises about unique nationalities or tie composition.
    -- Steinhauer is not the same as Descampe (distinct), but we don't know if Steinhauer is in the tie or related.
    -- Since premises do not preclude multiple Belgians or Descampe being in the tie, no contradiction arises.
    -- Proof fails here.
    sorry -- No valid proof exists to close the goal.

-- The unproven theorem above shows we cannot derive ¬InTie descampe.
