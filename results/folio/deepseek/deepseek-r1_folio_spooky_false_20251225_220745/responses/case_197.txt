The reasoning involves translating the given premises into Lean and attempting to prove the negation of the statement "KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog" (i.e., prove that this statement is false). The negation is equivalent to "KiKi barks or KiKi is a dog" (Barks KiKi ∨ Dog KiKi).

### Key Steps:
1. **Derive that KiKi jumps**:
   - From premise G: If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
   - If KiKi has no legs, assuming no jumps leads to a contradiction (via premises E and G). Thus, KiKi must jump regardless of leg status (using premise D for the case with legs).

2. **Jane likes KiKi**:
   - Since KiKi jumps and is an animal (premise F), premise C implies Jane likes KiKi.

3. **KiKi does not bark**:
   - If KiKi barked, premise A would imply Jane does not like KiKi, contradicting the previous step. Thus, KiKi cannot bark.

4. **Attempt to prove the goal (Barks KiKi ∨ Dog KiKi)**:
   - We have ¬Barks KiKi, so the goal reduces to proving Dog KiKi.
   - Premise B states all dogs bark and are animals, but there is no premise forcing KiKi to be a dog.
   - Assuming ¬Dog KiKi is consistent with all premises, so Dog KiKi cannot be proven.

### Conclusion:
The premises imply ¬Barks KiKi but do not force Dog KiKi. Thus, the goal (Barks KiKi ∨ Dog KiKi) cannot be proven. Therefore, the original statement "KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog" cannot be proven false from the premises.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The initial attempt had several issues in the Lean code:
1. The proof of `kiki_jumps` contained an incorrect case split that used `by trivial` instead of proper classical case analysis.
2. The proof of `not_barks_kiki` needed explicit contradiction handling.
3. The disjunction proof (`Barks KiKi ∨ Dog KiKi`) incorrectly tried to use `¬Barks KiKi` as proof of `Barks KiKi`.

The corrected code:
1. Uses proper classical case analysis for `kiki_jumps`
2. Directly applies contradictions where needed
3. Shows the disjunction cannot be proven since:
   - `¬Barks KiKi` is provable (from Jane liking KiKi)
   - `¬Dog KiKi` is provable (via contrapositive of axiom B)
   - Both disjunction branches fail

Final confirmation: The original statement "KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog" is actually true under the premises, so its negation cannot be proven.
