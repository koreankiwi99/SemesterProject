The context provides information that directly contradicts the statement. Specifically, it states that Ailton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Náutico. The statement claims that no one playing for Náutico is Brazilian, but Ailton Silva is a counterexample. Therefore, the statement is false.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom FootballClub : Type
axiom Brazilian : Person → Prop
axiom PlaysFor : Person → FootballClub → Prop
axiom Braga : FootballClub
axiom Nautico : FootballClub  -- Represents "Náutico"
axiom Fluminense : FootballClub
axiom AiltonSilva : Person
axiom isBrazilian : Brazilian AiltonSilva
axiom playsForNautico : PlaysFor AiltonSilva Nautico
theorem disprove_statement : ¬(∀ p : Person, PlaysFor p Nautico → ¬Brazilian p) := by
  intro h
  have h_contr := h AiltonSilva playsForNautico
  exact h_contr isBrazilian
</lean>

The Lean proof shows that the universal statement ("No one playing for Nautico is Brazilian") leads to a contradiction when applied to Ailton Silva, who is both Brazilian and plays for Nautico. Therefore, the statement is false.

ANSWER: False
