The translation and proof proceed as follows:

1. Define the necessary types and predicates:
   - `obj` for entities
   - `Ailton`, `Braga`, `Nautico`, `Fluminense` as specific objects
   - `IsFootballClub` to identify football clubs
   - `LoanedOutTo` for loan relationships

2. Formalize the premises:
   - `loaned_to_Braga`: Ailton was loaned to Braga
   - `BragaIsClub`: Braga is a football club (inferred from "Náutico is a football club along with Braga")

3. Prove the negation of the statement:
   - The statement "Ailton was not loaned out to a football club" is defined as the proposition `¬∃ C, IsFootballClub C ∧ LoanedOutTo Ailton C`
   - The theorem `not_statement` proves the negation of this proposition by showing Braga is a counterexample

4. Derive `False` from the statement:
   - The final theorem `proven_false` assumes the original statement and derives a contradiction using the existence proof

======================================================================

The corrected Lean code properly formalizes the premises and proves the negation of the statement. Key improvements:
1. Removed unnecessary club constants (Nautico/Fluminense) since only Braga is relevant
2. Simplified to directly prove the statement's falsity
3. Fixed function application error by removing redundant theorem
