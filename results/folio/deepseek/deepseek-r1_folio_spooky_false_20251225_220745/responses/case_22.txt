We are to formalize the given context and prove the negation of the statement "Black Mirror is popular". The reasoning uses the following steps:

1. From the biconditional: "Binge-watching occurs if and only if downloading occurs" (for Netflix shows)
2. We know Karen does not download "Black Mirror", so she does not binge-watch it.
3. The premise: If a Netflix show is popular, Karen binge-watches it.
4. Since Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror" (from step 2), it cannot be popular.

Thus, we prove that "Black Mirror" is not popular.

axiom obj : Type
axiom StrangerThings : obj
axiom BlackMirror : obj
axiom NetflixShow : obj → Prop
axiom Popular : obj → Prop
axiom BingeWatch : obj → Prop
axiom Download : obj → Prop
axiom ShareWithLisa : obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : NetflixShow StrangerThings ∧ Popular StrangerThings
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, NetflixShow x → (Popular x → BingeWatch x)
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, NetflixShow x → (BingeWatch x ↔ Download x)
axiom P4 : ¬Download BlackMirror
axiom P5 : NetflixShow BlackMirror
axiom P6 : ∀ x : obj, NetflixShow x → (BingeWatch x → ShareWithLisa x)

-- Prove that "Black Mirror" is NOT popular

  intro h_popular
  have h_bw := P2 BlackMirror P5 h_popular
  rw [P3 BlackMirror P5] at h_bw
  exact P4 h_bw
