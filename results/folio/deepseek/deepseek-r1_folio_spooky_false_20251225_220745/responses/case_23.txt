  contradiction

-- After attempting to prove the negation, we find the above is incomplete because T6 only provides that binge-watching LEADS to sharing, not that sharing REQUIRES binge-watching.
-- Since we cannot derive a contradiction from assuming "Shares Karen BlackMirror Lisa" (as Karen could share without binge-watching via mechanisms not forbidden by the axioms),
-- we must declare failure.

-- Revised: we demonstrate the attempt fails by showing we cannot complete the proof.

The corrected code fixes these errors:
1. Renames `Show` to `Series` to avoid conflict with Lean's built-in `Show` typeclass
2. Properly uses `variable` instead of `constant` for more flexible declarations
3. Specifies types for quantifiers (e.g., `∀ (s : Series)`)
4. Removes the logically flawed tactic proof that incorrectly assumed sharing implies binge-watching
5. Replaces the contradiction attempt with `admit` since the proof cannot be completed

The key logical issue: While we know:
- Karen doesn't download Black Mirror (T4)
- Thus she doesn't binge-watch it (T3)
- T6 says binge-watching causes sharing, but it doesn't say sharing requires binge-watching
There exists no axiom preventing Karen from sharing Black Mirror without binge-watching it.

Therefore, we cannot prove the negation ("Karen will not share Black Mirror with Lisa").

ITERATION 3

After analyzing the compilation errors and the logical structure, I've identified two key issues: incorrect use of `variable` declarations (which caused parsing errors) and the core logical impossibility of proving the negation due to insufficient premises. Here's the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
constant Person : Type
constant NetflixShow : Type
constant Karen : Person
constant Lisa : Person
constant StrangerThings : NetflixShow
constant BlackMirror : NetflixShow

constant Popular : NetflixShow → Prop
constant BingeWatches : Person → NetflixShow → Prop
constant Downloads : Person → NetflixShow → Prop
constant Shares : Person → NetflixShow → Person → Prop

axiom T1 : Popular StrangerThings
axiom T2 : ∀ (s : NetflixShow), Popular s → BingeWatches Karen s
axiom T3 : ∀ (s : NetflixShow), BingeWatches Karen s ↔ Downloads Karen s
axiom T4 : ¬ Downloads Karen BlackMirror
axiom T6 : ∀ (s : NetflixShow), BingeWatches Karen s → Shares Karen s Lisa

theorem disprove_share : ¬ Shares Karen BlackMirror Lisa := by
  intro h_share
  -- Prove Karen doesn't binge-watch BlackMirror
  have no_bw : ¬ BingeWatches Karen BlackMirror := by
    intro h_bw
    have h_dl : Downloads Karen BlackMirror := (T3 BlackMirror).mp h_bw
    exact T4 h_dl
  -- T6 only states binge-watching causes sharing, not the converse
  -- No axiom prevents sharing without binge-watching
  -- Cannot derive contradiction from h_share
  admit
</lean>

**Explanation:**
1. Replaced `variable` with `constant` for all declarations to resolve parsing errors
2. Removed redundant `NetflixShow` predicate by incorporating it into the type
3. Removed T5 (Black Mirror being a Netflix show) as it's implied by the type
4. The `admit` tactic confirms the proof is incomplete

**Logical Analysis:**
- From T3 and T4, Karen doesn't binge-watch Black Mirror (`no_bw`)
- T6 only establishes that binge-watching implies sharing ("if"), not that sharing requires binge-watching ("only if")
- No premise connects sharing directly to downloading/binge-watching
- Possible Karen could share without binge-watching via undetermined mechanisms
- Thus impossible to prove she doesn't share (¬Shares)
