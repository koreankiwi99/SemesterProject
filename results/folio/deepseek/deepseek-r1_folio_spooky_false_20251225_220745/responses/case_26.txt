The context provides information about Beijing's status as the capital of China, its geographic location, historical events it hosted, and the quality of its universities. However, it does not provide any data or logical relationships that would allow inferring Beijing's population rank relative to other Chinese cities. 

Specifically:
- Being the capital does not imply a specific population rank.
- Hosting major events indicates prominence but not quantitative size.
- Academic excellence relates to education quality, not city size.
- No population figures, comparisons, or rankings are mentioned.

Therefore, the negation of "Beijing is the second largest Chinese city" cannot be proven from the given premises. The statement remains unverifiable based solely on the provided context.
