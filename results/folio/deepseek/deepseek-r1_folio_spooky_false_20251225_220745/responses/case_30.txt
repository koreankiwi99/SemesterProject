The Lean code models the given premises and attempts to prove the negation of the statement "Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion." The axioms represent the logical relationships from the context. The theorem `not_GS_Djokovic` tries to derive a contradiction by assuming Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, but no contradiction is found. Since the premises do not provide sufficient information to disprove that Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion (he could be either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor without contradiction), the proof is incomplete and marked with `admit`.

ANSWER: Failure

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Djokovic : obj
axiom AtMixer : obj → Prop
axiom GS : obj → Prop
axiom Oscar : obj → Prop
axiom Tennis : obj → Prop
axiom Celebrity : obj → Prop
axiom Athlete : obj → Prop
axiom WellPaid : obj → Prop
axiom Famous : obj → Prop
axiom TaxHaven : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → GS p ∨ Oscar p
axiom P2 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → GS p → Tennis p
axiom P3 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → Oscar p → Celebrity p
axiom P4 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → Tennis p → Athlete p
axiom P5 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → Celebrity p → WellPaid p
axiom P6 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → Athlete p → Famous p
axiom P7 : ∀ p, AtMixer p → WellPaid p → TaxHaven p
axiom P8 : AtMixer Djokovic ∧ (Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic → WellPaid Djokovic)

theorem not_GS_Djokovic : ¬ GS Djokovic :=
by
  intro h_gs
  have h_mixer := P8.left

  have h_wellpaid := P8.right ⟨h_famous, h_athlete⟩
  have h_tax := P7 Djokovic h_mixer h_wellpaid
