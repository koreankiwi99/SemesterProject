The reasoning text has been translated into Lean 4 code. The goal is to prove that the statement "Djokovic does not live in a tax haven" is false by showing that Djokovic must live in a tax haven based on the premises.

variable Person : Type
variable Djokovic : Person
variable Mixer : Person → Prop
variable GrandSlam : Person → Prop
variable OscarNominated : Person → Prop
variable TennisPlayer : Person → Prop
variable Celebrity : Person → Prop
variable Athlete : Person → Prop
variable WellPaid : Person → Prop
variable Famous : Person → Prop
variable TaxHaven : Person → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x, Mixer x → GrandSlam x ∨ OscarNominated x
axiom P2 : ∀ x, Mixer x → GrandSlam x → TennisPlayer x
axiom P3 : ∀ x, Mixer x → OscarNominated x → Celebrity x
axiom P4 : ∀ x, Mixer x → TennisPlayer x → Athlete x
axiom P5 : ∀ x, Mixer x → Celebrity x → WellPaid x
axiom P6 : ∀ x, Mixer x → Athlete x → Famous x
axiom P7 : ∀ x, Mixer x → WellPaid x → TaxHaven x
axiom P8 : Mixer Djokovic
axiom P9 : Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic → WellPaid Djokovic

theorem Djokovic_in_tax_haven : TaxHaven Djokovic := by
  have h_mixer := P8
  have h_type := P1 Djokovic h_mixer
  cases h_type with
  | inl gs =>
      have h_tennis := P2 Djokovic h_mixer gs
      have h_athlete := P4 Djokovic h_mixer h_tennis
      have h_famous := P6 Djokovic h_mixer h_athlete
      have h_wellpaid := P9 ⟨h_famous, h_athlete⟩
      exact P7 Djokovic h_mixer h_wellpaid
  | inr on =>
      have h_celebrity := P3 Djokovic h_mixer on
      have h_wellpaid := P5 Djokovic h_mixer h_celebrity
      exact P7 Djokovic h_mixer h_wellpaid
</lean>

The Lean proof demonstrates that Djokovic lives in a tax haven by case analysis:
1. If Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, he becomes a tennis player (P2), then an athlete (P4), then famous (P6). Premise P9 (triggered by being a famous athlete) ensures he is well-paid, leading to living in a tax haven (P7).
2. If Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, he becomes a celebrity (P3), then well-paid (P5), and thus lives in a tax haven (P7).

Since both cases lead to `TaxHaven Djokovic`, the statement "Djokovic does not live in a tax haven" is false.

The compilation errors occurred because the `variable` declarations were not properly scoped. In Lean 4, `variable` must be used within a context like `section` or `namespace`, but here we can replace them with explicit `axiom` declarations for clarity. The corrected code uses `axiom` for all declarations and ensures proper typing.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Djokovic : Person
axiom Mixer : Person → Prop
axiom GrandSlam : Person → Prop
axiom OscarNominated : Person → Prop
axiom TennisPlayer : Person → Prop
axiom Celebrity : Person → Prop
axiom Athlete : Person → Prop
axiom WellPaid : Person → Prop
axiom Famous : Person → Prop
axiom TaxHaven : Person → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ (x : Person), Mixer x → GrandSlam x ∨ OscarNominated x
axiom P2 : ∀ (x : Person), Mixer x → GrandSlam x → TennisPlayer x
axiom P3 : ∀ (x : Person), Mixer x → OscarNominated x → Celebrity x
axiom P4 : ∀ (x : Person), Mixer x → TennisPlayer x → Athlete x
axiom P5 : ∀ (x : Person), Mixer x → Celebrity x → WellPaid x
axiom P6 : ∀ (x : Person), Mixer x → Athlete x → Famous x
axiom P7 : ∀ (x : Person), Mixer x → WellPaid x → TaxHaven x
axiom P8 : Mixer Djokovic
axiom P9 : Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic → WellPaid Djokovic

theorem Djokovic_in_tax_haven : TaxHaven Djokovic := by
  have h_mixer := P8
  have h_type := P1 Djokovic h_mixer
  cases h_type with
  | inl gs =>  -- Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion
      have h_tennis := P2 Djokovic h_mixer gs
      have h_athlete := P4 Djokovic h_mixer h_tennis
      have h_famous := P6 Djokovic h_mixer h_athlete
      have h_wellpaid := P9 ⟨h_famous, h_athlete⟩
      exact P7 Djokovic h_mixer h_wellpaid
  | inr on =>  -- Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor
      have h_celebrity := P3 Djokovic h_mixer on
      have h_wellpaid := P5 Djokovic h_mixer h_celebrity
      exact P7 Djokovic h_mixer h_wellpaid
</lean>

The proof shows that regardless of whether Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor, the premises force him to be well-paid (via either P9 or P5), and thus he must live in a tax haven (via P7). This contradicts the statement "Djokovic does not live in a tax haven", proving it false.

ANSWER: False
