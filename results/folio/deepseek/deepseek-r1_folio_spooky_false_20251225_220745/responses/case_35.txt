The context provides information about Diamond Mine and its feud with Imperium. Diamond Mine includes Ivy Nile, and Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine. Therefore, Imperium does have a feud with a professional wrestling stable (Diamond Mine) that includes Ivy Nile. This directly contradicts the statement "Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile," proving it false.

The error occurred because I incorrectly attempted to construct a term of type `False` without providing a necessary assumption. The solution is to focus on proving the negation of the statement directly. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type

axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom Imperium : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj

axiom ProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj → Prop
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Feud : obj → obj → Prop

axiom stable_DiamondMine : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
axiom includes_IvyNile : Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom feud_Imperium : Feud Imperium DiamondMine

-- Prove there exists a stable including Ivy Nile that Imperium feuds with
theorem exists_feud : ∃ S, ProfessionalWrestlingStable S ∧ Includes S IvyNile ∧ Feud Imperium S :=
  ⟨DiamondMine, stable_DiamondMine, includes_IvyNile, feud_Imperium⟩

-- Prove the statement is false using the existence proof
theorem disprove_statement : ¬ ¬ ∃ S, ProfessionalWrestlingStable S ∧ Includes S IvyNile ∧ Feud Imperium S :=
  fun H => H exists_feud
</lean>

This code:
1. Declares the necessary entities and predicates
2. Uses the premises to show Diamond Mine has the required properties
3. Proves `exists_feud` by providing Diamond Mine as a witness
4. Constructs `disprove_statement` showing the original claim is false

ANSWER: False
