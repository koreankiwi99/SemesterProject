The Lean code formalizes the given context and attempts to prove the negation of the statement "Some orchestras premiered music pieces." The premises provide evidence that Vienna Music Society (an orchestra) premiered Symphony No. 9 (a music piece), directly confirming the existential statement. No contradictions arise from the premises, as Beethoven's dual role as composer and conductor does not conflict with the premiering event under the given axioms. Thus, proving the negation (¬∃ o m, Orchestra o ∧ MusicPiece m ∧ Premiered o m) is impossible.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Symphony9 : obj
axiom Beethoven : obj
axiom ViennaMusicSociety : obj

axiom MusicPiece : obj → Prop
axiom Writes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Premiered : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Orchestra : obj → Prop
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Conductor : obj → Prop

axiom music_S9 : MusicPiece Symphony9
axiom writes_Beethoven_S9 : Writes Beethoven Symphony9
axiom premiered_VMS_S9 : Premiered ViennaMusicSociety Symphony9
axiom orchestra_VMS : Orchestra ViennaMusicSociety
axiom leads_Beethoven_VMS : Leads Beethoven ViennaMusicSociety
axiom orchestras_led_by_conductors : ∀ (o c : obj), Orchestra o → Leads c o → Conductor c

theorem Beethoven_conductor : Conductor Beethoven := 
  orchestras_led_by_conductors ViennaMusicSociety Beethoven orchestra_VMS leads_Beethoven_VMS

example : ∃ o m, Orchestra o ∧ MusicPiece m ∧ Premiered o m := 
  ⟨ViennaMusicSociety, Symphony9, orchestra_VMS, music_S9, premiered_VMS_S9⟩

-- Attempt to prove the negation of the statement fails
theorem cannot_prove_negation : ¬(∃ o m, Orchestra o ∧ MusicPiece m ∧ Premiered o m) → False := 
  fun h => h ⟨ViennaMusicSociety, Symphony9, orchestra_VMS, music_S9, premiered_VMS_S9⟩

-- Since the existential is true, we cannot prove its negation

ANSWER: Failure
