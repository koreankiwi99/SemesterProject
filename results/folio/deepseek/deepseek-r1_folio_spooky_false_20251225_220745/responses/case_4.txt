ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After analyzing the context and the statement, I realize that the premises do not provide enough information to definitively prove that James must have lunch in the company building. The attempted proof of double negation hits a dead end because when James has lunch at home:
- He must work remotely (by Premise4)
- If he isn't a manager, there's no contradiction with being remote (since only managers cannot work remotely)
- There's no requirement that forces him to schedule meetings or attend the building
- The absence of building attendance doesn't contradict any premises when he's not a manager

Thus, the negation of the statement ("James does not have lunch in the company") cannot be proven false from the given premises.

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred due to incorrect usage of the biconditional in Premise7. Specifically, in the non-manager branch, I attempted to derive `¬GoToBuilding James` from `¬Manager James` using the wrong direction of the implication. The biconditional `GoToBuilding James ↔ Manager James` means:
- `Premise7.1 : GoToBuilding James → Manager James`
- `Premise7.2 : Manager James → GoToBuilding James`

To derive `¬GoToBuilding James` from `¬Manager James`, we need the contrapositive of `Premise7.1`: `¬Manager James → ¬GoToBuilding James`. This has been corrected below.

However, even with this fix, the proof still fails in the non-manager branch because:
1. James has lunch at home → works remotely (Premise4)
2. James is not a manager → no restriction against remote work (Premise6 only forbids remote work for managers)
3. No premises force James to schedule meetings or attend the building
4. Premise2 only triggers for lunch in the building (which we've assumed false)

Thus, no contradiction exists in the non-manager branch, making the statement unprovable.
