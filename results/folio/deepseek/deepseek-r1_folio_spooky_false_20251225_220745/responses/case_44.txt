The goal is to prove that the statement "Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek and one of the most active players" is false. This means proving that Coco Gauff *is* both a player who lost to Iga Świątek and one of the most active players.

### Explanation:
1. **Premise Translation**:
   - `T1`: High WTA ranking implies being most active.
   - `T2`: Losing to Iga Świątek implies high WTA ranking.
   - `T3`: Female players lost to Iga Świątek.
   - `T4`: Players are female or male.
   - `T5`: Male players lost to Rafael Nadal.
   - `T6`: If Coco Gauff is highly ranked or lost to Nadal, she is not male.
   - `T7`: Coco Gauff is a player at Roland Garros 2022.

2. **Proof Strategy**:
   - Since Coco Gauff is a player (`T7`), she must be female or male (`T4`).
   - **Female Case**: Directly shows she lost to Iga (`T3`), is highly ranked (`T2`), and is most active (`T1`).
   - **Male Case**: Shows she lost to Nadal (`T5`), triggering `T6` to prove she is not male—a contradiction. Thus, only the female case holds.

3. **Result**: The conjunction `LostToIga CocoGauff ∧ MostActive CocoGauff` is proven, meaning the original statement ("Coco Gauff is not both...") is **false**.

ANSWER: False
