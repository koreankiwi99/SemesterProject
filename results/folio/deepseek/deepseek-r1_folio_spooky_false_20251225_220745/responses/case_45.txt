ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was used incorrectly. The goal was to prove `Cat w`, but the context contained `¬Cat w`, which is not a direct contradiction. Instead, we should recognize that the witness from `some_pets_not_mammals` cannot be used to prove the existence of a pet that is a cat, as it explicitly violates the mammal requirement for cats.

The corrected Lean code below:
1. Defines the necessary types and axioms
2. Attempts to prove the negation of "No pets are cats" (i.e., ∃ x, Pet x ∧ Cat x)
3. Shows that the witness from `some_pets_not_mammals` leads to a contradiction if assumed to be a cat
4. Concludes that no proof exists for the desired existential statement

axiom all_cats_mammals : ∀ x, Cat x → Mammal x
axiom some_pets_not_mammals : ∃ x, Pet x ∧ ¬Mammal x

-- Attempt to disprove "No pets are cats" (∀ x, Pet x → ¬Cat x)
-- by proving its negation: ∃ x, Pet x ∧ Cat x
example : ∃ x, Pet x ∧ Cat x := by
  rcases some_pets_not_mammals with ⟨w, hw_pet, hw_not_mammal⟩
  -- Assume w is a cat and derive contradiction
  have h_cat_mammal : Cat w → Mammal w := all_cats_mammals w
  -- If w were a cat, it would be a mammal, contradicting hw_not_mammal
  have : ¬Cat w := fun h_cat => hw_not_mammal (h_cat_mammal h_cat)
  -- We need to show Cat w, but we have ¬Cat w → no proof possible
  -- We cannot use w as witness since it's not a cat
  -- No other witnesses available from premises
