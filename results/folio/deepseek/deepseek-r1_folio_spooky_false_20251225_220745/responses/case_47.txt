ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `rw` tactic was incorrectly applied to an axiom (`mia_not_emma`) rather than a local hypothesis. The proof has been corrected by introducing a local hypothesis `h` and constructing a contradiction.

ANSWER: Failure

**Explanation:**  
- The proof `mia_not_summer` is now valid: Assuming `FavoriteSeason Mia = Summer` leads to a contradiction with `mia_not_emma` and `emma_fav_summer`.  
- However, there are no premises that force Mia's favorite season to be anything other than Summer. It could be Spring, Fall, or Winter.  
- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation of "Mia's favorite season is spring" (¬(FavoriteSeason Mia = Spring)).
