The premises provide information about language relations and the Romance language family. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclusively prove that German cannot be a Romance language. Key points:
- Romance languages form a family where all members are mutually related.
- French and Spanish are Romance languages, and German is related to Spanish.
- Basque is isolated (unrelated to all others), proving it is not Romance.
- But German's relation to Spanish could exist whether German is Romance or not, as the premises do not state that only family members can be related. There is also no explicit contradiction derived from assuming German is Romance.

Therefore, the negation ("German is not a Romance language") cannot be proven from the given premises.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After analyzing the premises and attempting to prove that "German is a Romance language" is false, I find that while we can prove Basque is not a Romance language, we cannot derive a contradiction from assuming German is Romance. The relation "German is related to Spanish" does not conflict with German being Romance, and no other premise forces a contradiction.

Here is the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Romance : obj → Prop
axiom R : obj → obj → Prop
axiom French : obj
axiom Spanish : obj
axiom German : obj
axiom Basque : obj

-- Premise: Romance languages form a family (all related)
axiom family_relation : ∀ x y, Romance x → Romance y → R x y

-- French and Spanish are Romance languages
axiom french_romance : Romance French
axiom spanish_romance : Romance Spanish

-- German is related to Spanish
axiom german_related_spanish : R German Spanish

-- Basque is isolated (unrelated to others)
axiom basque_isolated : ∀ x, x ≠ Basque → ¬ R Basque x

-- Distinctness of languages
axiom distinct1 : French ≠ Basque
axiom distinct2 : Spanish ≠ Basque
axiom distinct3 : German ≠ Basque
axiom distinct4 : French ≠ Spanish
axiom distinct5 : German ≠ French
axiom distinct6 : German ≠ Spanish

-- Prove Basque cannot be Romance
theorem basque_not_romance : ¬ Romance Basque := by
  intro h
  have must_relate : R Basque French := family_relation Basque French h french_romance
  exact basque_isolated French distinct1 must_relate

-- Attempt to prove German is not Romance (fails)
theorem german_not_romance : ¬ Romance German := by
  intro h
  have rel_gf : R German French := family_relation German French h french_romance
  -- No contradiction: relation to French is consistent with existing axioms
  -- Premises allow non-Romance languages to relate to Romance languages
  -- Basque isolation doesn't constrain German
  sorry  -- Cannot derive False
</lean>
