axiom Premise2 : ScriptEditor AndrewCollins Badults

-- Attempt to prove the negation of the statement: ¬∃ s, WorkingTitle s "The Secret Dude Society" ∧ ScriptEditor AndrewCollins s
theorem prove_negation : ¬∃ s, WorkingTitle s "The Secret Dude Society" ∧ ScriptEditor AndrewCollins s :=
  fun ⟨s, hTitle, hEditor⟩ => 
  -- We have a witness s with the working title and script editor. 
  -- However, we have no premises that allow us to derive a contradiction here.
  -- Specifically:
  --   - We know Badults has the title (Premise1) and AndrewCollins as editor (Premise2)
  --   - But s might be Badults or another series; we have no uniqueness constraints
  --   - Premises don't prohibit other series from having the same title or editor
  --   - Thus, s could be Badults (consistent with premises) or another series (not contradicted)
  -- We cannot produce a contradiction from the existential witness.
  -- Proof attempt fails at this point.
  sorry -- Cannot complete the proof without additional contradictory premises
