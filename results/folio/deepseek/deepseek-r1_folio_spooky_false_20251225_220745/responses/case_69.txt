To prove that the statement "No members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three" is false, we use the provided context:

1. Badults stars members of Pappy's, so there exists at least one member of Pappy's in Badults.
2. Badults piloted on BBC Three.

We define:
- `Person` for individuals
- `Show` for shows
- `Channel` for broadcast channels
- Specific channels `bbcTwo` and `bbcThree`
- The show `Badults`
- `Pappys` to identify members of Pappy's
- `starred_in` for actor-show relations
- `piloted_on` for show-channel relations

The premises are formalized as:
- `T1`: There exists a Pappy's member who starred in Badults.
- `T2`: Badults piloted on BBC Three.

The statement to evaluate (S) asserts that no Pappy's member starred in any show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three. However, from `T1` and `T2`, we find:
- A specific Pappy's member who starred in Badults.
- Badults piloted on BBC Three (which fulfills "BBC Two or BBC Three").

This contradicts S, proving S false. The Lean proof:
1. Assumes S.
2. Uses `T1` to get a Pappy's member `p` who starred in Badults.
3. Shows `p` starred in Badults (`hstar`) and Badults piloted on BBC Three (`T2`).
4. Constructs a show (Badults) satisfying the criteria.
5. Applies S to `p` and this show, yielding a contradiction.

The error occurred because `S` was defined as a `Prop` but was used as a function. The corrected code assumes the evaluated statement as a hypothesis (named `H`), then derives a contradiction using the axioms `T1` and `T2`. Specifically:

1. `T1` provides a member of Pappy's (`p`) who starred in Badults
2. `T2` shows Badults piloted on BBC Three (which satisfies "BBC Two or BBC Three")
3. Applying the universal statement `H` to `p` yields a negation of this existence
4. Providing the existence witness creates the contradiction

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the previous attempts tried to prove `False` directly, but the premises alone do not lead to a contradiction. Instead, we must prove that the statement "No members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three" is false (i.e., its negation is true). The corrected approach:

1. Defines the necessary types and predicates
2. Formalizes the premises:
   - `T1`: There exists a Pappy's member who starred in Badults
   - `T2`: Badults piloted on BBC Three
3. Proves the negation of the statement:
   - Assume the statement holds (`H`)
   - Use `T1` to get a specific Pappy's member `p` starring in Badults
   - Show `p` starred in Badults (BBC Three satisfies "BBC Two or BBC Three")
   - This contradicts `H`, proving the statement false

The Lean code proves the negation of the statement, confirming it is false.
