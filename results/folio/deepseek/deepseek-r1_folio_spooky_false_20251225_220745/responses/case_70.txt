To solve the problem, we need to translate the natural language premises into Lean code and then attempt to prove that the negation of the statement "KO is a stock" (i.e., ¬(Stock KO)) holds from these premises. If successful, we output `False`; otherwise, we output `Failure`.

### Lean Code Translation
The entities and predicates are defined as follows:
- `obj`: A type representing all entities in consideration.
- `Stock`, `Growth`, `BoughtForProfit`, `SuitableForRetirement`, `Mature`: Predicates over `obj`.
- `KO`: A constant of type `obj` representing the stock in question.

Premises translated into axioms:
1. **All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation:**  
   `∀ x, Growth x → BoughtForProfit x`
2. **If a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund:**  
   `∀ x, BoughtForProfit x → ¬ SuitableForRetirement x`
3. **Some stocks are growth stocks:**  
   `∃ x, Stock x ∧ Growth x`
4. **All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund:**  
   `∀ x, Mature x → SuitableForRetirement x`
5. **KO is a mature stock:**  
   This implies both `Mature KO` and (by the nature of mature stocks) that KO is a stock. We explicitly add an axiom: `∀ x, Mature x → Stock x` to capture this.

The statement to evaluate is **"KO is a stock"**, which is translated as `Stock KO`. We attempt to prove its negation: `¬Stock KO`.

### Proof Attempt
- From the axiom `Mature KO` (part of A5) and `mature_implies_stock`, we derive `Stock KO` via `KO_stock : Stock KO`.
- Attempting to prove `¬Stock KO`:
  - Assume `¬Stock KO`.
  - However, we already have a proof of `Stock KO` (`KO_stock`), leading to a contradiction under this assumption.
  - While this contradiction proves `¬(¬Stock KO)`, it **does not prove** `¬Stock KO` itself. In fact, the existence of `KO_stock` explicitly proves `Stock KO`, making `¬Stock KO` unprovable.

Since we cannot construct a proof of `¬Stock KO` from the premises, the attempt fails.
