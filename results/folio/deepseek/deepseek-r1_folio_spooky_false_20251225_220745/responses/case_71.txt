axiom KO : obj

-- All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation
axiom A1 : ∀ x, GrowthStock x → BoughtForProfit x

-- If bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then not suitable for retirement
axiom A2 : ∀ x, BoughtForProfit x → ¬ SuitableForRetirement x

-- All mature stocks are suitable for retirement
axiom A3 : ∀ x, MatureStock x → SuitableForRetirement x

-- KO is a mature stock
axiom A4 : MatureStock KO

-- Prove that "KO is a growth stock" is false
theorem ko_not_growth : ¬ GrowthStock KO := by
  intro hGrow  -- Assume KO is a growth stock
  have hBuy : BoughtForProfit KO := A1 KO hGrow
  have hNotSuitable : ¬ SuitableForRetirement KO := A2 KO hBuy
  have hSuitable : SuitableForRetirement KO := A3 KO A4
  exact hNotSuitable hSuitable

-- The statement "KO is a stock and a growth stock" reduces to GrowthStock KO since KO is in our stock domain
-- We've proved ¬GrowthStock KO, so the conjunction is false
theorem statement_false : ¬ (GrowthStock KO) := ko_not_growth
