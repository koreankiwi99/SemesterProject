The reasoning involves formalizing the premises and the statement to evaluate in Lean, then attempting to prove that the statement is false (i.e., proving its negation). The premises establish:
1. All growth stocks are bought for rapid price appreciation.
2. Anything bought for rapid price appreciation is not suitable for retirement funds.
3. Some stocks are growth stocks.
4. All mature stocks are suitable for retirement funds.
5. KO is a mature stock.

The statement to evaluate is:  
"If KO is a growth stock or bought for rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor volatile."

Key deductions from the premises:
- KO is a mature stock (premise 5), so KO is suitable for retirement (premise 4).
- If KO were a growth stock, it would be bought for rapid appreciation (premise 1), making it unsuitable for retirement (premise 2)—contradicting KO's retirement suitability. Thus, KO cannot be a growth stock.
- Similarly, if KO were bought for rapid appreciation, it would be unsuitable for retirement (premise 2), again contradicting KO's retirement suitability. Thus, KO cannot be bought for rapid appreciation.

Therefore, the antecedent of the statement ("KO is a growth stock or bought for rapid appreciation") is **false**. Since a false antecedent makes the entire implication true, the statement holds. Consequently, its negation cannot be proven.

The compilation errors were due to incorrect handling of the negation in the theorem `neg_statement` and improper use of the `⟨...⟩` notation. The corrected approach focuses on proving the necessary lemmas about KO while acknowledging that the original statement's negation cannot be proven.
