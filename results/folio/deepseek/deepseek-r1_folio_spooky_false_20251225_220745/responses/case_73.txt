The premises establish that Joe's plate is from Istanbul, and all Istanbul plates begin with 34. Therefore, Joe's plate must begin with 34. Attempting to prove the negation (that Joe's plate does not begin with 34) leads to a contradiction with the premises. However, the task requires proving the negation is true, which is impossible given the consistent premises. Thus, the proof fails.

<lean>
axiom Plate : Type
axiom joe : Plate
axiom Istanbul : Plate → Prop
axiom BeginsWith34 : Plate → Prop
axiom BeginsWith35 : Plate → Prop
axiom R1 : ∀ p : Plate, Istanbul p → BeginsWith34 p
axiom R3 : Istanbul joe
theorem joe_has_34 : BeginsWith34 joe := R1 joe R3
theorem prove_negation : ¬BeginsWith34 joe → False := fun h => h joe_has_34
