The premises lead to a contradiction, specifically from the axioms about Hannah's work and financial needs. This contradiction allows us to derive any conclusion, including the negation of the target statement. The Lean proof formally demonstrates this by showing the premises entail a falsehood.

axiom obj : Type

axiom mary_school : obj → Prop
axiom work : obj → Prop
axiom need_money : obj → Prop
axiom order_takeout : obj → Prop
axiom enjoy_dining : obj → Prop
axiom picky_eater : obj → Prop
axiom spend_time : obj → Prop

constant Hannah : obj

axiom A1 : ∀ x, mary_school x → work x → need_money x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, mary_school x → order_takeout x → work x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, mary_school x → order_takeout x ∨ enjoy_dining x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, mary_school x → enjoy_dining x → ¬picky_eater x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, mary_school x → enjoy_dining x → spend_time x
axiom A6 : mary_school Hannah
axiom A7 : work Hannah ∧ (need_money Hannah → (¬picky_eater Hannah ∧ ¬need_money Hannah))

theorem negation : ¬(mary_school Hannah ∧ ¬picky_eater Hannah ∧ spend_time Hannah) := by
  intro ⟨_, not_picky, _⟩
  have work_H : work Hannah := A7.1
  have need_H : need_money Hannah := A1 Hannah A6 work_H
  have aux : ¬picky_eater Hannah ∧ ¬need_money Hannah := A7.2 need_H
  exact aux.2 need_H
</lean>

ANSWER: False

The compilation errors occurred due to issues with the initial setup of the `obj` type and its usage. The corrected code ensures proper declaration of the type and predicates, and the proof remains valid. The premises lead to a contradiction when assuming the target statement, proving its negation.
