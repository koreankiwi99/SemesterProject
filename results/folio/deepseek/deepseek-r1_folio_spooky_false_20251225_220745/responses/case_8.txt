The Lean code formalizes the given context and attempts to prove that coughing is not a symptom of Monkeypox. The premises define symptoms and diseases, with specific axioms stating that Monkeypox includes fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness. The context also notes that tiredness occurs with the flu, but there is no information linking Monkeypox to coughing or implying that the listed symptoms are exhaustive. Since the premises do not provide any basis to conclude that coughing is excluded from Monkeypox symptoms, the negation cannot be proven.

<lean>
axiom Symptom : Type
axiom Disease : Type

axiom fever : Symptom
axiom headache : Symptom
axiom muscle_pains : Symptom
axiom tiredness : Symptom
axiom coughing : Symptom

axiom Monkeypox : Disease
axiom Flu : Disease

axiom HasSymptom : Disease → Symptom → Prop

axiom monkeypox_fever : HasSymptom Monkeypox fever
axiom monkeypox_headache : HasSymptom Monkeypox headache
axiom monkeypox_muscle_pains : HasSymptom Monkeypox muscle_pains
axiom monkeypox_tiredness : HasSymptom Monkeypox tiredness
axiom flu_tiredness : HasSymptom Flu tiredness

theorem not_monkeypox_coughing : ¬ HasSymptom Monkeypox coughing :=
by
  -- No premises provide evidence that coughing is not a symptom of Monkeypox.
  -- The list of Monkeypox symptoms is not stated to be exhaustive, so coughing might still be a symptom.
  -- Therefore, the negation cannot be proven.
