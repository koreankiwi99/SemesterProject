The Lean code correctly formalizes the premises and proves that Dried Thai chilies are not baked sweets. However, it does not prove that Dried Thai chilies are not mala hotpots. The premises are consistent with Dried Thai chilies being mala hotpots (which are spicy and not baked sweets). Therefore, the negation of the statement "Dried Thai chilies are a mala hotpot" cannot be proven from the premises.
