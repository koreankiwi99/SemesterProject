axiom Restaurant : Type

axiom RatingGreaterThanFour : Restaurant → Prop
axiom ProvidesTakeOut : Restaurant → Prop
axiom PopularAmongLocals : Restaurant → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ r : Restaurant, ListedInYelpRecs r → ¬ManyNegativeReviews r
axiom A2 : ∀ r : Restaurant, RatingGreaterThanFour r → ListedInYelpRecs r
axiom A3 : ∃ r : Restaurant, ¬ProvidesTakeOut r ∧ ManyNegativeReviews r
axiom A4 : ∀ r : Restaurant, PopularAmongLocals r → RatingGreaterThanFour r
axiom A5 : RatingGreaterThanFour HamdenPlaza ∨ PopularAmongLocals HamdenPlaza

-- Prove HamdenPlaza has rating > 4
theorem rating_gt_four : RatingGreaterThanFour HamdenPlaza := by
  cases A5 with
  | inl h => exact h
  | inr h => exact A4 HamdenPlaza h

-- Prove HamdenPlaza is listed in Yelp
theorem listed : ListedInYelpRecs HamdenPlaza := A2 HamdenPlaza rating_gt_four

-- Prove HamdenPlaza has no many negative reviews
theorem no_negative_reviews : ¬ManyNegativeReviews HamdenPlaza := A1 HamdenPlaza listed

-- Attempt to prove the negation of the statement: ¬(¬ProvidesTakeOut HamdenPlaza) ≡ ProvidesTakeOut HamdenPlaza
theorem goal : ProvidesTakeOut HamdenPlaza := by
  -- We have no premises connecting take-out status to ratings/reviews
  -- A3 shows existence of non-take-out restaurants with bad reviews, but doesn't constrain HamdenPlaza
  -- Since HamdenPlaza has no negative reviews, it cannot be the witness in A3
  -- But this doesn't force it to provide take-out
  -- No contradiction can be derived from assuming ¬ProvidesTakeOut HamdenPlaza
  -- Therefore proof fails
  sorry  -- Cannot complete proof

-- Since 'goal' cannot be proven without 'sorry', we conclude Failure
