The premises state that books contain tons of knowledge, which is interpreted universally: all books contain knowledge. Since Walden is explicitly identified as a book, it follows that Walden contains knowledge. Therefore, the statement "Walden contains knowledge" is true, and its negation cannot be proven from the premises.

<lean>
axiom Book : Type
axiom Person : Type
axiom Walden : Book
axiom Harry : Person
axiom containsKnowledge : Book → Prop
axiom read : Person → Book → Prop
axiom gainsKnowledge : Person → Prop
axiom becomesSmarter : Person → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ b : Book, containsKnowledge b  -- "Books contain tons of knowledge" (universal)
axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, ∀ b : Book, read p b → gainsKnowledge p  -- Reading a book causes knowledge gain
axiom P3 : ∀ p : Person, gainsKnowledge p → becomesSmarter p  -- Knowledge gain leads to becoming smarter
axiom P4 : read Harry Walden  -- Harry read Walden

-- Attempt to prove the negation: ¬containsKnowledge Walden
theorem prove_negation : ¬containsKnowledge Walden :=
  fun h : containsKnowledge Walden =>   -- Assume Walden contains knowledge
  -- We have P1 Walden: containsKnowledge Walden, which contradicts the assumption ¬containsKnowledge Walden?
  -- But P1 Walden proves containsKnowledge Walden, so the assumption 'h' is actually consistent with the premises.
  -- There is no contradiction. We cannot derive False here.
  -- Moreover, P2 and P4 prove gainsKnowledge Harry, but this does not help prove ¬containsKnowledge Walden.
  -- Since P1 directly states Walden contains knowledge, the negation is unprovable.
  -- No proof found for ¬containsKnowledge Walden.
  False.elim (by contradiction)  -- This tactic fails because no contradiction exists

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic failed to find a contradiction, as there was no inconsistency in the premises. The premises explicitly state that all books contain knowledge (P1), and Walden is a book. Therefore, the statement "Walden contains knowledge" is true, and its negation cannot be proven.

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Book : Type
axiom Person : Type
axiom Walden : Book
axiom Harry : Person
axiom containsKnowledge : Book → Prop
axiom read : Person → Book → Prop
axiom gainsKnowledge : Person → Prop
axiom becomesSmarter : Person → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ b : Book, containsKnowledge b  -- All books contain knowledge
axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, ∀ b : Book, read p b → gainsKnowledge p
axiom P3 : ∀ p : Person, gainsKnowledge p → becomesSmarter p
axiom P4 : read Harry Walden

-- Prove Walden contains knowledge (demonstrates why the negation is unprovable)
theorem walden_contains_knowledge : containsKnowledge Walden := 
  P1 Walden

-- Attempt to prove the negation (¬containsKnowledge Walden) fails logically
-- No valid proof exists since walden_contains_knowledge shows the opposite
</lean>
