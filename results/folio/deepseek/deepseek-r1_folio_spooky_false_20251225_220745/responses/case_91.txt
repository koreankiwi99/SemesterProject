The reasoning involves formalizing the given premises and the statement to evaluate in Lean, then attempting to prove the negation of the statement. The key insight is interpreting the categorization exclusivity implied by "either...or" in natural language, which allows proving the statement false.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom MachineTranslation : obj
axiom NLP : obj → Prop
axiom LanguageGeneration : obj → Prop
axiom LanguageUnderstanding : obj → Prop
axiom OutputTextSequence : obj → Prop

-- Premise: Every NLP task is either generation or understanding (with mutual exclusivity implied)
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, NLP x → (LanguageGeneration x ∨ LanguageUnderstanding x) ∧ ¬(LanguageGeneration x ∧ LanguageUnderstanding x)

-- Premise: If an NLP task has text sequence output, it is generation
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, NLP x → OutputTextSequence x → LanguageGeneration x

-- Premise: Machine translation is an NLP task
axiom A3 : NLP MachineTranslation

-- Premise: Machine translation has text sequence output
axiom A4 : OutputTextSequence MachineTranslation

-- Prove machine translation is NOT a language understanding task
theorem not_understanding : ¬ LanguageUnderstanding MachineTranslation := by
  intro H  -- Assume it is understanding
  -- Get the exclusivity property for MachineTranslation
  have A1_MT := A1 MachineTranslation A3
  -- Machine translation is generation by A2
  have gen : LanguageGeneration MachineTranslation := A2 MachineTranslation A3 A4
  -- This creates contradiction with exclusivity
  have : LanguageGeneration MachineTranslation ∧ LanguageUnderstanding MachineTranslation := ⟨gen, H⟩
  exact A1_MT.2 this
</lean>

The proof shows that assuming machine translation is a language understanding task leads to a contradiction with the exclusivity of categorization and the generation property derived from the premises. Therefore, the statement is false.

ANSWER: False
