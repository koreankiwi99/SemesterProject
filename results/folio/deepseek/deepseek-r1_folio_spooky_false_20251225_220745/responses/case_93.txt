The Lean code below formalizes the given premises. The goal is to prove the negation of the statement: "Tom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy." After careful analysis, the premises do not provide sufficient information to prove this negation. Specifically:

1. While The Olive Garden is a managed building, premise 1 states only that *some* managed buildings allow pets—it does not specify whether The Olive Garden does or does not allow pets.
2. Premise 10 establishes that *if* a building allows pets, then moving in with a pet is allowed. However, if The Olive Garden does not allow pets, premise 10 does not forbid allowing pets under other conditions or explicitly block Tom from moving in with Fluffy.
3. The security deposit requirement at The Olive Garden (≥ $2000) violates Tom's rental condition (≤ $1500), but this only affects his willingness to rent—not the building's policy on allowing Fluffy. The rental condition does not constrain the movement allowance.

No contradiction arises from assuming Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy. Therefore, the negation cannot be proven.

After analyzing the errors and re-evaluating the premises, I've corrected the Lean code. The key issues were:
1. Missing typeclass instances for natural number operations (fixed by explicit Nat operations)
2. Undefined lemma references (replaced with direct Nat calculations)
3. Premises not supporting the negation proof

The core logical problem remains: While we can prove that Tom won't rent at Olive Garden due to the high deposit, no premise connects deposit amount to pet allowance. The pet allowance at Olive Garden is unspecified (only that some buildings allow pets), so we cannot prove Tom is NOT allowed to move in with Fluffy.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom ManagedBuilding : Type
axiom Person : Type
axiom Pet : Type

axiom Cat : Pet → Prop
axiom Tom : Person
axiom Fluffy : Pet
axiom FluffyIsCat : Cat Fluffy

axiom OliveGarden : ManagedBuilding
axiom AllowsPets : ManagedBuilding → Prop
axiom AllowedToMoveInWith : ManagedBuilding → Person → Pet → Prop
axiom monthlyRent : ManagedBuilding → Nat
axiom securityDeposit : ManagedBuilding → Nat

-- Premise: Pets allowed in some managed buildings
axiom P1 : ∃ (b : ManagedBuilding), AllowsPets b

-- Premise: Deposit ≥ monthly rent
axiom P3 : ∀ (b : ManagedBuilding), securityDeposit b ≥ monthlyRent b

-- Premise: Olive Garden rent = $2000
axiom A7 : monthlyRent OliveGarden = 2000

-- Premise: $2000 > $1500
axiom A8 : 2000 > 1500

-- Premise: Tom's rental conditions
axiom Rents : ManagedBuilding → Person → Prop
axiom TomRentsCondition : ∀ (b : ManagedBuilding), 
  AllowedToMoveInWith b Tom Fluffy → securityDeposit b ≤ 1500 → Rents b Tom

-- Premise: Pet allowance implies move-in permission
axiom A10 : ∀ (b : ManagedBuilding), AllowsPets b → ∀ (p : Pet) (person : Person), 
  AllowedToMoveInWith b person p

-- Attempt to disprove: Tom is allowed to move into Olive Garden with Fluffy
theorem disprove_statement : ¬ (AllowedToMoveInWith OliveGarden Tom Fluffy) := by 
  intro h_allow  -- Assume Tom is allowed
  -- Prove deposit > $1500
  have deposit_ge_rent : securityDeposit OliveGarden ≥ monthlyRent OliveGarden := P3 OliveGarden
  have dep_ge_2000 : securityDeposit OliveGarden ≥ 2000 := by
    rw [A7] at deposit_ge_rent
    exact deposit_ge_rent
  have dep_gt_1500 : securityDeposit OliveGarden > 1500 := by
    apply Nat.lt_of_lt_of_le A8
    exact dep_ge_2000
  -- Now have: Tom allowed ∧ deposit > $1500
  -- But no premise connects high deposit to disallowance
  -- Premise A10 only gives sufficient condition for allowance
  -- Olive Garden's pet policy unknown (P1 only says "some" allow pets)
  -- Cannot derive contradiction
  contradiction  -- Fails to find contradiction
</lean>

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

After carefully analyzing the errors and re-examining the premises, I confirm that the negation cannot be proven. The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic couldn't find any contradictory facts in the context - which is correct, as no contradiction exists. The key insights are:

1. **Missing pet policy constraint**: Premise P1 states pets are allowed in *some* managed buildings, but doesn't specify whether Olive Garden allows pets.
2. **No deposit-allowance link**: While the deposit at Olive Garden exceeds $1500, no premise states that high deposits prevent pet movement allowance.
3. **Allowance could still hold**: Even with a high deposit, Olive Garden might allow pets (per P1) and thus permit Tom to move with Fluffy (per A10).

Here's the corrected Lean code that properly reflects these limitations:

<lean>

axiom Person : Type

axiom Cat : Pet → Prop
axiom Tom : Person
axiom Fluffy : Pet
axiom FluffyIsCat : Cat Fluffy

axiom OliveGarden : ManagedBuilding

axiom AllowedToMoveInWith : ManagedBuilding → Person → Pet → Prop
axiom monthlyRent : ManagedBuilding → Nat
axiom securityDeposit : ManagedBuilding → Nat

-- Premise: Pets allowed in some managed buildings
axiom P1 : ∃ (b : ManagedBuilding), AllowsPets b

-- Premise: Deposit ≥ monthly rent
axiom P3 : ∀ (b : ManagedBuilding), securityDeposit b ≥ monthlyRent b

-- Premise: Olive Garden rent = $2000
axiom A7 : monthlyRent OliveGarden = 2000

-- Premise: $2000 > $1500
axiom A8 : 2000 > 1500

-- Premise: Tom's rental conditions
axiom Rents : ManagedBuilding → Person → Prop
axiom TomRentsCondition : ∀ (b : ManagedBuilding), 
  AllowedToMoveInWith b Tom Fluffy → securityDeposit b ≤ 1500 → Rents b Tom

-- Premise: Pet allowance implies move-in permission
axiom A10 : ∀ (b : ManagedBuilding), AllowsPets b → ∀ (p : Pet) (person : Person), 
  AllowedToMoveInWith b person p

-- Attempt to disprove: Tom is allowed to move into Olive Garden with Fluffy
theorem disprove_statement : ¬ (AllowedToMoveInWith OliveGarden Tom Fluffy) := by 
  intro h_allow  -- Assume Tom is allowed
  -- Prove deposit > $1500
  have deposit_ge_rent : securityDeposit OliveGarden ≥ monthlyRent OliveGarden := P3 OliveGarden
  have dep_ge_2000 : securityDeposit OliveGarden ≥ 2000 := by
    rw [A7] at deposit_ge_rent
    exact deposit_ge_rent
  have dep_gt_1500 : securityDeposit OliveGarden > 1500 := by
    apply Nat.lt_of_lt_of_le A8 dep_ge_2000
  -- Context now has:
  -- h_allow: Tom allowed with Fluffy
  -- dep_gt_1500: Deposit > $1500
  -- But no premise connects high deposit to disallowance
  -- Premise A10 only provides a sufficient condition for allowance
  -- Olive Garden's pet policy is unknown (P1 doesn't specify it)
  -- Thus: No contradiction exists
  -- Proof fails since we can't derive False
  -- Explicitly show failure by closing with sorry
