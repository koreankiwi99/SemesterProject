The Lean translation captures the premises and attempts to prove the negation of "Harry is a queen bee". The proof shows:
1. Harry is a bee (axiom A6).
2. Bees are animals (axiom A7), so Harry is an animal.
3. Animals are invertebrates or vertebrates (axiom A1), leading to a case analysis:
   - If Harry is a vertebrate, it leads to a contradiction because bees cannot reproduce by mating (A4), but vertebrates must reproduce by mating (A2, A3).
   - If Harry is an invertebrate, no contradiction arises from assuming Harry is a queen bee, as invertebrates have no reproductive constraints in the premises.
The proof gets stuck in the invertebrate case, as there are no premises linking queen bees to vertebrates/invertebrates or prohibiting Harry from being a queen bee. Thus, the negation cannot be proven.
