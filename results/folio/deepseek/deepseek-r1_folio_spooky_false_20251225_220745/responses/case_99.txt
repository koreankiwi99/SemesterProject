The provided text includes premises about animals, their classification (invertebrates or vertebrates), reproduction methods, and specific information about bees and Harry. The goal is to determine if the statement "Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee" can be disproven from these premises.

Key observations:
- Premises define properties for animals (vertebrates/invertebrates, backbone possession, mating reproduction).
- Bees are mentioned separately, but **no premise states that bees are animals**.
- Harry is identified as a bee, not directly as an animal.
- Without establishing that Harry is an animal, deductions using animal-specific premises (like being a vertebrate/invertebrate) cannot be applied to Harry.

Attempted proof strategy:
1. Assume the negation of the conclusion: ¬(invertebrate harry ∨ queen_bee harry).  
   This means Harry is NOT an invertebrate and NOT a queen bee.
2. Harry is a bee (premise A6).  
   Since Harry is not a queen bee (from our assumption), Harry must be a non-queen bee.
3. Bees do not reproduce by mating (A4), so Harry does not reproduce by mating.
4. However, there are no premises linking bees to animals. Consequently:
   - Cannot classify Harry as vertebrate/invertebrate (A1 requires Animal harry).
   - Cannot use backbone/reproduction properties for animals (A2, A3).
5. The assumption ¬(invertebrate harry ∨ queen_bee harry) does not lead to a contradiction with the premises, since the information is insufficient to falsify it.

Thus, the negation of the conclusion cannot be proven from the given premises.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the proof attempt incorrectly returned a proposition (`¬ReproduceByMating harry`) instead of the required `False` type in the contradiction cases. After careful analysis, it's determined that the negation of the statement cannot be proven due to insufficient premises:

1. **Missing animal classification**: There is no premise stating that bees are animals. Harry is a bee, but without knowing he is an animal, we cannot use the invertebrate/vertebrate classification (A1-A3).

2. **No contradiction in cases**:
   - If Harry were a queen bee, we only derive that he doesn't reproduce by mating (consistent with A4)
   - If Harry were an invertebrate, there are no premises linking invertebrates (whether animal or not) to reproduction constraints that would contradict A4
