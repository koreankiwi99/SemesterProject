The premises state that Ailton Silva plays for Náutico, and Náutico is a football club. Therefore, the statement "Ailton Silva does not play for a football club" is false, as there exists at least one club (Náutico) for which he plays. The Lean proof demonstrates this by showing the existence of such a club, refuting the original statement.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom ailton_silva : obj
axiom Braga : obj
axiom Nautico : obj
axiom Fluminense : obj

axiom Club : obj → Prop
axiom PlaysFor : obj → obj → Prop

axiom club_Nautico : Club Nautico
axiom plays_for_nautico : PlaysFor ailton_silva Nautico

theorem not_statement : ¬ (¬ ∃ c : obj, Club c ∧ PlaysFor ailton_silva c) := 
  fun h => 
    h (Exists.intro Nautico (And.intro club_Nautico plays_for_nautico))

ANSWER: False
