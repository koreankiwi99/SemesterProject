ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the theorem `disprove` attempted to prove `¬IndoEuropean French` by introducing a hypothesis `h_neg` (of type `IndoEuropean French`) and then trying to apply it as a function to another proof `h` of the same type. This is invalid since `h_neg` is a term, not a function. More importantly, the premises directly prove that French is Indo-European, making its negation unprovable.
