The statement to evaluate is: "A private Ivy League research university moved to New Haven." This is an existential claim: there exists a private Ivy League research university that moved to New Haven.

From the context:
- Yale University is a private Ivy League research university.
- Yale University moved to New Haven in 1716.

These premises directly establish that Yale satisfies the conditions in the statement. Therefore, the existential claim is true, and its negation (that no such university exists) cannot be proven. Attempting to prove the negation leads to a dead end because Yale serves as a counterexample.

-- Attempt to prove the negation of the statement: ¬∃x, Private x ∧ IvyLeague x ∧ ResearchUniversity x ∧ MovedToNewHaven x

  fun ⟨x, h⟩ => 
    let ⟨priv_x, ivy_x, research_x, moved_x⟩ := h
    -- No contradiction can be derived because Yale satisfies all properties.
    -- Yale explicitly exists as a witness: 
    have Yale_witness : Private Yale ∧ IvyLeague Yale ∧ ResearchUniversity Yale ∧ MovedToNewHaven Yale := 
      ⟨Yale_attrs.left, Yale_attrs.right.left, Yale_attrs.right.right, Yale_moved⟩
    -- The existence of Yale contradicts the goal of proving "no such university exists".
    -- No premises imply uniqueness or conflict; thus, negation cannot be proven.
    -- Proof fails here.
    sorry -- Cannot fill this proof; no contradiction found.
