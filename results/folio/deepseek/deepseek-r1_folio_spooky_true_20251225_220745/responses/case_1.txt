The reasoning context is modeled in Lean using appropriate predicates to represent the natural language statements. The key insight is that the consequent of the statement to evaluate (Bonnie is either a student or inactive) holds unconditionally given the premises, regardless of the antecedent. This is proven via case analysis on Bonnie's club status (from premise 2): 
- If Bonnie performs in talent shows, she attends/engages (premise 1), hence she is a student (Bonnie equivalence axiom). 
- If Bonnie is inactive, she chaperones dances (premise 4). 

The antecedent (about Bonnie being a young wisher who chaperones, or not a young wisher) is irrelevant to proving the consequent true. Thus, the entire conditional statement holds.

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ p, Club p → Performs p → (Attends p ∧ Engaged p)
axiom P2 : ∀ p, Club p → (Performs p ∨ Inactive p)
axiom P3 : ∀ p, Club p → Chaperones p → ¬ Student p
axiom P4 : ∀ p, Club p → Inactive p → Chaperones p
-- P5 is unused in the proof but included for completeness
axiom P5 : ∀ p, Club p → Young p → Wishes p → Student p
axiom Club_Bonnie : Club Bonnie
axiom Bonnie_eq : (Attends Bonnie ∧ Engaged Bonnie) ↔ Student Bonnie

-- First, prove that Bonnie is either a student or inactive (unconditionally)
