The premises state that there are six distinct types of wild turkeys, and explicitly deny that Tom belongs to five of them (Eastern, Osceola, Gould's, Merriam's, Rio Grande). This leaves Ocellated as the only possibility. Therefore, it is impossible to prove the statement "Tom is an Eastern wild turkey" from the given premises.

    -- but here `h : kindOf Tom = Ocellated` rewritten in goal yields unprovable equality

The error occurred because in the Ocellated branch, the proof attempt used `False.elim` without providing a proof of `False`. The corrected approach demonstrates that Tom cannot be Eastern due to the premises and the distinct nature of the wild turkey kinds. The conclusion "Tom is an Eastern wild turkey" cannot be proven from the given premises.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the `contradiction` tactic couldn't resolve the cases where `kindOf Tom` was one of the non-Ocellated kinds. This happened because the context didn't have explicit contradictions for these cases. The proof was restructured to:
1. Use `cases` on `kindOf Tom` to examine all possible kinds
2. For each non-Ocellated kind, explicitly apply the relevant "not" axiom to derive `False`
3. In the Ocellated branch, rewrite the goal using `h` to get `Ocellated = Eastern`
4. Use `discriminate` to handle the impossible equality of distinct constructors

The critical insight is that after proving Tom must be Ocellated (since all other kinds lead to contradictions), the goal becomes proving `Ocellated = Eastern`. Since these are distinct constructors of an inductive type, this equality is impossible to prove, hence the conclusion fails.
