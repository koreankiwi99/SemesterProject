The reasoning involves translating the given premises into Lean and attempting to prove the conclusion. The key predicates and entities are defined, and the premises are formalized as axioms. The conclusion to prove is a conditional statement about Harry, a bee.

The Lean code sets up the necessary types, predicates, and axioms based on the context. The theorem `target` attempts to prove that if Harry satisfies the vertebrate-backbone equivalence, then he is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee. However, the proof fails in both cases of the disjunction:

1. **Case 1 (Harry is both vertebrate and has a backbone)**:  
   - Harry cannot be an animal (due to contradiction with reproduction axioms), but there's no axiom preventing non-animals from being invertebrates.  
   - No information exists to prove Harry isn't a queen bee.

2. **Case 2 (Harry is neither vertebrate nor has a backbone)**:  
   - If Harry is an animal, he must be an invertebrate (contradicting the desired conclusion).  
   - If Harry isn't an animal, invertebrate status is undetermined.  
   - Queen bee status remains unprovable.

Since the consequent cannot be proven in either case, the overall implication is unprovable.
