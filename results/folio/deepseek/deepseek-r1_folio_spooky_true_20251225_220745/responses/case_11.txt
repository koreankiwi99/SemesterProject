The premises provide information only about Tom and the six types of wild turkeys. Tom is explicitly stated to be a wild turkey but not of the first five types, implying he must be an Ocellated wild turkey. However, there are no premises about Joey. The existence of six types does not imply that all turkeys are wild turkeys, and Joey might be a non-wild turkey. Thus, we cannot prove that Joey is a wild turkey.

ANSWER: Failure

The compilation error occurred because the `fail` tactic was used incorrectly within the proof. Since there are no premises about Joey, it's impossible to prove that Joey is a wild turkey. The Lean code should reflect this by using `sorry` to indicate an unprovable statement.

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Turkey : Type
axiom WildTurkey : Turkey → Prop
axiom Eastern : Turkey → Prop
axiom Osceola : Turkey → Prop
axiom Goulds : Turkey → Prop
axiom Merriam : Turkey → Prop
axiom RioGrande : Turkey → Prop
axiom Ocellated : Turkey → Prop

axiom Tom : Turkey
axiom not_Eastern : ¬ Eastern Tom
axiom not_Osceola : ¬ Osceola Tom
axiom not_Goulds : ¬ Goulds Tom
axiom not_Merriam_OR_RioGrande : ¬ Merriam Tom ∧ ¬ RioGrande Tom
axiom tom_wild : WildTurkey Tom

axiom Joey : Turkey

theorem joey_wild : WildTurkey Joey := by
  sorry  -- No premises mention Joey
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure
