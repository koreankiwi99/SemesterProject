The premises state that all fir trees are evergreens and that some objects of worship are fir trees. The conclusion claims that some evergreens are not objects of worship. 

In Lean, we formalize the predicates and attempt to prove the conclusion. From the second premise, there exists an object `a` that is both an object of worship and a fir tree. By the first premise, `a` is also an evergreen. However, this only shows that there exists an evergreen that *is* worshipped. There is no information about other evergreens that might not be worshipped. The premises do not guarantee the existence of an evergreen that is not an object of worship. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom FirTree : obj → Prop
axiom Evergreen : obj → Prop
axiom ObjectOfWorship : obj → Prop

axiom all_fir_are_evergreen : ∀ x, FirTree x → Evergreen x
axiom some_worship_are_fir : ∃ x, ObjectOfWorship x ∧ FirTree x

theorem target : ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ ObjectOfWorship x :=
  by
  rcases some_worship_are_fir with ⟨a, ha_worship, ha_fir⟩
  have ha_evergreen : Evergreen a := all_fir_are_evergreen a ha_fir
  -- We have an evergreen object `a` that is worshipped, but we need an evergreen that isn't worshipped.
  -- No premise provides evidence of such an object.
  sorry  -- Proof incomplete; no evidence for existence of non-worshipped evergreen
