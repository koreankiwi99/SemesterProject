The reasoning involves deducing that the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico based on the premises, which then directly supports the conclusion that Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico.

**Proof Structure:**
1. **Premise:** The Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico or Texas (disjunction).
2. **Premise:** The Harding Pegmatite Mine (located in the Picuris Mountains) was donated.
3. **Premise:** No mountain range in Texas has a donated mine (universal negation).
4. **Contradiction Step:** If the Picuris Mountains were in Texas, this would contradict the third premise (since the mine exists and is donated).
5. **Disjunction Resolution:** By contradiction, the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas, so they must be in New Mexico (first premise).
6. **Conclusion:** Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains (second premise), which are in New Mexico.

Thus, the conclusion "Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico" is true.

**Lean Translation:**
- Axioms for `State` (New Mexico or Texas), `MountainRange`, and `Mine`.
- Specific constants: `Picuris` (mountain range) and `HardingPegmatiteMine` (mine).
- Predicates: 
  - `InState mr s` (mountain range `mr` is in state `s`).
  - `LocatedIn m mr` (mine `m` is located in mountain range `mr`).
  - `Donated m` (mine `m` was donated).
  - `Visited j m` (Juan de Onate visited mountain range `m`).
- Premises as axioms, including the critical universal negation for Texas.
- Proof shows existence of a mountain range in New Mexico visited by Juan.
