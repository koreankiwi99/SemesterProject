The Lean code establishes the premises and attempts to prove the statement. The key steps:
1. `range_location` shows Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico or Texas
2. `onate_visit` confirms Juan de Onate visited Picuris Mountains
3. `mine_donation` proves Harding Mine (in Picuris) was donated
4. `texas_constraint` establishes no donated mines in Texas ranges

The proof shows Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas (via contradiction using texas_constraint and mine donation), forcing them to be in New Mexico. While this confirms Juan visited a mountain range, the range is in New Mexico - not Texas. No premises provide information about Juan visiting any Texas mountain range, making the statement unprovable.
