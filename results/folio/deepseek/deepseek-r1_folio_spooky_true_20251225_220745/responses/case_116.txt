The reasoning context includes:
1. If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
2. Michael is taller than all others in his class.
3. Taller relation is transitive.
4. Peter is taller than Michael.
5. Michael blocks non-jumping shooters.
6. Michael cannot block Windy.
7. Jumping shooters are great shooters.

To prove "Peter can block Windy's shooting":
- Premise 1 only applies when **both are men**, and we don't know if Windy is a man.
- Premises 4 and 3 show Peter is taller than anyone in Michael's class (by transitivity), but Windy's class membership is unknown.
- Premises 5-6 imply Windy jumps while shooting, but this doesn't help with Peter's blocking ability.
- No premise links Peter to Windy's height or Windy's gender.

Proof fails because:
1. Critical missing fact: Is Windy a man? (Required for premise 1)
2. Critical missing fact: Peter vs. Windy height comparison (Transitivity doesn't chain without connections)
3. Blocking behavior for Peter is only defined for men he towers over (Windy may not qualify).

Lean formalization confirms unprovability:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Man : Person → Prop
axiom Taller : Person → Person → Prop
axiom CanBlock : Person → Person → Prop
axiom JumpsWhenShooting : Person → Prop
axiom InClass : Person → Prop  -- Represents membership in Michael's class

-- Premise 1: Conditional blocking by height for men
axiom block_rule : ∀ p q : Person, Man p → Man q → Taller p q → CanBlock p q

-- Premise 2: Michael's height dominance in class
axiom Michael : Person
axiom michael_man : Man Michael
axiom michael_in_class : InClass Michael
axiom michael_tallest : ∀ p : Person, InClass p → p ≠ Michael → Taller Michael p

-- Premise 3: Transitivity
axiom trans_taller : ∀ x y z : Person, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z

-- Premise 4: Peter surpasses Michael
axiom Peter : Person
axiom peter_man : Man Peter
axiom peter_taller_michael : Taller Peter Michael

-- Premise 5: Michael blocks non-jumpers
axiom michael_blocks : ∀ p : Person, ¬ JumpsWhenShooting p → CanBlock Michael p

-- Premise 6: Michael fails to block Windy
axiom Windy : Person
axiom michael_fails_windy : ¬ CanBlock Michael Windy

-- Premise 7: Jumping implies great shooter (unused; irrelevant to blocking)
axiom jumpers_great : ∀ p : Person, JumpsWhenShooting p → True  -- Placeholder

-- Attempted proof of Peter blocking Windy fails due to:
-- (1) Unknown whether Windy is a man
-- (2) Unknown relationship between Peter and Windy's heights
theorem peter_blocks_windy : CanBlock Peter Windy :=

    -- Must use `block_rule`, which requires:
    --   (a) Man Peter  [known]
    --   (b) Man Windy  [MISSING]

    -- Attempt to derive Windy's manhood fails (no premise provides it).
    -- Attempt to derive height relation:
    --   - Peter taller than Michael: known
    --   - Michael taller than Windy? Only if Windy ≠ Michael and InClass Windy [both unknown]

**ANSWER: Failure**

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `fail` tactic was used without completing the proof. After re-examining the premises and attempting to construct a proof, it remains impossible to prove that Peter can block Windy's shooting due to missing critical information:

1. **Windy's gender is unknown**: The blocking rule (premise 1) requires both parties to be men, but no premise establishes that Windy is a man.
2. **Height comparison is unprovable**: While Peter is taller than Michael, and Michael is taller than his classmates, there's no evidence that Windy is in Michael's class or how Windy's height compares to Peter's.
3. **No alternative blocking mechanism**: The only blocking rule for non-Michael individuals requires height superiority between men, which cannot be satisfied.

The corrected Lean code uses `sorry` to acknowledge the unprovability while maintaining compilable syntax:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Man : Person → Prop
axiom Taller : Person → Person → Prop
axiom CanBlock : Person → Person → Prop
axiom JumpsWhenShooting : Person → Prop
axiom InClass : Person → Prop

-- Premise 1: Taller men can block
axiom block_rule : ∀ p q : Person, Man p → Man q → Taller p q → CanBlock p q

-- Premise 2: Michael's class dominance
axiom Michael : Person
axiom michael_man : Man Michael
axiom michael_in_class : InClass Michael
axiom michael_tallest : ∀ p : Person, InClass p → p ≠ Michael → Taller Michael p

-- Premise 3: Transitivity of height

theorem peter_blocks_windy : CanBlock Peter Windy :=
  by
    -- Proof fails due to:
    -- 1. Missing evidence that Windy is a man (required for block_rule)
    -- 2. Missing height relationship: Taller Peter Windy cannot be established
    --    - Peter > Michael is known, but Michael > Windy requires:
    --        (a) Windy ∈ Michael's class (unknown)
    --        (b) Windy ≠ Michael (unknown)
    -- 3. No other blocking rules apply to Peter
