After translating the natural language premises into Lean code and attempting to prove the conclusion, the proof fails due to insufficient connectivity between geographical entities. Specifically:

1. The premises establish:
   - Barutin Cove is located in Snow Island
   - Snow Island is located in South Shetland Islands
   - Using transitivity, Barutin Cove is therefore located in the South Shetland Islands

2. However, the premise "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands" uses the relation `LocatedOn`, which is:
   - Not connected to the `LocatedIn` relation through axioms
   - Not covered by the transitive property axiom (which only applies to `LocatedIn`)
   
3. The conclusion requires proving ∃ (cove), LocatedIn cove Antarctica, but:
   - No chain links South Shetland Islands to Antarctica via `LocatedIn`
   - The `LocatedOn` relation cannot be used to close the proof
