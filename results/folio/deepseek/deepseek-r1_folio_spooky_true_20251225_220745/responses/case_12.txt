The premises state:
- The Legend of Zelda was created by a Japanese game company.
- All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese companies.
- If a game sells over one million copies, it is included in the Top 10 list.
- The Legend of Zelda sold over one million copies.

To prove: The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.

The key premises are:
- If a game sells over one million copies, it is on the Top 10 list (universal quantification).
- The Legend of Zelda sold over one million copies.

From these two premises, the conclusion follows directly through modus ponens. The information about Japanese companies is irrelevant to this specific conclusion, as it is not required for the logical derivation.

<lean>
axiom Game : Type
axiom zelda : Game
axiom InTop10 : Game → Prop
axiom SellsOverMillion : Game → Prop

-- Japanese company information (unused but included for completeness)
axiom JapaneseMade : Game → Prop
axiom P1 : JapaneseMade zelda
axiom P2 : ∀ g : Game, InTop10 g → JapaneseMade g

-- Critical premises
axiom P3 : ∀ g : Game, SellsOverMillion g → InTop10 g
axiom P4 : SellsOverMillion zelda

theorem zelda_in_top10 : InTop10 zelda := by 
  exact P3 zelda P4
</lean>

The proof uses only `P3` and `P4`. The premises about Japanese companies (`P1`, `P2`) are unused but do not affect the derivation. The result is provable.

ANSWER: True
