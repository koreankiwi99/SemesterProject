The premises state that there exists an entity that is both affection and love, and there exists an entity that is both love and positive. However, these two entities may not be the same. Without a connection between them (e.g., shared properties or identities), there is no way to guarantee an entity that is both affection and positive. The Lean proof attempt fails because it cannot construct a witness satisfying both properties simultaneously.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Affection : obj → Prop
axiom Love : obj → Prop
axiom Positive : obj → Prop

axiom premise1 : ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Love x
axiom premise2 : ∃ x, Love x ∧ Positive x

theorem goal : ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x := by
  rcases premise1 with ⟨a, ⟨ha_aff, ha_love⟩⟩
  rcases premise2 with ⟨b, ⟨hb_love, hb_pos⟩⟩
  -- No relationship between a and b exists
  -- Cannot prove ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x
  sorry
