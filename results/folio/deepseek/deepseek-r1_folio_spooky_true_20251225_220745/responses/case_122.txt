The premises do not provide sufficient information to prove that John's car is a Solo EV. The key observations are:
- Premises 1-4 establish relationships between vehicle types (Tesla Model 3, Solo EV) and properties (transporting multiple passengers, being one-seaters), but do not mention John's car.
- Premise 5 is a tautology (if ¬P then ¬P ∨ ¬Q) and adds no new information about John's car.
- No premise links John's car to Solo EV, Tesla Model 3, or any other category. John's car could belong to an unrelated vehicle type not constrained by the premises.

Thus, the statement "John's car is a Solo EV" cannot be proven from the given premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom johns_car : obj
axiom TransportMultiplePassengers : obj → Prop
axiom OneSeater : obj → Prop
axiom TeslaModel3 : obj → Prop
axiom SingleSeatElectricCar : obj → Prop
axiom SoloEV : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, TransportMultiplePassengers x → ¬ OneSeater x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, TeslaModel3 x → TransportMultiplePassengers x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x
axiom P5 : ¬ TeslaModel3 johns_car → (¬ TeslaModel3 johns_car ∨ ¬ SingleSeatElectricCar johns_car)

theorem johns_car_is_solo_ev : SoloEV johns_car := 
  by 
  -- No available premises about johns_car beyond tautologies. 
  -- Cannot prove SoloEV johns_car from given axioms.
