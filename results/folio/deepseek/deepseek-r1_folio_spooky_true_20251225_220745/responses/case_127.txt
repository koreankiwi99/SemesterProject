The context provides several premises about people, wedding plans, and family size. Premise 4 states that some people with well-attended weddings have larger families, but it does not specify that John is one of them. Premises 5 and 6 give conditional statements about John's engagement, wedding plans, invitations, and family size. However, there is no direct or indirect evidence that John has a larger family. The premises lack sufficient information about John to force this conclusion. Therefore, the statement "John has a larger family" cannot be proven from the given context.

-- All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom P1 : ∀ x : Person, makes_wedding_plans x → engaged x

-- All people who invite others make wedding plans.
axiom P2 : ∀ x : Person, invites_others x → makes_wedding_plans x

-- Anyone with a well-attended wedding invites others.
axiom P3 : ∀ x : Person, has_well_attended_wedding x → invites_others x

-- Some people with well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom P4 : ∃ x : Person, has_well_attended_wedding x ∧ has_larger_family x

-- If John is engaged, he does not (invite friends and make wedding plans).
axiom P5 : engaged John → ¬ (invites_friends John ∧ makes_wedding_plans John)

-- If John has a larger family, he has a well-attended wedding or invites friends.
axiom P6 : has_larger_family John → (has_well_attended_wedding John ∨ invites_friends John)

theorem john_has_larger_family : has_larger_family John :=
  by
    -- Premise 4 shows someone has a well-attended wedding and a larger family, but not necessarily John.
    -- Premises 5 and 6 are conditionals about John, but neither forces has_larger_family John.
    -- The argument cannot establish has_larger_family John directly or by contradiction.
    -- Since no proof exists within the context, the theorem is unprovable.
    -- A countermodel exists where John lacks a larger family (e.g., John unengaged and no invitations).
    -- Thus, we use 'sorry' to indicate failure.
