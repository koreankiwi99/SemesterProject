The premises do not allow us to prove that John does not have a larger family. The existential premise (4) confirms that some person has both a well-attended wedding and a larger family, but it does not specify John. Premises (5) and (6) about John lead to a contradiction only in certain interpretations and cases, but a consistent model exists where John has a larger family (e.g., by having John invite friends without being engaged or making wedding plans). Therefore, the conclusion cannot be proven from the given premises.

axiom Engaged : Person → Prop
axiom MakesWeddingPlans : Person → Prop
axiom InvitesOthers : Person → Prop
axiom HasWellAttendedWedding : Person → Prop
axiom HasLargerFamily : Person → Prop

axiom P4 : ∃ p : Person, HasWellAttendedWedding p ∧ HasLargerFamily p
-- Interpretation: If John is engaged, then he does not invite friends AND does not make wedding plans.
axiom P5 : Engaged John → ¬ InvitesFriends John ∧ ¬ MakesWeddingPlans John
axiom P6 : HasLargerFamily John → HasWellAttendedWedding John ∨ InvitesFriends John

      -- Without further premises linking InvitesFriends to Engaged or MakesWeddingPlans, this branch remains consistent.
      False.elim (sorry) -- Stuck; no contradiction found
