The premises provide information about general relationships and specific conditions about John, but they do not directly or indirectly force John to be engaged. The existential statement (premise 4) establishes that *some* individual with a well-attended wedding has a larger family, but this individual is not necessarily John. The universal premises (1-3) describe chains of implications (e.g., well-attended wedding → invites others → makes plans → engaged), but these apply to arbitrary individuals, not John specifically. Premises 5 and 6 are conditional statements about John, but their antecedents (John being engaged or having a larger family) are not asserted in the premises. Without evidence that John has a well-attended wedding, a larger family, or engages in related actions, the conclusion "John is engaged" cannot be proven.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the proof attempt did not close the goal `Engaged John`. The existential witness `w` from `P4` proves properties about some individual, but provides no connection to John. The premises contain no information about John's specific attributes (e.g., whether he has a larger family, makes wedding plans, or has a well-attended wedding). Premises 5 and 6 are conditional statements that require assumptions about John that are not provided. Thus, the conclusion "John is engaged" cannot be proven from the given premises.
