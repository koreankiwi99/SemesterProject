The formalization accurately captures all premises, including the ambiguity in the fifth premise where "John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans" is interpreted using a negated conjunction: `¬ (InvitesFriends John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)`. The Lean proof demonstrates that:
- The existential premise (A4) applies to some unspecified person, providing no information about John.
- Attempts to prove both `¬HasLargerFamily John` and `¬InvitesOthers John` lead to dead ends. 
  - Assuming `HasLargerFamily John` (to derive absurdity) yields two cases: either `HasWellAttendedWedding John` (implying `InvitesOthers John`, conflicting with the desired goal but the goal is not yet available), or `InvitesFriends John` (which yields no contradiction with any premise).
  - Assuming `InvitesOthers John` to prove its negation leads to `MakesWeddingPlans John` and `Engaged John` but no contradiction from `A5` without additional assumptions about `InvitesFriends John`.

No inherent contradiction is found in the premises that would enforce the conclusion about John. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the provided premises.
