The given premises do not allow us to conclude that humans are mammals. While we know:
- Some mammals have teeth
- Platypuses (which are mammals) have no teeth
- Humans have teeth

There is no premise stating that having teeth implies being a mammal. Humans could belong to another category (e.g., reptiles) that also have teeth. The existence of mammals with teeth and platypuses (mammals without teeth) shows that tooth presence isn't sufficient to determine mammal status. Thus, the conclusion "Humans are mammals" is unprovable from these premises.

-- Some mammals have teeth
axiom A1 : ∃ x, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
-- Platypuses have no teeth
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Platypus x → ¬ HasTeeth x
-- Platypuses are mammals
axiom A3 : ∀ x, Platypus x → Mammal x
-- Humans have teeth
axiom A4 : ∀ x, Human x → HasTeeth x
