The reasoning involves homonyms: "vacuum" is used in two distinct senses. Premise 2 ("Vacuums suck") refers to vacuum cleaners (household appliances that create suction), while premise 4 ("Space is a vacuum") refers to cosmic vacuum (a void in space). There is no premise linking cosmic vacuums to sucking. Thus, "Space sucks" cannot be proven from the given premises.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors were due to incorrect syntax for declaring multiple axioms in a single line. The corrected code properly declares each object separately. However, the conclusion "Space sucks" cannot be proven from the given premises. 

The critical issue is semantic ambiguity in "vacuum": 
- Premise 2 ("Vacuums suck") refers to vacuum cleaners (appliances that suck)
- Premise 4 ("Space is a vacuum") refers to cosmic vacuum (a void in space)
- No premise connects cosmic vacuums to sucking

Thus, the proof fails since:
1. Space is a cosmic vacuum, not a vacuum cleaner
2. There's no axiom that cosmic vacuums suck
