The reasoning involves categorizing machine learning algorithms and deducing the type used for the state-of-the-art text summarization model based on the given premises.

**Key Premises:**
1. ML algorithms are either supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning.
2. Unsupervised learning requires no labeled data.
3. The state-of-the-art text summarization model uses ML algorithms.
4. Reinforcement learning is **not** used for this model.
5. The ML algorithm for text summarization **requires labeled data**.

**Analysis:**
- From premise 5, the algorithm used requires labeled data.
- From premise 2, unsupervised learning cannot be used (since it requires no labeled data).
- From premise 4, reinforcement learning is excluded.
- By process of elimination (premise 1), the algorithm must be supervised learning.

**Lean Proof:**
The Lean code formalizes the categories, properties, and constraints. It proves that the state-of-the-art algorithm (`sota`) must be supervised by:
1. Confirming it requires labeled data (premise 5).
2. Eliminating unsupervised (contradicts labeled data requirement) and reinforcement (explicitly excluded).
3. Concluding the only remaining category is supervised.

-- Premise 5: Algorithm requires labeled data
axiom T5 : requires_labeled_data sota

**Conclusion:** The proof demonstrates that supervised learning must be used, following logically from the premises.

ANSWER: True

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The initial proof attempt encountered a compilation error because the `contradiction` tactic was unable to automatically detect the contradiction in the reinforcement learning case. The error occurred in the branch for `Category.reinforcement`, where the context contained both `h : category sota = Category.reinforcement` and `T4 : category sota ≠ Category.reinforcement`. The resolution involves explicitly proving `False` using these contradicting assumptions and then leveraging `False.elim` to discharge the goal.

**Corrected Lean Proof:**
The axioms accurately model the premises:
1. `Algorithm` represents machine learning algorithms.
2. `Category` enumerates the three learning types.
3. `requires_labeled_data` encodes the labeled data requirement.
4. `T2` corresponds to "unsupervised learning doesn't require labeled data".
5. Negative constraints for reinforcement learning (`T4`) and positive labeled data requirement (`T5`) for the state-of-the-art algorithm (`sota`).

The theorem `supervised_used` is proven by:
1. Showing `sota` cannot be unsupervised (since it requires labeled data).
2. Using case analysis:
   - Supervised case: Trivial via `rfl`.
   - Unsupervised/Reinforcement cases: Derive `False` from contradictions and eliminate to any goal.

</lean>

**Conclusion:** The premises logically entail that supervised learning must be used for the state-of-the-art text summarization model, as unsupervised and reinforcement learning are eliminated by the data requirement and explicit exclusion, respectively.
