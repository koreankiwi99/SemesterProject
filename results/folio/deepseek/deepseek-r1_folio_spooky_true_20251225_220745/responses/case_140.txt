The premises establish relationships about films but do not provide evidence that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" contains excessive violent/erotic content or is in the Frozen series. Specifically:

1. The disjunction in Premise 7 guarantees "Hachi" is either family-friendly animated or universally appropriate. 
2. Both cases imply universal appropriateness:
   - Family-friendly → Rated GA → Appropriate for all ages
   - Directly appropriate for all ages
3. Universal appropriateness allows children to watch without guidance (Premise 1), which means the film cannot contain excessive content (Premise 2, contrapositive).
4. Thus, we prove "Hachi" has no excessive content:  
   `¬ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi`
5. However, Frozen series membership (`InFrozenSeries`) cannot be proven from:
   - Family-friendly status (Premise 5 only states Frozen films are family-friendly, not the converse)
   - Universal appropriateness (no connection)
6. Therefore, `ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi ∨ InFrozenSeries Hachi` is unprovable since the first disjunct is false and the second lacks evidence.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The error occurred because the `goal_unprovable` theorem attempted to prove the negation of the conclusion, which was unnecessary. The correct approach is to directly attempt proving the original conclusion and fail when it cannot be proven.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

axiom CanWatchWithoutGuidance : obj → Prop
axiom ContainsExcessiveContent : obj → Prop

theorem goal : ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi ∨ InFrozenSeries Hachi := by
  have : ¬ ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi := no_excessive_content
  right  -- Attempt to prove InFrozenSeries Hachi
  -- No axioms connect FamilyFriendlyAnimated/AppropriateForAllAges to Frozen series

</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

Explanation:
1. We successfully prove ¬ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi using the premises
2. The conclusion reduces to InFrozenSeries Hachi
3. Premise P5 only states that Frozen films are family-friendly (not the converse)
4. Premise P7 gives no connection between Hachi and the Frozen series
5. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be proven from the premises
