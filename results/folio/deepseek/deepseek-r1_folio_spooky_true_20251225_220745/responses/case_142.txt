The reasoning involves translating the natural language statements into logical axioms and proving that the conclusion follows. The key steps are:

1. **Identify entities and predicates:**
   - `Animal`: the type of all animals.
   - `BreedBack`: a property indicating an animal is bred back.
   - `ArtificiallySelected`: a property indicating an animal is artificially selected.
   - `HeckCattle`: a property indicating an animal is a Heck cattle.

2. **Translate premises:**
   - "Breeding back is a form of artificial selection" → `∀ x, BreedBack x → ArtificiallySelected x`
   - "Heck cattle were bred back" → `∀ x, HeckCattle x → BreedBack x` (since Heck cattle are defined by being bred back)
   - "Heck cattle are animals" → Ensures Heck cattle are of type `Animal`.
   - Existence of Heck cattle is implied by historical context (bred in 1920s), so we add `∃ x, HeckCattle x`.

3. **Prove the conclusion "Some Heck cattle are artificially selected":**
   - From `∃ x, HeckCattle x`, there is a Heck cattle, say `w`.
   - Apply `∀ x, HeckCattle x → BreedBack x` to `w`: `HeckCattle w → BreedBack w` → `BreedBack w`.
   - Apply `∀ x, BreedBack x → ArtificiallySelected x` to `w`: `BreedBack w → ArtificiallySelected w` → `ArtificiallySelected w`.
   - Thus, `w` is a Heck cattle and artificially selected: `HeckCattle w ∧ ArtificiallySelected w`.
   - Therefore, `∃ x, HeckCattle x ∧ ArtificiallySelected x`.

The premises about resembling aurochs and extinct animals are not needed for this conclusion, as they do not affect the chain from Heck cattle to artificial selection.

The compilation errors occurred due to the use of `constant` declarations and `rcases`, which may require Mathlib. The corrected code uses `axiom` for declarations and built-in tactics like `cases` and `apply` without dependencies.
