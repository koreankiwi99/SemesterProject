-- Attempt to prove Palace of Flies was translated from Italian
theorem palace_from_italian : translated_from_Italian pf := by
  -- We have no premise that New Vessel Press only translates from Italian.
  -- Knowing one book (nc) is from Italian doesn't constrain pf's origin.
  -- We cannot deduce pf was translated from Italian.
  sorry

-- Since the proof requires an impossible case split on translation sources, it fails.
