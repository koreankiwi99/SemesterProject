ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The initial error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic in the `mixture_case` proof didn't automatically resolve the contradiction between `h.2` (contains_only_one_element Mixture) and the derived `¬contains_only_one_element Mixture` from `no_compound_one_element`. This was fixed by explicitly handling the case using pattern matching and the `contradiction` tactic after ensuring the context contains both contradictory facts.

For the main proof of `contains_carbon Mixture`:
- We first prove the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor contains only one element (`mixture_case`)
- We demonstrate that the mixture cannot be organic (would imply being chemical - contradicting `mixture_case`)
- The only carbon-containing premise applies specifically to organic compounds
- There are no premises forcing non-organic things to contain carbon

The proof fails because:
1. The mixture is proven inactive in all relevant chemical categories
2. The carbon-containment premise only covers organic compounds
3. There are no premises about carbon in non-organic entities

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred in the `mixture_case` proof because the `contradiction` tactic didn't automatically resolve the explicit contradiction between the hypotheses. This was fixed by explicitly using `exfalso` to switch to a `False` goal and then directly applying the contradictory hypotheses.

ANSWER: Failure

**Explanation:**  
While we successfully derived that the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor contains only one element, and that it cannot be organic (since organic compounds must be chemical compounds - creating a contradiction with `not_chem`), the only premise that forces carbon containment is tied to organic compounds (`all_organic_contain_carbon`). There is no premise that forces non-organic objects to contain carbon or provides an alternative path to carbon containment. The mixture's non-organic status therefore prevents us from proving it contains carbon.
