The premises establish that the mixture cannot be a chemical compound and cannot contain only one element, which leads to the conclusion that the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane, regardless of whether it contains only one element or contains carbon. This makes the implication true unconditionally.

axiom P1 : ∀x, Hydrocarbon x → OrganicCompound x
axiom P2 : ∀x, Alkane x → Hydrocarbon x
axiom P3 : ∀x, OrganicCompound x → ChemicalCompound x
axiom P4 : ∀x, OrganicCompound x → ContainsCarbon x
axiom P5 : ∀x, ChemicalCompound x → ¬ ContainsOnlyOneElement x
axiom P6 : (ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture) ∨ (¬ ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ¬ ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture)

theorem mixture_not_chem : ¬ ChemicalCompound Mixture := by
  rcases P6 with ⟨h1, h2⟩ | ⟨h3, h4⟩
  · exact absurd h2 (P5 Mixture h1)
  · exact h3

theorem mixture_not_alkane : ¬ Alkane Mixture := by
  intro h
  have : Hydrocarbon Mixture := P2 Mixture h
  have : OrganicCompound Mixture := P1 Mixture this
  have : ChemicalCompound Mixture := P3 Mixture this

theorem mixture_property : ¬ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ¬Alkane Mixture :=
