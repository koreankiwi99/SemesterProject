The conclusion "Some Greeks are mortal" requires the existence of at least one Greek. While the premises establish that all Greeks are human and all humans are mortal, they do not guarantee that any Greeks actually exist. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be proven from the given premises alone.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Mortal : obj → Prop
axiom Greek : obj → Prop

axiom all_human_mortal : ∀ x, Human x → Mortal x
axiom all_greek_human : ∀ x, Greek x → Human x

theorem some_greek_mortal : ∃ x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x := 
  by
    -- Attempt: Derive that Greeks are mortal
    have greek_mortal : ∀ x, Greek x → Mortal x := 
      fun x h => all_human_mortal x (all_greek_human x h)
    -- But cannot proceed: No existential witness available
    -- since premises lack existence of any Greek
    sorry -- Proof incomplete
