The premises lead to a contradiction due to Premise 6 (James works in the lab) directly contradicting Premise 7 (James does not work in the lab or have a part-time job). A contradiction implies any statement can be proven true, including that James has a part-time job.

The premises contain a contradiction:  
- Axiom T6 states James works in the lab.  
- Axiom T7 states James does not work in the lab _and_ does not have a part-time job (as a negated disjunction implies conjunctions of the negations).  

Specifically, T6 implies James works in the lab, but T7 implies he does not work in the lab. This leads to a contradiction. From a contradiction, anything can be proven (principle of explosion), including that James has a part-time job.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The premises contain a contradiction that allows proving any statement, including the conclusion. Specifically:
- Axiom T6 states James works in the lab
- Axiom T7 states James does not work in the lab AND does not have a part-time job (as ¬(P ∨ Q) ≡ ¬P ∧ ¬Q)
- This contradiction (T6 and ¬T6) enables proving any conclusion via explosion

axiom Student : Type
axiom James : Student
axiom works_in_library : Student → Prop
axiom from_CS_dept : Student → Prop
axiom has_part_time_job : Student → Prop
axiom takes_database_course : Student → Prop
axiom takes_class_with_David : Student → Prop
axiom works_in_lab : Student → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ s, works_in_library s → ¬ from_CS_dept s
axiom T2 : ∀ s, has_part_time_job s → works_in_library s
axiom T3 : ∀ s, takes_database_course s → from_CS_dept s
axiom T4 : ∀ s, takes_class_with_David s → takes_database_course s
axiom T5 : ∀ s, works_in_lab s → takes_class_with_David s
axiom T6 : works_in_lab James
axiom T7 : ¬ (works_in_lab James ∨ has_part_time_job James)

theorem James_has_job : has_part_time_job James := by
  apply False.elim    -- Change goal to False
  apply T7            -- Change goal to works_in_lab James ∨ has_part_time_job James
  exact Or.inl T6     -- Prove left disjunct using T6
