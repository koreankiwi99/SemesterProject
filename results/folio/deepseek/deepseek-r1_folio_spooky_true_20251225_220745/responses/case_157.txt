The premises and the conclusion are translated into Lean 4. The key reasoning is:

- Premise 6 states: James works in the lab (`works_in_lab James`).
- Premise 7 states: James does not work in the lab **or** James does not have a part-time job (`¬ works_in_lab James ∨ ¬ has_part_time_job James`).
- Since James works in the lab (Premise 6), the first disjunct of Premise 7 (`¬ works_in_lab James`) is false. Therefore, the second disjunct (`¬ has_part_time_job James`) must be true.
- Thus, James does not have a part-time job offered by the university.

This conclusion follows directly from Premises 6 and 7, without needing the other premises. The Lean proof uses case analysis on the disjunction in Premise 7 and derives a contradiction in the first case (using Premise 6), leaving the second case as the required result.

ANSWER: True

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic failed to recognize the explicit contradiction between `P6` and the left disjunct of `P7`. The proof is corrected by explicitly constructing the contradiction using `False.elim` applied to `not_works P6` in the first case.

    | inr no_job => exact no_job
</lean>

The conclusion follows directly from premises P6 and P7:
- P6 states James works in the lab (`works_in_lab James`)
- P7 states James either doesn't work in the lab OR doesn't have a part-time job
- The left disjunct (`¬works_in_lab James`) contradicts P6, forcing the right disjunct (`¬has_part_time_job James`) to be true

Thus, the statement "James does not have a part-time job offered by the university" is provable.
