The reasoning involves translating the premises into Lean and proving the conclusion. The premises are:

1. No library workers are from CS: `∀ s, WorksInLibrary s → ¬ FromCS s`
2. Part-time job holders work in the library: `∀ s, HasPartTimeJob s → WorksInLibrary s`
3. Database course takers are from CS: `∀ s, TakesDatabase s → FromCS s`
4. Students in Professor David's class take database: `∀ s, TakesClassWithDavid s → TakesDatabase s`
5. Lab workers take Professor David's class: `∀ s, WorksInLab s → TakesClassWithDavid s`
6. James works in the lab: `WorksInLab James`
7. James does not both work in the lab and have a part-time job: `¬ (WorksInLab James ∧ HasPartTimeJob James)`

The conclusion is: James takes the database course or has a part-time job (`TakesDatabase James ∨ HasPartTimeJob James`).

**Proof:**
- From premise 6 and 5, James takes a class with Professor David: `TakesClassWithDavid James`.
- From premise 4, James takes the database course: `TakesDatabase James`.
- Therefore, the disjunction holds by the left disjunct (`Or.inl`).

Premise 7 is not needed for the proof since `TakesDatabase James` alone suffices. The Lean code formalizes this reasoning and proves the conclusion.
