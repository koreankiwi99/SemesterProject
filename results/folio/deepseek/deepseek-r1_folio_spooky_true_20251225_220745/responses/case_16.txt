The premises do not provide sufficient information to conclude that Rockie is a turtle. While it is established that Rockie is a rabbit (since Rockie cannot be a squirrel due to the calmness contradiction and must therefore be a rabbit according to the third premise), there is no connection between rabbits and turtles in the given context. The existence of some turtle that can be spotted near the campus (from the second premise) does not imply that Rockie is that turtle, nor does being a rabbit preclude Rockie from being a turtle. However, the premises also do not require rabbits and turtles to be disjoint categories, so Rockie being a rabbit does not automatically prove it is not a turtle—yet there is no premise linking Rockie specifically to being a turtle. Thus, the proof fails.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The Lean code attempts to prove that Rockie is a turtle based on the given premises. The proof proceeds as follows:

1. Rockie is spotted and calm (by `rockie_spotted_calm`).
2. By `only_rabbits_squirrels_spotted`, Rockie must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.
3. If Rockie is a squirrel:
   - Then Rockie is skittish (by `spotted_squirrels_skittish`).
   - Skittish implies not calm (by `skittish_not_calm`).
   - This contradicts Rockie's calmness, closing this branch.
4. If Rockie is a rabbit:
   - There exists some turtle that is spotted (by `some_turtles_spotted`).
   - This turtle must be a rabbit or squirrel (by `only_rabbits_squirrels_spotted`).
   - However, there is no premise linking Rockie (a rabbit) to being a turtle.
   - The existential turtle does not force Rockie to be that turtle.
   - This branch cannot be proven.

The squirrel branch leads to contradiction, but the rabbit branch cannot prove Rockie is a turtle. Therefore, the proof fails.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The Lean code attempts to prove that Rockie is a turtle but encounters an insurmountable gap in the reasoning. Here's the analysis:

1. **Premises establish**:
   - Rockie is spotted and calm
   - Spotted animals are only rabbits or squirrels
   - Spotted squirrels are skittish
   - Skittish animals are not calm

2. **Critical deduction path**:
   - Rockie cannot be a squirrel (leads to contradiction: skittish vs calm)
   - Therefore Rockie must be a rabbit
   - There exists some spotted turtle (by premise)
   - That turtle must be rabbit or squirrel (by "only" premise)

3. **Proof gap**:
   - No premise links Rockie (a rabbit) to being a turtle
   - The existential turtle doesn't constrain Rockie's properties
   - Rabbit and turtle categories aren't shown to overlap for Rockie

The code demonstrates the rabbit/squirrel deduction but cannot bridge to turtle conclusion.
