The premises establish that there exists a show airing at 8 pm on Monday that gives out roses, which must be The Bachelor (from premise 2). The Bachelor portrays real people and is therefore a reality TV show (from premises 3 and 4). Breaking Bad is explicitly not a reality TV show. However, there is no information linking Breaking Bad's air time to Monday at 8 pm. The existence of The Bachelor airing at that time does not preclude other shows (including Breaking Bad) from airing simultaneously, as the premises do not state that only one show airs per time slot. Thus, the conclusion cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Show : Type
axiom breakingBad : Show
axiom theBachelor : Show
axiom AirsOnMondayAt8 : Show → Prop
axiom GivesOutRoses : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
axiom IsRealityTVShow : Show → Prop

-- Premise 1: Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses
axiom exists_show : ∃ s : Show, AirsOnMondayAt8 s ∧ GivesOutRoses s

-- Premise 2: If a show gives out roses, it is The Bachelor
axiom roses_implies_bachelor : ∀ s : Show, GivesOutRoses s → s = theBachelor

-- Premise 3: The Bachelor portrays real people
axiom bachelor_portrays : PortraysRealPeople theBachelor

-- Premise 4: Portraying real people implies reality TV
axiom portrays_implies_reality : ∀ s : Show, PortraysRealPeople s → IsRealityTVShow s

-- Premise 5: Breaking Bad is a show (implicit by its existence)

-- Premise 6: Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show
axiom not_reality : ¬ IsRealityTVShow breakingBad

-- Attempt to prove Breaking Bad airs on Monday at 8 pm
theorem breaking_bad_time : AirsOnMondayAt8 breakingBad :=
  by
    -- Extract the show from Premise 1
    obtain ⟨s, h_airs, h_roses⟩ := exists_show
    -- Show s must be The Bachelor (Premise 2)
    have s_is_bachelor : s = theBachelor := roses_implies_bachelor s h_roses
    -- The Bachelor portrays real people (Premise 3)
    have bachelor_real : PortraysRealPeople theBachelor := bachelor_portrays
    -- Therefore, The Bachelor is a reality show (Premise 4)
    have bachelor_reality : IsRealityTVShow theBachelor := portrays_implies_reality theBachelor bachelor_real
    -- Breaking Bad is not a reality show (Premise 6), but this doesn't constrain its air time
    -- No premise links Breaking Bad to s or the time slot
    -- Cannot establish air time for Breaking Bad
    sorry

-- Proof fails due to insufficient information
