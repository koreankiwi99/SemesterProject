The Lean code formalizes the given premises and attempts to prove the conclusion. The premises establish that any show giving out roses must be an episode of The Bachelor, which portrays real lives, making it a reality TV show. Breaking Bad is explicitly stated not to be a reality TV show. Therefore, Breaking Bad cannot give out roses, contradicting the conclusion that it does. The proof attempt fails because the premises imply Breaking Bad lacks the required properties.

<lean>
axiom Show : Type
axiom breakingBad : Show
axiom AirsMonday8pm : Show → Prop
axiom GivesRoses : Show → Prop
axiom IsBachelorEpisode : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
axiom RealityTVShow : Show → Prop

axiom P1 : ∃ s : Show, AirsMonday8pm s ∧ GivesRoses s
axiom P2 : ∀ s : Show, GivesRoses s → IsBachelorEpisode s
axiom P3 : ∀ s : Show, IsBachelorEpisode s → PortraysRealPeople s
axiom P4 : ∀ s : Show, PortraysRealPeople s → RealityTVShow s
axiom P6 : ¬ RealityTVShow breakingBad

theorem breakingBad_gives_roses : AirsMonday8pm breakingBad ∧ GivesRoses breakingBad := by
  -- Attempt to prove the conclusion by using the premises
  -- First, extract a witness from P1 (some show satisfying the conditions)
  rcases P1 with ⟨s, airs_s, roses_s⟩
  -- Show that if Breaking Bad gives roses, it must be a reality TV show (contradicting P6)
  have no_roses : ¬ GivesRoses breakingBad := by
    intro h_roses
    have is_bachelor := P2 breakingBad h_roses
    have portrays := P3 breakingBad is_bachelor
    exact P6 (P4 breakingBad portrays)
  -- The conclusion requires GivesRoses breakingBad, which contradicts no_roses
  -- Also, there is no premise linking the witness 's' to breakingBad
  -- Thus, the proof fails
