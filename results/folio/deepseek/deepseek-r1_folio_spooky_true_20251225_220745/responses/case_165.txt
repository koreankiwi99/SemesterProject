The reasoning involves translating the given premises into Lean and proving the conclusion. The conclusion is: "If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm." 

After formalizing the premises:
- There exists a show airing Monday at 8pm that gives roses.
- Any show giving roses is an episode of The Bachelor.
- The Bachelor portrays real lives.
- Any show portraying real lives is a reality TV show.
- Breaking Bad is a show and not a reality TV show.

The proof shows that if roses were given during Breaking Bad, it would lead to a contradiction:
1. Breaking Bad giving roses implies it is The Bachelor (Premise 2).
2. The Bachelor portrays real lives (Premise 3), so it is a reality TV show (Premise 4).
3. Thus, Breaking Bad would be a reality TV show, contradicting Premise 6.
4. This contradiction implies the antecedent (roses given during Breaking Bad) is false, making the entire implication true vacuously.

The Lean code formalizes this reasoning and proves the conclusion.

-- Premise 2: If a show gives out roses, it is an episode of The Bachelor.
