The reasoning involves proving that there exists a German politician who was part of both legislative bodies. Heinrich Schmidt serves as the witness.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : obj
axiom GermanPolitician : obj → Prop
axiom PrussianStateParliament : obj → Prop
axiom NaziReichstag : obj → Prop

axiom politician : GermanPolitician HeinrichSchmidt
axiom member : PrussianStateParliament HeinrichSchmidt ∧ NaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt

theorem some_german_in_both : 
  ∃ x, GermanPolitician x ∧ PrussianStateParliament x ∧ NaziReichstag x :=
  by
    apply Exists.intro HeinrichSchmidt
    constructor
    · exact politician
    · constructor
      · exact member.left
      · exact member.right
</lean>

ANSWER: True
