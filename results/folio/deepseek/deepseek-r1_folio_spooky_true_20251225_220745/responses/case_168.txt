The formalization captures the context: Heinrich Schmidt is a politician and a member of the Nazi Reichstag. The conclusion to prove is "No politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag", which translates to `∀ x, Politician x → ¬ InNaziReichstag x`. However, applying this conclusion to Schmidt leads to a contradiction: he is both a politician (`Politician schmidt`) and a member (`InNaziReichstag schmidt`). This contradiction proves that the conclusion is false. Since the conclusion cannot be derived from the premises and is in fact falsified by them, we return `Failure`.

The error occurred due to an incorrect approach in trying to reveal a contradiction via the conclusion itself inside the proof. Instead, the attempt to prove the universal statement directly fails because the premises provide a counterexample but no generalized rule to establish the universal claim. The proper method is to show that the theorem cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom schmidt : obj
axiom Politician : obj → Prop
axiom InNaziReichstag : obj → Prop
axiom politician_schmidt : Politician schmidt
axiom in_reichstag_schmidt : InNaziReichstag schmidt

theorem no_politicians_in_nazi : ∀ x, Politician x → ¬ InNaziReichstag x := 
  fun x hPolitician => 
    -- For arbitrary x, no premises link x to Schmidt beyond the specific instance.
    -- Schmidt's existence as a counterexample prevents generalization.
    -- Proof fails because:
    --   - No premise states all politicians are Schmidt
    --   - No premise excludes other politicians from the Reichstag
