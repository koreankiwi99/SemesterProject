</lean>

The premises provide no direct or indirect link to establish that colorectal cancer must be severe cancer. While we proved that colorectal cancer cannot be bile duct cancer (to avoid violating P6 with the low survival rate chain from P3→P2→P1), no premise forces it to be severe cancer. The structural chain only flows from bile duct cancer to severe cancer (P3), not vice versa, and colorectal cancer has no other connection to severity.

ANSWER: Failure

**Explanation:**
1. The error was in the last line where I incorrectly tried to apply `hAvoid` to a proposition rather than a proof term. This has been removed.
2. The proof shows:
   - Colorectal cancer cannot be bile duct cancer (via contradiction using P1-P3 and P6)
   - However, there are no premises forcing colorectal cancer to be severe cancer
3. The premises allow for non-bile duct cancers that are not severe (e.g., mild cancers not mentioned)
4. "Mild flu comes with low survival rate" is irrelevant to cancer severity classifications
5. The chain of implications only goes one direction (bile duct → severe → deadly → low survival), with no reverse dependencies
6. Therefore, the conclusion "Colorectal cancer is severe cancer" does not follow from the premises
