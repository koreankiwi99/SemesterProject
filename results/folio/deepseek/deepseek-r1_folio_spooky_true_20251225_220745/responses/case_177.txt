The reasoning hinges on the equivalence between "the last summer Olympic games" and "Tokyo." The premise states that the last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo, establishing that these refer to the same event. The additional premise states that the United States won the most medals in Tokyo. Therefore, by substitution, the United States won the most medals in the last summer Olympic games.

<lean>
axiom OlympicEvent : Type
axiom Country : Type
axiom UnitedStates : Country
axiom won_most_medals : Country → OlympicEvent → Prop

axiom Tokyo : OlympicEvent
axiom lastOlympic : OlympicEvent
axiom last_eq_tokyo : lastOlympic = Tokyo
axiom US_won_Tokyo : won_most_medals UnitedStates Tokyo

theorem US_won_last : won_most_medals UnitedStates lastOlympic := by
  rw [last_eq_tokyo]
  exact US_won_Tokyo

ANSWER: True
