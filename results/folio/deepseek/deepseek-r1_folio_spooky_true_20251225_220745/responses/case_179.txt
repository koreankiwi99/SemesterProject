The natural language reasoning involves flights, airports, and specific actions by Susan and John. The key premises are:
1. Susan flies to LGA airport (her flight arrives at LGA).
2. No flight has the same departure and arrival airport.
3. John flies from LGA airport (his flight departs from LGA).

The statement to evaluate is: "Susan flies from LGA airport" (meaning Susan has a flight departing from LGA).

In Lean, we model:
- `Airport` and `Person` as types.
- `LGA` as a specific airport.
- `Susan` and `John` as specific persons.
- `Flight` as a type representing flights.
- `departure` and `arrival` functions specifying the airports for each flight.
- `Takes` predicate associating a person with a flight.
- Premises:
  - P1: Susan has a flight arriving at LGA.
  - P2: For any flight, departure ≠ arrival.
  - P3: John has a flight departing from LGA.
- Conclusion: Susan has a flight departing from LGA.

Proof attempt:
- From P1, Susan has a flight `f` with `arrival f = LGA`.
- By P2, `departure f ≠ LGA` (since departure ≠ arrival).
- Thus, flight `f` does not depart from LGA.
- No premise indicates Susan has another flight departing from LGA.
- Therefore, the conclusion cannot be proven from the premises.

The error occurred because the `rcases` tactic requires existentials to be over inductive types, but the use of `variable` declarations led to dependent types that confused the tactic. The corrected solution declares all types and constants directly using `axiom` and `constant` to avoid dependency issues. 

<lean>
constant Airport : Type
constant Person : Type
constant Flight : Type
constant LGA : Airport
constant Susan : Person
constant John : Person
constant departure : Flight → Airport
constant arrival : Flight → Airport
constant Takes : Person → Flight → Prop

axiom P1 : ∃ f : Flight, Takes Susan f ∧ arrival f = LGA
axiom P2 : ∀ f : Flight, departure f ≠ arrival f
axiom P3 : ∃ g : Flight, Takes John g ∧ departure g = LGA

theorem target : ∃ h : Flight, Takes Susan h ∧ departure h = LGA :=
  by
    -- Susan has a flight f arriving at LGA
    rcases P1 with ⟨f, susan_flight, arr_eq_LGA⟩  
    -- P2 forbids same departure/arrival airport
    have dep_ne_LGA : departure f ≠ LGA := by
      intro dep_eq_LGA  -- Assume departure f = LGA
      -- This would force departure f = arrival f = LGA
      have : departure f = arrival f := Eq.trans dep_eq_LGA arr_eq_LGA.symm
      exact P2 f this  -- Contradiction with P2
    -- This flight f does NOT depart from LGA
    -- There is no information about other flights Susan might take:
    -- • John's LGA departure (P3) doesn't involve Susan
    -- • No exclusivity assumptions about flights
    sorry  -- Cannot prove existence of second flight h
</lean>

The premises establish:
1. Susan has a flight *arriving* at LGA
2. No flight has matching departure/arrival airports
3. John has a flight *departing* from LGA

The conclusion requires proving Susan has a flight *departing* from LGA. The proof fails because:
- Flight `f` (Susan's LGA arrival) cannot depart from LGA due to `P2`
- No premise shows Susan has multiple flights
- John's flights don't provide information about Susan

ITERATION 3

The compilation errors occurred due to improper handling of constants and function applications. The corrected code declares all types and functions explicitly using `axiom` and ensures proper function application syntax. The proof attempt shows that Susan's flight arriving at LGA cannot depart from LGA, but there's no information about other flights Susan might take.

axiom Flight : Type
axiom LGA : Airport
axiom Susan : Person
axiom John : Person
axiom departure : Flight → Airport
axiom arrival : Flight → Airport

axiom P2 : ∀ f : Flight, departure f ≠ arrival f
axiom P3 : ∃ g : Flight, Takes John g ∧ departure g = LGA

theorem target : ∃ h : Flight, Takes Susan h ∧ departure h = LGA :=
  by
    -- Extract Susan's flight from P1
    obtain ⟨f, h_susan_f, h_arrival⟩ := P1
    -- Prove departure f ≠ LGA using P2
    have h_dep_ne : departure f ≠ LGA := by
      intro h_dep_eq
      have : departure f = arrival f := Eq.trans h_dep_eq h_arrival.symm
      exact P2 f this
    -- No premise shows Susan has another flight departing from LGA:
    -- 1. Susan's known flight doesn't depart from LGA
    -- 2. John's flight doesn't involve Susan
    -- 3. No assumption about multiple flights per person
    sorry  -- Proof fails here
