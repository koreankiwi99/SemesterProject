The premises state that Susan flies to LGA airport, John flies from LGA airport, and no flight has the same departure and arrival airport. However, there is no information connecting John's flights to arriving at LGA. Specifically:
- John's flight from LGA (by premise) must arrive at a different airport (due to the no-same-airport rule), so that particular flight does not arrive at LGA.
- The premises do not provide any information about other flights John might take. Therefore, we cannot prove that John has a flight arriving at LGA.
