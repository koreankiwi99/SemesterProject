The reasoning involves proving that Tom, being a pet owner, cannot be both grumpy and mean to animals based on the given premises. Here's the formalization and proof:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Tom : obj
axiom Grumpy : obj → Prop
axiom MeanToAnimals : obj → Prop
axiom NiceToAnimals : obj → Prop
axiom AnimalLover : obj → Prop
axiom PetOwner : obj → Prop

axiom premise1 : ∀ x : obj, NiceToAnimals x → ¬ MeanToAnimals x
axiom premise2 : ∃ x : obj, Grumpy x ∧ MeanToAnimals x
axiom premise3 : ∀ x : obj, AnimalLover x → NiceToAnimals x
axiom premise4 : ∀ x : obj, PetOwner x → AnimalLover x
axiom premise5 : PetOwner Tom

theorem conclusion : ¬ (Grumpy Tom ∧ MeanToAnimals Tom) := by
  have T_animal_lover : AnimalLover Tom := premise4 Tom premise5
  have T_nice : NiceToAnimals Tom := premise3 Tom T_animal_lover
  have T_not_mean : ¬ MeanToAnimals Tom := premise1 Tom T_nice
  intro h
  have mean := h.2
  exact T_not_mean mean

#check conclusion
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**  
1. Premise 4 and 5 establish that Tom is an animal lover.  
2. Premise 3 implies Tom is nice to animals.  
3. Premise 1 shows that if someone is nice to animals, they aren't mean to animals.  
4. Thus, Tom cannot be mean to animals.  
5. Therefore, it's impossible for Tom to be both grumpy and mean to animals (even if Tom were grumpy, the "mean" part would be false).  

Premise 2 (about some grumpy people being mean) isn't needed for this proof, as Tom's properties alone suffice. The conclusion holds.

ANSWER: True
