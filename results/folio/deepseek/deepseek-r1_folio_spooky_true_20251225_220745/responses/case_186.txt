The premises provided do not allow us to prove that Dani Shapiro was born in Boston. While we know Dani Shapiro is American and Boston is an American city, there is no premise stating that being American implies being born in an American city. The premises about novels, podcasts, and writing activities do not provide information about birthplace. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given context.
