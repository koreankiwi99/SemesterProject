The premises establish that:
1. There exists at least one professional basketball player who is not an American national.
2. All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
3. Doing jump shots implies leaping straight into the air.
4. Leaping straight into the air implies activating leg muscles.
5. Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

From premises 4 and 5, Yuri does not leap straight into the air (by contraposition of premise 4). From this and premise 3, Yuri cannot do jump shots (by contraposition of premise 3). From this and premise 2, Yuri is not a professional basketball player (by contraposition of premise 2).

However, there is no premise linking non-basketball players to American nationality. The existence of some non-American basketball players (premise 1) does not provide information about Yuri, who is not a basketball player. Nationality for non-basketball players remains unconstrained by the premises. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that Yuri is an American national.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Yuri : obj
axiom ProBasketball : obj → Prop
axiom American : obj → Prop
axiom JumpShots : obj → Prop
axiom LeapAir : obj → Prop
axiom ActivateLegs : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∃ x, ProBasketball x ∧ ¬ American x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, ProBasketball x → JumpShots x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, JumpShots x → LeapAir x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, LeapAir x → ActivateLegs x
axiom A5 : ¬ ActivateLegs Yuri

-- Prove Yuri isn't a pro basketball player (derivable but irrelevant to nationality)
theorem not_player : ¬ ProBasketball Yuri := by
  intro hPlayer
  have hJump : JumpShots Yuri := A2 Yuri hPlayer
  have hLeap : LeapAir Yuri := A3 Yuri hJump
  exact A5 (A4 Yuri hLeap)

-- Attempt to prove American Yuri fails
theorem target : American Yuri := by
  -- No premises connect non-basketball players to nationality
  -- A1 provides no information about Yuri (who isn't a player)
  sorry -- Proof impossible
