The premises establish that all professional basketball players activate their leg muscles through a chain of actions (jump shots → leap → activate leg muscles). However, Yuri does not activate his leg muscles, so he cannot be a professional basketball player. The conclusion claims Yuri is an American professional basketball player, which requires him to be both a basketball player and American. Since we proved Yuri is not a basketball player, the conclusion cannot hold. The Lean code formalizes this reasoning, including a proof that Yuri is not a basketball player (`not_basketball`). Attempting to prove the conclusion (`target`) fails, as there is no evidence supporting Yuri being a basketball player or American, and the premises contradict the basketball player requirement.

axiom obj : Type
axiom BasketballPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom American : obj → Prop
axiom JumpShots : obj → Prop
axiom Leap : obj → Prop
axiom ActivateLegMuscles : obj → Prop
axiom Yuri : obj

axiom P1 : ∃ x, BasketballPlayer x ∧ ¬ American x
axiom P2 : ∀ x, BasketballPlayer x → JumpShots x
axiom P3 : ∀ x, JumpShots x → Leap x
axiom P4 : ∀ x, Leap x → ActivateLegMuscles x
axiom P5 : ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri

theorem not_basketball : ¬ BasketballPlayer Yuri :=
  fun h : BasketballPlayer Yuri =>
    have jump : JumpShots Yuri := P2 Yuri h
    have leap : Leap Yuri := P3 Yuri jump
    have activate : ActivateLegMuscles Yuri := P4 Yuri leap
    P5 activate

theorem target : BasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri :=
  -- Proof fails: Yuri cannot be a basketball player (via not_basketball), and no premises provide American(Yuri).
  -- Attempting to prove BasketballPlayer Yuri leads to contradiction with P5.
  -- American Yuri remains unsubstantiated.
