The logic challenge requires translating natural language premises into Lean and proving the conclusion: "If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish."

**Key observations from premises:**
1. `Spotted(Rockie) ∧ Calm(Rockie)` (Premise 6)
2. Spotted entities are rabbits or squirrels (Premise 3).
3. If Rockie were a squirrel, then:
   - Premise 5 implies `Skittish(Rockie)`
   - Premise 4 implies `¬Calm(Rockie)`, contradicting `Calm(Rockie)`.
4. Thus, Rockie must be a rabbit (closed case by contradiction).
5. As a spotted rabbit (Premises 1, 6), Rockie is cute.
6. Therefore, `Cute(Rockie)` holds unconditionally, proving the consequent `Cute(Rockie) ∨ Skittish(Rockie)` regardless of the antecedent.

The implication holds since the antecedent's truth value does not affect the already-true consequent.

The compilation errors occurred because the bound variable `x` in the axioms was not explicitly typed. Adding `(x : U)` to each axiom resolves the issue. The corrected Lean code proves the conclusion as follows:

1. **Premises Analysis**:
   - Rockie is spotted and calm (P6).
   - Spotted animals are rabbits or squirrels (P3).
   - If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish (P5), leading to a contradiction with calmness (P4). Thus, Rockie must be a rabbit (theorem `rockie_rabbit`).
   - As a spotted rabbit, Rockie is cute (P1, theorem `rockie_cute`).

2. **Conclusion Proof**:
   - The consequent "Rockie is cute or skittish" holds unconditionally (since Rockie is cute).
   - The antecedent ("Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel") is irrelevant to the truth of the consequent. Thus, the implication is true.

The compilation errors occurred due to Lean's automatic introduction of implicit variables, which caused ambiguity in the type declarations. By adding `set_option autoImplicit false` at the beginning, we enforce explicit type declarations throughout the code. The corrected Lean code proves the conclusion as follows:

1. **Premises Analysis**:
   - Rockie is spotted and calm (P6).
   - Spotted animals are exclusively rabbits or squirrels (P3).
   - If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish (P5), contradicting calmness (P4). Thus, Rockie must be a rabbit (theorem `rockie_rabbit`).
   - As a spotted rabbit, Rockie is cute (P1, theorem `rockie_cute`).

2. **Conclusion Proof**:
   - The consequent "Rockie is cute or skittish" holds unconditionally (since Rockie is cute).
   - The antecedent ("Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel") is irrelevant to the truth of the consequent. Thus, the implication is true.
