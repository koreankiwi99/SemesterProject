The premises state that every event is happy or sad, and at least one event is happy. However, these do not logically force all events to be sad. Specifically, there may exist a happy event that is not sad, and perhaps other events that are either happy or sad, but if any event is happy and not sad, then the conclusion that all events are sad is false. Since an alternative model exists satisfying the premises but not the conclusion, the conclusion cannot be proven.

<lean>
axiom Event : Type
axiom Happy : Event → Prop
axiom Sad : Event → Prop
axiom P1 : ∀ e : Event, Happy e ∨ Sad e
axiom P2 : ∃ e : Event, Happy e

-- Attempt to prove ∀ e, Sad e
theorem goal : ∀ e, Sad e := by
  intro e
  cases P1 e  -- For arbitrary e, show Sad e
  case inr s =>  -- If Sad e, done
    exact s
  case inl h =>  -- If Happy e, stuck
    -- Cannot derive Sad e from premises alone
    -- Existence of happy events doesn't help: no axioms linking properties across events
    -- and no exclusivity assumption (Happy → ¬Sad) provided
    sorry  -- Proof incomplete here
