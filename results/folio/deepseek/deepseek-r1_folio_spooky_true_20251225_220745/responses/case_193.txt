The premises state that Steinhauer was the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic, which directly contradicts the statement to evaluate (that Steinhauer was not the winner). Despite additional information about a six-way tie on the leaderboard, a Belgian participant in the tie, and Descampe (who is Belgian and on the leaderboard), no contradiction arises when combined with the uniqueness of the winner and the requirement that the winner is on the leaderboard. Even with these axioms, the existence of multiple people on the leaderboard, including the winner and other participants (possibly in the tie), does not invalidate the initial premise that Steinhauer is the winner. Therefore, the conclusion that Steinhauer is not the winner cannot be proven from the premises.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the attempted proof of `¬ isWinner steinhauer` was incomplete and failed to derive a contradiction. After careful analysis, the premises do not provide any basis to conclude that Steinhauer was not the winner. In fact, the premises explicitly state that Steinhauer was the winner, and the additional information about the leaderboard, tie, and Descampe does not contradict this. The Lean code below defines the premises correctly without attempting an unprovable theorem.
