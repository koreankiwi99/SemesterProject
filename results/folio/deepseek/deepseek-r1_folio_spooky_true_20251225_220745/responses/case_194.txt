The premises establish that there is at least one person from Belgium in the six-way tie on the leaderboard, and Descampe is from Belgium and on the leaderboard. However, there is no information indicating that Descampe is the only Belgian on the leaderboard or that the Belgian in the tie is unique. Therefore, Descampe might not be the same person as the Belgian in the tie, and we cannot conclude that Descampe is in the six-way tie.

-- Attempt to prove Descampe is in the tie
theorem goal : InTie descampe := by
  -- We know there exists a Belgian in the tie (tie_exists)
  have ⟨b, hb_tie, hb_bel⟩ := tie_exists
  -- Descampe is Belgian and on the leaderboard, but we lack uniqueness
  -- No premise forces b = descampe or limits Belgians on leaderboard
  -- Thus, we cannot prove InTie descampe
