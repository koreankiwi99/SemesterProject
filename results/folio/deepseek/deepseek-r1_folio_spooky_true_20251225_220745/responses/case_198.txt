    -- Attempt to derive contradiction from premises
    -- We know ailtonSilva is Brazilian and plays for nautico
    have ailtonBrazilian : isBrazilian ailtonSilva := brazilianAndPlaysNautico.left
    have ailtonAtNautico : playsFor ailtonSilva nautico := brazilianAndPlaysNautico.right
    -- But we need to show ¬isBrazilian p for arbitrary p under h
    -- No general rule links p to ailtonSilva
    -- Premises don't force all nautico players to be non-Brazilian
    -- Counterexample exists: ailtonSilva satisfies both conditions
    -- Therefore, proof fails at this point
    admit  -- Explicit admission of unprovability
