The premises establish relationships for Netflix shows, but do not compel Karen to share "Black Mirror" with Lisa. Specifically:
- Karen downloads a show if and only if she binge-watches it.
- Karen does not download "Black Mirror", so she does not binge-watch it.
- The sharing condition only applies if she binge-watches a show, which is false for "Black Mirror".
- No premise forces sharing without binge-watching.

Thus, the conclusion cannot be proven from the given premises.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The Lean code formalizes the given premises but encounters an issue when attempting to prove the conclusion. The premises establish that:
- "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show
- Downloading occurs if and only if binge-watching occurs
- Karen does not download "Black Mirror", so she does not binge-watch it
- Sharing requires binge-watching

The proof attempt fails because the sharing rule (`share_if_binge`) requires proof of binge-watching, which contradicts the proven fact that Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror" (`not_binge_BM`). No alternative path to prove sharing exists in the premises.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The error occurred because the proof attempted to use `not_download_BM` (which states that downloading does not occur) to prove that downloading *does* occur. This is a fundamental contradiction in the proof attempt. The premises establish that:
1. Downloading occurs if and only if binge-watching occurs (`binge_iff_download`)
2. Karen does not download "Black Mirror" (`not_download_BM`)
3. Sharing requires binge-watching (`share_if_binge`)

From these, we can prove that binge-watching does not occur (`not_binge_BM`). Since the sharing rule requires binge-watching (which is false for "Black Mirror"), and no alternative path to sharing exists in the premises, the conclusion cannot be proven.
