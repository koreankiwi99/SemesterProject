The statement claims that Beijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics. The context provides direct evidence for each part:

1. **2008 Summer Olympics**: Explicitly stated: "Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics..."  
2. **Winter Olympics**: Explicitly stated: "Beijing has hosted the Summer and Winter Olympics..." (as a distinct event type).

The proof relies on:  
- A specialized event (`summer2008`) for the 2008 Summer Olympics.  
- Predicates to define hosting relationships and event types.  
- Axioms directly derived from the context:  
  - Hosting of `summer2008` (premise 4).  
  - General hosting of at least one Winter Olympics event (premise 5).  

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Beijing : obj
axiom summer2008 : obj
axiom Hosts : obj → obj → Prop
axiom IsWinterOlympics : obj → Prop

-- Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics (premise 4)
axiom hosted_summer_2008 : Hosts Beijing summer2008

-- Beijing has hosted at least one Winter Olympics (premise 5)
axiom hosted_some_winter : ∃ e : obj, IsWinterOlympics e ∧ Hosts Beijing e

-- Proof that Beijing hosted both:
theorem statement : 
    Hosts Beijing summer2008 ∧ (∃ e, IsWinterOlympics e ∧ Hosts Beijing e) := 
  ⟨hosted_summer_2008, hosted_some_winter⟩
</lean>

The conjunction is proven using the two direct axioms. Additional context (capital status, location, universities) is irrelevant to the core logic and safely omitted.

ANSWER: True
