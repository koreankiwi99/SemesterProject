The reasoning shows that Djokovic must live in a tax haven based on the given premises. Djokovic is at the mixer, so he is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor. If he is a Grand Slam champion, he becomes a professional tennis player, then an athlete, then famous. Being a famous athlete triggers the conditional that he is well-paid. If he is an Oscar-nominated actor, he is a celebrity, which directly makes him well-paid. In both cases, he is well-paid, and all well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens. Therefore, Djokovic lives in a tax haven.
