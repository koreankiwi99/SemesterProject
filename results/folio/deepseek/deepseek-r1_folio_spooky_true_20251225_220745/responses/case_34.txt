The context states that Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine and that Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers. However, there is no explicit premise stating that leading a stable implies leading every member or subgroup within that stable. Without an axiom connecting the "leads" and "includes" relations, the conclusion that Roderick Strong directly leads the Creed Brothers cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom RoderickStrong : obj
axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom CreedBrothers : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj
axiom Imperium : obj

axiom leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom includes : obj → obj → Prop

axiom leads_diamond : leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
axiom includes_creed : includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
axiom includes_ivy : includes DiamondMine IvyNile
-- Imperium feud not relevant to the conclusion

theorem strong_leads_creed : leads RoderickStrong CreedBrothers :=
  by 
  -- No axiom links 'leads' of a stable to 'includes' members. Proof fails.
  sorry
