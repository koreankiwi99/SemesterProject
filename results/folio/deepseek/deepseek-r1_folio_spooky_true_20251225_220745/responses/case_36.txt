The premises state that Beethoven wrote Symphony No. 9, which is a music piece, and that composers write music pieces. However, the latter premise only establishes that composers are individuals who write music pieces (i.e., if someone is a composer, they write at least one music piece). It does not establish the converse—that anyone who writes a music piece must be a composer. The other premises (about the Vienna Music Society premiering the symphony, Beethoven leading the orchestra, and orchestras being led by conductors) do not provide any link to Beethoven being a composer. Therefore, the conclusion that Beethoven is a composer cannot be proven from the given premises.

  -- We know Beethoven wrote a music piece (P3 and P1), but P2 does not provide the reverse implication.
  -- From P5, P6, and P7, we can prove Beethoven is a conductor, but that doesn't imply he is a composer.
