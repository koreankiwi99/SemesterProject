The reasoning involves proving the statement "Some orchestras premiered music pieces" from the given premises. The key steps are:

1. Identify relevant entities and predicates:
   - `SymphonyNo9` is a music piece (premise)
   - `ViennaMusicSociety` is an orchestra (premise)
   - `ViennaMusicSociety` premiered `SymphonyNo9` (premise)

2. The conclusion requires showing ∃ orchestra ∃ music piece, such that the orchestra premiered the music piece. Using the premises:
   - `ViennaMusicSociety` (orchestra) premiered `SymphonyNo9` (music piece)
   - This directly satisfies the existential quantifier

3. Other premises (about composers, Beethoven leading, conductors) are irrelevant to the conclusion since:
   - Beethoven's role as composer/conductor doesn't affect the premiering event
   - The premiering orchestra (`ViennaMusicSociety`) and music piece (`SymphonyNo9`) are explicitly given

The Lean proof constructs the existential witness using `ViennaMusicSociety` and `SymphonyNo9` with the relevant properties.
