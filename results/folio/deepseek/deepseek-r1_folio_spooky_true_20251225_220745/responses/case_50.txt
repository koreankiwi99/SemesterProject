The reasoning involves deriving a contradiction from the assumption that 1984 is a streaming service, using the provided premises. Here's the Lean translation:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom c1984 : obj
axiom Digital : obj → Prop
axiom Analog : obj → Prop
axiom PrintedText : obj → Prop
axiom StreamingService : obj → Prop
axiom HardcoverBook : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Digital x → ¬ Analog x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, PrintedText x → Analog x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, StreamingService x → Digital x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, HardcoverBook x → PrintedText x
axiom P5 : StreamingService c1984 → HardcoverBook c1984

theorem conclusion : ¬ StreamingService c1984 :=
  fun h : StreamingService c1984 =>
  have D : Digital c1984 := P3 c1984 h
  have HB : HardcoverBook c1984 := P5 h
  have PT : PrintedText c1984 := P4 c1984 HB
  have A : Analog c1984 := P2 c1984 PT
  have notA : ¬ Analog c1984 := P1 c1984 D
  notA A
</lean>

The proof shows that assuming `StreamingService c1984` leads to a contradiction: It implies both `Analog c1984` (via printed text and analog media) and `¬ Analog c1984` (via digital media exclusion). Thus, the negation holds.

ANSWER: True
