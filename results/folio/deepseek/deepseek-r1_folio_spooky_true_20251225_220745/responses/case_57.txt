The reasoning involves translating the given premises into Lean 4 axioms and attempting to prove the statement "Butte and St Pierre are in the same state." The premises establish that Butte is in Montana, St Pierre is not in Montana, and each city (except certain exceptions not relevant here) is in exactly one state. The proof attempt shows that no state exists where both Butte and St Pierre are located, as Butte's state is uniquely Montana, and St Pierre is explicitly excluded from Montana. The existential statement cannot be proven, leading to a failure.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The error occurred because in the proof attempt for `same_state_butte_st_pierre`, I incorrectly tried to use `st_pierre_not_in_montana` (a negation) where a positive proof was required. After careful analysis, I've restructured the Lean code to properly represent the premises and the statement to evaluate. The key insight is:

1. Butte is in Montana (given explicitly)
2. St Pierre is not in Montana (given explicitly)
3. Each city (except the listed exceptions) can only be in one state (uniqueness axiom)
4. Since Butte and St Pierre are not among the exceptions, Butte must be exclusively in Montana
5. Therefore, no state exists where both Butte and St Pierre are located

The Lean code now:
- Defines the necessary types and axioms
- Proves White Sulphur Springs is in Montana (using the uniqueness axiom)
- Defines the target statement as `∃ s, IsInState butte s ∧ IsInState st_pierre s`
- Proves this statement is false by showing it leads to a contradiction

ANSWER: Failure

**Explanation:**  
The target statement ("Butte and St Pierre are in the same state") cannot be proven because:
- Butte is exclusively in Montana (by premises and uniqueness axiom)
- St Pierre is not in Montana
- No other state can contain Butte (due to uniqueness)
- Therefore, the statement is false, and we cannot prove it true
