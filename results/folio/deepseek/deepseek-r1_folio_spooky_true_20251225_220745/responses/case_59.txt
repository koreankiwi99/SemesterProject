The problem involves translating the given premises into Lean and then proving that Missoula is in Montana. The key premises are:

1. Billings is in Montana.
2. Montana includes Butte, Helena, and Missoula (which directly states Missoula is in Montana).
3. White Sulphur Springs and Butte are in the same state.
4. St Pierre is not in Montana.
5. Unique state assignment holds for all cities except excluded ones (Missoula isn't excepted).

The conclusion ("Montana is home to Missoula") is directly stated in premise 2, so it doesn't require other premises. The ambiguous premise about "any city in Butte" isn't needed for this proof.

ITERATION 2

The compilation errors occurred due to using the keyword `constants` (plural) instead of `constant` (singular) in Lean 4. The corrected code uses `constant` for all declarations and adds explicit type annotations where needed. The proof remains straightforward since the premise directly states that Missoula is in Montana.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect syntax for declaring multiple constants. In Lean 4, each constant must be declared separately with explicit type annotations. The proof remains valid since the premise directly states Missoula is in Montana.
