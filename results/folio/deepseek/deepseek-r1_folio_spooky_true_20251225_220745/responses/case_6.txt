The conclusion "There is an animal" follows from the premise "Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals" (formalized as ∃ x, Animal x ∧ MonkeypoxVirusOccursIn x). The proof extracts the witness from this existential quantifier. Other statements (about mammals, symptoms, flu) are irrelevant to the existence claim and were therefore omitted.

ANSWER: True
