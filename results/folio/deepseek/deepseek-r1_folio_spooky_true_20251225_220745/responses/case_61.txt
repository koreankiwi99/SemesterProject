The reasoning cannot establish that Mike has a J1 visa. The premises state that international students have either an F1 or J1 visa, and Mike is an international student. However, when Mike wants to work, he must apply for CPT. This requirement is explicitly tied to F1 visa holders in the premises, but nothing is stated about J1 visa holders' requirements. The existence of the requirement for Mike could align with him having an F1 visa (since F1 requires CPT or OPT when working). There is no information indicating that J1 visa holders are exempt from CPT, nor is there any principle to infer Mike's visa type from the CPT requirement alone. Attempting to prove "Mike has a J1 visa" from the given premises yields no proof, as no premise necessitates a J1 visa for Mike.

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was used inappropriately when attempting to derive a contradiction in the F1 case. However, the deeper issue is that the premises do not provide sufficient information to prove that Mike has a J1 visa. The natural language premises are consistent with Mike having either visa type, and no premise forces a contradiction when assuming Mike has an F1 visa.

-- Premises:
-- 1. All international students have F1 or J1 visas

    -- - mike_cpt requires CPT if Mike wants to work
    -- - F1_rule allows CPT for F1 students who want to work
    -- - We don't know whether Mike wants to work
    admit  -- Cannot prove J1 in this branch
  case inr hJ =>  -- Case 2: Mike has J1
    exact hJ  -- We could complete the proof here
  -- But since the F1 case blocks completion, the proof fails
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

**Explanation:**  
- The proof attempt fails because the F1 case cannot be resolved.  
- The premises are consistent with Mike having F1: If Mike has F1 and wants to work, applying for CPT satisfies both `F1_rule` and `mike_cpt`.  
- No premise eliminates the F1 case or requires J1 for students needing CPT.  
- Without information correlating CPT exclusively with J1, Mike's visa type remains undetermined.
