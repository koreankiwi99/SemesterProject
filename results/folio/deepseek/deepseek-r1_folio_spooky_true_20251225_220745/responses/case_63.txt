The conclusion "Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle" does not follow from the premises. Here's why:

1. Ted is an alligator, and alligators are not domesticated animals.
2. If Ted were Brown Swiss cattle, then he would be a cow (premise 1), and thus a domesticated animal (premise 3), contradicting premise 4.
3. Thus, Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle.
4. Since "Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle" requires Ted to be Brown Swiss cattle (which is impossible), the entire conjunction is false.

The premises do not provide any evidence that Ted is a pet, and specifically prove that Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven true.

The compilation error occurred because the placeholder `?` in `disprove_BSC_Ted ?_` requires a proof of `BSC Ted`, which is not available. In fact, the premises prove that `BSC Ted` is false, making it impossible to prove the conjunction `Pet Ted ∧ BSC Ted`. Here's the corrected Lean code:

</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

**Explanation:**  
1. The premises prove Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle (`not_BSC_Ted`), making `BSC Ted` false.  
2. There's no evidence that Ted is a pet – the existence of some pet that is Brown Swiss cattle doesn't imply Ted is that pet.  
3. Both conjuncts (`Pet Ted` and `BSC Ted`) are unprovable:  
   - `Pet Ted` has no supporting evidence  
   - `BSC Ted` contradicts the premises  
Thus, the statement "Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle" cannot be proven from the given premises.

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic requires both a proposition and its negation to be present in the context to derive a contradiction. In the `right` branch, we only had `¬BSC Ted` but not `BSC Ted`, so `contradiction` failed. Here's the corrected Lean code:

axiom BSC : obj → Prop   -- Brown Swiss cattle
axiom Cow : obj → Prop
axiom Pet : obj → Prop
axiom Domesticated : obj → Prop
axiom Alligator : obj → Prop

axiom some_pets_are_bsc : ∃ x, Pet x ∧ BSC x
axiom all_cows_domesticated : ∀ x, Cow x → Domesticated x

axiom ted_alligator : Alligator Ted

theorem not_BSC_Ted : ¬ BSC Ted := by
  intro h
  have hCow : Cow Ted := all_bsc_are_cows Ted h
  have hDom : Domesticated Ted := all_cows_domesticated Ted hCow
  exact alligators_not_domesticated Ted ted_alligator hDom

theorem target : Pet Ted ∧ BSC Ted := by
  apply And.intro
  case left =>   -- Prove Pet Ted
    cases some_pets_are_bsc with
    | intro w hw =>  -- w is some pet that is BSC
      -- No premise connects Ted to w, so Pet Ted remains unprovable
      sorry
  case right =>  -- Prove BSC Ted
    -- We have a proof that BSC Ted is impossible (not_BSC_Ted)
    -- But we cannot prove a false statement
    exact not_BSC_Ted ?_  -- Placeholder for BSC Ted proof (which doesn't exist)
    -- Alternatively, we could write:
    -- have : ¬BSC Ted := not_BSC_Ted
    -- apply False.elim
    -- exact this ?_   -- Still requires BSC Ted
    -- Ultimately, we cannot prove BSC Ted
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

**Explanation:**  
1. The premises prove Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle (`not_BSC_Ted`):  
   - If Ted were BSC, he'd be a cow → domesticated → contradicts "alligators aren't domesticated"  
2. The conclusion requires Ted to be both a pet and BSC:  
   - `BSC Ted` is provably false (cannot be proven)  
   - `Pet Ted` has no support: "some pets are BSC" doesn't imply Ted is one of them  
3. Both branches require `sorry`/placeholders since:  
   - Left branch: No evidence Ted is a pet  
   - Right branch: `BSC Ted` contradicts known facts  
Thus the statement cannot be proven from the premises.
