After analyzing the context and the statement, I'll translate the problem into Lean 4. The key observation is that while the context establishes relationships between Monkeypox, animals, and symptoms, it provides no information linking Monkeypox to humans specifically, nor any premises that would prevent humans from getting the flu. The tiredness symptom occurs in both Monkeypox and flu cases, but this overlap doesn't force the conclusion that no one gets the flu.

axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasMonkeypoxVirus : obj → Prop
axiom GetsMonkeypox : obj → Prop
axiom GetsFlu : obj → Prop
axiom Tiredness : obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom virus_implies_monkeypox : ∀ x, HasMonkeypoxVirus x → GetsMonkeypox x
axiom virus_in_animals : ∃ x, Animal x ∧ HasMonkeypoxVirus x
axiom humans_are_mammals : ∀ h, Human h → Mammal h
axiom mammals_are_animals : ∀ m, Mammal m → Animal m
axiom monkeypox_causes_tiredness : ∀ x, GetsMonkeypox x → Tiredness x
axiom flu_causes_tiredness : ∀ h, Human h → GetsFlu h → Tiredness h

-- Attempt to prove: No human gets the flu
theorem no_one_gets_flu : ∀ h, Human h → ¬ GetsFlu h :=
  fun h human_h flu_h =>
  -- If a human has the flu, they experience tiredness
  have tired_from_flu : Tiredness h := flu_causes_tiredness h human_h flu_h
  -- But there might be other causes of tiredness (like Monkeypox in animals),
  -- and we have no information about humans having Monkeypox
  -- No contradiction can be derived since:
  -- 1. Tiredness doesn't imply flu (multiple causes possible)
  -- 2. No premises restrict flu occurrence
  -- Therefore, we cannot complete the proof
  False.elim (sorry) -- Proof fails at this point
