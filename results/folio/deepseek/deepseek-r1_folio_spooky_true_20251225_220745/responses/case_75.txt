The premises lead to a provable conclusion. Here's the Lean formalization and proof:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Hannah : obj
axiom Works : obj → Prop
axiom NeedsMoney : obj → Prop
axiom OrdersTakeout : obj → Prop
axiom EnjoysDining : obj → Prop
axiom Picky : obj → Prop
axiom SpendsTime : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x : obj, Works x → NeedsMoney x
axiom T2 : ∀ x : obj, OrdersTakeout x → Works x
axiom T3 : ∀ x : obj, OrdersTakeout x ∨ EnjoysDining x
axiom T4 : ∀ x : obj, EnjoysDining x → ¬ Picky x
axiom T5 : ∀ x : obj, EnjoysDining x → SpendsTime x
axiom T7 : Works Hannah ∧ (NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ Picky Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah))

theorem hannah_needs_money : NeedsMoney Hannah :=
  have H_works : Works Hannah := T7.1
  T1 Hannah H_works
</lean>

**Proof explanation**:  
- From `T7`, we extract `Works Hannah` (first conjunct).  
- Applying universal axiom `T1` to `Hannah` gives: `Works Hannah → NeedsMoney Hannah`.  
- Combining these yields `NeedsMoney Hannah`.  
The unused part of `T7` (the implication) does not affect this direct deduction. The conclusion is provable from the premises.

ANSWER: True
