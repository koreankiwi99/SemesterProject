The reasoning involves deriving a contradiction from the premises and the antecedent of the conclusion. The antecedent assumes that Hamden Plaza Subway provides take-out and receives many negative reviews. From premise 5, we know it either has a rating >4 or is popular among locals. Both cases lead to it being listed in Yelp (premises 2 and 4). By premise 1, this means it cannot have many negative reviews, contradicting the antecedent. Thus, the antecedent leads to a contradiction, making the entire implication true by the principle of explosion.
