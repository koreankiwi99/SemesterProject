The premises state that every NLP task is either a language generation task or a language understanding task (without specifying mutual exclusivity). Machine translation is an NLP task with a text sequence output, which by premise 2 makes it a language generation task. However, there is no premise indicating that a task cannot be both generation and understanding simultaneously, nor any premise forcing machine translation to be an understanding task. Thus, the conclusion that machine translation is a language understanding task cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
variable Task : Type
variable IsGenerationTask : Task → Prop
variable IsUnderstandingTask : Task → Prop
variable HasTextOutput : Task → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ t, IsGenerationTask t ∨ IsUnderstandingTask t
axiom P2 : ∀ t, HasTextOutput t → IsGenerationTask t
axiom MT : Task
axiom P4 : HasTextOutput MT

theorem target : IsUnderstandingTask MT := by
  have gen_MT : IsGenerationTask MT := P2 MT P4
  cases (P1 MT) with
  | inl _ => sorry  -- Stuck: generation doesn't imply understanding
  | inr under => exact under  -- This branch relies on P1 choosing understanding, which isn't forced
</lean>

Below is the corrected Lean code addressing the compilation errors. The previous errors occurred due to improper function application and missing explicit types in variable declarations. In Lean 4, predicates must be explicitly applied to arguments of the correct type, and declarations must include type annotations.

The reasoning remains unchanged:  
- Premises establish that machine translation is a language generation task (via `HasTextOutput` and the implication).  
- While all tasks are either generation or understanding (disjunction), there is **no premise stating mutual exclusivity**. Thus, proving machine translation is an understanding task is impossible despite it being a generation task.

<lean>
axiom Task : Type
axiom IsGenerationTask : Task → Prop
axiom IsUnderstandingTask : Task → Prop
axiom HasTextOutput : Task → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ (t : Task), IsGenerationTask t ∨ IsUnderstandingTask t
axiom P2 : ∀ (t : Task), HasTextOutput t → IsGenerationTask t

axiom MT : Task
axiom P4 : HasTextOutput MT

theorem target : IsUnderstandingTask MT := by 
  -- Prove MT is generation via P2 and P4
  have gen_MT : IsGenerationTask MT := P2 MT P4 
  -- P1 states MT must be generation OR understanding
  -- Case split on the disjunction:
  cases P1 MT with
  | inl h_gen =>
      -- MT is generation (matches gen_MT). 
      -- No premise shows generation implies ¬understanding → cannot prove understanding.
      admit  
  | inr h_under =>
      -- If MT were understanding, this branch would prove it.
      -- BUT: gen_MT proves generation, so this branch is factually inconsistent?
      -- However, no axiom prevents a task from being BOTH.
      -- Thus, we cannot assume mutual exclusivity.
      exact h_under
-- The `admit` in generation branch causes failure.

I apologize for the errors. The issue was due to the 'cases' tactic requiring a hypothesis name and a common name conflict with "Task". I've resolved it by renaming the type and using explicit disjunction elimination. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom NLPTask : Type
axiom IsGenerationTask : NLPTask → Prop
axiom IsUnderstandingTask : NLPTask → Prop
axiom HasTextOutput : NLPTask → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ (t : NLPTask), IsGenerationTask t ∨ IsUnderstandingTask t
axiom P2 : ∀ (t : NLPTask), HasTextOutput t → IsGenerationTask t
axiom MT : NLPTask
axiom P4 : HasTextOutput MT

theorem target : IsUnderstandingTask MT := by 
  apply Or.elim (P1 MT) 
  -- Generation branch
  · intro gen 
    -- Known from P2: P4 → generation → NO premise shows understanding → cannot prove
    sorry 
  -- Understanding branch
  · intro under 
    exact under
</lean>

The proof fails because:
1. Premise P1 states every NLP task is either generation OR understanding (but may be both)
2. Premise P2 proves machine translation (MT) is generation since it has text output
3. We're asked to prove MT is understanding - but could be generation-only
No premise establishes mutual exclusivity, so generation does not preclude understanding.
