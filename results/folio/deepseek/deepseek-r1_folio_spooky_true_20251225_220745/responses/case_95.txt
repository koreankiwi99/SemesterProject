The conclusion that "The Harvard Weekly Book club has legal obligations" cannot be proven from the given premises. Here's the step-by-step reasoning and Lean formalization:

### Key Observations:
1. **Premises establish a hierarchy**:
   - PrivateCompany ⊆ Company ⊆ BusinessOrganization ⊆ LegalEntity
   - LegalEntity entities are CreatedUnderLaw and HaveLegalObligations

2. **Information about Harvard Weekly Book Club**:
   - We only know *if* it is CreatedUnderLaw, then it is ¬PrivateCompany
   - There is **no premise stating** it belongs to any category (BusinessOrganization, Company, etc.)

3. **Proof attempt**:
   - Assuming HarvardWeekly Book Club is PrivateCompany leads to contradiction (via premises 1-4 and 6)
   - But without belonging to *any* category in the hierarchy, we cannot conclude it is a LegalEntity
   - Premise 6 only provides conditional information, not affirmative membership

### Lean Formalization:
```lean
axiom obj : Type
axiom HarvardWeeklyBookClub : obj
axiom BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop
axiom Company : obj → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : obj → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : obj → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : obj → Prop

axiom all_biz_legal : ∀ x, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom all_companies_biz : ∀ x, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom all_private_companies : ∀ x, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom legal_created : ∀ x, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom legal_obligations : ∀ x, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom hwbc_conditional : CreatedUnderLaw HarvardWeeklyBookClub → ¬ PrivateCompany HarvardWeeklyBookClub

theorem hwbc_has_obligations : HasLegalObligations HarvardWeeklyBookClub := 
  by
    -- Attempt proof by contradiction on private membership
    have not_private : ¬ PrivateCompany HarvardWeeklyBookClub := by
      intro h_private
      have h_company : Company HarvardWeeklyBookClub := all_private_companies HarvardWeeklyBookClub h_private
      have h_biz : BusinessOrganization HarvardWeeklyBookClub := all_companies_biz HarvardWeeklyBookClub h_company
      have h_legal : LegalEntity HarvardWeeklyBookClub := all_biz_legal HarvardWeeklyBookClub h_biz
      have h_created : CreatedUnderLaw HarvardWeeklyBookClub := legal_created HarvardWeeklyBookClub h_legal
      exact hwbc_conditional h_created h_private
    -- But cannot proceed further: No information about company/business organization membership
    -- HarvardWeeklyBookClub may not be in the BusinessOrganization-LegalEntity hierarchy at all
    sorry -- Proof fails here
```

### Why the Proof Fails:
- We derive `¬PrivateCompany HarvardWeeklyBookClub` but cannot prove it belongs to *any* category implying LegalEntity
- The premises discuss categories (businesses, companies) but never assert Harvard belongs to them
- Premise 6 is conditional ("if created under law") but doesn't provide affirmative status

ANSWER: Failure
