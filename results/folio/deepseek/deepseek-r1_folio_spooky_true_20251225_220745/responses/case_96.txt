The conclusion "The Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations and is a private company" does not follow from the premises. In fact, the premises imply that if the Harvard Weekly Book Club were a private company, it would lead to a contradiction. Specifically:

1. If it were a private company (assumption for contradiction):
   - It would be a company (premise 3).
   - Then a business organization (premise 2).
   - Then a legal entity (premise 1).
   - Then created under law (premise 4).
   - But premise 6 states that if created under law, it is not a private company → contradiction.

Thus, the Harvard Weekly Book Club cannot be a private company. Therefore, the conjunction (has legal obligations AND is a private company) is unprovable. Additionally, there are no premises establishing that the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity or business organization, so "has legal obligations" is also unprovable.

ITERATION 2

The error occurred in the proof of the second conjunct where `intro` was incorrectly used in a context that didn't require hypothesis introduction. After careful analysis, I've determined that the conclusion ("The Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations and is a private company") cannot be proven from the given premises. 

Key reasons:
1. The Harvard Weekly Book Club's status as a legal entity cannot be established (required for legal obligations)
2. Premises show a contradiction if it were a private company, but provide no positive evidence
3. "Created under law" is required for both implications but remains unproven

Here's the corrected Lean code:

axiom obj : Type
axiom HarvardWeeklyBookClub : obj
axiom BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop
axiom Company : obj → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : obj → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : obj → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom P5 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom P6 : CreatedUnderLaw HarvardWeeklyBookClub → ¬ PrivateCompany HarvardWeeklyBookClub

theorem target : HasLegalObligations HarvardWeeklyBookClub ∧ PrivateCompany HarvardWeeklyBookClub := by
  apply And.intro
  · -- Cannot prove legal obligations: no evidence of Harvard being legal entity
    show HasLegalObligations HarvardWeeklyBookClub from sorry
  · -- Cannot prove private company status: would contradict P6 if Harvard was created under law
    show PrivateCompany HarvardWeeklyBookClub from sorry

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect use of the `show ... from` syntax within tactic proofs. The proper approach is to use `sorry` for unprovable subgoals. After careful analysis, I confirm that the conclusion cannot be proven from the premises:

1. There's no evidence that Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity (required for legal obligations)
2. Premises imply a contradiction if it were a private company, but provide no positive evidence
3. The conditional premise (P6) doesn't provide usable information without additional assumptions

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HarvardWeeklyBookClub : obj
axiom BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop
axiom Company : obj → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : obj → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : obj → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom P5 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom P6 : CreatedUnderLaw HarvardWeeklyBookClub → ¬ PrivateCompany HarvardWeeklyBookClub

theorem target : HasLegalObligations HarvardWeeklyBookClub ∧ PrivateCompany HarvardWeeklyBookClub := by
  apply And.intro
  · -- No premises establish Harvard as legal entity
    sorry  -- Cannot prove legal obligations
  · -- Would cause contradiction with P6 if Harvard was created under law
    sorry  -- Cannot prove private company status
