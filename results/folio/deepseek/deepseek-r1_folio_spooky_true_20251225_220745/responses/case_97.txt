The reasoning text establishes a chain of implications that lead to the conclusion. If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, then:

1. It is a company (from "All private companies are companies").
2. It is a business organization (from "All companies are business organizations").
3. It is a legal entity (from "All business organizations are legal entities").
4. It has legal obligations (from "All legal entities have legal obligations").
5. It is created under law (from "All legal entities are created under law").

Since either "has legal obligations" or "created under law" must hold (both actually follow), the disjunction is satisfied. Premise 6 ("If created under law then not a private company") isn't needed for this proof.

axiom obj : Type
axiom HWBC : obj
axiom BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : obj → Prop
axiom Company : obj → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : obj → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom A6 : CreatedUnderLaw HWBC → ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC

theorem conclusion : PrivateCompany HWBC → (HasLegalObligations HWBC ∨ CreatedUnderLaw HWBC) :=
  fun h =>
    have comp : Company HWBC := A3 HWBC h
    have bus : BusinessOrganization HWBC := A2 HWBC comp
    have leg : LegalEntity HWBC := A1 HWBC bus
    Or.inl (A5 HWBC leg)  -- Uses HasLegalObligations branch (CreatedUnderLaw also follows via A4)
