The premises establish that Harry is a bee and bees do not reproduce by mating. While we can infer Harry is an invertebrate (since vertebrates reproduce by mating), there is no premise linking bee status to queen bee status beyond "all queen bees are bees" (which doesn't imply all bees are queen bees). Thus, "Harry is a queen bee" cannot be proven from the given premises.

axiom obj : Type

axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom Invertebrate : obj → Prop
axiom Vertebrate : obj → Prop
axiom HasBackbone : obj → Prop
axiom ReproduceByMating : obj → Prop
axiom Bee : obj → Prop
axiom QueenBee : obj → Prop

axiom Harry : obj

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → (Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x)
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, HasBackbone x → ReproduceByMating x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Vertebrate x → HasBackbone x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Bee x → ¬ ReproduceByMating x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, QueenBee x → Bee x
axiom A6 : Bee Harry
axiom A7 : ∀ x : obj, Bee x → Animal x  -- Bees are animals (implicit)

theorem harry_invertebrate : Invertebrate Harry := by
  apply Or.resolve_right (A1 Harry (A7 Harry A6))
  intro hVert
  have Hback : HasBackbone Harry := A3 Harry hVert
  have Hmate : ReproduceByMating Harry := A2 Harry Hback
  exact A4 Harry A6 Hmate

-- No axioms connect "Bee" directly to "QueenBee" beyond subset relation (A5)
-- Therefore, QueenBee Harry is unprovable
