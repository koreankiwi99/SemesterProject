The reasoning involves translating the given premises into Lean 4 syntax and attempting to prove the statement "Taylor visits the gym at least once a day". The premises establish logical relationships between health consciousness, eating habits, gym visits, and Taylor's background. Key deductions:

1. **Contradiction in Taylor's first scenario**: If Taylor both grew up in a health-conscious home and disregards her physical well-being, we derive:
   - Health-conscious home → eats salads → very conscious (Premises 2, 1)
   - Disregarding well-being → not very conscious (Premise 4)
   This yields a contradiction, so this scenario is impossible.

2. **Taylor's actual state**: Taylor must be in the second scenario: she neither grew up in a health-conscious home nor disregards her physical well-being.

3. **Gym visits imply contradictions**: If Taylor visits the gym daily:
   - Gym visits → fulfills nutrition → health-conscious home (Premise 5, 3)
   - But Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious home (from step 2)
   This leads to a contradiction.

Thus, Taylor **cannot** visit the gym daily. Since the statement "Taylor visits the gym at least once a day" is false and cannot be proven from the premises, the proof attempt fails.

After analyzing the issues in the previous Lean code, I've made the following corrections:

1. Fixed the proof of `taylor_case` by using `False.elim (not_both h)` in the left branch instead of relying on `contradiction`

2. Kept the main theorem `taylor_gym` as unproven with a `sorry` placeholder since we cannot prove that Taylor visits the gym daily

Here is the corrected Lean code:

-- Cannot be proven

  -- Attempt: Assume Taylor visits gym
  have gym_to_nutrition := P5 Taylor
  have nutrition_to_home := P3 Taylor
  -- Would require health-conscious home: 
  have home_req : VisitsGymDaily Taylor → GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor := 
    fun h => nutrition_to_home (gym_to_nutrition h)
  -- But taylor_case shows Taylor has no health-conscious home
  exact False.elim (taylor_case.1 (home_req (by assumption))) -- Stuck here
                                       --^ no proof for the assumption
  sorry -- Final failure to prove
</lean>

**Explanation of why the proof fails:**
1. We derive that Taylor must be in the second scenario: neither from a health-conscious home nor disregards her physical well-being
2. If Taylor visited the gym daily, she would:
   - Fulfill nutritional needs (by P5)
   - Come from a health-conscious home (by P3)
3. But taylor_case proves she's not from a health-conscious home
4. This creates a contradiction if we assume gym visits
5. However, we cannot prove the original gym visit claim since it leads to contradiction
6. Therefore we cannot prove "Taylor visits the gym daily"

The compilation errors occurred due to issues in defining and referencing the `taylor_case` lemma. The conjunction type annotation caused parsing conflicts, and the theorem proof incorrectly assumed a hypothesis that wasn't present. Below is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Taylor : Person

axiom EatsSaladsRegularly : Person → Prop
axiom VeryConscious : Person → Prop
axiom GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome : Person → Prop
axiom FulfillsNutrition : Person → Prop

axiom VisitsGymDaily : Person → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ p : Person, EatsSaladsRegularly p → VeryConscious p
axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p → EatsSaladsRegularly p
axiom P3 : ∀ p : Person, FulfillsNutrition p → GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p
axiom P4 : ∀ p : Person, DisregardPhysicalWellBeing p → ¬ VeryConscious p
axiom P5 : ∀ p : Person, VisitsGymDaily p → FulfillsNutrition p

-- Taylor's condition
axiom Taylor_condition : 
  (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor ∧ DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) ∨ 
  (¬ GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor ∧ ¬ DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor)

-- First scenario leads to contradiction
lemma not_both : ¬ (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor ∧ DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) := by
  intro ⟨h1, h2⟩
  have h3 := P2 Taylor h1
  have h4 := P1 Taylor h3
  exact P4 Taylor h2 h4

-- Taylor does not have a health-conscious home
lemma taylor_not_home : ¬ GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor := by
  cases Taylor_condition with
  | inl h => exact False.elim (not_both h)
  | inr h => exact h.1

-- Taylor does not disregard her physical well-being
lemma taylor_not_disregard : ¬ DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by
  cases Taylor_condition with
  | inl h => exact False.elim (not_both h)
  | inr h => exact h.2

-- Attempt to prove Taylor visits gym daily
theorem taylor_gym : VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by
  -- If Taylor visited the gym, she'd fulfill nutrition (P5)
  have H1 : VisitsGymDaily Taylor → FulfillsNutrition Taylor := P5 Taylor
  -- Fulfilling nutrition implies health-conscious home (P3)
  have H2 : FulfillsNutrition Taylor → GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor := P3 Taylor
  -- Thus gym visits imply health-conscious home
  have H3 : VisitsGymDaily Taylor → GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor := 
    fun h => H2 (H1 h)
  -- But we've proven Taylor has no health-conscious home
  exact False.elim (taylor_not_home (H3 (by sorry)))  -- No proof for gym visits
</lean>

**Explanation:**
1. The problematic conjunction lemma was split into separate lemmas (`taylor_not_home` and `taylor_not_disregard`).
2. The proof of `taylor_gym` demonstrates that assuming gym visits leads to contradiction (via `taylor_not_home`), but cannot prove the initial assumption.
3. The `sorry` placeholder confirms the unprovability of the statement.
