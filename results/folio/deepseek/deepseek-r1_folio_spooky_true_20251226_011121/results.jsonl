We need to model the context in Lean and then see if we can prove the statement.\n\nLet's break down the context:\n\n1. \"People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.\"\n   \u2192 If someone is in the club and performs in talent shows often, then they attend and are engaged with school events.\n   \u2192 We can write: \u2200 p, (Club p) \u2192 (Performs p) \u2192 (Attends p \u2227 Engaged p)\n\n2. \"People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.\"\n   \u2192 For every person in the club, either they perform often OR they are inactive and disinterested.\n   \u2192 \u2200 p, (Club p) \u2192 (Performs p \u2228 Inactive p)\n\n3. \"People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.\"\n   \u2192 If someone in the club chaperones dances, then they are not a student of the school.\n   \u2192 \u2200 p, (Club p) \u2192 (Chaperones p) \u2192 \u00ac (Student p)\n\n4. \"All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\"\n   \u2192 \u2200 p, (Club p) \u2192 (Inactive p) \u2192 (Chaperones p)\n\n5. \"All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\"\n   \u2192 We can interpret this as: For any person in the club, if they are a young child or teenager (we'll use one predicate for being a young child or teenager, say `Young p`) AND they wish to further their career (say `Wishes p`), then they are students.\n   \u2192 \u2200 p, (Club p) \u2192 (Young p) \u2192 (Wishes p) \u2192 (Student p)\n\nAdditionally, we have a fact about Bonnie:\n\n6. \"Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\"\n   \u2192 This is a bit complex. Let me parse it:\n     Let A = Bonnie attends and is engaged (i.e., Attends Bonnie \u2227 Engaged Bonnie)\n     Let S = Bonnie is a student (Student Bonnie)\n\n     The statement says: (A \u2227 S) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acS)\n\n     This is an exclusive OR? Actually, it's an inclusive OR? But note that the two cases are mutually exclusive.\n     However, observe: (A \u2227 S) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acS) is equivalent to (A \u2194 S). Because if A and S are both true, then the first holds. If both false, the second holds. If one true and one false, neither holds.\n\n     Actually, note: the sentence says \"either both ... and ... or ...\". So it is exactly: (A \u2227 S) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acS) which is the same as A \u2194 S.\n\n     So we have: (Attends Bonnie \u2227 Engaged Bonnie) \u2194 (Student Bonnie)\n\nNow, the statement to evaluate:\n\n\"If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\"\n\nLet's break the antecedent:\n\nLet Y = Young Bonnie (she is a young child or teenager)\nLet W = Wishes Bonnie (wishes to further her career)\nLet C = Chaperones Bonnie\n\nThe antecedent is: (Y \u2227 W \u2227 C) \u2228 (\u00acY \u2227 \u00acW)   [Note: the \"neither\" part: not (Young and not Wishes? Actually, the text: \"neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes ...\" -> meaning: she is not a young child/teenager AND she does not wish? Actually, note: the whole \"young child or teenager who wishes\" is a noun phrase? The negation: \"neither is [a young child or teenager] nor [someone who wishes ...]\"? \n\nBut the text: \"Bonnie is either \n   both a young child or teenager [but note: \"young child or teenager\" is one category] who wishes ... and chaperones \n   OR \n   neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes ...\"\n\nActually, it's ambiguous. But let's look: \"neither is a young child nor teenager\" ... that would be \u00acY. The text then says \"who wishes ...\", but if she is not a young child nor teenager, then the \"who wishes\" might be attached to the young child/teen? In that case, the second part would just be \u00acY (with no condition on W). However, the intended meaning is: she doesn't have the property of being a young child/teenager AND also doesn't wish? \n\nBut note: the entire property in the first branch: \"a young child or teenager who wishes ...\" is [Young p \u2227 Wishes p] and then also chaperones. \n\nSo the antecedent is: either [Y \u2227 W \u2227 C] OR she does not fall into the category of being a young child/teenager with wish? And the second branch says \"neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes ...\". That could be interpreted as: \u00ac(Y \u2227 W) ... but note \"neither a young child nor [a teenager who wishes]\"? That seems ungrammatical. \n\nAlternatively, we can parse the second branch as: she is not (a young child or teenager) and she does not (wish to further ...). However, the text: \"neither is a young child nor teenager\" might cover the entire category, and then \"who wishes\" is left hanging? Actually, the original text: \n\"Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities\"\n\nThe first branch: [((young child or teenager) and wishes) and chaperones].\nThe second branch: [neither (a young child) nor (a teenager who wishes)]? That doesn't make sense because then it would be \u00ac(young_child) and \u00ac(teenager who wishes). But she could be a teenager without wishing? \n\nBut wait, the text says \"neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes ...\". This is best interpreted as: she is not a young child, and she is not a teenager who wishes? That would be \u00ac(young_child) and \u00ac(teenager \u2227 wishes). But then this doesn't cover all cases and is complex.\n\nAlternatively, the whole phrase \"a young child or teenager who wishes\" is a single entity? Meaning people that are both (young child or teenager) and wish? Then the antecedent becomes:\n\nEither: (Young Bonnie \u2227 Wishes Bonnie) \u2227 Chaperones Bonnie   OR   \u00ac(Young Bonnie \u2227 Wishes Bonnie)\n\nSo the antecedent: [(Y \u2227 W) \u2227 C] \u2228 [\u00ac(Y \u2227 W)]\n\nAnd the consequent: Bonnie is either a student or inactive.\n\nIn symbols: (Student Bonnie) \u2228 (Inactive Bonnie)\n\nSo the statement to prove is:\n\n   ( [ (Y \u2227 W) \u2227 C ] \u2228 \u00ac(Y \u2227 W) ) \u2192 ( (Student Bonnie) \u2228 (Inactive Bonnie) )\n\nNow, note that \u00ac(Y \u2227 W) is equivalent to \u00acY \u2228 \u00acW.\n\nSo the antecedent becomes: [ (Y \u2227 W \u2227 C) ] \u2228 [ \u00acY \u2228 \u00acW ]\n\nWhich is the same as: [ (Y \u2227 W \u2227 C) \u2228 \u00acY \u2228 \u00acW ]\n\nBut this is in fact ALWAYS true? Because if we don't have both Y and W, then \u00acY \u2228 \u00acW holds. If we do have both Y and W, then we require C? But wait, the antecedent is satisfied regardless of C in the case we have both Y and W? Not exactly: if we have both Y and W, then we need C to hold for the first term to be true. However, if we have both Y and W and not C, then the first term fails and the second term would require \u00acY or \u00acW, which fails because we have both? So in that case the antecedent would be false.\n\nSo actually, the antecedent is equivalent to: (\u00acY \u2228 \u00acW) \u2228 (Y \u2227 W \u2227 C)\n\nWhich we can also write as: (\u00acY \u2228 \u00acW) \u2228 (C \u2227 Y \u2227 W)\n\nNow, we know from the context:\n\n- Bonnie is in the club: Club Bonnie.\n\n- We have the equivalence: (Attends Bonnie \u2227 Engaged Bonnie) \u2194 (Student Bonnie)\n\nWe need to prove: under the antecedent, the consequent (Student Bonnie \u2228 Inactive Bonnie) holds.\n\nHowever, note: the antecedent is a disjunction. We can do case analysis.\n\nCase 1: \u00acY \u2228 \u00acW\n\nCase 2: Y \u2227 W \u2227 C\n\nWe need to show that in each case, Student Bonnie \u2228 Inactive Bonnie.\n\nBut note: we might not have enough information to prove this? Or perhaps we do.\n\nLet me sketch:\n\nFirst, we note from the context:\n\nPremise 2: Bonnie (as a member) is either Performs or Inactive.\n\nPremise 1: If she performs then she attends and is engaged -> then by the equivalence, she is a student.\n\nPremise 4: If she is inactive then she chaperones.\n\nPremise 3: If she chaperones then she is not a student.\n\nNow, the equivalence: (Attends Bonnie \u2227 Engaged Bonnie) \u2194 Student Bonnie.\n\nBut note: if she is inactive, then she chaperones (by P4), and then by P3 she is not a student. So if she is inactive, then \u00ac Student Bonnie. \n\nAlso, from the equivalence: if \u00ac Student Bonnie, then \u00ac (Attends \u2227 Engaged).\n\nBut the consequent we need to prove is: Student Bonnie \u2228 Inactive Bonnie.\n\nThis is equivalent to: \u00ac (\u00ac Student Bonnie \u2227 \u00ac Inactive Bonnie)\n\nSo if she is not inactive, what do we know? \n\nBy premise 2: either Performs or Inactive. Since not inactive, she performs.\n\nThen by premise 1: she attends and is engaged -> by equivalence she is a student.\n\nThus, if not inactive then she is a student.\n\nThat is: \u00ac Inactive Bonnie \u2192 Student Bonnie.\n\nWhich is exactly: Student Bonnie \u2228 Inactive Bonnie.\n\nSo actually, the consequent holds regardless of Bonnie's attributes! \n\nIf so, then the entire implication holds: because the consequent is always true.\n\nBut that seems too strong. Let me check:\n\nWe have proved: \n  Club Bonnie \u2192 (Student Bonnie \u2228 Inactive Bonnie)\n\nWe know Club Bonnie is true.\n\nSo indeed the consequent holds unconditionally.\n\nTherefore, the entire conditional statement is true, regardless of the antecedent.\n\nTherefore, the statement is always true.\n\nBut note: we must formalize the context to see this.\n\nSo our Lean model:\n\nWe define the type of people and a constant for Bonnie.\n\nWe define predicates:\n- Club: person \u2192 Prop\n- Performs: person \u2192 Prop       (performs in talent shows often)\n- Attends: person \u2192 Prop        (attends school events)\n- Engaged: person \u2192 Prop        (very engaged with school events)\n- Inactive: person \u2192 Prop       (inactive and disinterested community member)\n- Chaperones: person \u2192 Prop     (chaperones high school dances)\n- Student: person \u2192 Prop        (student who attends the school)\n- Young: person \u2192 Prop          (young child or teenager)\n- Wishes: person \u2192 Prop         (wishes to further academic career and opportunities)\n\nNow premises:\n\nP1: \u2200 p, Club p \u2192 Performs p \u2192 (Attends p \u2227 Engaged p)\nP2: \u2200 p, Club p \u2192 Performs p \u2228 Inactive p\nP3: \u2200 p, Club p \u2192 Chaperones p \u2192 \u00ac (Student p)\nP4: \u2200 p, Club p \u2192 Inactive p \u2192 Chaperones p\nP5: \u2200 p, Club p \u2192 Young p \u2192 Wishes p \u2192 Student p\n\nAnd about Bonnie:\naxiom Club_Bonnie : Club Bonnie\naxiom Bonnie_eq : (Attends Bonnie \u2227 Engaged Bonnie) \u2194 Student Bonnie\n\nNow we need to state the theorem:\n\nLet Y := Young Bonnie\nLet W := Wishes Bonnie\nLet C := Chaperones Bonnie\nLet S := Student Bonnie\nLet I := Inactive Bonnie\n\nTheorem: ( ( (Y \u2227 W) \u2227 C ) \u2228 \u00ac (Y \u2227 W) ) \u2192 (S \u2228 I)\n\nBut we know that from the argument above, S \u2228 I holds without the antecedent.\n\nWe can prove: Club Bonnie \u2192 S \u2228 I.\n\nIndeed, we do:\n\nProof:\n  From P2: Performs Bonnie \u2228 Inactive Bonnie.\n  Case 1: Inactive Bonnie \u2192 from P4, Chaperones Bonnie \u2192 from P3, \u00ac Student Bonnie. But we have I, so S \u2228 I holds (by the disjunction with I).\n  Case 2: Performs Bonnie \u2192 then by P1, Attends Bonnie \u2227 Engaged Bonnie \u2192 then by the equivalence (Bonnie_eq), we get Student Bonnie. So S holds, hence S \u2228 I holds.\n\nSo we can prove the consequent unconditionally.\n\nTherefore, the entire theorem holds.\n\nIn Lean:\n\nWe define the type and the predicates.\n\nThen we assume the axioms.\n\nFinally, we prove:\n\ntheorem bonnie_consequent : Student Bonnie \u2228 Inactive Bonnie := by \n  cases (P2 Bonnie Club_Bonnie) with\n  | inl perf => \n    have att_eng : Attends Bonnie \u2227 Engaged Bonnie := P1 Bonnie Club_Bonnie perf\n    rw [Bonnie_eq] at att_eng\n    exact Or.inl att_eng\n  | inr inact => exact Or.inr inact\n\nThen the statement we are to prove is:\n\ntheorem target : ((Young Bonnie \u2227 Wishes Bonnie) \u2227 Chaperones Bonnie) \u2228 \u00ac (Young Bonnie \u2227 Wishes Bonnie) \u2192 Student Bonnie \u2228 Inactive Bonnie := \n  fun _ => bonnie_consequent   -- because the consequent doesn't depend on the antecedent\n\nSo we can simply ignore the antecedent.\n\nLet's formalize.\n\nNote: We don't need P5?

The winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic was Steinhauer.\n2. Steinhauer participated in the 1992 du Maurier Classic.\n3. One six-way tie was on the leaderboard, and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium.\n4. Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic.\n5. All people on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic participated in the 1992 du Maurier Classic.\n\nWe are to evaluate: Descampe is in the six-way tie in the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic.\n\nLet's break down:\n\nWe have an event: the 1992 du Maurier Classic.\nWe define:\n- `obj` as the type of people (or golfers).\n- We have specific individuals: Steinhauer and Descampe.\n- We have properties and relations:\n  * `Winner` : a function that takes an event and returns a person? But note: the winner is of the event. However, the problem only talks about one event. Alternatively, we can fix the event and model the properties relative to that event.\n\nSince all statements are about the same event (1992 du Maurier Classic), we can model without parameterizing by event.\n\nLet's define:\n- `Person` : Type\n- `steinhauer : Person`\n- `descampe : Person`\n- `Winner : Person \u2192 Prop`  (but note: there is only one winner? Actually, the winner is Steinhauer. So we can have `winner` as a specific person? Or we can have a predicate `IsWinner`.)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the winner\", so there is exactly one winner? However, we are not told that there is only one winner. But in golf tournaments, there is typically one winner (unless a tie for first, but then they are co-winners). However, the problem states that there was a six-way tie on the leaderboard, but it doesn't say for first place. Moreover, we are told Steinhauer was the winner. So we can assume that Steinhauer is the winner and that there might be multiple winners? Actually, the problem doesn't say there is only one winner. But note: the winner is singular.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the winner as a specific person: we can have `winner : Person` and then an axiom that `winner = steinhauer`.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the winner\", implying there is one. However, the tie might be for a different position. So we don't know if the tie includes the winner or not.\n\nLet me re-read: \"one six-way tie was on the leaderboard\". The leaderboard typically includes multiple positions. The tie is for a particular position (i.e., six people tied for, say, 10th place). And one of those six was from Belgium.\n\nDescampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard. So we know Descampe is on the leaderboard and Belgian.\n\nWe are not told that there is only one Belgian on the leaderboard. So the fact that there is one person in the tie from Belgium does not necessarily imply that Descampe is that person, because there might be more than one Belgian on the leaderboard.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Descampe is in the tie.\n\nLet me formalize:\n\nWe define:\n- `Person` : Type\n- `steinhauer : Person`\n- `descampe : Person`\n- `IsWinner : Person \u2192 Prop`\n- `Participated : Person \u2192 Prop`\n- `OnLeaderboard : Person \u2192 Prop`\n- `FromBelgium : Person \u2192 Prop`\n\nAxioms:\n1. `IsWinner steinhauer`\n2. `Participated steinhauer`\n3. There exists a six-way tie. But note: we don't have a direct way to represent ties. Instead, we can say there is a set of six people who are tied? Actually, the problem says \"one six-way tie\", meaning there is a group of six people who are tied (for the same position). And one of them is from Belgium.\n\nWe can define:\n- `Tie : Set Person` (or `Tie : Person \u2192 Prop` as a predicate for being in the tie) but note: we are told there is one tie. However, we don't need to model the entire set theory. We can say:\n\nWe have a group of six people who are tied? Actually, the problem says \"one six-way tie\", meaning there is a tie consisting of six people. And we are told that one of them is from Belgium.\n\nSo:\n- `tie : Set Person` (but Lean doesn't have built-in set? We can use `List Person` or `Finset`? But we are not going to use any set operations. Alternatively, we can use a predicate `InTie : Person \u2192 Prop` and then axioms about it.\n\nBut note: we are not told that the tie is the only tie? We are told \"one six-way tie\", meaning there was one such tie. But there might be others? The problem doesn't say. However, we are only concerned with this tie.\n\nWe can introduce:\n- `InTie : Person \u2192 Prop`\n- Axiom: `\u2203 (p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 : Person), (\u2200 p, InTie p \u2194 p = p1 \u2228 p = p2 \u2228 p = p3 \u2228 p = p4 \u2228 p = p5 \u2228 p = p6) \u2227 p1 \u2260 p2 \u2227 ...` (all distinct) but that is messy.\n\nAlternatively, we can state:\n- There are exactly six people in the tie? Actually, we don't need the exact set, but we know:\n  * There is at least one person in the tie who is Belgian.\n  * And there are six people in the tie? Actually, we don't know the exact number? The problem says \"six-way tie\", meaning six people tied.\n\nBut we don't need the exact count for the conclusion? Actually, we don't. We only need to know that Descampe is in the tie.\n\nWe can have:\n- `InTie : Person \u2192 Prop`\n- Axiom: `\u2203 p : Person, InTie p \u2227 FromBelgium p`   (one person in the tie is from Belgium)\n- But note: we are not told that there are six people, but that doesn't matter for our purpose.\n\nHowever, we are also told that the tie is on the leaderboard. So every person in the tie is on the leaderboard.\n\nSo:\n- `\u2200 p, InTie p \u2192 OnLeaderboard p`\n\nAlso, we know:\n4. `FromBelgium descampe` and `OnLeaderboard descampe`\n5. `\u2200 p, OnLeaderboard p \u2192 Participated p`\n\nNow, we want to know: `InTie descampe`\n\nBut we don't have any axiom that says that Descampe is the only Belgian on the leaderboard? Or that the Belgian in the tie is the only Belgian? We are not told that.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Descampe is in the tie. There might be another Belgian on the leaderboard who is in the tie, and Descampe might be a different Belgian on the leaderboard (not in the tie).\n\nHence, the statement does not follow.\n\nBut wait: what if we assume that there is only one Belgian on the leaderboard? The problem doesn't say that. It says \"one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium\", meaning at least one. And we know Descampe is Belgian and on the leaderboard. So without the uniqueness, we cannot conclude.\n\nTherefore, we must answer Failure.\n\nHowever, let me formalize to see if we can prove it.\n\nWe'll set up the axioms and then try to prove `InTie descampe`.\n\nWe'll see that without the uniqueness of Belgians on the leaderboard, we cannot.\n\nFormalization:\n\n<lean>\naxiom Person : Type\naxiom steinhauer : Person\naxiom descampe : Person\n\naxiom IsWinner : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom Participated : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom OnLeaderboard : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FromBelgium : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom InTie : Person \u2192 Prop   -- being in that particular six-way tie\n\n-- Premises:\naxiom winner_steinhauer : IsWinner steinhauer\naxiom steinhauer_participated : Participated steinhauer\naxiom exists_belgian_in_tie : \u2203 p, InTie p \u2227 FromBelgium p\naxiom descampe_belgian : FromBelgium descampe\naxiom descampe_on_leaderboard : OnLeaderboard descampe\naxiom leaderboard_participated : \u2200 p, OnLeaderboard p \u2192 Participated p\n\n-- Also, we know that the tie is on the leaderboard:\naxiom tie_on_leaderboard : \u2200 p, InTie p \u2192 OnLeaderboard p\n\n-- We want to prove: InTie descampe\n\n-- But note: we don't have any axiom that says that the Belgian in the tie is the only Belgian on the leaderboard? \n-- Without that, we cannot conclude.\n\n-- Let's try to prove it and see if we can.\ntheorem descampe_in_tie : InTie descampe := \n  -- We know there exists a Belgian in the tie, say `p0`.\n  let \u27e8p0, h_p0_in_tie, h_p0_belgian\u27e9 := exists_belgian_in_tie\n  -- We know Descampe is Belgian and on the leaderboard, but we don't know if `p0` is Descampe.\n  -- We have no information that would force `p0 = descampe`.\n  -- Therefore, we cannot prove it.\n\n  -- We can try to use the fact that Descampe is on the leaderboard and Belgian, but without uniqueness, we cannot link to the tie.\n\n  -- Hence, we must admit failure.\n  sorry   -- This is unprovable.\n\n</lean>\n\nTherefore, the answer is Failure.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium\".

However, in logic problems, it is common to interpret \"one\" as \"at least one\" unless specified otherwise.\n\nMoreover, the problem does not say \"exactly one\" or \"only one\".

But the text says \"either ... or\", which in natural language often implies exclusive or. However, the problem does not explicitly say they are exclusive. We'll assume inclusive or unless we need exclusivity.\n\n4. \"If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.\"\n   \u2200x, (Employee(x) \u2227 HasLunchAtHome(x)) \u2192 WorksRemotelyFromHome(x)\n\n5. \"All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.\"\n   \u2200x, (Employee(x) \u2227 InOtherCountries(x)) \u2192 WorksRemotelyFromHome(x)\n\n6. \"No managers work remotely from home.\"\n   \u2200x, Manager(x) \u2192 \u00acWorksRemotelyFromHome(x)\n\n7. \"James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.\"\n   AppearsToday(James) \u2194 Manager(James)\n\nNow, the statement to evaluate is a biconditional (but note the text says \"if and only if\" implicitly by two implications? Actually, the text says two implications):\n\n   \"If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home.\" \n   and \n   \"If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries.\"\n\nBut note: the second part is the contrapositive of the first? Actually, the first part is:\n   (Manager(James) \u2228 InOtherCountries(James)) \u2192 \u00ac(HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome(James))\n\nThe second part is:\n   (HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome(James)) \u2192 (\u00acManager(James) \u2227 \u00acInOtherCountries(James))\n\nObserve that the second part is equivalent to:\n   (HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome(James)) \u2192 \u00ac(Manager(James) \u2228 InOtherCountries(James))\n\nSo the entire statement is:\n   (Manager(James) \u2228 InOtherCountries(James)) \u2194 \u00ac(HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome(James))\n\nBut wait, that doesn't look right because the right-hand side is negated. Alternatively, note that the two implications together form a contrapositive pair? Actually, they form an equivalence:\n\n   A \u2192 B   and   \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA   is the contrapositive of the first, but here we have:\n\n   A \u2192 \u00acC   and   C \u2192 \u00acA   where A = (Manager(James) \u2228 InOtherCountries(James)) and C = (HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome(James))\n\nBut note: the second implication is: C \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nSo we have A \u2192 \u00acC and C \u2192 \u00acA, which together mean A \u2194 \u00acC.\n\nTherefore, the statement to prove is:\n   (Manager(James) \u2228 InOtherCountries(James)) \u2194 \u00ac(HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome(James))\n\nBut note: the problem says \"James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home\", which is \u00ac(HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome(James)).\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the statement to evaluate is presented as two implications, but they are equivalent to the biconditional.\n\nNow, we need to see if this biconditional follows from the premises.\n\nWe are going to introduce James as a constant. Also, we note that James is an employee? The premises talk about employees and managers. We are told about James: he is either a manager or in other countries? But we don't know if James is an employee. However, the context of the problem is about employees. The premises mention \"employees\", \"managers\", and James. We must assume that James is an employee? The problem does not explicitly say, but the statement about James being a manager implies that he is an employee? Or does it? Managers are typically employees. Also, the premises about \"employees\" and then \"managers\" (who are a subset of employees) suggest that James is an employee.\n\nBut note: the premise \"No managers work remotely from home\" does not specify that managers are employees. However, the context is about employees. We must assume that managers are employees? Otherwise, we cannot relate.\n\nSimilarly, the premise about James: \"James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager\" - this implies that James is a manager? Or not? It doesn't say he is an employee. However, without James being an employee, we cannot use the employee premises.\n\nGiven the context, I think we must assume that James is an employee. Otherwise, the premises about employees wouldn't apply to him.\n\nSo let's add:\n   Employee(James)\n\nNow, let's formalize the premises.\n\nWe'll define:\n- `Employee` : a predicate for being an employee.\n- `SchedulesMeeting` : schedules a meeting with customers.\n- `GoesToBuilding` : goes to the company building today.\n- `HasLunchInBuilding` : has lunch in the company building.\n- `HasLunchAtHome` : has lunch at home.\n- `WorksRemotelyFromHome` : works remotely from home.\n- `InOtherCountries` : is in other countries.\n- `Manager` : is a manager.\n\nAnd we have the constant `James`.\n\nPremises:\n\n1. \u2200x, Employee(x) \u2192 (SchedulesMeeting(x) \u2192 GoesToBuilding(x))\n   But note: the premise says \"All employees who schedule a meeting ...\", so we can write:\n      \u2200x, (Employee(x) \u2227 SchedulesMeeting(x)) \u2192 GoesToBuilding(x)\n\n   Alternatively, we can write:\n      \u2200x, Employee(x) \u2192 (SchedulesMeeting(x) \u2192 GoesToBuilding(x))\n\n   These are equivalent.\n\n2. \u2200x, HasLunchInBuilding(x) \u2192 SchedulesMeeting(x)\n   Note: this doesn't specify that x is an employee? But the context is about employees. However, the premise says \"Everyone\", which might include non-employees? But the next premise restricts to employees. We'll assume that the domain is employees? Or we can make the domain general and then restrict with Employee? The problem doesn't specify. We'll let the domain be arbitrary, but the premises are about employees and managers.\n\n   Actually, the problem says \"All employees\", \"Everyone\" (which in context probably means every employee), etc. So we'll assume that all the predicates are applied to employees. But note: the second premise says \"Everyone who has lunch in the company building\" - this might include non-employees? However, the third premise says \"Employees have lunch ...\", so we can assume that having lunch in the building is only for employees? We'll formalize without restricting the domain arbitrarily, but we'll use the predicates with the understanding that they apply to employees.\n\n   However, to be safe, we'll let the domain be a type `obj` and then use predicates.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n   axiom P1 : \u2200 x : obj, (Employee x \u2227 SchedulesMeeting x) \u2192 GoesToBuilding x\n\n   But note: the premise does not say that the person must be an employee? Actually, it says \"All employees who ...\", so it's conditional on being an employee. So we must have Employee x as part of the antecedent.\n\n   Similarly, premise 2: \"Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings\" - we don't know if non-employees can have lunch in the building? But the context is about employees. We'll assume that the domain of discourse is employees? Or we can restrict the quantifiers to employees? Alternatively, we can note that the third premise says employees have lunch in one of two places, so we can assume that if someone has lunch in the building, they are an employee? But the premise doesn't say that. However, without loss of generality, we can assume that the only people we are talking about are employees? The problem doesn't mention non-employees. So we'll let the universe be arbitrary, but we'll use the predicates only as stated.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define:\n\n   axiom P2 : \u2200 x : obj, HasLunchInBuilding x \u2192 SchedulesMeeting x\n\n   And then we'll have to use the fact that if someone has lunch in the building, they might be an employee? Actually, the third premise says that employees have lunch either in the building or at home. It doesn't say that non-employees don't. But then we cannot reason about non-employees. Since James is an employee, we can focus on employees.\n\n   We'll proceed and hope that we don't need non-employees.\n\n3. \u2200x, Employee x \u2192 (HasLunchInBuilding x \u2228 HasLunchAtHome x)\n\n   And we also note that the problem doesn't say these are exclusive, so we cannot assume that if someone has lunch in the building, they don't have lunch at home? But that would be strange. However, the natural language \"either ... or\" often means exclusive or. But the problem doesn't specify. We'll assume inclusive or.\n\n   However, note the next premise: if they have lunch at home, then they work remotely. And if they have lunch in the building, then they schedule meetings, which leads to going to the building.\n\n   Also, we don't have an explicit exclusion, so we must be cautious.\n\n4. \u2200x, Employee x \u2192 (HasLunchAtHome x \u2192 WorksRemotelyFromHome x)\n\n5. \u2200x, Employee x \u2192 (InOtherCountries x \u2192 WorksRemotelyFromHome x)\n\n6. \u2200x, Manager x \u2192 \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome x\n\n   Also, note: managers are employees? The problem doesn't explicitly say, but we can assume that managers are employees. Otherwise, premise 6 would not relate to the other premises. So we add:\n\n   axiom Manager_imp_Employee : \u2200x, Manager x \u2192 Employee x\n\n   Alternatively, we can assume that whenever we talk about a manager, we are talking about an employee. But without this, we cannot use the premises about employees. So we'll add this.\n\n7. AppearsToday James \u2194 Manager James\n\n   Note: \"appears in the company today\" probably means the same as \"goes to the company building today\". So we can equate `AppearsToday` with `GoesToBuilding`. Therefore, we can write:\n\n   axiom P7 : GoesToBuilding James \u2194 Manager James\n\n   But note: the premise says \"James will appear in the company today\", which we take as `GoesToBuilding James`.\n\nNow, we want to prove:\n\n   (Manager James \u2228 InOtherCountries James) \u2194 \u00ac (HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James)\n\nBut note: the right-hand side is equivalent to:\n   \u00ac HasLunchAtHome James \u2227 \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome James\n\nSo we can break the biconditional into two directions.\n\nDirection 1: (Manager James \u2228 InOtherCountries James) \u2192 \u00ac (HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James)\n\nDirection 2: \u00ac (HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James) \u2192 (Manager James \u2228 InOtherCountries James)\n\nHowever, we must check if we can prove both.\n\nLet's try to prove direction 1.\n\nAssume: Manager James \u2228 InOtherCountries James.\n\nWe need to show: \u00ac (HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James)\n\nWhich is: \u00ac HasLunchAtHome James \u2227 \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome James.\n\nCase 1: Manager James.\n   By premise 6: Manager James \u2192 \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome James. So we have \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome James.\n   Now, we need to show \u00ac HasLunchAtHome James.\n\n   Suppose, for contradiction, that HasLunchAtHome James.\n   Since James is an employee (because Manager James implies Employee James, by our added axiom), then by premise 4: \n        HasLunchAtHome James \u2192 WorksRemotelyFromHome James.\n   But we have \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome James and WorksRemotelyFromHome James, contradiction.\n\n   Therefore, \u00ac HasLunchAtHome James.\n\nCase 2: InOtherCountries James.\n   By premise 5: InOtherCountries James \u2192 WorksRemotelyFromHome James (since James is an employee).\n   But we also need to show \u00ac (HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James) -> but wait, we are assuming InOtherCountries James, so we have WorksRemotelyFromHome James. Then the disjunction HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James is true (because of WorksRemotelyFromHome James). But we are trying to show it is false? Contradiction.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot have InOtherCountries James leading to the right-hand side? \n\nWait, let me reexamine:\n\nWe are assuming InOtherCountries James, and we want to show \u00ac (HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James). But from InOtherCountries James, we get WorksRemotelyFromHome James (by premise 5). Therefore, the disjunction is true. But we want it to be false. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, direction 1 fails in the case of InOtherCountries James.\n\nBut wait, the statement to evaluate says: \"If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home.\"\n\nBut if James is in other countries, then by premise 5 he works remotely from home, so he does work remotely from home. Therefore, the disjunction \"has lunch at home or work remotely from home\" is true (because of the second part). Therefore, the consequent \"does not\" is false. So the implication fails when James is in other countries.\n\nTherefore, the entire statement to evaluate is not necessarily true? But note: the problem asks us to evaluate the statement, meaning to see if it follows from the premises.\n\nHowever, we have a counterexample: suppose James is in other countries. Then:\n   - He works remotely from home (by premise 5).\n   - Therefore, the disjunction (HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James) is true.\n   - The consequent says: James does not (has lunch at home or work remotely from home) -> false.\n   - The antecedent is true (because he is in other countries).\n   - So the implication is false.\n\nTherefore, the statement does not hold.\n\nBut wait, let me check the premises again. Is there any premise that prevents James from being in other countries and being a manager? Premise 6 says no manager works remotely from home. Premise 5 says if in other countries, then works remotely from home. So if James is both a manager and in other countries, we have a contradiction: he would have to work remotely and not work remotely.\n\nTherefore, the premises imply that James cannot be both a manager and in other countries.\n\nSo let's revisit direction 1:\n\nAssume Manager James \u2228 InOtherCountries James.\n\nCase 1: Manager James. Then we showed \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome James and \u00ac HasLunchAtHome James (by contradiction). So the consequent holds.\n\nCase 2: InOtherCountries James. Then we have WorksRemotelyFromHome James (by premise 5). But we also have, from the disjunction, that he is not a manager (because if he were, we'd have a contradiction). But wait, we don't have that he is not a manager? We have that he is in other countries. And premise 6 says managers don't work remotely. So if he is in other countries and works remotely, then he cannot be a manager? Because if he were a manager, then we would have both WorksRemotelyFromHome James and \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome James.\n\nTherefore, from InOtherCountries James, we can deduce that James is not a manager.\n\nBut now, we need to show \u00ac (HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James). However, we have WorksRemotelyFromHome James (from premise 5), so the disjunction is true. Therefore, we cannot show that it is false.\n\nSo the consequent fails.\n\nAlternatively, note: the consequent is \"does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home\", meaning he does not do at least one of these? Actually, the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations. So we need him to not have lunch at home AND not work remotely.\n\nBut we have him working remotely (because he is in other countries). So we cannot have him not working remotely.\n\nTherefore, direction 1 fails.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home\" -> this is ambiguous. The intended meaning is: James does not (have lunch at home or work remotely from home). So it's \u00ac(A\u2228B).\n\nSo in the case of InOtherCountries, we have B (WorksRemotelyFromHome) true, so \u00ac(A\u2228B) is false.\n\nTherefore, the implication fails for InOtherCountries.\n\nBut note: the premises imply that if James is in other countries, then he is not a manager? And we don't have any premise that says he must be a manager? So we can have James in other countries and not a manager. Then the antecedent is true (because he is in other countries) and the consequent is false (because he works remotely). So the implication is false.\n\nTherefore, the entire biconditional fails.\n\nBut wait, the problem states two implications. The second implication is:\n\n   If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor in other countries.\n\nLet's check that:\n\nAssume: HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James.\n\nWe need to show: \u00acManager James \u2227 \u00acInOtherCountries James.\n\nCase 1: HasLunchAtHome James.\n   Then by premise 4: WorksRemotelyFromHome James (since James is an employee).\n   Now, by premise 6: if he were a manager, then \u00acWorksRemotelyFromHome James -> contradiction. So \u00acManager James.\n   Now, we need to show \u00acInOtherCountries James.\n   Suppose he is in other countries. Then by premise 5: WorksRemotelyFromHome James -> which we already have. But also, if he is in other countries, that doesn't contradict anything else? So we don't have a contradiction? Therefore, we cannot conclude \u00acInOtherCountries James.\n\nCase 2: WorksRemotelyFromHome James (without having lunch at home). Then similarly, if he is a manager, we get contradiction -> \u00acManager James.\n   But again, we don't know about InOtherCountries. He could be in other countries? And premise 5 says if he is in other countries then he works remotely, which we have. So we have no contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that he is not in other countries.\n\nSo the second implication fails.\n\nThus, the entire statement does not follow from the premises.\n\nBut note: we haven't used all the premises. We haven't used premises 1, 2, 3, and 7? Maybe we need them.\n\nLet me try to see if we can derive more.\n\nFrom premise 3: James is an employee, so he either has lunch in the building or at home.\n\nIf he has lunch in the building, then by premise 2: he schedules meetings, then by premise 1: he goes to the building.\n\nBut we have premise 7: James goes to the building if and only if he is a manager.\n\nSo if James has lunch in the building, then he goes to the building, so he is a manager.\n\nThen by premise 6: he does not work remotely.\n\nAlso, if he has lunch at home, then by premise 4: he works remotely.\n\nNow, what if he works remotely? Then he cannot be a manager (by premise 6). Therefore, by premise 7, he does not go to the building.\n\nBut note: if he has lunch in the building, then he goes to the building, so he is a manager, so he doesn't work remotely.\n\nNow, what about being in other countries? Premise 5: if he is in other countries, then he works remotely. And if he works remotely, then he is not a manager (by premise 6), so by premise 7 he does not go to the building.\n\nBut if he is in other countries, he cannot go to the building? That makes sense.\n\nNow, let's try to prove the second implication again:\n\nAssume: HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James.\n\nWe need to show: \u00acManager James \u2227 \u00acInOtherCountries James.\n\nWe already know that if he has lunch at home, then he works remotely (by premise 4). So in both cases of the disjunction, we have WorksRemotelyFromHome James.\n\nTherefore, we have WorksRemotelyFromHome James.\n\nThen, by premise 6: \u00acManager James.\n\nNow, we need to show \u00acInOtherCountries James.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that InOtherCountries James.\n\nThen by premise 5: WorksRemotelyFromHome James -> which we already have. But note: we don't have a contradiction yet.\n\nIs there any premise that says if you work remotely then you are in other countries? No, premise 5 only says if you are in other countries then you work remotely, not the converse.\n\nAlso, we have premise 3: James has lunch either in the building or at home.\n\nIf he is in other countries, then he works remotely. But does that force him to have lunch at home? Not necessarily. He could have lunch in the building? But if he is in other countries, can he have lunch in the building? Probably not. But the premises don't say that.\n\nWe don't have a premise that says if you are in other countries, you cannot have lunch in the building. So we cannot rule out that he is in other countries and has lunch in the building? But that would require him to go to the building (if he has lunch in the building, then he schedules meetings, then he goes to the building). But if he is in other countries, he cannot go to the building? The problem doesn't say that explicitly.\n\nWe have: if he is in other countries, he works remotely from home. But does that prevent him from going to the building? The problem doesn't say.\n\nTherefore, we cannot derive a contradiction from InOtherCountries James and WorksRemotelyFromHome James.\n\nSo we cannot conclude \u00acInOtherCountries James.\n\nThus, the second implication fails.\n\nSimilarly, the first implication fails as we saw.\n\nTherefore, the entire statement does not follow.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries.\" \n\nWe can show he is not a manager, but not that he is not in other countries.\n\nSo we cannot prove the statement.\n\nTherefore, we return Failure.\n\nHowever, let me try to see if we can prove the first part under the assumption that James is not both a manager and in other countries.\n\nBut the premises do not rule out James being in other countries and not a manager. And in that case, the first implication fails.\n\nSimilarly, the second implication fails because we cannot rule out that James is in other countries and works remotely (which is consistent) and then he would be in other countries, so the consequent \"neither a manager nor in other countries\" would be false.\n\nTherefore, the statement does not follow.\n\nWe'll now write the Lean code to formalize the premises and then attempt to prove the biconditional. We expect it to fail.\n\nNote: We must include the domain and all predicates.\n\nWe'll define:\n  obj : Type\n  James : obj\n  Employee : obj \u2192 Prop\n  SchedulesMeeting : obj \u2192 Prop\n  GoesToBuilding : obj \u2192 Prop   // same as appears in the company today\n  HasLunchInBuilding : obj \u2192 Prop\n  HasLunchAtHome : obj \u2192 Prop\n  WorksRemotelyFromHome : obj \u2192 Prop\n  InOtherCountries : obj \u2192 Prop\n  Manager : obj \u2192 Prop\n\nPremises:\n\naxiom P1 : \u2200 x : obj, Employee x \u2192 (SchedulesMeeting x \u2192 GoesToBuilding x)\n// Alternatively, we could write: \u2200 x, (Employee x \u2227 SchedulesMeeting x) \u2192 GoesToBuilding x\n// But they are equivalent.\n\naxiom P2 : \u2200 x : obj, HasLunchInBuilding x \u2192 SchedulesMeeting x\n\naxiom P3 : \u2200 x : obj, Employee x \u2192 HasLunchInBuilding x \u2228 HasLunchAtHome x\n\naxiom P4 : \u2200 x : obj, Employee x \u2192 (HasLunchAtHome x \u2192 WorksRemotelyFromHome x)\n\naxiom P5 : \u2200 x : obj, Employee x \u2192 (InOtherCountries x \u2192 WorksRemotelyFromHome x)\n\n// We assume that managers are employees\naxiom Manager_imp_Employee : \u2200 x : obj, Manager x \u2192 Employee x\n\naxiom P6 : \u2200 x : obj, Manager x \u2192 \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome x\n\naxiom P7 : GoesToBuilding James \u2194 Manager James\n\n// We also need to know that James is an employee? We don't have that explicitly.\n// But without it, we cannot use the employee premises. The problem doesn't state that James is an employee. \n// However, the context is about employees. The statement about James being a manager implies he is an employee? \n// Because we have Manager_imp_Employee. But if James is not an employee, then P7 still holds? \n// But the premises about employees wouldn't apply. \n\n// We must assume James is an employee? Otherwise, we cannot use P3, P4, P5 on James.\n\n// How can we get that James is an employee? \n// From P7: if James is a manager, then by Manager_imp_Employee he is an employee. \n// But if he is not a manager, then we don't know. However, the problem says \"James will appear ... if and only if he is a manager\". \n// And appearing (GoesToBuilding) is defined for everyone? But the premises about employees are only for employees.\n\n// We are in trouble if James is not an employee. So we must assume that James is an employee.\n\n// Let's add:\naxiom James_employee : Employee James\n\nNow, the goal is to prove:\n\n   (Manager James \u2228 InOtherCountries James) \u2194 \u00ac (HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James)\n\nBut as we saw, we cannot prove it.\n\nWe can try to prove one direction and see where it fails.\n\nIn Lean, we can try to prove the theorem and if we get stuck, we can admit failure.\n\nBut note: we are not required to write a proof if it fails. We just output Failure.\n\nTherefore, after careful analysis, we conclude that the statement does not follow.\n\nSo we output Failure.\n\nHowever, let me try to prove the second part of the biconditional:\n\n   (HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James) \u2192 \u00ac (Manager James \u2228 InOtherCountries James)\n\nWe can break this into:\n\n   (HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James) \u2192 (\u00ac Manager James \u2227 \u00ac InOtherCountries James)\n\nWe can try:\n\n  have h1 : \u00ac Manager James := by \n      intro hM\n      have h_no_remote : \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome James := P6 James hM\n      cases' h with\n      | inl h_lunch_home => \n          have h_remote : WorksRemotelyFromHome James := P4 James James_employee h_lunch_home\n          contradiction\n      | inr h_remote => contradiction\n\nSo we can prove \u00acManager James.\n\nBut how to prove \u00acInOtherCountries James?\n\nWe have no way. We can assume InOtherCountries James and then derive WorksRemotelyFromHome James (by P5) and we already have WorksRemotelyFromHome James from the disjunction? But that's consistent. There's no contradiction.\n\nSo we cannot prove \u00acInOtherCountries James.\n\nTherefore, the theorem does not hold.\n\nHence, we return Failure.\n\nNow, we write the Lean code with the axioms and then state the theorem and then admit that we cannot prove it.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"If you can prove it, give me True at the end of the answer. If you cannot prove it, give me Failure\".\n\nSo we write the Lean code and then at the end, we say ANSWER: Failure.\n\nBut note: we must wrap the Lean code in <lean> tags.\n\nLet's write the Lean code:\n", "prediction": "Failure", "parse_status": "SUCCESS", "lean_code": "axiom obj : Type\naxiom James : obj\naxiom Employee : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom SchedulesMeeting : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom GoesToBuilding : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom HasLunchInBuilding : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom HasLunchAtHome : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom WorksRemotelyFromHome : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom InOtherCountries : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Manager : obj \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom P1 : \u2200 x : obj, Employee x \u2192 (SchedulesMeeting x \u2192 GoesToBuilding x)\naxiom P2 : \u2200 x : obj, HasLunchInBuilding x \u2192 SchedulesMeeting x\naxiom P3 : \u2200 x : obj, Employee x \u2192 HasLunchInBuilding x \u2228 HasLunchAtHome x\naxiom P4 : \u2200 x : obj, Employee x \u2192 (HasLunchAtHome x \u2192 WorksRemotelyFromHome x)\naxiom P5 : \u2200 x : obj, Employee x \u2192 (InOtherCountries x \u2192 WorksRemotelyFromHome x)\naxiom Manager_imp_Employee : \u2200 x : obj, Manager x \u2192 Employee x\naxiom P6 : \u2200 x : obj, Manager x \u2192 \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome x\naxiom P7 : GoesToBuilding James \u2194 Manager James\naxiom James_employee : Employee James\n\n-- Attempt to prove the biconditional statement\ntheorem target : (Manager James \u2228 InOtherCountries James) \u2194 \u00ac(HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James) := \n  Iff.intro\n    (fun h : Manager James \u2228 InOtherCountries James =>\n      Or.elim h\n        (fun hM : Manager James =>\n          have no_remote : \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome James := P6 James hM\n          have no_lunch_home : \u00ac HasLunchAtHome James := by\n            intro hLunchHome\n            have remote : WorksRemotelyFromHome James := P4 James James_employee hLunchHome\n            contradiction\n          show \u00ac(HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James) from \n            fun hOr => Or.elim hOr (fun hl => no_lunch_home hl) (fun hr => no_remote hr))\n        (fun hO : InOtherCountries James =>\n          have remote : WorksRemotelyFromHome James := P5 James James_employee hO\n          show \u00ac(HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James) from \n            fun hOr => Or.elim hOr (fun _ => remote) (fun hr => hr) remote  -- Contradiction attempt fails here\n          ))\n    (fun not_home_or_remote : \u00ac(HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James) =>\n      have not_remote : \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome James := fun hr => not_home_or_remote (Or.inr hr)\n      have not_manager : \u00ac Manager James := fun hM => \n        P6 James hM (P4 James James_employee ?_)  -- Cannot establish HasLunchAtHome James\n      have not_other_countries : \u00ac InOtherCountries James := fun hO => \n        not_remote (P5 James James_employee hO)\n      show Manager James \u2228 InOtherCountries James from \n        Or.inl ?_  -- Cannot prove Manager James\n      sorry)  -- Proof incomplete at multiple points", "lean_verification": {"success": false, "env": 3, "errors": ["Function expected at\n  Or.elim hOr (fun x => remote) fun hr => hr\nbut this term has type\n  WorksRemotelyFromHome James\n\nNote: Expected a function because this term is being applied to the argument\n  remote", "Function expected at\n  Or.inl ?m.35\nbut this term has type\n  ?m.33 \u2228 ?m.34\n\nNote: Expected a function because this term is being applied to the argument\n  sorry"], "warnings": [], "all_messages": [{"severity": "error", "data": "Function expected at\n  Or.elim hOr (fun x => remote) fun hr => hr\nbut this term has type\n  WorksRemotelyFromHome James\n\nNote: Expected a function because this term is being applied to the argument\n  remote"}, {"severity": "error", "data": "Function expected at\n  Or.inl ?m.35\nbut this term has type\n  ?m.33 \u2228 ?m.34\n\nNote: Expected a function because this term is being applied to the argument\n  sorry"}]}, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 597, "completion_tokens": 7719, "total_tokens": 8316}}, {"iteration": 2, "llm_response": "After analyzing the premises and the statement to evaluate, it is determined that the biconditional cannot be proven.

The errors in the code are due to incorrect proof construction.\n\n Let's break down the statement:\n \"If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James does not either have lunch at home or work remotely from home.\"\n And conversely:\n \"If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries.\"\n\n However, note the contrapositive is mentioned as more natural. But we must prove the biconditional.\n\n The errors in the forward direction for the case when James is in other countries:\n   We have: \n     hO : InOtherCountries James\n     remote : WorksRemotelyFromHome James   [from P5]\n   We want to show: \u00ac(HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James)\n\n   But note: the disjunction includes WorksRemotelyFromHome James, which we have (remote). So we cannot show the negation.\n\n This suggests that the statement might not hold. However, let's reexamine the premises.\n\n Alternatively, note that the statement to evaluate is actually two implications that form a biconditional. But the second part of the biconditional (the converse) might be provable.\n\n However, the error in the code for the case of InOtherCountries is that we are trying to derive a contradiction by having both the disjunction and the fact that remote holds. But the disjunction includes remote, so we cannot get a contradiction that way.\n\n Actually, the negation of (A \u2228 B) is \u00acA \u2227 \u00acB. But in our case, we are trying to show \u00ac(HasLunchAtHome \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome) which is equivalent to \u00acHasLunchAtHome \u2227 \u00acWorksRemotelyFromHome.\n\n But when James is in other countries, we have WorksRemotelyFromHome James (by P5). So we cannot have \u00acWorksRemotelyFromHome James. Therefore, the forward direction fails when James is in other countries.\n\n Therefore, the entire biconditional is not provable.\n\n However, let's check the premises again:\n\n Premises:\n   P1: All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.\n   P2: Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.\n   P3: Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.\n   P4: If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.\n   P5: All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.\n   P6: No managers work remotely from home.\n   P7: James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.\n\n Also, we have James_employee: Employee James.\n\n Now, the statement to evaluate is:\n   (Manager James \u2228 InOtherCountries James) \u2194 \u00ac(HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James)\n\n But note: if James is in other countries, then by P5 he works remotely from home. So the right-hand side requires that he does not work remotely from home, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the forward implication fails when James is in other countries.\n\n However, wait: the right-hand side is \u00ac(HasLunchAtHome \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome). If James is in other countries, then WorksRemotelyFromHome James is true, so the disjunction is true, and its negation is false. But the left-hand side is true (because he is in other countries). So we have true \u2192 false, which is false.\n\n Therefore, the biconditional is false.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Statement to evaluate\" and then gives two implications that are actually contrapositives of each other? Actually, the two implications together form a biconditional.\n\n However, the first implication is:\n   If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James does not either have lunch at home or work remotely from home.\n\n The second implication is:\n   If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries.\n\n But note: the second implication is the contrapositive of the first? Actually, the first implication is:\n   (M \u2228 C) \u2192 \u00ac(L \u2228 R)\n\n The contrapositive of this is:\n   (L \u2228 R) \u2192 \u00ac(M \u2228 C)   [which is equivalent to (L\u2228R) \u2192 (\u00acM \u2227 \u00acC)]\n\n And the second implication is exactly: \n   If (L\u2228R) then (\u00acM \u2227 \u00acC)\n\n So the two implications together are equivalent to the biconditional.\n\n But we have found a counterexample: when James is in other countries (so M\u2228C is true) but then R is true (because he is in other countries) so L\u2228R is true, and hence \u00ac(L\u2228R) is false.\n\n Therefore, the biconditional is false.\n\n However, let's check if there is a way to avoid this. Is it possible for James to be in other countries and not work remotely? No, because P5 says if he is in other countries then he works remotely.\n\n Also, note that if James is in other countries, then he is an employee (by James_employee) and by P5 he works remotely.\n\n Therefore, the forward implication fails.\n\n But wait: what if we interpret the statement differently? The problem says \"James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.\" (P7). If James is in other countries, can he appear in the company? Probably not. But note P7 says: GoesToBuilding James \u2194 Manager James.\n\n Also, note P1: if an employee schedules a meeting then they go to the building. And P2: if they have lunch in the building then they schedule a meeting.\n\n Now, if James is in other countries, then he cannot be going to the building? Because by P7, going to the building only if he is a manager. But if he is in other countries, he is not a manager? Not necessarily: he could be a manager in other countries? But note P6: no managers work remotely. So if he is a manager, he cannot work remotely. But if he is in other countries, then by P5 he must work remotely. So if he is both a manager and in other countries, we have a contradiction.\n\n Therefore, it is impossible for James to be both a manager and in other countries.\n\n So the disjunction (Manager James \u2228 InOtherCountries James) is exclusive? Actually, it is impossible for both to be true.\n\n But even then, if James is in other countries (and not a manager, to avoid contradiction), then we have:\n   Left: true (because InOtherCountries James)\n   Right: \u00ac(HasLunchAtHome James \u2228 WorksRemotelyFromHome James)\n   But we have WorksRemotelyFromHome James (by P5) so the disjunction (L\u2228R) is true (because R is true) and hence the negation is false.\n\n Therefore, the forward implication fails.\n\n So the biconditional is not true.\n\n However, let's try to prove the two implications separately to see if we can salvage one.\n\n First implication: (M \u2228 C) \u2192 \u00ac(L \u2228 R)\n   Case M: \n        Then by P6: \u00acR.\n        Also, if he is a manager, then he is an employee (by Manager_imp_Employee). By P3, he either has lunch in building or at home.\n        But if he has lunch at home, then by P4 he works remotely, which contradicts P6. So he must have lunch in building -> \u00acL.\n        Therefore, \u00acL and \u00acR -> \u00ac(L\u2228R). So the case M holds.\n\n   Case C:\n        Then by P5: R.\n        Then L\u2228R is true, so \u00ac(L\u2228R) is false. Therefore, the implication fails.\n\n Second implication: (L\u2228R) \u2192 (\u00acM \u2227 \u00acC)\n   We assume L\u2228R and want to show \u00acM and \u00acC.\n\n   For \u00acM: \n        If M, then by P6 \u00acR. But we have L\u2228R. If R, then contradiction. If L, then by P4 (since James is an employee) we get R, which again contradicts \u00acR. So \u00acM.\n\n   For \u00acC:\n        If C, then by P5 we get R. Then L\u2228R is true (by R). But we have L\u2228R already. However, we want to show \u00acC? We assume C and we have R, but that doesn't directly contradict anything. However, note we have \u00acM from above? But we don't have any contradiction for \u00acC.\n\n        Actually, we don't have a premise that says if you are in other countries then you are not in the building? But note: if James is in other countries, then he cannot be going to the building? But we don't have that as a premise. We have P7: GoesToBuilding James \u2194 Manager James. And we have \u00acM (from above) so GoesToBuilding James is false. But that doesn't contradict being in other countries.\n\n        Moreover, note that if James is in other countries, he might still have lunch at home? But we don't have a premise that says if you are in other countries then you must have lunch at home? Actually, P5 only says he works remotely, but not about lunch.\n\n        However, we have P3: he must have lunch either in building or at home. But if he is in other countries, he cannot have lunch in the building? We don't have that premise. So it's possible that he has lunch in the building even if he is in other countries? That doesn't make sense, but we don't have a premise against it.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot derive \u00acC from L\u2228R.\n\n        Specifically, assume James is in other countries (C). Then by P5, R is true. Then L\u2228R is true. But we want to show \u00acC, which would be false. So the implication (L\u2228R)\u2192\u00acC fails.\n\n        Also, note that we have \u00acM (as above) but that doesn't help.\n\n Therefore, the second implication also fails.\n\n But wait, the second implication is: (L\u2228R) \u2192 (\u00acM \u2227 \u00acC). We have shown \u00acM, but we cannot show \u00acC.\n\n So the entire biconditional is false.\n\n However, note the problem says \"Statement to evaluate\" and then gives two implications. But if we interpret the statement as a whole (the biconditional), it is false.\n\n But let me check if there is a possibility that the premises force that if James is in other countries then he must have lunch at home? Then we would have L, and then R by P4? But we already have R by P5, so no new information.\n\n And note: we don't have any premise that says if you are in other countries then you have lunch at home. So we cannot derive \u00ac(L\u2228R) in the case of C.\n\n Therefore, we must conclude that the statement is not provable.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries.\" But we have a counterexample: James is in other countries. Then he works remotely (R) so L\u2228R is true. But he is in other countries (so the conclusion says he is not in other countries? which is false). Therefore, the second implication is false.\n\n Similarly, the first implication fails when James is in other countries.\n\n Therefore, the biconditional is false.\n\n But the problem asks to prove the statement. Since we found a counterexample (James in other countries), we cannot prove it.\n\n However, note: we have not considered the other premises. For example, if James is in other countries, can he schedule a meeting? And then by P1, he would go to the building? But if he is in other countries, he cannot go to the building? But we have P7: he goes to the building iff he is a manager. And if he is in other countries and not a manager (to avoid contradiction with P6 and P5), then he doesn't go to the building. \n\n But P2: if he has lunch in the building then he schedules a meeting. But if he is in other countries, he cannot have lunch in the building? We don't have that premise. So it's possible that he has lunch in the building even if he is in other countries? That seems absurd, but the premises don't forbid it.\n\n Alternatively, note that if he is in other countries and he has lunch in the building, then by P2 he schedules a meeting, then by P1 he goes to the building, then by P7 he is a manager. But then we have a manager who is in other countries, which by P5 must work remotely, but by P6 cannot work remotely -> contradiction.\n\n Therefore, if James is in other countries, he cannot have lunch in the building. Then by P3, he must have lunch at home. Then by P4, he works remotely. Which we already have from P5.\n\n But note: the contradiction we just found is if he is in other countries and he has lunch in the building. But we just argued that he cannot have lunch in the building. So he must have lunch at home.\n\n However, that doesn't change the fact that he works remotely (which we already know). So we still have R true, so L\u2228R is true.\n\n Therefore, the forward implication still fails: we have (M\u2228C) true (because C) and we want \u00ac(L\u2228R) but L\u2228R is true.\n\n So the biconditional is false.\n\n Therefore, we cannot prove it.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"No managers work remotely from home.\" and \"All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.\" So if James is both a manager and in other countries, we get a contradiction. Therefore, it is impossible for James to be both. So the disjunction is exclusive.\n\n But even then, when James is in other countries (and not a manager), we have:\n   Left: true (because C)\n   Right: \u00ac(L\u2228R) \n   But R is true (because C) so L\u2228R is true, so \u00ac(L\u2228R) is false.\n\n Therefore, the forward implication fails.\n\n Hence, the statement is not provable.\n\n But note: the problem says \"James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.\" If James is in other countries, he cannot appear in the company? So we have \u00acGoesToBuilding James. Then by P7, \u00acManager James. So if he is in other countries, then he is not a manager. That we already know to avoid contradiction.\n\n But that doesn't help the forward implication.\n\n Therefore, we must conclude that the statement is not provable.\n\n However, let's try to prove the second implication again, because we were able to prove \u00acM but not \u00acC.\n\n Second implication: (L\u2228R) \u2192 (\u00acM \u2227 \u00acC)\n\n We have:\n   \u00acM: as before (if M, then \u00acR, but L\u2228R leads to R by either L (via P4) or directly R, contradiction).\n\n   \u00acC: \n        Assume C. Then by P5, R. Then L\u2228R is true (by R). But we have L\u2228R as assumption, so no new issue.\n        Now, we want to derive a contradiction? We don't have one.\n\n        But note: if James is in other countries (C), then he cannot be having lunch in the building? Why? Because if he has lunch in the building, then by P2 he schedules a meeting, then by P1 he goes to the building, then by P7 he is a manager. But we have \u00acM (from above) so he cannot be a manager. Contradiction.\n\n        Therefore, he cannot have lunch in the building. Then by P3, he must have lunch at home (L). Then by P4, he works remotely (R). But we already have R from P5.\n\n        Now, we have L and R, but that doesn't contradict anything. However, we have \u00acM and C. But we want to show \u00acC? We assumed C and we have no contradiction? \n\n        Actually, we have a contradiction from having lunch in the building? But we avoided that by having lunch at home. So no contradiction.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot derive \u00acC.\n\n        Counterexample: James is in other countries (so C true). Then:\n          \u00acM: because if he were a manager, then by P6 he wouldn't work remotely, but by P5 he must -> contradiction. So \u00acM.\n          Then he must have lunch at home (because if he had lunch in building, then he would schedule a meeting, then go to the building, then by P7 he would be a manager -> contradiction). So L true.\n          Then R true (by P5).\n          Then L\u2228R is true.\n          But we want \u00acC, which is false.\n\n        Therefore, the second implication fails.\n\n Given that, we must return Failure.\n\n But note: the problem says \"If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries.\" In our counterexample, James has lunch at home AND works remotely from home (so L\u2228R is true) and he is not a manager (so \u00acM) but he DOES work in other countries (so \u00acC is false). Therefore, the conclusion (\u00acM \u2227 \u00acC) is false.\n\n Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n Hence, we cannot prove it.\n\n Therefore, we output Failure.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Statement to evaluate\" and it is a biconditional. We have shown a counterexample (James in other countries) for both implications? Actually, for the first implication: \n   Left: M\u2228C is true (because C) -> but we require \u00ac(L\u2228R). But L\u2228R is true (because R) so the implication is false.\n\n For the second implication: \n   We have L\u2228R true (because R) and we require \u00acM \u2227 \u00acC. We have \u00acM (because if he were a manager, contradiction) but we have C (true) so \u00acC is false. Therefore, the conjunction is false.\n\n So both implications are false in the counterexample.\n\n Therefore, the biconditional is false.\n\n Final Answer: Failure\n\n But note: we must check if James can be in other countries? We have no premise that says James is not in other countries. So it is a possible scenario.\n\n Therefore, we cannot prove the statement.\n\n Revised Lean code: We might not need to write a complete proof since we know it fails. We can just state the theorem and leave it unproven, but we must output Failure.\n\n However, the instructions say: if you cannot prove it, give Failure.\n\n So we write:\n\n<lean>\naxiom obj : Type\naxiom James : obj\naxiom Employee : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom SchedulesMeeting : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom GoesToBuilding : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom HasLunchInBuilding : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom HasLunchAtHome : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom WorksRemotelyFromHome : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom InOtherCountries : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Manager : obj \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom P1 : \u2200 x : obj, Employee x \u2192 (SchedulesMeeting x \u2192 GoesToBuilding x)\naxiom P2 : \u2200 x : obj, HasLunchInBuilding x \u2192 SchedulesMeeting x\naxiom P3 : \u2200 x : obj, Employee x \u2192 HasLunchInBuilding x \u2228 HasLunchAtHome x\naxiom P4 : \u2200 x : obj, Employee x \u2192 (HasLunchAtHome x \u2192 WorksRemotelyFromHome x)\naxiom P5 : \u2200 x : obj, Employee x \u2192 (InOtherCountries x \u2192 WorksRemotelyFromHome x)\naxiom Manager_imp_Employee : \u2200 x : obj, Manager x \u2192 Employee x\naxiom P6 : \u2200 x : obj, Manager x \u2192 \u00ac WorksRemotelyFromHome x\naxiom P7 : GoesToBuilding James \u2194 Manager James\naxiom James_employee : Employee James\n\n-- The theorem we want is not provable because we found a counterexample: \n-- Assume James is in other countries (and not a manager).

Not exactly: \n        If A and B are both true, then true.\n        If A and B are both false, then true.\n        Otherwise false.\n\n        So it is the same as \u00ac (A xor B) and also the same as A = B.\n\n   But note: the statement says \"either (A and B) or (neither)\", so it's exactly that: (A \u2227 B) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB).\n\nWe are to evaluate: \"Taylor visits the gym at least once a day\", i.e., `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`.\n\nWe want to see if we can prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` from the premises.\n\nHowever, note that the premises do not directly give us information about Taylor's gym visits. We have a chain:\n\n   VisitsGymDaily p \u2192 FulfillsNutrition p \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p \u2192 EatsSaladsRegularly p \u2192 VeryConscious p\n\nBut also, we have:\n\n   DisregardPhysicalWellBeing p \u2192 \u00ac VeryConscious p\n\nAnd Taylor's condition: either (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor and DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) or (neither).\n\nWe must see if Taylor's condition forces her to be in a state that leads to visiting the gym? Actually, note that we have a chain that leads to VeryConscious, but if Taylor disregards her physical well-being, then she cannot be very conscious. And if she grew up in a health-conscious home, then she would be very conscious (by the chain). So if she both grew up in a health-conscious home and disregards her physical well-being, we get a contradiction? Because:\n\n   If A (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome) and B (DisregardPhysicalWellBeing) then:\n      By premise 2: EatsSaladsRegularly Taylor\n      By premise 1: VeryConscious Taylor\n      By premise 4: DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor \u2192 \u00ac VeryConscious Taylor\n      So we have VeryConscious Taylor and \u00ac VeryConscious Taylor -> contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent possibility for Taylor is the second option: neither A nor B. That is:\n\n   \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor and \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor.\n\nNow, we want to know if Taylor visits the gym daily. The chain for visiting the gym:\n\n   VisitsGymDaily Taylor \u2192 FulfillsNutrition Taylor \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor\n\nBut we have \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor. Therefore, if Taylor visited the gym daily, we would have:\n\n   VisitsGymDaily Taylor \u2192 FulfillsNutrition Taylor \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2192 False\n\nSo it would be impossible. Therefore, we cannot have VisitsGymDaily Taylor? Actually, we have shown that if Taylor visited the gym daily, we would get a contradiction because we have \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor.\n\nBut wait: the premise 3 says: FulfillsNutrition p \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p. So if Taylor does not grow up in a health-conscious home, then she cannot fulfill her nutrition. And then by premise 5: if she visits the gym daily, then she fulfills her nutrition, which then would require her to have grown up in a health-conscious home. But we have that she didn't. So she cannot visit the gym daily.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Taylor visits the gym at least once a day\" is false? But note: we are asked to prove it. We cannot prove it because we have shown that it leads to a contradiction. Moreover, we have no positive evidence that she does.\n\nBut wait: the problem says to prove the statement if it follows from the premises. The statement is: Taylor visits the gym at least once a day.\n\nWe have shown that if Taylor visited the gym daily, we would get a contradiction (because we have \u00acGrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor). Therefore, we can actually prove the negation? But note: we are not asked to prove the negation. We are asked to prove the statement.\n\nSince we cannot prove the statement (and in fact we can prove its negation), we must answer Failure.\n\nHowever, let me double-check:\n\nPremises:\n\n1. \u2200 p, EatsSaladsRegularly p \u2192 VeryConscious p\n2. \u2200 p, GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p \u2192 EatsSaladsRegularly p\n3. \u2200 p, FulfillsNutrition p \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p\n4. \u2200 p, DisregardPhysicalWellBeing p \u2192 \u00ac VeryConscious p\n5. \u2200 p, VisitsGymDaily p \u2192 FulfillsNutrition p\n6. (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) \u2228 (\u00acGrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00acDisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor)\n\nWe deduced that the first disjunct leads to contradiction:\n\n   Assume A: GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor and DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor.\n   Then from A.1 (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor) and premise 2: EatsSaladsRegularly Taylor.\n   Then from premise 1: VeryConscious Taylor.\n   Then from A.2 (DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) and premise 4: \u00ac VeryConscious Taylor -> contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we must have the second disjunct: \u00acGrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor and \u00acDisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor.\n\nNow, we wish to prove: VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n\nBut from premise 5: VisitsGymDaily Taylor \u2192 FulfillsNutrition Taylor.\nFrom premise 3: FulfillsNutrition Taylor \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor.\nBut we have \u00acGrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor. Therefore, by modus tollens: \u00acFulfillsNutrition Taylor, and then \u00acVisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n\nSo we have proven that Taylor does NOT visit the gym daily. Therefore, the statement \"Taylor visits the gym at least once a day\" is false. We cannot prove it; we can disprove it.\n\nBut the question asks: \"Statement to evaluate: Taylor visits the gym at least once a day.\" and we are to prove it if we can. Since we cannot prove it (we can prove the opposite), we must output Failure.\n\nHowever, note: the problem says \"try to PROVE that the conclusion is True\". We are only to output True if we can prove the statement. Since we cannot, we output Failure.\n\nBut wait: what if we misinterpreted? Let me see if there's any way Taylor could visit the gym daily? Only if she grew up in a health-conscious home. But we have that she didn't. So no.\n\nTherefore, we cannot prove the statement.\n\nNow, let's write the Lean code accordingly.\n\nWe'll define:\n- `Person : Type`\n- `Taylor : Person`\n- Predicates as above.\n\nPremises as axioms.\n\nThen we'll try to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`.\n\nBut we know we can't. We can prove the negation? But the problem doesn't ask for that.\n\nWe are to output Failure if we cannot prove the statement.\n\nSo in Lean, we can try to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` and if we hit a dead end, we stop.\n\nBut note: in Lean, we can actually prove the negation? However, the problem doesn't require that. We are only to try to prove the statement.\n\nAlternatively, we can show that the premises lead to the negation of the statement, so the statement is not provable (without additional assumptions).\n\nBut the problem says: \"If you can prove it, give me True at the end of the answer. If you cannot prove it, give me Failure at the end of the answer.\"\n\nTherefore, we write the Lean code and then conclude Failure.\n\nHowever, note: we can actually prove in Lean that `\u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor`? But that is not what we are asked. We are asked to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`. Since we cannot, we output Failure.\n\nBut to be thorough, we can write the Lean code that includes the deduction of Taylor's situation and then show that the statement leads to contradiction? Actually, we don't need to prove the statement, we just need to see if we can prove it.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to prove the statement and if we get stuck, we output Failure.\n\nBut note: we can actually prove that the statement is false? Then we definitely cannot prove it.\n\nSo in Lean, we can set up the context and then attempt a proof of `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` and see that it fails. However, Lean is a proof assistant and we can write a proof of the negation? But that's not required.\n\nGiven the problem, we are only to output True if we can prove the statement, else Failure.\n\nTherefore, we write the Lean axioms and then leave the theorem for `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` unproven? But we must attempt it.\n\nActually, we can write a proof that the statement is false? But the problem doesn't ask for that. It asks for the statement.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n```\ntheorem taylor_gym : VisitsGymDaily Taylor := ?   -- we cannot prove it\n\n```\n\nBut we know we can't. So we output Failure.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"During the translation, please pay close attention to the predicates and entities.\" and then try to prove.\n\nSo we write the Lean code with the context and then attempt a proof? Actually, we can write a proof that the statement is unprovable? That's not what Lean does.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to construct a countermodel? But Lean doesn't do that.\n\nSo we must be pragmatic: we write the axioms and then state the theorem and then we don't prove it. Then we say Failure.\n\nBut the problem says: \"If you cannot prove it, give me Failure at the end of the answer.\"\n\nSo we write:\n\n<lean>\naxiom Person : Type\naxiom Taylor : Person\n\naxiom EatsSaladsRegularly : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VeryConscious : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FulfillsNutrition : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom DisregardPhysicalWellBeing : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VisitsGymDaily : Person \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom P1 : \u2200 p : Person, EatsSaladsRegularly p \u2192 VeryConscious p\naxiom P2 : \u2200 p : Person, GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p \u2192 EatsSaladsRegularly p\naxiom P3 : \u2200 p : Person, FulfillsNutrition p \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p\naxiom P4 : \u2200 p : Person, DisregardPhysicalWellBeing p \u2192 \u00ac VeryConscious p\naxiom P5 : \u2200 p : Person, VisitsGymDaily p \u2192 FulfillsNutrition p\n\n-- Taylor's condition: either (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor and DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) or (neither)\naxiom Taylor_condition : \n  (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) \u2228 \n  (\u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor)\n\n-- We now try to prove VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n\n-- But note: we deduced that the first disjunct leads to a contradiction.\nlemma not_both : \u00ac (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) := by\n  intro h\n  have h1 := P2 Taylor h.1   -- EatsSaladsRegularly Taylor\n  have h2 := P1 Taylor h1     -- VeryConscious Taylor\n  have h3 := P4 Taylor h.2    -- \u00ac VeryConscious Taylor\n  exact h3 h2\n\n-- Therefore, Taylor_condition must be the second disjunct.\nlemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => exact absurd h not_both\n  | inr h => exact h\n\n-- Now, we want to prove VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n-- But we have taylor_case.1: \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor.\n\n-- Suppose VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n-- Then by P5: FulfillsNutrition Taylor.\n-- Then by P3: GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor.\n-- But that contradicts taylor_case.1.\n\n-- Therefore, we can prove \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n\ntheorem not_gym : \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by\n  intro h\n  have h1 := P5 Taylor h       -- FulfillsNutrition Taylor\n  have h2 := P3 Taylor h1      -- GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor\n  exact taylor_case.1 h2\n\n-- But the statement we were asked to evaluate is \"Taylor visits the gym at least once a day\", i.e., VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n-- Since we have proven the negation, we cannot prove the positive statement.\n\n-- Therefore, we cannot prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`.\n</lean>\n\nBut note: the problem says to try to prove the statement.

We did not prove it; we proved the opposite.\n\nSo the answer is Failure.\n\nBut wait: what if the problem expects us to prove the statement? We have shown it's false. So we cannot prove it.\n\nTherefore:\n\nANSWER: Failure\n\nBut note: the example output was either True or Failure.\n\nWe are not proving the statement, so Failure.\n\nLet me write the Lean code accordingly. However, note that in the Lean code above we proved `not_gym`. But the problem doesn't ask for that. It asks for the statement. So we don't need to include that theorem? Actually, we are only required to try to prove the statement. We can include the attempt and show it fails? But Lean doesn't show failed attempts.\n\nAlternatively, we can state the theorem we want and then not prove it? But that would cause an error.\n\nSo we must not include an unproven theorem. Therefore, we write the context and then we note that we cannot prove the theorem.\n\nBut the problem says: \"I want you to try to PROVE that the conclusion is True\". So we must attempt a proof? In Lean, we can write:\n\n```\ntheorem taylor_visits_gym : VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by\n  -- We know from taylor_case that \u00acGrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor.\n  -- If we assume VisitsGymDaily Taylor, then:\n  apply P5 Taylor   -- This gives FulfillsNutrition Taylor\n  apply P3 Taylor   -- This gives GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor\n  exact taylor_case.1 ?   -- but we have \u00acGrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor, so we get a contradiction.\n\n  -- Actually, we can't complete the proof because we have a contradiction if we assume VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n  -- So we would need to use the fact that we have a contradiction to prove anything? But that's not helpful.\n\n  -- Alternatively, we can try to use Taylor_condition? But we already know the first case is impossible and the second case gives \u00acGrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor.\n\n  -- We have no positive evidence that Taylor visits the gym.\n\n  -- So we cannot prove it.\n\n  -- Therefore, we leave the proof incomplete? But Lean requires a proof.\n\n  -- Actually, we can use the fact that we have a contradiction from the assumption? But that would prove the negation, not the positive.\n\n  -- We cannot prove VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n\n  -- So we must admit defeat? But in Lean, we cannot leave a theorem unproven.\n\n  -- Therefore, we must not write this theorem if we cannot prove it.\n\n  -- But the problem says to wrap ALL Lean code. And we are to try to prove. So we can write a failed attempt? No, Lean code must be correct.\n\n  -- Alternatively, we can write a proof that leads to a contradiction? But that would prove False, not VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n\n  -- We decide: we do not write the theorem `taylor_visits_gym` because we cannot prove it.\n\n  -- But then how do we represent that we tried? We don't write it.\n\n  -- However, the problem says: \"During the translation, please pay close attention to the predicates and entities.\" and then try to prove.\n\n  -- We have written the context. We have written the necessary lemmas (not_both and taylor_case) and even not_gym. But we are not required to write the negation.\n\n  -- Since we cannot prove the statement, we do not write a theorem for it.\n\n  -- So the Lean block will contain the context and the lemmas we used to deduce Taylor's situation, but not the unproven theorem.\n\n```\n\nBut the problem says: \"If you cannot prove it, give me Failure\". So we don't write the theorem.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n```\ntheorem taylor_visits_gym : VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by\n  sorry   -- This is an unproven theorem, but Lean accepts it with `sorry`. However, `sorry` is an axiom and we don't want to use it.\n\n```\n\nBut the problem says to prove. So we avoid `sorry`.\n\nTherefore, we will write the context and the deductions we made (which show that Taylor does not visit the gym) and then we do not state the theorem we cannot prove.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"translate natural language reasoning text to Lean code\". We have translated the premises and the condition about Taylor. We have also deduced that Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious home and does not disregard her physical well-being. And we deduced that she does not visit the gym. But that last deduction is the negation of the statement we are to evaluate.\n\nHowever, the problem does not ask for the negation. So we can omit `not_gym`? But then we haven't attempted the proof of the statement.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n```\ntheorem taylor_visits_gym : VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by\n  -- We have taylor_case: \u00acGrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00acDisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor\n  -- We want to prove VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n  -- Apply P5: so we need FulfillsNutrition Taylor.\n  apply P5 Taylor\n  -- Now we need FulfillsNutrition Taylor.

But we already know it's the second case.\n\n  -- We are stuck.\n\n  -- Therefore, we cannot prove it.\n\n```\n\nBut this is not a valid proof. So we cannot write it.\n\nTherefore, we decide to write the context and the necessary lemmas and then not write the theorem for the statement.\n\nAnd then we output Failure.\n\nSo the Lean code will be:\n\n<lean>\naxiom Person : Type\naxiom Taylor : Person\n\naxiom EatsSaladsRegularly : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VeryConscious : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FulfillsNutrition : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom DisregardPhysicalWellBeing : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VisitsGymDaily : Person \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom P1 : \u2200 p : Person, EatsSaladsRegularly p \u2192 VeryConscious p\naxiom P2 : \u2200 p : Person, GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p \u2192 EatsSaladsRegularly p\naxiom P3 : \u2200 p : Person, FulfillsNutrition p \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p\naxiom P4 : \u2200 p : Person, DisregardPhysicalWellBeing p \u2192 \u00ac VeryConscious p\naxiom P5 : \u2200 p : Person, VisitsGymDaily p \u2192 FulfillsNutrition p\n\naxiom Taylor_condition : \n  (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) \u2228 \n  (\u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor)\n\nlemma not_both : \u00ac (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) := by\n  intro h\n  have h1 := P2 Taylor h.1\n  have h2 := P1 Taylor h1\n  have h3 := P4 Taylor h.2\n  exact h3 h2\n\nlemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => exact absurd h not_both\n  | inr h => exact h\n\n-- We cannot prove VisitsGymDaily Taylor because we have:\n--   If VisitsGymDaily Taylor, then by P5: FulfillsNutrition Taylor, then by P3: GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor.\n--   But taylor_case.1 says \u00acGrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor -> contradiction.\n-- Therefore, we have no proof of VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: Failure\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Statement to evaluate: Taylor visits the gym at least once a day.\" and we are to prove it.

Let's fix them step by step.\n\nFrom the errors:\n\n1. In the lemma `taylor_case`, the proof uses `cases Taylor_condition` and then in the `inl` branch uses `contradiction`. The error message might be because Lean couldn't automatically close the branch. However, we have the lemma `not_both` that proves that the left branch is impossible. So we can use `exact not_both h` in the `inl` branch.\n\n2. The main theorem `taylor_gym` is trying to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` but the proof is incorrect. We are using `have` without using the implications. Moreover, the `exact` at the end is using `taylor_case.1` which is of type `\u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor`, but what we need is to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` (which we don't have). Actually, the theorem `taylor_gym` is the statement we are trying to prove (that Taylor visits the gym daily). But from the context, we know that this should be false. We are not able to prove it, so we should instead show that assuming it leads to a contradiction.\n\nHowever, note that our goal is to either prove the statement (if possible) or output Failure. We cannot prove it, so we should show that the premise leads to a contradiction? But actually, the argument is that from the premises and the condition about Taylor, we can deduce that Taylor does NOT visit the gym. But the statement to evaluate is that she does. So we are trying to prove it and if we cannot, we output Failure.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"try to PROVE that the conclusion is True\". So if we can prove it, we output True. If we cannot, we output Failure.\n\nIn this case, we actually can prove that the conclusion is False? But that's not the same as proving the conclusion True. We are being asked to prove the statement to evaluate, which is \"Taylor visits the gym at least once a day\".\n\nWe know:\n- Taylor is in the state: not in a health-conscious home and does not disregard her physical well-being.\n- If she visited the gym daily, then by P5 she would fulfill nutrition, and by P3 she would have grown up in a health-conscious home. But this contradicts `taylor_case.1`.\n\nSo, we can actually prove that she does NOT visit the gym. Therefore, we cannot prove that she does. Hence, the attempt to prove the given statement (that she visits the gym) fails.\n\nBut note: in Lean, we are trying to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`. We have shown that assuming it leads to a contradiction. So we should write a theorem that says the opposite, but then how do we handle the original theorem? Actually, the original statement to evaluate is the one we are writing as `theorem taylor_gym`. Since we cannot prove it, we leave it unproven? Or we try to do a proof by contradiction? But even if we do, we end up proving the negation.\n\nHowever, the task is: prove the statement if possible. If not, output Failure.\n\nSo we must try to write a proof of `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`. We'll see that it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we cannot prove it (because it is false). So we should mark as Failure.\n\nBut in Lean, we can attempt to write a proof and if we encounter a contradiction, we can close the goal by `contradiction` or `exfalso`. However, note: if we prove False from the assumptions, then we can use `absurd` but that doesn't help because we are trying to prove a positive statement.\n\nLet me try to structure:\n\nAssume `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`.\nThen by P5: `FulfillsNutrition Taylor`.\nThen by P3: `GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor`.\nBut by `taylor_case` we have `\u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor`.\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can actually disprove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`, but for proving `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` we have a contradiction. So we cannot prove it. So we should not be able to complete the proof.\n\nIn the code, we have:\n\n```\ntheorem taylor_gym : VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by \n  have := P5 Taylor   -- VisitsGymDaily Taylor \u2192 FulfillsNutrition Taylor\n  have := P3 Taylor   -- FulfillsNutrition Taylor \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor\n  exact taylor_case.1  -- Contradiction: \u00acGrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor\n```\n\nThis is incorrect because `P5 Taylor` is of type `VisitsGymDaily Taylor \u2192 FulfillsNutrition Taylor`, but we don't have a proof of `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` to use it. We are in the context of trying to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`. We haven't used the current goal.\n\nTo properly use the implications, we need to apply the premises. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n```\ntheorem taylor_gym : VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by\n  have h_gym : VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by assumption  -- we don't have this\n```\n\nThat doesn't work. We might try:\n\n```\ntheorem taylor_gym : VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by\n  apply ?   -- we have no introduction rule\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can try to show that the assumption leads to a contradiction, but that would be a proof of `\u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor`, not `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`.\n\nGiven that we are not able to provide a proof of `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`, we should output Failure.\n\nBut let's fix the code so that it compiles and correctly represents the reasoning.\n\nThe errors we encountered:\n\n1. In the definition of `taylor_case`, the first branch: `inl h => contradiction` was not working. We can use `inl h => exact not_both h`.\n\n2. The error also mentioned a problem with the lemma `taylor_case`? The error said \"Function expected ...\" but I think it was because the `contradiction` tactic didn't resolve. After fixing, it should be okay.\n\nWe'll correct:\n\n```\nlemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => exact absurd h not_both   -- or we can do: apply not_both; exact h\n  | inr h => exact h\n```\n\nBut actually, `not_both h` is a proof of `False`. But we need a proof of the conjunction. Alternatively, we can do:\n\nWe have `inl h: GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor` and we have `not_both: \u00ac (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor)`, so `not_both h` is of type `False`. We can eliminate that with `contradiction`.\n\nBut the previous version with `contradiction` should work if the context has a contradiction. Let me try with `cases Taylor_condition; { apply not_both; assumption } | { assumption }`? No, we can also try:\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n```\nlemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition\n  case inl h => \n    have : False := not_both h\n    contradiction\n  case inr h => exact h\n```\n\nBut `contradiction` will work just as `this : False` is present.\n\nBut I think the original error was because the contradiction tactic did not find the contradiction. With our explicit `not_both h` we can fix.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n```\nlemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => exfalso; exact not_both h\n  | inr h => exact h\n```\n\nBut note the error: \"contradiction\" didn't work. So let's use `exfalso; apply not_both; exact h`.\n\nAlternatively, we can prove the conjunction by splitting:\n\n```\nlemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition\n  \u00b7 intro \u27e8h1, h2\u27e9  -- we are in the inl branch, but we have h as the proof of the left disjunct?\n    -- Actually, the case tag inl is for the first disjunct, so we have h : GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor.\n    -- Then we can show that this leads to False.\n    have contra := not_both h\n    exact contra  -- but at this point we have False, but we are supposed to build the conjunction. \n```\n\nActually, the lemma `taylor_case` expects a proof of a conjunction. However, in the `inl` branch we are deriving a contradiction, so we can eliminate it. So:\n\n```\nlemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition\n  case inl h => \n    have contra : False := not_both h\n    contradiction\n  case inr h => \n    exact h\n```\n\nBut `contradiction` will work since we have `False` in the context.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n```\nlemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => contradiction   -- now that we have the lemma not_both, it might work?\n```\n\nWait, why was there an error before? The error said: unexpected token and then mentioned the type. I think the previous version using `contradiction` should work if the context has a contradiction. But in our initial code, the context in the left branch had `h: GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor` and we had the lemma `not_both` that says that such a thing is false. However, the contradiction tactic doesn't automatically use `not_both`? Because `not_both` is a lemma that needs to be applied.\n\nSo let's do:\n\n```\nlemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => \n    exact False.elim (not_both h)\n  | inr h => exact h\n```\n\nOr more simply:\n\n```\nlemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => apply not_both.rec \n  | inr h => exact h\n```\n\nThat's not right. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n```\nlemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => \n    have f := not_both h\n    contradiction\n  | inr h => exact h\n```\n\nI think the problem was that `contradiction` didn't find the contradiction. But if we use `exfalso` then `contradiction` or `exact ...` should work.\n\nAlternatively, we can do a direct case split and use the lemma:\n\n```\nlemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  match Taylor_condition with\n  | Or.inl _ => \n      have : False := not_both \u27e8?_, ?_\u27e9   -- but we have h, which is a proof of the conjunction\n      exact this.elim  -- not_false is False, then any goal can be proven by eliminating False.\n  | Or.inr h => exact h\n```\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nLet me try a different approach. We can derive the state for Taylor:\n\n```\nlemma not_left : \u00ac (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) := not_both\n\nlemma taylor_case : (\u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor) \u2227 (\u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => \n      apply False.elim\n      apply not_both h\n  | inr h => exact h\n```\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow for the main theorem:\n\nWe are trying to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`. But we know that if we assume it, we can derive a contradiction. However, we are not able to prove it. Therefore, the code for the theorem `taylor_gym` is not needed? We can leave it as an attempt.\n\nBut note: we are only required to try to prove it. And if we cannot, we output Failure.\n\nBut in the code, we have the theorem `taylor_gym` which is exactly the statement we want. And we are going to fail to prove it.\n\nWe can try to write a proof and if we cannot, leave it out? But then we must indicate Failure.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n```\ntheorem taylor_gym : VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by\n  -- We'll assume we are going to derive a contradiction.\n  apply False.elim  -- we don't have a contradiction? Actually, we need to derive one.\n  let hgym : VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by admit -- this doesn't help.\n\n  -- Alternative: by_contra her_state? \n\n  -- Instead, let's try to prove that Taylor visits the gym must be false.\n  -- But we are trying to prove it's true, so that's not the same.\n\n  -- We can do:\n  have h : \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by\n    intro h_gym\n    have fulfill := P5 Taylor h_gym\n    have home := P3 Taylor fulfill\n    exact taylor_case.1 home\n\n  -- But now how to prove VisitsGymDaily Taylor? We have h that says it's not, so we have a contradiction with the goal? \n  -- Actually, we are stuck because we don't have VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n\n  -- We cannot complete the proof.\n  sorry\n```\n\nSince we cannot prove it, we output Failure.\n\nBut the requirement is: if I can prove the statement to evaluate, then output True (and the code must be proven). If not, output Failure.\n\nTherefore, we cannot prove it, so we should output Failure.\n\nNow, to fix the whole code:\n\n1. We fix the `taylor_case` lemma to use `False.elim` in the left branch.\n2. We leave the theorem `taylor_gym` unproven (with `sorry`) because we cannot prove it.\n\nAlternatively, we can omit the theorem `taylor_gym` and just expose the fact that we have a lemma contradicting it? But the problem says we must wrap ALL the lean code. And we have to write a theorem that tries to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. How about we write the theorem and if we cannot prove it, we leave a `sorry`? Then we output Failure.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"If you can prove it, give me True at the end of the answer. If you cannot prove it, give me Failure\".\n\nSo the existence of a `sorry` means we cannot prove it.\n\nLet me write the corrected code:\n\n<lean>\naxiom Person : Type\naxiom Taylor : Person\n\naxiom EatsSaladsRegularly : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VeryConscious : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FulfillsNutrition : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom DisregardPhysicalWellBeing : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VisitsGymDaily : Person \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom P1 : \u2200 p : Person, EatsSaladsRegularly p \u2192 VeryConscious p\naxiom P2 : \u2200 p : Person, GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p \u2192 EatsSaladsRegularly p\naxiom P3 : \u2200 p : Person, FulfillsNutrition p \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p\naxiom P4 : \u2200 p : Person, DisregardPhysicalWellBeing p \u2192 \u00ac VeryConscious p\naxiom P5 : \u2200 p : Person, VisitsGymDaily p \u2192 FulfillsNutrition p\n\n-- Taylor's condition: (health-conscious home \u2227 disregard well-being) \u2228 (\u00achealth-conscious home \u2227 \u00acdisregard well-being)\naxiom Taylor_condition : \n  (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) \u2228 \n  (\u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor)\n\n-- First scenario leads to contradiction\nlemma not_both : \u00ac (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) := by\n  intro \u27e8h1, h2\u27e9\n  have h3 := P2 Taylor h1\n  have h4 := P1 Taylor h3\n  exact P4 Taylor h2 h4\n\n-- Taylor must be in the second scenario\nlemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => \n      exact False.elim (not_both h)  -- h is a proof of the left and not_both h is a proof of False.\n  | inr h => exact h\n\n-- Attempt to prove that Taylor visits the gym daily (we cannot)\ntheorem taylor_gym : VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by \n  -- We know that if she visited the gym, she would fulfill nutrition and hence be from a health-conscious home:\n  have h_if : VisitsGymDaily Taylor \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor := by \n      intro gym\n      have fulfill := P5 Taylor gym\n      exact P3 Taylor fulfill\n  -- We also know that Taylor is not from a health-conscious home: taylor_case.1\n  -- So we have that Taylor does not visit the gym? \n  -- But we are trying to prove she does, which would be a contradiction.\n  -- However, we cannot prove she visits the gym without a contradiction. \n  -- Actually, we have h_if which says: if she visits, then home.

This might be due to the way we are writing the type.\n\nMoreover, the error \"unexpected token ':'; expected command\" and \"Unknown identifier `taylor_case`\" suggest that there might be a parsing issue because of the previous error.\n\nLet me restructure the code:\n\n1. Instead of defining `taylor_case` as a lemma that returns a conjunction, we can split it into two lemmas or use a structure. However, for simplicity, we can keep it as a single lemma but ensure the type is correctly parenthesized.\n\n2. Alternatively, we can avoid defining `taylor_case` as a conjunction and instead prove the two parts separately.\n\nBut note: the error says \"Function expected at ... but this term has type Prop\". This indicates that in the context where we are using `taylor_case.1`, Lean is expecting a function, but `taylor_case` is a proof of a proposition. The issue might be in the way we are trying to use `taylor_case` in the theorem `taylor_gym`.\n\nHowever, the initial error is in the definition of `taylor_case`. Let me check the type annotation:\n\nWe have:\n  lemma taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor\n\nThis type is a proposition, and it should be acceptable. But the error message says \"Function expected ...\", which is confusing.\n\nAnother possibility: the error might be because of the `by` tactic block. We can try to write the proof without using `cases` in a way that avoids the issue.\n\nAlternatively, we can define `taylor_case` without a type annotation and let Lean infer it, but that is not safe.\n\nLet me try to fix the definition of `taylor_case` by using parentheses around the type:\n\n  lemma taylor_case : (\u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor) \u2227 (\u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) := ...\n\nBut note: the conjunction `\u2227` is right-associative? Actually, it doesn't matter because we are using it as a binary connective. However, adding parentheses might help the parser.\n\nAlternatively, we can break it into two lemmas:\n\n  lemma taylor_not_home : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor := ...\n  lemma taylor_not_disregard : \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := ...\n\nBut then we have to adjust the proof accordingly.\n\nGiven the time, I will try breaking it into two lemmas.\n\nAlso, in the theorem `taylor_gym`, we are trying to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` which is false. We are getting stuck because we don't have a proof of `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` to feed to `home_req`. Instead, we should be showing that the assumption leads to a contradiction. But note: we are not assuming `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`; we are trying to prove it. So we cannot use `by assumption` because there is no such assumption.\n\nTherefore, we cannot prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`. We should instead show that the statement is unprovable by leaving the theorem unproven (using `sorry` or by attempting to prove by contradiction and failing).\n\nBut the requirement is: if we can prove it, give True, else Failure. So we don't need to have a complete proof for `taylor_gym`; we only need to show that we cannot prove it. However, the problem asks to try to prove and if we fail, output Failure.\n\nSo let's restructure:\n\n- We will prove that Taylor does NOT visit the gym daily? Actually, the statement to evaluate is \"Taylor visits the gym at least once a day\". We are to prove or disprove it. But note: the premises do not allow us to prove it, and in fact, we can prove that Taylor does NOT visit the gym? Let me see:\n\nFrom `taylor_not_home` (which we have) and the chain:\n\n  VisitsGymDaily Taylor \u2192 FulfillsNutrition Taylor \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor\n\nSo if Taylor visited the gym, we would have `GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor`, which contradicts `taylor_not_home`. Therefore, we can prove that Taylor does NOT visit the gym.\n\nBut note: the problem asks to prove the statement \"Taylor visits the gym at least once a day\". Since we can prove the negation, we cannot prove the positive statement. So we should not be able to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Statement to evaluate: Taylor visits the gym at least once a day.\" and we are to try to prove it. Since we cannot, we output Failure.\n\nBut let me clarify: the task is to prove the statement from the premises. If we can prove it, we output True; if we cannot (i.e., the premises do not entail the statement) we output Failure.\n\nWe have shown that the premises entail the negation of the statement? Actually, we can prove that Taylor does not visit the gym. So the statement is false. Therefore, we cannot prove the statement (because it is false and our premises are true). So we output Failure.\n\nBut note: we are not asked to prove the negation, only to try to prove the statement.\n\nSo in the Lean code, we attempt to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` and fail. We can also show that the assumption of `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` leads to a contradiction, but that would be a proof of `\u00acVisitsGymDaily Taylor`, not of `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`.\n\nTherefore, we leave the theorem `taylor_gym` unproven (with `sorry`).\n\nBut to avoid errors, let me restructure the code:\n\n1. Define the type and axioms.\n2. Prove `not_both` as before.\n3. Prove two separate lemmas for Taylor's case: one for not having a health-conscious home and one for not disregarding well-being.\n4. In the theorem `taylor_gym`, we attempt to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` and fail.\n\nAlternatively, we can show that assuming `VisitsGymDaily Taylor` leads to a contradiction, but that would be a proof of `\u00acVisitsGymDaily Taylor`. However, that is not what we are asked to prove. We are asked to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`.\n\nSo we must fail to prove `taylor_gym`.\n\nCorrected code:\n\n<lean>\naxiom Person : Type\naxiom Taylor : Person\n\naxiom EatsSaladsRegularly : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VeryConscious : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FulfillsNutrition : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom DisregardPhysicalWellBeing : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VisitsGymDaily : Person \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom P1 : \u2200 p : Person, EatsSaladsRegularly p \u2192 VeryConscious p\naxiom P2 : \u2200 p : Person, GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p \u2192 EatsSaladsRegularly p\naxiom P3 : \u2200 p : Person, FulfillsNutrition p \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p\naxiom P4 : \u2200 p : Person, DisregardPhysicalWellBeing p \u2192 \u00ac VeryConscious p\naxiom P5 : \u2200 p : Person, VisitsGymDaily p \u2192 FulfillsNutrition p\n\n-- Taylor's condition\naxiom Taylor_condition : \n  (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) \u2228 \n  (\u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor)\n\n-- First scenario leads to contradiction\nlemma not_both : \u00ac (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) := by\n  intro \u27e8h1, h2\u27e9\n  have h3 := P2 Taylor h1\n  have h4 := P1 Taylor h3\n  exact P4 Taylor h2 h4\n\n-- Now, we know Taylor must be in the second scenario.\nlemma taylor_not_home : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => exact False.elim (not_both h)\n  | inr h => exact h.1\n\nlemma taylor_not_disregard : \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => exact False.elim (not_both h)\n  | inr h => exact h.2\n\n-- We cannot prove that Taylor visits the gym daily.

This is acceptable because we cannot prove it. We then output Failure.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"try to PROVE that the conclusion is True\". Since we cannot, we output Failure.\n\nHowever, we can actually prove that Taylor does NOT visit the gym. But that is a different statement. We are only asked about the positive statement.\n\nSo the final answer is Failure.\n\nBut to avoid the `sorry`, we can instead have the theorem `taylor_gym` be unproven and then we output Failure.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the theorem to show that the statement is false? But the problem does not ask for that.\n\nSo I will leave the theorem with `sorry`.\n\nNow, the errors we had before were due to the way we defined `taylor_case` as a conjunction. Now we have split it into two lemmas, so we avoid that issue.\n\nLet me run through the code:\n\n- `taylor_not_home` and `taylor_not_disregard` are proven without errors.\n- In `taylor_gym`, we are stuck because we have no way to prove `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`. We only have that it implies a contradiction, which means we can prove the negation, but not the positive.\n\nTherefore, we output Failure.\n\nANSWER: Failure\n", "prediction": "Failure", "parse_status": "SUCCESS", "lean_code": "axiom Person : Type\naxiom Taylor : Person\n\naxiom EatsSaladsRegularly : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VeryConscious : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FulfillsNutrition : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom DisregardPhysicalWellBeing : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VisitsGymDaily : Person \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom P1 : \u2200 p : Person, EatsSaladsRegularly p \u2192 VeryConscious p\naxiom P2 : \u2200 p : Person, GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p \u2192 EatsSaladsRegularly p\naxiom P3 : \u2200 p : Person, FulfillsNutrition p \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p\naxiom P4 : \u2200 p : Person, DisregardPhysicalWellBeing p \u2192 \u00ac VeryConscious p\naxiom P5 : \u2200 p : Person, VisitsGymDaily p \u2192 FulfillsNutrition p\n\n-- Taylor's condition\naxiom Taylor_condition : \n  (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) \u2228 \n  (\u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor)\n\n-- First scenario leads to contradiction\nlemma not_both : \u00ac (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor) := by\n  intro \u27e8h1, h2\u27e9\n  have h3 := P2 Taylor h1\n  have h4 := P1 Taylor h3\n  exact P4 Taylor h2 h4\n\n-- Taylor does not have a health-conscious home\nlemma taylor_not_home : \u00ac GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => exact False.elim (not_both h)\n  | inr h => exact h.1\n\n-- Taylor does not disregard her physical well-being\nlemma taylor_not_disregard : \u00ac DisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor := by\n  cases Taylor_condition with\n  | inl h => exact False.elim (not_both h)\n  | inr h => exact h.2\n\n-- Attempt to prove Taylor visits gym daily\ntheorem taylor_gym : VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by\n  -- If Taylor visited the gym, she'd fulfill nutrition (P5)\n  have H1 : VisitsGymDaily Taylor \u2192 FulfillsNutrition Taylor := P5 Taylor\n  -- Fulfilling nutrition implies health-conscious home (P3)\n  have H2 : FulfillsNutrition Taylor \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor := P3 Taylor\n  -- Thus gym visits imply health-conscious home\n  have H3 : VisitsGymDaily Taylor \u2192 GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor := \n    fun h => H2 (H1 h)\n  -- But we've proven Taylor has no health-conscious home\n  exact False.elim (taylor_not_home (H3 (by sorry)))  -- No proof for gym visits", "lean_verification": {"success": false, "env": 6, "errors": ["Function expected at\n  \u00acGrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor \u2227 \u00acDisregardPhysicalWellBeing Taylor\nbut this term has type\n  Prop\n\nNote: Expected a function because this term is being applied to the argument\n  lemma", "unexpected token ':';
