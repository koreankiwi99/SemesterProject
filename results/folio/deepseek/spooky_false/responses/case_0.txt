The natural language reasoning is translated into Lean code to represent the premises. The goal is to prove that "Bonnie performs in school talent shows often" is false. However, after formalizing the premises and attempting the proof, it is determined that the negation cannot be proven. Both possibilities (Bonnie performs or does not perform) remain consistent with the premises, depending on her engagement and student status. Therefore, the proof of negation fails.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Club : Person → Prop
axiom Performs : Person → Prop
axiom AttendsEngaged : Person → Prop
axiom InactiveDisinterested : Person → Prop
axiom Chaperones : Person → Prop
axiom Student : Person → Prop

-- Premise 1: People who perform are engaged.
axiom P1 : ∀ p, Club p → Performs p → AttendsEngaged p
-- Premise 2: People either perform or are inactive (or both).
axiom P2 : ∀ p, Club p → Performs p ∨ InactiveDisinterested p
-- Premise 3: Chaperones are not students.
axiom P3 : ∀ p, Club p → Chaperones p → ¬ Student p
-- Premise 4: Inactive people chaperone.
axiom P4 : ∀ p, Club p → InactiveDisinterested p → Chaperones p
-- Premise 5: Young children/teenagers with academic wishes are students (not used for Bonnie).
axiom YoungChildOrTeen : Person → Prop
axiom WishFurther : Person → Prop
axiom P5 : ∀ p, Club p → YoungChildOrTeen p → WishFurther p → Student p

axiom Bonnie : Person
axiom BonnieInClub : Club Bonnie
-- Premise 6: Bonnie is engaged → student (equivalent to ¬AttendsEngaged ∨ Student)
axiom BonnieCase : ¬ AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∨ Student Bonnie

-- Attempt to prove Bonnie does not perform fails due to insufficient constraints.
