The reasoning involves translating the natural language premises into Lean 4 and proving that the statement "Luke complains often about annoying siblings" leads to a contradiction (False) under these premises. The key steps are:

1. **Premise Translation**:
   - `MB x`: x was born in a multiple birth.
   - `H x`: x has siblings born together.
   - `C x`: x complains often about annoying siblings.
   - `S x`: x spends a lot of time hanging out/playing with siblings.
   - `Home x`: x lives at home.
   - `Strangers x`: x lives with strangers.
   - Premises become axioms `P1` to `P6`.

2. **Logical Derivation**:
   - Assume `C Luke` (Luke complains about siblings).
   - By `P3`, `C Luke` implies `H Luke` (Luke has siblings born together).
   - By `P2`, `H Luke` implies `MB Luke` (Luke was born in a multiple birth).
   - By `P1`, `MB Luke` implies `S Luke` (Luke spends time with siblings).
   - By `P5`, `S Luke` implies `Home Luke` (Luke lives at home).
   - By `P4`, `Home Luke` implies `¬Strangers Luke` (Luke does not live with strangers).
   - Now, `P6` states Luke must be in one of two mutually exclusive states:
     - Case 1: `MB Luke ∧ Strangers Luke` – Contradicts `¬Strangers Luke`.
     - Case 2: `¬MB Luke ∧ ¬Strangers Luke` – Contradicts `MB Luke`.
   - Both cases yield a contradiction, proving `C Luke → False`.

3. **Lean Implementation**:
   - The theorem `contradiction_from_C_Luke` assumes `C Luke` and derives `False`.
   - Tactics are avoided; pure functional style is used with `have` for intermediate steps.
