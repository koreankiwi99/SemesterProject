The statement "It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test" is directly supported by the premise stating the cost is $205, which is cheaper than $300. Formalization shows:
- Base cost is $205 (less than $300)
- Financial aid may reduce individual costs further, but no premise suggests costs exceed $300
- Tom's situation confirms financial aid eligibility but doesn't alter the base cost

Lean proof attempts to disprove the statement (prove ¬(cost < 300)) fail because:
1. Base cost ($205) is provably below $300
2. Tom's cost is bounded by base cost (≤ $205), also below $300

Thus, the negation cannot be proven.
