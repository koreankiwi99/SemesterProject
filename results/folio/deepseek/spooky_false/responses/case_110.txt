The premises state that all fir trees are evergreens and that some objects of worship are fir trees. The conclusion claims some evergreens are not objects of worship. To evaluate this, we attempt to prove the negation of the conclusion (i.e., that no such evergreen exists) using the premises.

In Lean, we model:
- `obj` as a type
- Predicates: `FirTree`, `Evergreen`, `ObjectOfWorship`
- Premise 1: `∀ x, FirTree x → Evergreen x`
- Premise 2: `∃ x, ObjectOfWorship x ∧ FirTree x`
- Negation of conclusion: `∀ x, Evergreen x → ObjectOfWorship x` (equivalent to "all evergreens are objects of worship")

However, Premise 2 only guarantees one example of a worshipped fir tree (which is evergreen). It does not restrict that other evergreens (e.g., non-fir trees) cannot exist that are unworshipped. Thus, we cannot derive universal worship of evergreens from the given premises. The direct proof fails, as no contradiction arises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom FirTree : obj → Prop
axiom Evergreen : obj → Prop
axiom ObjectOfWorship : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x, FirTree x → Evergreen x
axiom P2 : ∃ x, ObjectOfWorship x ∧ FirTree x

theorem prove_conclusion_false : ¬∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ObjectOfWorship x :=
  fun ⟨x, ⟨hEvergreen, hNotWorship⟩⟩ => by 
    -- We have an evergreen x not worshipped. How do P1/P2 force a contradiction?
    -- P2 gives some worshipped fir tree, but not constraint linking x to it.
    -- Cannot derive ¬(hEvergreen x) or ¬(hNotWorship x) here.
    sorry -- Stuck at incomplete proof

Attempt fails: Premises support models where:
- `a` (worshipped fir tree) is an evergreen (by P1).
- `b` is a non-fir evergreen (e.g., pine) not worshipped.
No contradiction → cannot prove the negation.
