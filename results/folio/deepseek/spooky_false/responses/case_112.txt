The premises establish that the Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in either New Mexico or Texas, Juan de Onate visited them, the Harding Pegmatite Mine located there was donated, and no mountain range in Texas has a donated mine. The conclusion claims Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in Texas.

**Reasoning:**
- The Harding Pegmatite Mine is in the Picuris Mountains and donated.
- If the Picuris Mountains were in Texas, this would violate the premise that no Texas mountain range has a donated mine.
- Thus, the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico (not Texas), and Juan visited them there.
- However, there might exist other mountain ranges in Texas that Juan visited. The premises do not constrain Juan to visiting only the Picuris Mountains, nor do they preclude undonated mines or other ranges in Texas. Without such constraints, the existence of a Texas mountain range visited by Juan remains possible.

**Lean Proof Attempt:**
- Formalized premises and proved `LocatedIn picuris texas` is false (by contradiction: the donated mine violates the "no donated mines in Texas ranges" rule).
- Unable to prove the negation of the existential conclusion (Juan visiting any Texas range) because:
  1. Equality between `mr` (the hypothetical Texas range) and `picuris` cannot be established.
  2. No information implies Juan *only* visited the Picuris Mountains.
- Proof of the theorem `no_visit_in_texas` requires showing no such `mr` exists, but the case where `mr ≠ picuris` has no contradiction.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect declaration of constants. In Lean 4, constants must be declared individually using `constant` instead of grouped under `constants`. Additionally, the lemma and theorem references failed because the constants weren't properly declared. Here's the corrected code:

axiom MountainRange : obj → Prop
axiom LocatedIn : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Visited : obj → obj → Prop

  -- Case where mr ≠ picuris: No contradiction possible
  · have no_mine_in_mr : ¬ ∃ m, Mine m ∧ LocatedIn m mr ∧ Donated m := 
      T4 mr hMr hLoc
    -- No premises link Juan's visits to mine donations or constrain other ranges
    admit
</lean>

**Explanation of Failure**:  
The premises prove that Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas (due to the donated mine violating T4). However, the conclusion claims Juan visited *some* mountain range in Texas. While Picuris is ruled out, there might exist *other* mountain ranges in Texas that Juan visited, as the premises:  
1. Don't constrain Juan to visiting only Picuris  
2. Don't prohibit undonated mines in Texas ranges  
3. Don't provide information about other ranges  
The `admit` in the `mr ≠ picuris` case reflects this missing contradiction. Thus, the negation cannot be proven.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to improper handling of type declarations and constant definitions in Lean 4. The key issues were:
1. Using `axiom` for type declaration (`obj : Type`) instead of `constant`
2. Grouping multiple constants in a single declaration
3. Incorrect existential witness construction in the lemma

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
constant obj : Type

constant MountainRange : obj → Prop
constant LocatedIn : obj → obj → Prop
constant Visited : obj → obj → Prop
constant Mine : obj → Prop
constant Donated : obj → Prop

constant juan : obj
constant picuris : obj
constant harding : obj
constant newMexico : obj
constant texas : obj

axiom T1 : MountainRange picuris ∧ (LocatedIn picuris newMexico ∨ LocatedIn picuris texas)
axiom T2 : Visited juan picuris
axiom T3 : Mine harding ∧ LocatedIn harding picuris ∧ Donated harding
axiom T4 : ∀ (mr : obj), MountainRange mr → LocatedIn mr texas → ¬ ∃ (m : obj), Mine m ∧ LocatedIn m mr ∧ Donated m

lemma Picuris_not_in_Texas : ¬ LocatedIn picuris texas := by
  intro hIn
  have no_mine := T4 picuris T1.left hIn
  have witness : ∃ (m : obj), Mine m ∧ LocatedIn m picuris ∧ Donated m := ⟨harding, T3.left, T3.right.left, T3.right.right⟩
  exact no_mine witness

theorem no_visit_in_texas : ¬ ∃ (mr : obj), MountainRange mr ∧ LocatedIn mr texas ∧ Visited juan mr := by
  intro ⟨mr, hMr, hLoc, hVisit⟩
  by_cases hEq : mr = picuris
  · subst hEq
    exact Picuris_not_in_Texas hLoc
  · have no_mine := T4 mr hMr hLoc
    admit
</lean>

**Explanation of Failure**:  
The premises prove that the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas (lemma `Picuris_not_in_Texas`), as their donated mine violates axiom T4. However, the conclusion claims Juan visited *some* mountain range in Texas. While Picuris is ruled out:
- There might exist other mountain ranges in Texas
- Juan might have visited other Texas ranges besides Picuris
- The premises don't constrain Juan to visiting only Picuris
- Axiom T4 only prohibits donated mines in Texas ranges, but doesn't prevent undonated mines or unvisited ranges

The `admit` in the `mr ≠ picuris` case confirms no contradiction exists for other ranges. Thus, the negation of the conclusion cannot be proven.
