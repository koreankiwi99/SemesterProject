The translation of the natural language reasoning into Lean code involves defining the necessary types, predicates, and axioms based on the given premises. The goal is to attempt to prove that "Windy is a great shooter" is false (i.e., prove `¬GreatShooter Windy`). If this proof succeeds, the answer is "False"; otherwise, it is "Failure".

### Analysis:
- **Premise 1**: If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.  
  Formalized as: `∀ x y, Man x → Man y → Taller x y → Block x y`
- **Premise 2**: Michael is a man taller than everyone else in his class (excluding himself).  
  Formalized as: `Man Michael ∧ ∀ x, Class x → x ≠ Michael → Taller Michael x`
- **Premise 3**: Transitivity of "taller than".  
  Formalized as: `∀ x y z, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z`
- **Premise 4**: Peter is a man taller than Michael.  
  Formalized as: `Man Peter ∧ Taller Peter Michael`
- **Premise 5**: Michael can block any person's shooting if the person does not jump.  
  Formalized as: `∀ x, Person x → (¬ Jump x → Block Michael x)`
- **Premise 6**: Every shooter who jumps is a great shooter.  
  Formalized as: `∀ x, (Shooter x ∧ Jump x) → GreatShooter x`
- **Premise 7**: Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.  
  Formalized as: `¬ Block Michael Windy`
- **Additional**: Windy is a person and a shooter (implied by context).  
  Formalized as: `Person Windy ∧ Shooter Windy`

### Attempt to Prove `¬GreatShooter Windy`:
1. From Premise 5 and Premise 7:  
   - `Person Windy → (¬ Jump Windy → Block Michael Windy)`  
   - `¬ Block Michael Windy`  
   - Using modus tollens: `¬ (¬ Jump Windy)` → `Jump Windy`  
   Thus, `Jump Windy` is proven.

2. From Premise 6:  
   - `(Shooter Windy ∧ Jump Windy) → GreatShooter Windy`  
   - Since `Shooter Windy` and `Jump Windy` hold, `GreatShooter Windy` follows.

### Conclusion:
The premises imply `GreatShooter Windy` (Windy is a great shooter). There is no contradiction or way to prove `¬GreatShooter Windy`. Therefore, the proof of the negation fails.

The error occurred in the `Jump_Windy` theorem where an `intro` tactic was used incorrectly. The proof should use proof by contradiction via the classical `by_contra` tactic instead. Here's the corrected Lean code:

-- Prove Jump Windy via contradiction using R5 and R7

</lean>

**Explanation:**
1. **Theorem `Jump_Windy`** is now proven by contradiction:
   - Assume `¬Jump Windy` (using `by_contra`)
   - Apply R5 to get `Block Michael Windy`
   - This contradicts axiom R7 (`¬Block Michael Windy`)

2. **Theorem `Windy_great`** follows directly from R6, given `Windy_shooter` and `Jump_Windy`.

3. **Failed proof attempt (example):** 
   - We attempt to prove `¬GreatShooter Windy`
   - But we already have `Windy_great : GreatShooter Windy`, causing an immediate contradiction with any assumption of `¬GreatShooter Windy`.

Since we successfully proved `GreatShooter Windy` and cannot prove its negation (as attempted in the failing example), the answer is:

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to the use of the `by_contra` tactic without importing the required classical reasoning tools. Additionally, the `contradiction` tactic failed because it requires explicit contradictory hypotheses. The corrected solution:

1. Adds an explicit excluded middle axiom (`em`) for classical reasoning
2. Proves `Jump Windy` using case analysis on `em (Jump Windy)`
3. Proves `GreatShooter Windy` using the previous result
4. Shows that attempting to prove the negation leads to contradiction

-- Final result shows negation cannot be proved
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

**Explanation:**  
The premises imply `GreatShooter Windy` (Windy is a great shooter) through:
1. `R7` and `R5` prove Windy jumps (`Jump_Windy`)
2. `R6` combines this with `Windy_shooter` to prove greatness (`Windy_great`)

Since we've successfully proven `GreatShooter Windy`, attempting to prove its negation (`¬GreatShooter Windy`) results in contradiction. The conclusion that "Windy is a great shooter" is therefore true, making its negation unprovable from the premises.
