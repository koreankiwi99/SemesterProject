ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred due to the use of `nomatch c`, which is not a valid tactic in this context. The proof attempt failed because no contradiction could be derived from the premises. Specifically:

1. The premises establish that Barutin Cove is located in Snow Island, which is in the South Shetland Islands.
2. Antarctica is also located in the South Shetland Islands.
3. There is no premise stating that Barutin Cove is located in Antarctica or that Snow Island and Antarctica are disjoint.
4. The transitivity axiom only chains locations but cannot derive a relationship between Barutin Cove and Antarctica.
5. The existence of another cove in Antarctica named after a Bulgarian place cannot be disproven, as no premises constrain other coves.

Thus, the negation of the statement cannot be proven. The corrected Lean code uses `sorry` to indicate the unprovable step.
