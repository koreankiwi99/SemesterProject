The premises state:
- Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island, interpreted as Barutin Cove being located in Snow Island.
- Snow Island is located in the South Shetland Islands.
- Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands, interpreted as Antarctica being located in the South Shetland Islands.
- Transitivity: If A is in B and B is in C, then A is in C.

The statement to evaluate is "Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica." To prove this false, we must prove Barutin Cove is located in Antarctica.

Using transitivity:
- Barutin Cove is in Snow Island (P1).
- Snow Island is in South Shetland Islands (P2).
- Thus, Barutin Cove is in South Shetland Islands (by transitivity).

However:
- Antarctica is in South Shetland Islands (P4).

There is no premise stating that South Shetland Islands is located in Antarctica or that Antarctica contains South Shetland Islands. Therefore, Barutin Cove being in South Shetland Islands and Antarctica being in South Shetland Islands does not imply Barutin Cove is in Antarctica. The chain of location cannot be completed.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to a naming conflict with the `Trans` axiom, which is a reserved typeclass in Lean. To resolve this, the axiom has been renamed to `loc_trans`. Additionally, the application of the transitivity axiom has been simplified by leveraging Lean's type inference, removing the need to explicitly specify place arguments.

The premises establish:
- Barutin Cove is located in Snow Island (`P1`)
- Snow Island is located in South Shetland Islands (`P2`)
- Antarctica is located in South Shetland Islands (`P4`)
- Transitivity of location (`loc_trans`)

The theorem `barutin_in_south_shetland` proves Barutin Cove is in South Shetland Islands via transitivity applied to `P1` and `P2`. However, there is no premise linking South Shetland Islands to Antarctica in the required direction (we only have Antarctica → South Shetland, not South Shetland → Antarctica). Thus, proving "Barutin Cove is located in Antarctica" (which would falsify the given statement) is impossible with the provided premises.
