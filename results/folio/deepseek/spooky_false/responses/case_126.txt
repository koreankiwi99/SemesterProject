The natural language reasoning establishes that Rock must have wings based on the given premises. The premises lead to a case analysis where, regardless of whether Rock is a monkey or a bird, it can fly. Since Rock is Peter's pet and can fly, it must have wings by the sixth premise. This contradicts the statement "Rock does not have wings," proving it false.
