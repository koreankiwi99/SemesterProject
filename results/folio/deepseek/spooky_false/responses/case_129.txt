The reasoning in the context leads to a situation where it's possible for John to be engaged without contradicting the premises. Specifically, if John has a well-attended wedding and a larger family (consistent with the existential premise), he can be engaged and make wedding plans (via the chain: well-attended → invites others → wedding plans → engaged), while not inviting friends satisfies the fifth premise. The sixth premise is also satisfied by having a well-attended wedding. Since no contradiction arises from assuming John is engaged, the negation cannot be proven.

The compilation errors occurred because the variable declarations for predicates were not properly formatted. In Lean 4, when declaring predicates (e.g., `obj → Prop`), they must be explicitly defined as functions. The corrected code uses `axiom` declarations for all entities and predicates to ensure proper typing.

After analyzing the premises and attempting to prove that "John is engaged" is false (i.e., prove `¬ engaged John`), no contradiction can be derived. The existential premise (T4) applies to some unspecified individual, not necessarily John, and the conditional premises (T5-T6) do not force contradictory obligations on John when combined with the universal premises (T1-T3). Therefore, the negation cannot be proven.
