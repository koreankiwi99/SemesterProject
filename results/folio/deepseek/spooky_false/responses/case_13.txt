The premises provide information about the Legend of Zelda and general conditions for games, but contain no data about FIFA 22. Specifically:
- Legend of Zelda was created by a Japanese company (given)
- Legend of Zelda sold over a million copies (given)
- Games selling over a million copies appear on the Top 10 list (implication)
- All Top 10 listed games are Japanese-made (universal)

These establish properties about Legend of Zelda (it must be on Top 10 and Japanese-made), but no connection exists to FIFA 22. The premises don't mention FIFA 22's sales, Top 10 status, or manufacturer. Thus, no inference can be made about FIFA 22's manufacturer, positive or negative. 

<lean>
axiom Game : Type
axiom Top10 : Game → Prop
axiom JapaneseMade : Game → Prop
axiom SellsOverMillion : Game → Prop

axiom zelda : Game
axiom fifa22 : Game

-- Premises
axiom created_zelda_japanese : JapaneseMade zelda
axiom top10_japanese : ∀ g, Top10 g → JapaneseMade g
axiom million_in_top10 : ∀ g, SellsOverMillion g → Top10 g
axiom zelda_sold_million : SellsOverMillion zelda

-- Proving zelda's properties (verifies premise consistency)
theorem zelda_in_top10 : Top10 zelda := million_in_top10 zelda zelda_sold_million
theorem zelda_japanese_verified : JapaneseMade zelda := top10_japanese zelda zelda_in_top10

-- Attempt to prove FIFA 22 is NOT Japanese-made
theorem disprove_fifa22_japanese : ¬JapaneseMade fifa22 :=
  by 
    -- No premises connect to fifa22 → no proof possible
    -- Cannot proceed without additional axioms
    sorry -- Proof incomplete
