The premises establish that platypuses are mammals and have no teeth, directly supporting the statement "Platypuses are mammals with no teeth." Attempting to prove the negation of this statement (i.e., that platypuses are either not mammals or have teeth) leads to a contradiction with the premises. Specifically:
- The premise "Platypuses are mammals" (`T3`) contradicts the disjunct "platypuses are not mammals."
- The premise "Platypuses have no teeth" (`T2`) contradicts the disjunct "platypuses have teeth."

Thus, the negation cannot be proven from the given premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Platypus : obj
axiom Human : obj
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom Teeth : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∃ x, Mammal x ∧ Teeth x
axiom T2 : ¬ Teeth Platypus
axiom T3 : Mammal Platypus
axiom T4 : Teeth Human

-- Attempt to prove the negation of "Platypuses are mammals with no teeth"
theorem prove_negation : ¬ (Mammal Platypus ∧ ¬ Teeth Platypus) :=
  by
    intro h  -- Assume the statement is true
    have ⟨mammal_platypus, no_teeth⟩ := h  -- Split the conjunction
    -- We have T3: Mammal Platypus (matches mammal_platypus) and T2: ¬Teeth Platypus (matches no_teeth)
    -- No contradiction found; negation cannot be proven
    sorry  -- Proof incomplete
