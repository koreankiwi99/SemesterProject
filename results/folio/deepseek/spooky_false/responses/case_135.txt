The premises establish that:
- Plungers, vacuums, and vampires all suck.
- Space is a vacuum, so space sucks.
- Dusts are household appliances that do not suck.

To prove that "Space is a vampire" is false, we need to show that space cannot be a vampire. However:
- The premises confirm that vacuums suck and vampires suck, but do not state that vacuums cannot be vampires.
- Space sucks (because it is a vacuum), which is consistent with vampire behavior (since vampires suck).
- There is no premise linking vacuums and vampires in a mutually exclusive way.
- The duster premise only provides that dusters do not suck, but space is not a duster (and we have no premise that vacuums cannot be dusters, though it's logically deducible that space isn't a duster due to sucking, but this doesn't affect vampire status).

Thus, while we can prove space is not a duster (since it sucks), we cannot prove space is not a vampire. The premises allow for the possibility that space could be both a vacuum and a vampire.

-- Prove space sucks (as a vacuum)
theorem space_sucks : Suck space := vacuums_suck space space_vacuum

-- Prove space is not a duster (since it sucks)
theorem not_duster : ¬IsDuster space :=

-- Attempt to prove space is not a vampire fails
-- No contradiction if space were a vampire: 
--   vampires_suck space would give Suck space (already true)
-- No premise prevents vacuums from being vampires
