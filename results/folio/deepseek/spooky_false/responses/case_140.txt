The premises provide consistent information, and while it can be proved that "Hachi: A dog's Tale" does not contain excessive erotic and violent content, it cannot be definitively proven that it is not in the "Frozen" series. The disjunction conclusion requires showing that both parts are false, which is not possible with the given premises.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After analyzing the compilation errors, I made the following corrections:
1. Changed `constant Hachi : Film` to `axiom Hachi : Film` for consistency with other declarations
2. Explicitly applied all predicates to `Hachi` in proof steps instead of using `_` placeholders
3. The proof of `¬ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi` is now valid

However, the negation of the conclusion "Hachi contains excessive content or is in Frozen series" requires proving both:
- ¬ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi (which we proved)
- ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi (which cannot be proved from premises)

Since we cannot prove the complete negation (both conjunctions), we return Failure.
