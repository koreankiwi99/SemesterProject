After translating the premises into Lean and attempting to prove the negation of the statement, the proof fails. The reasoning is as follows:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - `∀ x, AllAges x → CanWatchWithout x`: If a film is appropriate for all ages, children can watch without parental guidance.
   - `∀ x, Excessive x → ¬CanWatchWithout x`: Excessive films prevent children from watching without guidance.
   - `∀ x, GARated x → AllAges x`: General Audience (GA) ratings imply appropriateness for all ages.
   - `∀ x, FamilyFriendlyAnimated x → GARated x`: Family-friendly animated films are GA-rated.
   - `∀ x, InFrozenSeries x → FamilyFriendlyAnimated x`: Frozen series films are family-friendly animated.
   - `FamilyFriendlyAnimated hachi ∨ AllAges hachi`: "Hachi" is either family-friendly animated or appropriate for all ages.

2. **Key Inference**:
   - From `FamilyFriendlyAnimated hachi ∨ AllAges hachi`, both cases imply `¬Excessive hachi`:
     - If family-friendly animated, it is GA-rated (via `P4`), appropriate for all ages (via `P3`), and children can watch without guidance (via `P1`), so it cannot be excessive (`P2`).
     - If appropriate for all ages, directly leads to `¬Excessive hachi` via `P1` and `P2`.

3. **Statement Negation Attempt**:
   The goal is to disprove:  
   `(Excessive hachi ∧ InFrozenSeries hachi) ∨ (¬Excessive hachi ∧ ¬InFrozenSeries hachi)`.  
   Since `¬Excessive hachi` is proven, the statement simplifies to:  
   `¬InFrozenSeries hachi` (as the first disjunct is false, and the second disjunct reduces to `¬InFrozenSeries hachi`).  
   However:
   - **No information on `InFrozenSeries hachi`**: The premises confirm `FamilyFriendlyAnimated x → GARated x` for *any* film, not just Frozen series films. "Hachi" could be family-friendly animated without being in the Frozen series.
   - **No contradiction**: `¬InFrozenSeries hachi` is possible (e.g., "Hachi" is family-friendly animated but not a Frozen film), making the original statement true in this scenario.

4. **Conclusion**: The negation of the statement cannot be proven from the premises. The outcome depends on whether "Hachi" is in the Frozen series, which is unknown.

ITERATION 2

After analyzing the errors, I've corrected the Lean code. The primary issues were:
1. Syntax errors in lemma definitions (using `:` instead of `:=` in term mode)
2. Incorrect use of `cases` with named patterns without proper scoping
3. Missing proof for the second disjunct in the negation proof

The corrected code properly defines the lemma using term mode and handles the first disjunct of the negation proof. However, the second disjunct remains unprovable because:
- We know ¬Excessive hachi (from the lemma)
- But we have no premise forcing InFrozenSeries hachi to be true or false
- P5 only states Frozen films are family-friendly, not the converse
- P6 shows hachi is family-friendly or all-ages, but neither implies Frozen membership

Thus, we cannot derive a contradiction in the second case.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

After analyzing the errors, I've corrected the Lean code by using proper tactic mode syntax throughout. The key fixes are:
1. Replaced term-mode proofs (`fun x => ...`) with tactic-mode proofs (`by ...`)
2. Used `intro` instead of lambda abstraction for implications
3. Structured case analysis properly with `cases` and dot notation
4. Removed unnecessary type annotations causing syntax errors

The proof shows:
1. `¬Excessive hachi` is provable from premises
2. The first disjunct (`Excessive ∧ InFrozenSeries`) leads to contradiction
3. The second disjunct (`¬Excessive ∧ ¬InFrozenSeries`) cannot be contradicted because:
   - Premises don't force family-friendly films to be in Frozen series
   - No information connects all-ages appropriateness to Frozen series

Thus, the negation of the statement cannot be proven.
