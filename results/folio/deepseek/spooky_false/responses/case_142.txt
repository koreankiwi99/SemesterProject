The natural language reasoning is translated into Lean 4 to evaluate the statement "Some Heck cattle are artificially selected." The premises provide the following:

1. Breeding back implies artificial selection.
2. All Heck cattle are bred back.
3. Heck cattle are animals.
4. Aurochs are animals (though not directly used).
5. There exists an animal that is bred back and resembles an extinct animal.

The statement asserts that there exists a Heck cattle that is artificially selected. Its negation is ¬∃ x, Heck x ∧ ArtificiallySelected x (i.e., no Heck cattle are artificially selected).

**Proof Attempt:**
- From `P2`, every Heck cattle is bred back.
- From `P1`, every bred back animal is artificially selected.
- Thus, any Heck cattle (if it exists) must be artificially selected.
- However, attempting to prove the negation:
  - Assume there exists a Heck cattle `x`.
  - Then `x` is bred back (`P2 x`) and artificially selected (`P1 x`).
  - To prove the negation, we need ¬ArtificiallySelected x, but we have ArtificiallySelected x, leading to no contradiction (only the existence of equivalently proven facts).
- Premise 5 confirms existence of *a* bred back animal, but not necessarily a Heck cattle.
- The existence of Heck cattle is not explicitly affirmed nor denied in the premises, creating a gap:
  - If a Heck cattle exists, the original statement holds, making the negation false.
  - If no Heck cattle exists, the negation holds.
- Since neither scenario is provable from the premises, the negation remains unverified.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred due to incorrect proof structure. The term `(fun x => x) hArt` was applied unnecessarily and `by admit` was misplaced. The corrected Lean code uses a direct approach to prove the negation but fails due to insufficient premises.

</lean>

**Explanation:**  
The proof attempts to derive a contradiction from assuming `∃ x, Heck x ∧ ArtificiallySelected x`. While `P2` and `P1` show any Heck cattle must be artificially selected, no contradiction arises because:
1. The premises don't confirm Heck cattle exist (despite historical implication).
2. Premise 5's existence claim doesn't specify Heck cattle.
3. The assumption `hArt` (artificially selected) aligns with derived `hSelected`.

Since no contradiction is found and the existence of Heck cattle isn't provable, the negation cannot be verified.
