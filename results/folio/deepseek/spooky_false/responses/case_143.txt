The premises state that Heck cattle were bred back to resemble aurochs and that some bred-back animals resemble extinct animals. However, the existence of one bred-back animal (Heck cattle) resembling aurochs does not force aurochs to be extinct, as the premise about resembling extinct animals could refer to a different animal. No premise provides evidence that aurochs are not extinct, nor does assuming aurochs are extinct create a contradiction. Therefore, the negation of "Aurochs are extinct" cannot be proven from the given premises.

axiom BredBack : Animal → Prop
axiom Resemble : Animal → Animal → Prop
axiom Extinct : Animal → Prop

-- Premise: Heck cattle were bred back
axiom h_heck_bred : BredBack heck_cattle

-- Premise: Heck cattle resemble aurochs
axiom h_heck_resemble : Resemble heck_cattle aurochs

-- Premise: Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals
axiom h_some : ∃ (x y : Animal), BredBack x ∧ Extinct y ∧ Resemble x y

-- Attempt to prove aurochs are not extinct
theorem disprove_extinct : ¬ Extinct aurochs := by
  -- Assume aurochs are extinct
  intro h_extinct
  -- Since Heck cattle are bred back and resemble the (assumed extinct) aurochs, 
  -- they witness the existential in `h_some`
  have witnesses : ∃ (x y : Animal), BredBack x ∧ Extinct y ∧ Resemble x y :=
    ⟨heck_cattle, aurochs, h_heck_bred, h_extinct, h_heck_resemble⟩
  -- But `h_some` already asserts this existential. No contradiction arises.
  -- We cannot prove anything false since the premises are consistent with both extinction and non-extinction
  -- When `h_some` is satisfied by other animals unknown to us, no conclusion about aurochs follows.
  sorry -- Proof fails at this point
