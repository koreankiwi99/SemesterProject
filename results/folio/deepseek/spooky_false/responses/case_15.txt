The reasoning involves translating the given context and statement into Lean. The context provides two premises:
1. All squares are four-sided: ∀ x, Square x → FourSided x
2. All four-sided things are shapes: ∀ x, FourSided x → Shape x

The statement to evaluate is: "All squares are shapes" (∀ x, Square x → Shape x). However, the task requires attempting to prove the negation of this statement (i.e., ¬∀ x, Square x → Shape x, which is equivalent to ∃ x, Square x ∧ ¬Shape x).

From the premises, we can derive ∀ x, Square x → Shape x by transitivity. Therefore, the negation cannot be proven, as it contradicts the premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Square : obj → Prop
axiom FourSided : obj → Prop
axiom Shape : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : ∀ x, Square x → FourSided x
axiom T2 : ∀ x, FourSided x → Shape x

-- The conclusion "All squares are shapes" is provable:
theorem valid_conclusion : ∀ x, Square x → Shape x := 
  fun x h => T2 x (T1 x h)

-- Attempting to prove the negation of the statement (that the conclusion is false):
-- We need to prove: ¬ (∀ x, Square x → Shape x)
-- This is equivalent to: ∃ x, Square x ∧ ¬ Shape x
-- However, no such x exists because:
--   For any x with Square x, we have FourSided x (by T1) and then Shape x (by T2).
-- Thus, we cannot construct a proof of the negation.
