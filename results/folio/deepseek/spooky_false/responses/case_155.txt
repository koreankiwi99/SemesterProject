The premises state that all humans are mortal and all Greeks are humans. The conclusion claims that some Greeks are mortal. However, the premises do not assert the existence of any Greeks. If there are no Greeks, the premises hold true (vacuously for universal quantifiers), but the existential conclusion is false. Since existence is not guaranteed, we cannot definitively prove the negation of the conclusion (that no Greeks are mortal) solely from the given premises. The proof attempt fails because the domain might be empty.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to using `cases'` instead of `cases` and failing to derive a contradiction. After correction, the proof attempt shows:
1. Assuming a witness `w` exists that is both Greek and mortal
2. Deriving that `w` must be mortal via the premises
3. Observing this confirms rather than contradicts the assumption

Since no contradiction is found, the negation cannot be proven. The premises are consistent with both:
- A world with Greeks (who would be mortal)
- A world without Greeks (making the existential false)

Thus, the proof fails.
