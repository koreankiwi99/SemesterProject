The reasoning chain shows that James must be in the computer science department due to his lab work and associated coursework, yet if he had a part-time job, he would be working in the library (which prohibits computer science students). This contradiction proves that James cannot have the part-time job.

axiom Student : Type
axiom James : Student
axiom LibraryWorker : Student → Prop
axiom CSDept : Student → Prop
axiom PartTimeJob : Student → Prop
axiom TakingDatabase : Student → Prop
axiom TakingWithDavid : Student → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ s : Student, LibraryWorker s → ¬ CSDept s
axiom A2 : ∀ s : Student, PartTimeJob s → LibraryWorker s
axiom A3 : ∀ s : Student, TakingDatabase s → CSDept s
axiom A4 : ∀ s : Student, TakingWithDavid s → TakingDatabase s
axiom A5 : ∀ s : Student, LabWorker s → TakingWithDavid s
axiom A6 : LabWorker James
axiom A7 : ¬LabWorker James ∨ ¬PartTimeJob James

ANSWER: False
