The premises state that hawks never swim and that some birds are hawks. The statement to evaluate claims that all birds swim. 

Using the premises, we can derive a contradiction to the statement:
1. There exists an individual (call it `a`) that is both a bird and a hawk (from premise 2).
2. Since `a` is a hawk, it does not swim (from premise 1).
3. But if all birds swim (the statement), then `a` must swim because it is a bird.
4. This leads to a contradiction: `a` both swims and does not swim.

Thus, the statement "All birds swim" is false.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Hawk : obj → Prop
axiom Bird : obj → Prop
axiom Swims : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x, Hawk x → ¬ Swims x
axiom P2 : ∃ x, Bird x ∧ Hawk x

  intro H
  rcases P2 with ⟨a, bird_a, hawk_a⟩

  have swim_a : Swims a := H a bird_a
