The premises establish that there exists a show airing at 8 pm on Monday that gives out roses, which must be an episode of The Bachelor. Such episodes portray real lives and are reality TV shows. Breaking Bad is explicitly not a reality TV show. However, the premises do not prohibit multiple shows from airing simultaneously at 8 pm on Monday. While Breaking Bad cannot be the specific show that gives out roses (as that would require it to be a reality show), it could potentially air at the same time without giving roses. There is no premise stating exclusivity of time slots or linking non-reality shows to specific scheduling constraints. Thus, the negation of the statement cannot be proven from the given premises.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After analyzing the reasoning and the compilation errors, I've revised the Lean code. The core issue is that the premises do not provide enough constraints to prove that Breaking Bad cannot air at 8 pm Monday. While we can show the rose-giving show at that time must be a reality show (and Breaking Bad isn't), multiple shows could air simultaneously at that time slot since exclusivity isn't specified.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Show : Type
axiom breakingBad : Show
axiom AirsOnMonday8pm : Show → Prop
axiom GivesRoses : Show → Prop
axiom IsBachelorEpisode : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
axiom IsRealityShow : Show → Prop

axiom P1 : ∃ s, AirsOnMonday8pm s ∧ GivesRoses s
axiom P2 : ∀ s, GivesRoses s → IsBachelorEpisode s
axiom P3 : ∀ s, IsBachelorEpisode s → PortraysRealPeople s
axiom P4 : ∀ s, PortraysRealPeople s → IsRealityShow s
axiom P5 : ¬ IsRealityShow breakingBad

theorem not_breakingBad_at_8pm : ¬ AirsOnMonday8pm breakingBad := 
  fun h : AirsOnMonday8pm breakingBad => 
  let ⟨s0, h_s0_air, h_s0_roses⟩ := P1
  have h_s0_bachelor : IsBachelorEpisode s0 := P2 s0 h_s0_roses
  have h_s0_real : PortraysRealPeople s0 := P3 s0 h_s0_bachelor
  have h_s0_reality : IsRealityShow s0 := P4 s0 h_s0_real
  -- Breaking Bad cannot be the rose-giving show
  have breakingBad_not_s0 : breakingBad ≠ s0 := 
    fun heq : breakingBad = s0 => 
    have bb_reality : IsRealityShow breakingBad := heq ▸ h_s0_reality
    P5 bb_reality
  -- However: No premise prevents multiple shows at same time
  -- h shows BB airs at 8pm, h_s0_air shows s0 airs at 8pm
  -- But no contradiction since timeslot might have multiple shows
  False.elim (by
    -- Attempt to find contradiction fails
    -- No relation between non-rose shows and reality status
    apply breakingBad_not_s0
    -- Try to prove breakingBad = s0? No, since:
    -- We have no axiom ∀ s, AirsOnMonday8pm s → s = s0
    sorry
  )
</lean>

The proof fails at the `sorry` because:
1. We have no premise that the 8 pm Monday slot is exclusive
2. Breaking Bad airing at that time doesn't force it to be the rose-giving show
3. Non-reality shows aren't prohibited from airing during that time slot

Thus, the negation of "Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm" cannot be proven.
