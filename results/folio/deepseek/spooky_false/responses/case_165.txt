The reasoning involves translating the natural language context into Lean and attempting to prove that the statement "If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm" is false. The premises establish that:
1. There exists a show airing Monday at 8 pm that gives roses.
2. Any show giving roses must be an episode of The Bachelor.
3. The Bachelor portrays real people.
4. All shows portraying real people are reality TV shows.
5. Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

From these, it follows that Breaking Bad cannot give roses (since that would require it to be a reality TV show, contradicting premise 5). Thus, the antecedent "roses are given out during Breaking Bad" is false, making the entire implication true. Consequently, the negation of the statement cannot be proven.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the attempt to prove the negation of the implication relied on constructing `GivesRoses BreakingBad`, which contradicts the previously established theorem `no_roses`. After analyzing the premises, it becomes clear that:

1. The implication "if roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it airs Monday at 8 pm" is logically true because the antecedent (`GivesRoses BreakingBad`) is false (as proven by `no_roses`).
2. Proving the negation of a true implication would require deriving a contradiction, which is impossible given the premises.

The corrected Lean code below formalizes the logic and shows the failed proof attempt for the negation. Since the negation cannot be proven, the result is "Failure".
