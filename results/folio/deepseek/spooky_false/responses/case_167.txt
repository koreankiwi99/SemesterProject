The premises state that Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician and a member of both legislative bodies. The statement claims that some German politician was part of both bodies, which Heinrich Schmidt satisfies. Attempting to prove the negation (that no such politician exists) leads to a contradiction with the premises, as Heinrich Schmidt serves as a counterexample. However, the Lean proof below demonstrates that the negation cannot be proven, as no contradiction arises without additional negative premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : obj
axiom GermanPolitician : obj → Prop
axiom InPrussianParliament : obj → Prop
axiom InNaziReichstag : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : GermanPolitician HeinrichSchmidt
axiom T2 : InPrussianParliament HeinrichSchmidt
axiom T3 : InNaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt

theorem prove_negation : ¬∃ x, GermanPolitician x ∧ InPrussianParliament x ∧ InNaziReichstag x := 
  by
    intro h  -- Assume the existential claim
    -- Extract witness and evidence from the existential
    rcases h with ⟨w, h_gp, h_pp, h_nr⟩
    -- No contradiction: Premises support the existence of HeinrichSchmidt, 
    -- but do not prohibit other individuals from satisfying the conditions.
    -- No negative premises (e.g., mutual exclusivity) are provided to derive False.
    -- Proof cannot be completed.
    sorry  -- Admission of unprovability
