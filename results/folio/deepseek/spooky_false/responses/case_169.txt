The Lean code models the given premises and attempts to prove that "Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer" is false. The axioms represent:
- Deadly diseases imply low survival rates (`A1`)
- Severe cancers are deadly diseases (`A2`)
- Bile duct cancers are severe cancers (`A3`)
- Cholangiocarcinomas are bile duct cancers (`A4`)
- Mild flu has a low survival rate (`A5`)
- Colorectal cancer is not both bile duct cancer and low-survival (`A6`)

The theorem `not_severe` attempts to prove that colorectal cancer is not severe cancer by assuming it and deriving a contradiction. However:
1. Assuming `SevereCancer ColorectalCancer` leads to `LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer` (via `A2` and `A1`)
2. With `A6`, this implies `¬BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer`
3. No premise forces colorectal cancer to be bile duct cancer or creates a contradiction

Thus, no contradiction arises, and the negation cannot be proven.
