The goal is to prove that the statement "Taylor visits the gym at least once a day" is false, based on the given premises. Here's the Lean 4 formalization:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Taylor : Person
axiom EatsSaladsRegularly : Person → Prop
axiom VeryConscious : Person → Prop
axiom GrewUpHealthConscious : Person → Prop
axiom FulfillNutrition : Person → Prop
axiom DisregardWellBeing : Person → Prop
axiom VisitGymDaily : Person → Prop

-- Premises from context
axiom P1 : ∀ p : Person, EatsSaladsRegularly p → VeryConscious p
axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, GrewUpHealthConscious p → EatsSaladsRegularly p
axiom P3 : ∀ p : Person, FulfillNutrition p → GrewUpHealthConscious p
axiom P4 : ∀ p : Person, DisregardWellBeing p → ¬ VeryConscious p
axiom P5 : ∀ p : Person, VisitGymDaily p → FulfillNutrition p
axiom P6 : (GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor ∧ DisregardWellBeing Taylor) ∨ 
            (¬ GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor ∧ ¬ DisregardWellBeing Taylor)

-- Core proof
theorem taylor_not_gym : ¬ VisitGymDaily Taylor := by
  intro hGym
  have hNutri : FulfillNutrition Taylor := P5 Taylor hGym
  have hGrew : GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor := P3 Taylor hNutri
  have hEat : EatsSaladsRegularly Taylor := P2 Taylor hGrew
  have hConsc : VeryConscious Taylor := P1 Taylor hEat
  cases P6
  case inl h =>  -- Health-conscious home and disregards well-being
    have hDisregard := h.2
    apply P4 Taylor hDisregard
    exact hConsc
  case inr h =>  -- Neither health-conscious home nor disregards well-being
    have hNotGrew := h.1
    contradiction
</lean>

**Explanation**:
- **Premise chains**: Gym visits imply fulfilling nutrition (`P5`), fulfilling nutrition implies health-conscious upbringing (`P3`), which implies eating salads (`P2`), which implies health consciousness (`P1`).
- **Taylor's dichotomy**: `P6` forces a choice between two mutually exclusive cases.
- **Contradiction in left case**: Health consciousness from salad-eating contradicts the disregard for well-being via `P4`.
- **Contradiction in right case**: Proved health-conscious upbringing (`hGrew`) directly contradicts ¬GrewUpHealthConscious from `P6`.
- Both cases yield contradictions under the assumption of gym visits, proving the negation.

ANSWER: False
