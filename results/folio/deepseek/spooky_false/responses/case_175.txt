The premises state that the summer Olympic games is a sporting event, the last edition was in Tokyo, and the United States won the most medals there. However, there is no information provided about the world championships. The premises do not mention the world championships, nor do they establish any relationship between the summer Olympic games and the world championships. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that the world championships is not a sporting event based solely on the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Event : Type
axiom SportingEvent : Event → Prop
axiom lastSummerOlympicGames : Event
axiom worldChampionships : Event
axiom T1 : SportingEvent lastSummerOlympicGames
axiom Location : Type
axiom tokyo : Location
axiom heldIn : Event → Location → Prop
axiom T2 : heldIn lastSummerOlympicGames tokyo
axiom Nation : Type
axiom unitedStates : Nation
axiom wonMostMedals : Nation → Event → Prop
axiom T3 : wonMostMedals unitedStates lastSummerOlympicGames

-- Attempt to prove ¬SportingEvent worldChampionships fails due to no relevant premises
theorem cannot_prove_negation : ¬SportingEvent worldChampionships → False :=
  fun h => by
    -- No axioms connect worldChampionships to premises; proof fails
    contradiction   -- Fails: no contradiction found
    done
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic failed to find a contradiction, as there are no premises connecting `worldChampionships` to the given axioms. After careful analysis, it's impossible to prove the negation of the statement ("The world championships is a sporting event") because the premises provide no information about the world championships.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Event : Type
axiom SportingEvent : Event → Prop
axiom lastSummerOlympicGames : Event
axiom worldChampionships : Event
axiom T1 : SportingEvent lastSummerOlympicGames
axiom Location : Type
axiom tokyo : Location
axiom heldIn : Event → Location → Prop
axiom T2 : heldIn lastSummerOlympicGames tokyo
axiom Nation : Type
axiom unitedStates : Nation
axiom wonMostMedals : Nation → Event → Prop
axiom T3 : wonMostMedals unitedStates lastSummerOlympicGames

-- Attempt to prove ¬SportingEvent worldChampionships
theorem cannot_prove_negation : ¬SportingEvent worldChampionships → False :=
  fun h => by
    -- No axioms mention worldChampionships or provide any connection
    -- to lastSummerOlympicGames that would yield a contradiction
    apply h  -- This would require proving ¬SportingEvent worldChampionships
    done     -- Proof fails: no premises available
</lean>

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `apply h` tactic attempted to prove `SportingEvent worldChampionships`, which has no supporting premises. After careful analysis, there is no way to prove the negation of the statement ("The world championships is a sporting event") because the premises provide no information about the world championships at all. The axioms only describe properties of the summer Olympic games.

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Event : Type
axiom SportingEvent : Event → Prop
axiom lastSummerOlympicGames : Event
axiom worldChampionships : Event
axiom T1 : SportingEvent lastSummerOlympicGames
axiom Location : Type
axiom tokyo : Location
axiom heldIn : Event → Location → Prop
axiom T2 : heldIn lastSummerOlympicGames tokyo
axiom Nation : Type
axiom unitedStates : Nation
axiom wonMostMedals : Nation → Event → Prop
axiom T3 : wonMostMedals unitedStates lastSummerOlympicGames

-- Attempt to prove ¬SportingEvent worldChampionships
theorem cannot_prove_negation : ¬SportingEvent worldChampionships → False :=
  fun h => by
    -- No axioms connect worldChampionships to any premises
    -- Cannot derive contradiction from h alone
    exact h ?_  -- Explicitly show missing proof for SportingEvent worldChampionships
</lean>
