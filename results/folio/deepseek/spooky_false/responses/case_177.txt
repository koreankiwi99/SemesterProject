The context states that the United States won the most medals in Tokyo, but it does not specify that this refers to the last summer Olympic games. It could refer to a different event in Tokyo. Therefore, we cannot prove that the United States won the most medals in the last summer Olympic games, nor can we prove the negation of this statement. The premises do not provide enough information to establish a contradiction or prove the negation.

<lean>
axiom Event : Type
axiom Location : Type
axiom Country : Type

axiom SummerOlympic : Event → Prop
axiom wasIn : Event → Location → Prop
axiom wonMostMedals : Country → Event → Prop

axiom lastSummerOlympic : Event
axiom Tokyo : Location
axiom UnitedStates : Country

axiom A1 : SummerOlympic lastSummerOlympic
axiom A2 : wasIn lastSummerOlympic Tokyo
axiom A3 : ∃ e : Event, wasIn e Tokyo ∧ wonMostMedals UnitedStates e

-- Attempt to prove the negation of the statement: ¬ wonMostMedals UnitedStates lastSummerOlympic
-- However, A3 only guarantees that *some* event in Tokyo had the US winning most medals, not necessarily the last summer Olympic games.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation.
