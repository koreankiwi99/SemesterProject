After analyzing the premises and attempting to prove the negation of the statement "Rockie is a turtle or cute," the following observations are made:

1. **Premises**:
   - All spotted rabbits are cute.
   - Some spotted turtles exist.
   - Only rabbits and squirrels are spotted.
   - Skittish implies not calm.
   - All spotted squirrels are skittish.
   - Rockie is spotted and calm.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Rockie is spotted, so by premise 3, Rockie must be a rabbit or squirrel.
   - **Squirrel case**: If Rockie is a squirrel, then by premise 5, Rockie is skittish. Premise 4 then implies Rockie is not calm, contradicting premise 6 (Rockie is calm). Thus, Rockie cannot be a squirrel.
   - **Rabbit case**: Rockie must be a rabbit (since squirrel is impossible). By premise 1, spotted rabbits are cute, so Rockie is cute.
   - Therefore, "Rockie is a turtle or cute" holds true (as Rockie is cute), making its negation false.

3. **Proof Attempt**:
   - The Lean code defines the predicates and premises and attempts to prove the negation ¬(Turtle Rockie ∨ Cute Rockie).
   - The squirrel branch derives a contradiction and closes.
   - The rabbit branch establishes Rockie is cute but cannot derive a contradiction for the disjunction, as rabbits being cute does not conflict with the premises (even if Rockie were also a turtle, but disjointness isn't assumed).
   - The existential premise (some turtle exists) doesn't impact Rockie’s case.

**Conclusion**: The negation cannot be proven. The statement is true.
