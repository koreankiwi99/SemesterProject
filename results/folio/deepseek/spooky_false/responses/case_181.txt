The premises do not allow us to prove that Tom is not a grumpy person. While we can derive that Tom is nice to animals and therefore not mean to animals, there is no premise stating that grumpy people must be mean to animals. Premise 2 only asserts that some grumpy people are mean to animals, which does not preclude the existence of grumpy people who are not mean to animals. Thus, Tom could potentially be grumpy without being mean to animals, and we cannot derive a contradiction from assuming Tom is grumpy. Therefore, the negation of the statement cannot be proven.

axiom obj : Type
axiom NiceToAnimals : obj → Prop
axiom MeanToAnimals : obj → Prop
axiom Grumpy : obj → Prop
axiom AnimalLover : obj → Prop
axiom PetOwner : obj → Prop
axiom Tom : obj

axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, NiceToAnimals x → ¬ MeanToAnimals x
axiom P2 : ∃ x : obj, Grumpy x ∧ MeanToAnimals x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, AnimalLover x → NiceToAnimals x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, PetOwner x → AnimalLover x
axiom P5 : PetOwner Tom

-- Attempt to prove ¬Grumpy Tom fails because:
-- 1. Tom is a pet owner (P5) → AnimalLover Tom (P4) → NiceToAnimals Tom (P3) → ¬MeanToAnimals Tom (P1)
-- 2. P2 shows ∃ a grumpy person who is mean to animals, but does not require all grumpy people to be mean.
-- No contradiction arises if Tom is grumpy but not mean to animals.
