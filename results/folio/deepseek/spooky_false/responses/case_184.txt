The premises do not allow us to prove that Dani Shapiro is not a novel writer. Specifically:
- Premise 6 states "Family History is a novel", and premise 5 states "Family History is written by Dani Shapiro".
- Premise 3 states that if a book is a novel and written by a person, then that person is a novel writer.
- However, the premises do not explicitly state that "Family History" is a book (only that it is a novel), so premise 3 cannot be directly applied to conclude Dani Shapiro is a novel writer.
- There is no premise contradicting Dani Shapiro being a novel writer (e.g., creating a podcast does not preclude novel writing).
- Therefore, the negation of the statement "Dani Shapiro is a novel writer" cannot be proven from the given premises.

    -- No premises provide evidence against Dani Shapiro being a novel writer.
    -- Premise 3 cannot be applied because we lack proof that FamilyHistory is a book.
    -- Premise 1 and 7 about podcasts do not relate to novel writing status.
    -- Thus, the negation cannot be proven.
