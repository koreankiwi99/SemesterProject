The premises provided do not allow us to prove that Dani Shapiro was not born in Boston. While Dani Shapiro being an American writer might suggest possible origins, there is no prerequisite linking this status exclusively to being born in an American city. The premise states that being born in an American city implies being American (sufficient condition), but it does not assert that American citizenship necessitates being born in such a city (necessary condition). Boston's status as an American city provides a potential birthplace but is not exclusive to Dani. Without premises specifically about Dani's birthplace or contradictions derived from other facts (e.g., the distinct nature of the novel and podcast), the negation cannot be proven.
