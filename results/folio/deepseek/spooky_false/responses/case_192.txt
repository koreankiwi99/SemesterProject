The natural language states that events are either happy or sad, which implies mutual exclusivity and exhaustiveness (each event is happy or sad but not both). Additionally, at least one event is happy. The statement to evaluate is "All events are sad." 

Using Lean, we formalize the premises:
- `Event` as a type.
- Predicates `Happy` and `Sad` for events.
- Premise 1: `∀ e, Happy e ↔ ¬ Sad e` (capturing exclusivity and exhaustiveness).
- Premise 2: `∃ e, Happy e`.

We prove the negation of the statement "All events are sad" (i.e., `¬ (∀ e, Sad e)`). This is equivalent to showing `∃ e, ¬ Sad e`. From premise 2, there exists a happy event `e₀`. By premise 1, `Happy e₀` implies `¬ Sad e₀`, contradicting the universal sadness claim. Thus, the statement "All events are sad" is false.
