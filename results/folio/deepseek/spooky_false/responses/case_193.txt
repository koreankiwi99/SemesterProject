The premises directly state that Steinhauer was the winner (axiom A1). The statement to evaluate claims Steinhauer was not the winner, which contradicts axiom A1. Therefore, the statement is false, and we can prove this by deriving a contradiction from the statement and axiom A1.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Steinhauer : obj
axiom Descampe : obj
axiom Winner : obj → Prop
axiom Participated : obj → Prop
axiom Leaderboard : obj → Prop
axiom Belgian : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : Winner Steinhauer
axiom A2 : Participated Steinhauer
axiom A3 : ∃ p : obj, Leaderboard p ∧ Belgian p
axiom A4 : Leaderboard Descampe ∧ Belgian Descampe
axiom A5 : ∀ p : obj, Leaderboard p → Participated p

theorem false_conclusion : ¬(¬Winner Steinhauer) := 
  fun h : ¬Winner Steinhauer => h A1

ANSWER: False
