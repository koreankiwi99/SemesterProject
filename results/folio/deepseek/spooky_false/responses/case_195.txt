The premises are consistent with both possibilities: KiKi being terricolous or not. While terricolous implies having legs (via P5), and having legs implies jumping (via P4), which implies Jane likes KiKi (via P3), there's no premise forcing KiKi to bark or not bark. Since Jane dislikes only animals that bark, her liking KiKi introduces no contradiction. Additionally, the conditional premise about KiKi (P7) doesn't resolve the terricolous status when KiKi jumps or has legs. Thus, proving the negation of the statement (¬Terricolous KiKi) from the premises is impossible.

axiom P3 : ∀ (a : Animal), Jump a → Like a
axiom P4 : ∀ (a : Animal), Legs a → Jump a
axiom P5 : ∀ (a : Animal), Terricolous a → Legs a
axiom P7 : (¬ Jump KiKi ∧ ¬ Legs KiKi) → (Terricolous KiKi ∨ Legs KiKi)

The compilation errors occurred due to the use of `constant` instead of `axiom` for declarations and potential parsing issues with the last premise. The corrected code uses `axiom` consistently and adds parentheses to clarify the structure of the implication in `P7`.

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom KiKi : Animal
axiom Bark : Animal → Prop
axiom Dog : Animal → Prop
axiom Like : Animal → Prop
axiom Jump : Animal → Prop
axiom Legs : Animal → Prop
axiom Terricolous : Animal → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ a : Animal, Bark a → ¬ Like a
axiom P2 : ∀ a : Animal, Dog a → Bark a
axiom P3 : ∀ a : Animal, Jump a → Like a
axiom P4 : ∀ a : Animal, Legs a → Jump a
axiom P5 : ∀ a : Animal, Terricolous a → Legs a
axiom P7 : (¬ (Jump KiKi) ∧ ¬ (Legs KiKi)) → (Terricolous KiKi ∨ Legs KiKi)
</lean>

**Proof Analysis:**  
The premises imply that KiKi must jump (via case analysis on `Legs KiKi` using `P4`, `P5`, `P7`, and classical logic). This means:  
- `Jump KiKi` holds (provable)  
- `Like KiKi` follows from `P3`  
- No premise forces KiKi to bark or be a dog  
- `Terricolous KiKi` implies `Legs KiKi` (via `P5`) and `Jump KiKi` (via `P4`), but this leads to no contradiction  
- The negation of `Terricolous KiKi` is consistent with the premises (e.g., KiKi could have legs and jump without being terricolous)  

Since the negation of "KiKi is terricolous" cannot be proven from the premises, the proof attempt fails.
