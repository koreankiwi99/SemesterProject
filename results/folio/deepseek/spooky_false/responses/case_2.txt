The reasoning process follows the given premises to evaluate the statement about Bonnie. The key steps involve:

1. Formalizing all premises as Lean axioms
2. Demonstrating that Bonnie must either chaperone dances or perform often
3. Showing that the consequent (Bonnie being young/academically ambitious AND inactive) leads to a contradiction if assumed

Here's the Lean translation:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Bonnie : obj

axiom Performs : obj → Prop
axiom AttendsEngaged : obj → Prop
axiom Inactive : obj → Prop
axiom Chaperones : obj → Prop
axiom Student : obj → Prop
axiom Young : obj → Prop
axiom WishAcademic : obj → Prop

-- Premise 1: Performers are engaged
axiom P1 : ∀ x, Performs x → AttendsEngaged x

-- Premise 2: Members perform or are inactive
axiom P2 : ∀ x, Performs x ∨ Inactive x

-- Premise 3: Chaperones aren't students
axiom P3 : ∀ x, Chaperones x → ¬ Student x

-- Premise 4: Inactive members chaperone
axiom P4 : ∀ x, Inactive x → Chaperones x

-- Premise 5: Young academic aspirants are students
axiom P5 : ∀ x, Young x → WishAcademic x → Student x

theorem bonnie_statement_false : 
  ¬ ((Chaperones Bonnie ∨ Performs Bonnie) → (Young Bonnie ∧ WishAcademic Bonnie) ∧ Inactive Bonnie) := by
  -- Assume the entire statement is true
  intro H
  -- Show Bonnie must chaperone or perform
  have h_disj : Chaperones Bonnie ∨ Performs Bonnie := by 
    cases (P2 Bonnie) with 
    | inl perf => exact .inr perf 
    | inr inac => exact .inl (P4 Bonnie inac)
  -- Apply implication to get consequent
  have h_conseq := H h_disj
  -- Extract inactivity and young/academic parts
  have h_inac := h_conseq.right
  have h_young_acad := h_conseq.left
  -- Young+academic implies student (P5)
  have h_student : Student Bonnie := P5 Bonnie h_young_acad.left h_young_acad.right
  -- Inactivity implies chaperone (P4)
  have h_chap : Chaperones Bonnie := P4 Bonnie h_inac
  -- But chaperones can't be students (P3)
  have h_not_student := P3 Bonnie h_chap
  -- Contradiction: both Student and ¬Student
  exact h_not_student h_student
</lean>

ANSWER: False

The Lean proof shows the statement leads to a contradiction (student vs non-student), proving the original statement about Bonnie is false.
