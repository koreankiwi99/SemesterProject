The statement to evaluate is: "Beijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics."

From the context:
- "Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics" is explicitly stated.
- "Beijing has hosted the Summer and Winter Olympics" confirms Beijing hosted at least one Winter Olympics event.

The statement requires:
1. Hosting the 2008 Summer Olympics (confirmed).
2. Hosting the Winter Olympics (any edition, confirmed).

Thus, the statement is true. Attempting to prove its negation leads to failure because the premises directly support the statement.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Beijing : obj
axiom Event : Type
axiom summer2008 : Event
axiom isSummerOlympics : Event → Prop
axiom isWinterOlympics : Event → Prop
axiom Hosts : obj → Event → Prop

-- Premises from context
axiom hosted_summer_2008 : Hosts Beijing summer2008
axiom is_summer_2008 : isSummerOlympics summer2008
axiom hosted_winter : ∃ e : Event, isWinterOlympics e ∧ Hosts Beijing e

-- Statement: Beijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.
-- Represented as: (Hosts Beijing summer2008) ∧ (∃ w, isWinterOlympics w ∧ Hosts Beijing w)
theorem prove_negation : ¬ (Hosts Beijing summer2008 ∧ ∃ w, isWinterOlympics w ∧ Hosts Beijing w) :=
  fun h => 
  have h_left : Hosts Beijing summer2008 := h.left
  have h_right : ∃ w, isWinterOlympics w ∧ Hosts Beijing w := h.right
  -- No contradiction: premises directly support both conjuncts
  -- hosted_summer_2008 proves left, hosted_winter proves right
  -- Cannot derive contradiction
  False.elim (by sorry) -- Proof fails here

-- Since negation cannot be proven, we indicate failure
</lean>
