axiom obj : Type
axiom Beijing : obj
axiom LocatedInNorthernChina : obj → Prop
axiom LocatedInSouthernChina : obj → Prop

-- Premises from context
axiom T1 : LocatedInNorthernChina Beijing

-- Additional premises do not provide location contradictions
-- Attempt to prove ¬LocatedInSouthernChina Beijing fails without disjointness axiom
theorem disprove_statement : ¬LocatedInSouthernChina Beijing := 
  fun h => 
    have no_contradiction : LocatedInNorthernChina Beijing ∧ LocatedInSouthernChina Beijing := ⟨T1, h⟩ 
    -- No axiom stating Northern and Southern are mutually exclusive
    -- Cannot derive False from premises alone
    False.elim (by admit) -- Proof fails; admit indicates unprovable gap
