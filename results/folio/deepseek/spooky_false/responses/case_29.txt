The Lean proof begins by assuming the premises and the conditional statement to evaluate: "If Marvin is not from Mars then he is human". Through case analysis of the disjunctive premise about Marvin's origin, both cases lead to contradiction when combined with this assumption. 

In the first case (Marvin is from both Earth and Mars), we derive that Marvin is both human (due to being from Earth and highly intelligent) and not human (via the alien/extraterrestrial chain), resulting in contradiction.

In the second case (Marvin is from neither), the conditional forces Marvin to be human when he is not from Mars, but the extraterrestrial derivation forces him not to be human, again yielding contradiction.

Since the conditional leads to absurdity in all scenarios under the premises, we prove its falsehood. Thus, the answer is:

ANSWER: False
