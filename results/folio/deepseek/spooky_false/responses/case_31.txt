After analyzing the premises and attempting to prove the negation of the statement "Djokovic lives in a tax haven" (i.e., ¬LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic), the following conclusions are drawn:

1. **Premises Analysis**:
   - Djokovic is at the mixer.
   - Everyone at the mixer is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.
   - If Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, he becomes a professional tennis player, then an athlete, then famous, and (via the Djokovic-specific premise) well-paid, leading to living in a tax haven.
   - If Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, he becomes a celebrity, then well-paid, leading to living in a tax haven.
   - In both cases, the premises entail that Djokovic lives in a tax haven.

2. **Proof Attempt**:
   - A valid proof of ¬LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic cannot be constructed because the premises directly imply LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic.
   - Attempts to derive a contradiction (e.g., assuming ¬LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic and using the premises) fail because the premises consistently support the positive conclusion.

3. **Lean Code Justification**:
   - The Lean code defines all predicates and premises exactly as stated.
   - The `goal` theorem attempts to prove the negation but cannot be completed without `sorry`, confirming the proof is unattainable.
   - No contradiction exists in the premises, and the positive statement is derivable (though not required for this task).

**Final Answer**: Failure (the negation cannot be proven from the premises).

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the proof attempted to use the hypothesis `h` (of type `LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic`) as a function when it is actually a proposition. The proof structure was flawed because it assumed a contradiction could be derived from having two proofs of the same proposition (`h` and `tax_haven`), which is not logically possible. After careful analysis, the premises imply that Djokovic must live in a tax haven, making the negation unprovable.
