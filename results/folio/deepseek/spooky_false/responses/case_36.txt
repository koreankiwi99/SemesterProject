After translating the context into Lean, I attempted to prove that Beethoven is not a composer (i.e., `¬Composer beethoven`) using the provided premises. Here's the analysis:

- Premise 6 states that Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society (an orchestra).
- Premise 7 states that orchestras are led by conductors, implying that anyone leading an orchestra must be a conductor.
- Thus, Beethoven must be a conductor (`Conductor beethoven`).
- Premise 3 states that Beethoven wrote Symphony No. 9 (a music piece).
- Premise 2 states that composers write music pieces, but crucially, it does **not** state that *only* composers write music pieces. There is no exclusivity implied.
- Being a conductor does not preclude Beethoven from also being a composer, as there is no premise asserting mutual exclusion between composers and conductors.
- Therefore, while we can prove `Conductor beethoven`, we have no premises to contradict `Composer beethoven`. Writing a music piece (per Premise 3) is consistent with both him being a composer and not being a composer under the given axioms.

The negation `¬Composer beethoven` cannot be proven from the premises.

Attempt to prove ¬Composer beethoven fails because:
1. P3 shows Beethoven wrote a music piece, but P2 does NOT require that writers of music pieces must be composers.
2. beethoven_conductor shows Beethoven is a conductor, but no premise forbids conductors from being composers.
No contradiction arises from assuming `Composer beethoven`.
