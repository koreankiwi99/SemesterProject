The Lean code formalizes the given premises and attempts to prove the negation of the statement "A design by Max is a brutalist building," interpreted as "There exists a brutalist building that Max adores." The proof fails because while a contradiction arises for Zaha Hadid styles (due to conflicting geometry requirements), no contradiction exists for Kelly Wearstler styles. Premises allow for the possibility that Max adores a brutalist building of Kelly Wearstler's style (lacking interesting geometries but satisfying evocativeness and dreaminess). Thus, the negation cannot be proven.

      -- No contradiction: KellyWearstler brutalist building without interesting geometries is consistent
      -- Premise 6 requires interesting geometries to apply, which we lack here
      -- Thus, no contradiction in this branch
      sorry  -- Proof fails here
