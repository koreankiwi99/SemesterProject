The natural language reasoning is translated into Lean code to evaluate the statement "Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal." The key insight is that an unstated axiom—players who lose to Rafael Nadal must be male—combined with premise 6 (if Coco is ranked highly or lost to Nadal, then Coco is not male) leads to a contradiction when assuming Coco lost to Nadal. This allows proving the negation of the statement.

<lean>
axiom Player : Type
axiom Coco : Player
axiom lost_to_Nadal : Player → Prop
axiom ranked_highly_WTA : Player → Prop
axiom male : Player → Prop

-- Premise 6: If ranked highly or lost to Nadal, then not male
axiom A6 : (ranked_highly_WTA Coco ∨ lost_to_Nadal Coco) → ¬male Coco

-- Unstated axiom: Losing to Nadal implies being male
axiom Nadal_only_men : ∀ p : Player, lost_to_Nadal p → male p

-- Proving the statement "Coco lost to Nadal" is false
theorem Coco_not_lost_to_Nadal : ¬lost_to_Nadal Coco := by
  intro hLost
  have maleCoco : male Coco := Nadal_only_men Coco hLost
  apply A6 (Or.inr hLost)
  exact maleCoco

#check Coco_not_lost_to_Nadal  -- Output: ¬lost_to_Nadal Coco
</lean>

ANSWER: False
