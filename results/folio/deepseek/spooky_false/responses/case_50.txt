The premises lead to a contradiction when assuming "1984 is a streaming service," but they do not directly provide evidence to conclude that "1984 is a streaming service." The negation of the conclusion ("1984 is not a streaming service") is actually supported by the reasoning.

**Natural Language Reasoning:**
1. Assume (for contradiction) that 1984 is a streaming service (i.e., `StreamingService n`).
2. By axiom A3, `StreamingService n` implies `DigitalMedia n`.
3. By axiom A5, `StreamingService n` implies `HardcoverBook n`.
4. By axiom A4, `HardcoverBook n` implies `PrintedText n`.
5. By axiom A2, `PrintedText n` implies `Analog n`.
6. By axiom A1, `DigitalMedia n` implies `¬Analog n`.
7. Steps 5 and 6 create a contradiction: `Analog n` and `¬Analog n`.
8. Thus, the assumption `StreamingService n` must be false, proving `¬StreamingService n`.

This proves the **original conclusion** ("1984 is not a streaming service") is **true**. However, the task requires proving the **negation of the conclusion** (i.e., "1984 is a streaming service") to demonstrate the original conclusion is false. Since this negation cannot be proven (as it causes a contradiction), the attempt fails.

**Lean Formalization:**
```lean
<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom n : obj
axiom DigitalMedia : obj → Prop
axiom Analog : obj → Prop
axiom PrintedText : obj → Prop
axiom StreamingService : obj → Prop
axiom HardcoverBook : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, DigitalMedia x → ¬ Analog x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, PrintedText x → Analog x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, StreamingService x → DigitalMedia x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, HardcoverBook x → PrintedText x
axiom A5 : StreamingService n → HardcoverBook n

-- Attempt to prove the negation of the conclusion ("1984 is a streaming service")
theorem negate_conclusion : StreamingService n := by
  -- No axioms directly provide StreamingService n. 
  -- Attempt 1: Use A5 to get HardcoverBook n, but requires StreamingService n (circular).
  -- Attempt 2: Use A3 to get DigitalMedia n, but again requires StreamingService n.
  -- No other axioms assert StreamingService n for any object.
  sorry -- Proof fails: Premises do not support proving StreamingService n.
