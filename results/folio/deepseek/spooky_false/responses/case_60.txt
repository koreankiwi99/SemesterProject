ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After analyzing the text and the reasoning requirements, I realize that the premises do not provide sufficient information to prove that Mike does *not* have an F1 visa. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mike : obj

-- Predicates
axiom International : obj → Prop
axiom F1 : obj → Prop
axiom J1 : obj → Prop
axiom WantsWork : obj → Prop
axiom AppliesForCPT : obj → Prop
axiom AppliesForOPT : obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, International x → (F1 x ∨ J1 x)
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, International x → F1 x → (WantsWork x → (AppliesForCPT x ∨ AppliesForOPT x))
axiom P3 : International Mike
axiom P4 : WantsWork Mike → AppliesForCPT Mike

-- Attempt to prove ¬F1 Mike
theorem negate_statement : ¬F1 Mike := by
  intro hF1  -- Assume Mike has F1 visa
  -- Using P2 we get that if Mike wants work, he needs CPT or OPT
  have h_work_implication := P2 Mike P3 hF1
  -- P4 tells us that if Mike wants work, he applies for CPT specifically
  -- This is consistent because CPT satisfies the OR condition in P2
  -- No contradiction can be derived
  admit  -- Proof cannot be completed
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

**Explanation:**
1. The extra `end` statement causing compilation error was removed
2. The identifiers were capitalized for consistency (Mike vs mike)
3. The critical issue remains: Premises P2 and P4 are consistent when Mike has F1 visa
   - P2 requires CPT **or** OPT when Mike wants to work
   - P4 requires specifically CPT when Mike wants to work
   - CPT satisfies the OR condition in P2 → no contradiction
4. Without information about Mike's work intention or visa constraints for J1 holders, we cannot prove Mike *lacks* an F1 visa. The conclusion is unprovable.
