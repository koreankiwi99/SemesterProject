The Lean code below formalizes the given premises and attempts to prove the negation of the statement "Mike has a J1 visa". The premises are translated into axioms, and a theorem attempts to show ¬J1 Mike. However, the proof relies on case analysis for Mike's visa status (F1 or J1) and his work intent. The critical insight is:

- If Mike wants to work and has an F1 visa, he must apply for CPT or OPT (Premise 2).  
- Premise 4 requires Mike to apply for CPT if he wants to work.  
- If Mike has a J1 visa (and not F1) but wants to work, we expect no application requirement from the given rules. Yet Premise 4 forces CPT application, creating conflict.  

However, the proof fails because Premise 2 does not prohibit J1 visa holders from applying for CPT or OPT. The absence of visa exclusivity (using inclusive ∨) allows Mike to have both visas. The proof gets stuck when Mike has J1 without F1 but wants to work, as no contradiction arises between Premise 4 (requiring CPT) and the silence on J1 requirements. Hence, we cannot complete the proof.

</lean>

After careful formalization:

1. The premises allow Mike to have both visas (P1 uses inclusive OR)
2. P4 requires CPT when Mike wants to work, regardless of visa
3. J1 visa holders applying for CPT isn't prohibited
4. The assumption "Mike has J1" doesn't contradict the premises

The negation (¬J1 Mike) cannot be proven.
