ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The Lean code correctly formalizes the premises but shows that the negation of "Ted is a pet" cannot be proven. Here's the analysis:

1. We prove Ted cannot be a Brown Swiss cattle (since that would imply he's domesticated, contradicting the alligator premise).
2. However, the premise "Some pets are Brown Swiss cattle" does not imply all pets are Brown Swiss cattle.
3. There is no premise linking alligators to pet status or requiring all pets to be domesticated.
4. Thus, Ted could theoretically be a non-Brown-Swiss pet without contradiction.

Since we cannot derive a contradiction from assuming Ted is a pet, the negation cannot be proven.
