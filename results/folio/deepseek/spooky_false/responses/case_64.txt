The reasoning involves trying to prove the negation of the statement: "If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet." The negation of this implication is "Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle and Ted is a pet." The premises are analyzed to determine if this negation can be proven.

Premises:
1. All Brown Swiss cattle are cows.
2. Some pets are Brown Swiss cattle (but this pet is not specified to be Ted).
3. All cows are domesticated animals.
4. Alligators are not domesticated animals.
5. Ted is an alligator.

Attempt:
- If Ted were a Brown Swiss cattle, he would be a cow (premise 1), then domesticated (premise 3).
- But as an alligator (premise 5), Ted cannot be domesticated (premise 4), leading to a contradiction.
- Therefore, Ted cannot be a Brown Swiss cattle. This refutes the antecedent (`BrownSwiss Ted`), making it false.
- Additionally, there is no premise indicating Ted is a pet. The existential premise (some pet is a Brown Swiss cattle) does not specify Ted, so it does not provide evidence that Ted is a pet.

Conclusion:
The negation `BrownSwiss Ted ∧ Pet Ted` cannot be proven because:
- `BrownSwiss Ted` is false (leads to contradiction).
- `Pet Ted` has no supporting evidence.

Thus, the attempt to prove the negation of the original statement fails.
