To evaluate the statement "Yale University has the largest university endowment of any educational institution," we formalize the context in Lean. Yale's endowment is given as $42.3 billion, but no information is provided about the endowments of other educational institutions. Without comparative data or any premises implying that another institution has a larger endowment, the negation of the statement cannot be proven.

<lean>
axiom EducationalInstitution : Type
axiom yale : EducationalInstitution
axiom endowment : EducationalInstitution → ℝ
axiom yale_endowment : endowment yale = 42300000000  -- $42.3 billion
</lean>
