The given premises state that there is a list of residential colleges at Yale, which explicitly includes Pierson College. Therefore, the statement "Pierson College is a residential college at Yale" is directly supported by the context.

Attempting to prove the **negation** (that Pierson College is *not* a residential college at Yale) leads to a contradiction with the premise `T_list` (which asserts Pierson is a residential college). Since no other premises provide conflicting information (e.g., the endowment or move details are irrelevant), no contradiction exists. Thus, the negation *cannot* be proven.

Final answer: Failure

axiom obj : Type
axiom Yale : obj
axiom Pierson : obj
def ResidentialCollegeAt : obj → obj → Prop
axiom T_list : ResidentialCollegeAt Pierson Yale

    -- Contradiction required here, but none exists
    -- Since `T_list` confirms `ResidentialCollegeAt Pierson Yale`, 
    -- `h` and `T_list` prove identical propositions (no contradiction)

The compilation error occurred because `axiom` was used after `def` without proper separation. In Lean, all declarations must be in order, and using `axiom` after other definitions requires explicit sectioning. The corrected approach uses `constant` for type declarations and `axiom` for propositions.

However, the core issue remains: **we cannot prove the negation of "Pierson College is a residential college at Yale"** because:
1. The premises explicitly list Pierson College as a residential college at Yale
2. Other information (endowment, move date) provides no contradiction
3. We lack premises about exclusivity (e.g., "only these colleges exist")

Thus, the negation is unprovable from the given premises.

<lean>
constant obj : Type
constant Yale : obj
constant Pierson : obj
constant ResidentialCollegeAt : obj → obj → Prop
axiom T_list : ResidentialCollegeAt Pierson Yale

theorem neg_conclusion : ¬ ResidentialCollegeAt Pierson Yale := 
  fun h => 
    -- Contradiction required: we have T_list proving it IS true, 
    -- and our assumption h says it is true (no conflict). 
    -- No other axioms contradict this.
    (by trivial) -- This placeholder shows proving False is impossible
    -- Actual proof should define what makes a contradiction, 
    -- but no such definition exists in the premises.
    sorry -- Required since we can't construct actual contradiction

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to syntax issues in the lambda function and tactic block usage. The corrected code properly defines the constants and axioms, then attempts to prove the negation. However, the premises explicitly include Pierson College in the list of residential colleges at Yale, making it impossible to derive a contradiction. Therefore, the proof remains incomplete (`sorry`).

<lean>
constant obj : Type
constant Yale : obj
constant Pierson : obj
constant ResidentialCollegeAt : obj → obj → Prop
axiom T_list : ResidentialCollegeAt Pierson Yale

theorem neg_conclusion : ¬ ResidentialCollegeAt Pierson Yale :=
  fun h : ResidentialCollegeAt Pierson Yale =>
    False.elim (
      -- Attempt to find contradiction fails:
      -- T_list proves ResidentialCollegeAt Pierson Yale
      -- h is identical to T_list (both true propositions)
      -- No premises provide conflicting information
      by 
        apply False.rec
    )
    -- Could not find contradiction - proof incomplete
    sorry
</lean>
