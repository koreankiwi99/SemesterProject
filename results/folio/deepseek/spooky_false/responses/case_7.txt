axiom P6 : ∀ x, Human x → GetsFlu x → FeelsTired x

-- Statement: "No one gets the flu" ≡ ∀ x, Human x → ¬GetsFlu x
-- We attempt to prove its negation: ∃ x, Human x ∧ GetsFlu x
theorem neg_statement : ∃ x, Human x ∧ GetsFlu x := by
  -- We have no premise asserting any human gets flu or Monkeypox
  -- P2 gives an animal with virus, but not necessarily human or causing Monkeypox
  -- P6 is conditional with no instance of flu
  -- Thus, we cannot construct an existential witness
  admit  -- Proof fails

-- Since neg_statement is unprovable, we show the original statement's falsehood is unprovable
theorem false_from_premises : False := by
  have h : ¬∃ x, Human x ∧ GetsFlu x := fun ⟨x, hx⟩ => 
    -- No contradiction from premises alone
    sorry  -- Cannot derive contradiction
  -- Even with h, no premise yields False
  admit   -- Proof fails
