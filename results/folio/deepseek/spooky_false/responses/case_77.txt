The premises lead to a contradiction, allowing the negation of the statement to be proven. Specifically:
- Premise 7 states Hannah works on campus and that if she needs money, she doesn't need money (a contradiction).
- Premise 1 requires Hannah to need money because she works on campus and attends Mary's school.
- These cannot both hold, resulting in a proof of False.

After analyzing the errors, I identified two main issues: 
1. Universe level mismatch in type declarations
2. Insufficient type information in tactic mode for type inference

Here's the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Hannah : Person

axiom AtMarysSchool : Person → Prop
axiom WorksOnCampus : Person → Prop
axiom NeedsMoney : Person → Prop
axiom OrdersTakeout : Person → Prop
axiom EnjoysDining : Person → Prop
axiom PickyEater : Person → Prop
axiom SpendsTime : Person → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ (p : Person), AtMarysSchool p → WorksOnCampus p → NeedsMoney p
axiom P2 : ∀ (p : Person), AtMarysSchool p → OrdersTakeout p → WorksOnCampus p
axiom P3 : ∀ (p : Person), AtMarysSchool p → OrdersTakeout p ∨ EnjoysDining p
axiom P4 : ∀ (p : Person), AtMarysSchool p → EnjoysDining p → ¬PickyEater p
axiom P5 : ∀ (p : Person), AtMarysSchool p → EnjoysDining p → SpendsTime p
axiom P6 : AtMarysSchool Hannah
axiom P7 : WorksOnCampus Hannah ∧ (NeedsMoney Hannah → ¬PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬NeedsMoney Hannah)

theorem false_derived : False := by
  rcases P7 with ⟨works_hannah, impl⟩
  have needs_money : NeedsMoney Hannah := P1 Hannah P6 works_hannah
  apply (impl needs_money).2
  exact needs_money

theorem neg_statement : ¬(AtMarysSchool Hannah ∧ (¬PickyEater Hannah ∨ SpendsTime Hannah)) := 
  fun ⟨hSchool, _⟩ => false_derived
</lean>

**Explanation of corrections:**
1. Changed `constant` to `axiom` for universe consistency
2. Added explicit parentheses around implication types
3. Used `rcases` for cleaner destructuring
4. Simplified the contradiction proof by directly using `(impl needs_money).2 needs_money`
5. Specified types implicitly through direct application
6. Added explicit parameters to quantifiers
7. Kept `neg_statement` for formal negation proof

The premises lead to a contradiction: 
- P7 states that if Hannah needs money, she doesn't need money
- P1 requires that Hannah needs money due to her campus job
- This circular dependency proves False

**Final Answer:**  
ANSWER: False
