```

The premises establish that Sir Digby is a good guy and his nemesis is a bad guy, but **do not prove the outcome of their fight**. The global statement "good guys always win" (collective victory) does not entail that every individual good guy wins every fight. Since we cannot prove that the nemesis wins (to refute the original statement), the negation cannot be proven.

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The errors occurred due to missing premises and incorrect handling of role assignments in the proof. The key issues were:

1. Missing the critical premise: "In superhero movies, the good guys always win"
2. Lack of evidence that the nemesis is in the movie
3. Inability to prove role exclusivity (good/bad) without additional axioms

Here's the corrected Lean code:

    -- Contradiction: digby_good and digby_bad can coexist per premises?
    -- Even if contradiction, still missing nemesis_in_movie for good_guys_win
    contradiction  -- Fails since no role exclusivity axiom
</lean>

**Explanation:**
1. Added missing `good_guys_win` axiom to capture the first premise
2. The proof fails because:
   - No evidence that nemesis is in the movie (`InMovie nemesis M`)
   - Premises don't prohibit characters from being both good/bad
   - `good_guys_win` requires both fighters to be in the movie
3. Cannot prove `Wins nemesis digby` due to insufficient evidence about:
   - Nemesis's movie presence
   - Role exclusivity (good/bad status)
   - Actual fight outcome

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The errors occurred due to two main issues:
1. Missing role exclusivity axiom (a character can't be both good and bad)
2. Insufficient evidence about nemesis's presence in the movie

Here's the corrected Lean code with proper role exclusivity handling:

<lean>
axiom Movie : Type
axiom Character : Type

axiom M : Movie
axiom digby : Character
axiom nemesis : Character

axiom SuperheroMovie : Movie → Prop
axiom Fights : Character → Character → Prop
axiom GoodGuy : Character → Prop
axiom BadGuy : Character → Prop
axiom Wins : Character → Character → Prop
axiom NamedAfter : Movie → Character → Prop
axiom InMovie : Character → Movie → Prop

-- Premises
axiom movie_superhero : SuperheroMovie M
axiom digby_fights_nemesis : Fights digby nemesis
axiom fight_roles : ∀ (x y : Character), Fights x y → 
  (GoodGuy x ∧ BadGuy y) ∨ (GoodGuy y ∧ BadGuy x)
axiom naming_rule : ∀ (m : Movie) (x : Character), 
  SuperheroMovie m → NamedAfter m x → GoodGuy x ∧ InMovie x m
axiom named_after_digby : NamedAfter M digby
axiom win_exclusive : ∀ (x y : Character), Wins x y → ¬ Wins y x
axiom good_guys_win : ∀ (m : Movie), SuperheroMovie m →
  ∀ (x y : Character), InMovie x m → InMovie y m → Fights x y → 
  GoodGuy x → BadGuy y → Wins x y

-- Critical missing axiom: Role exclusivity
axiom role_exclusive : ∀ (c : Character), ¬ (GoodGuy c ∧ BadGuy c)

theorem refute_nemesis_does_not_win : Wins nemesis digby := by
  -- Establish Digby's properties
  have digby_good : GoodGuy digby := (naming_rule M digby movie_superhero named_after_digby).1
  have digby_in_movie : InMovie digby M := (naming_rule M digby movie_superhero named_after_digby).2

  -- Analyze fight roles
  cases fight_roles digby nemesis digby_fights_nemesis with
  | inl h =>  -- Case: Digby good, nemesis bad
    have nemesis_bad := h.2
    -- Cannot proceed: missing evidence that nemesis is in the movie
    sorry
  | inr h =>  -- Case: Nemesis good, digby bad
    have nemesis_good := h.1
    have digby_bad := h.2
    -- Contradiction: Digby cannot be both good and bad
    exact False.elim (role_exclusive digby ⟨digby_good, digby_bad⟩)
</lean>

**Explanation:**
1. Added `role_exclusive` axiom to resolve the contradiction case
2. The proof still fails because:
   - No evidence exists that nemesis is in the movie (`InMovie nemesis M`)
   - The `good_guys_win` axiom requires both fighters to be in the movie
   - Premises don't provide nemesis's movie presence
3. The first case (Digby good/nemesis bad) remains unprovable due to insufficient information
4. The original conclusion ("nemesis does not win") cannot be refuted

ANSWER: Failure
