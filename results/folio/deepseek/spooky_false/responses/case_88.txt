ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After analyzing the context, the premises lead to the conclusion that Harry is smarter. The attempt to prove the negation (Harry is not smarter) fails because:

1. Reading a book causes knowledge gain (Premise 1)
2. Knowledge gain causes increased smartness (Premise 2)
3. Harry read Walden (Premise 3)

From these premises, we can derive:
- Harry gained knowledge
- Therefore, Harry became smarter

The negation of this conclusion ("Harry is not smarter") is unprovable because it contradicts these combined premises. The Lean code below formalizes this reasoning:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Book : Type
axiom Harry : Person
axiom Walden : Book
axiom Reads : Person → Book → Prop
axiom GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop
axiom Smarter : Person → Prop

axiom reading_gains : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p
axiom knowledge_smarter : ∀ (p : Person), GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p
axiom harry_read_walden : Reads Harry Walden

-- Prove Harry gained knowledge
theorem harry_gained_knowledge : GainsKnowledge Harry := 
  reading_gains Harry Walden harry_read_walden

-- Prove Harry became smarter
theorem harry_smarter : Smarter Harry := 
  knowledge_smarter Harry harry_gained_knowledge

-- Attempt to prove ¬Smarter Harry
-- This attempt fails because:
-- 1. Introduce hypothesis (h: Smarter Harry)
-- 2. But we have harry_smarter : Smarter Harry
-- 3. No contradiction exists in premises
theorem disprove_smarter : ¬Smarter Harry := by
  intro h
  -- Inconsistent with harry_smarter only if 
  -- we have negation of Smarter Harry. Not found.
  apply False.elim  -- Stuck here with no contradiction

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `disprove_smarter` theorem attempted to prove `¬Smarter Harry` but failed to provide a contradiction. The premises establish that Harry became smarter, so no contradiction exists. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Book : Type
axiom Harry : Person
axiom Walden : Book
axiom Reads : Person → Book → Prop
axiom GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop
axiom Smarter : Person → Prop

axiom reading_gains : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p
axiom knowledge_smarter : ∀ (p : Person), GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p
axiom harry_read_walden : Reads Harry Walden

-- Harry gained knowledge from reading Walden
theorem harry_gained_knowledge : GainsKnowledge Harry := 
  reading_gains Harry Walden harry_read_walden

-- Harry became smarter
theorem harry_is_smarter : Smarter Harry := 
  knowledge_smarter Harry harry_gained_knowledge

-- Attempt to prove ¬Smarter Harry (fails)
theorem disprove_smarter : ¬Smarter Harry := by
  intro h  -- Assume Smarter Harry
  -- No contradiction exists because premises support Smarter Harry
  -- Cannot proceed further - goal remains: False
  exact False.elim  -- Placeholder, but still fails
</lean>

**Explanation of Failure:**  
The premises directly support the conclusion:
1. Books contain knowledge → Reading causes knowledge gain
2. Knowledge gain causes increased smartness
3. Harry read a book (Walden)  
Thus, `Smarter Harry` is provable. The negation (`¬Smarter Harry`) cannot be proven since no premises contradict Harry's smartness increase. The proof attempt fails at `exact False.elim` because no contradiction exists.
