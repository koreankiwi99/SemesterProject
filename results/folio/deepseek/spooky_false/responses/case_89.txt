The statement "A smarter person has gained knowledge" is interpreted as a universal claim: if a person is smarter, then they have gained knowledge (∀ p, smarter p → gained_knowledge p). The premises establish that reading a book leads to gaining knowledge, which leads to becoming smarter. However, the premises do not assert that becoming smarter *requires* gaining knowledge; other methods of becoming smarter might exist. While Harry (who read a book) supports the statement, no premise rules out a smarter person who did not gain knowledge. Thus, the negation of the statement (∃ p, smarter p ∧ ¬gained_knowledge p) cannot be proven.

axiom person : Type
axiom book : Type
axiom Harry : person
axiom Walden : book

axiom contains_knowledge : book → Prop
axiom reads : person → book → Prop
axiom gains_knowledge : person → Prop
axiom becomes_smarter : person → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ (b : book), contains_knowledge b
axiom P2 : ∀ (p : person) (b : book), reads p b → gains_knowledge p
axiom P3 : ∀ (p : person), gains_knowledge p → becomes_smarter p
axiom P4 : reads Harry Walden

-- Prove Harry gained knowledge and became smarter
theorem Harry_gains : gains_knowledge Harry := by
  apply P2 Harry Walden P4

theorem Harry_smarter : becomes_smarter Harry := by
  apply P3 Harry Harry_gains

-- Statement to disprove: "A smarter person has gained knowledge" (universal)
def statement : Prop := ∀ (p : person), becomes_smarter p → gains_knowledge p

-- Attempt to prove negation: ∃ p, becomes_smarter p ∧ ¬ gains_knowledge p
-- No such person exists in premises; cannot construct counterexample.
-- Proof fails.
