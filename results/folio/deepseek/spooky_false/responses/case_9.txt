ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the `cases` tactic replaced `Tom` with each constructor in the respective branches, causing the axioms (which depend on `Tom`) to become self-referential contradictions (e.g., `Eastern ≠ Eastern`). Instead, we directly attempt to prove the negation of "Tom is Ocellated" by assuming `Tom = Ocellated` and seeking a contradiction with the premises. However, no contradiction arises because the premises are consistent with `Tom` being Ocellated.
