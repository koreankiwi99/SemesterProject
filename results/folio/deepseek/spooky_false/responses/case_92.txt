The premises provide the conditions under Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building: he must be allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit must be no more than $1500. At The Olive Garden (a managed building), the monthly rent is $2000, and the security deposit is at least the monthly rent, making it $2000 or more. Since $2000 is greater than $1500, the security deposit condition fails. However, premise 9 only states a sufficient condition for Tom to rent, not a necessary condition. It does not preclude Tom from renting for other reasons. No premises provide such reasons, but the failure of one condition does not, by itself, prove Tom will not rent. Thus, the negation of the conclusion cannot be proven, leading to "Failure."

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `apply` tactic was used incorrectly when trying to prove `securityDeposit OliveGarden ≥ 2000`. The axiom `P3` states that for any managed building, the security deposit is at least the monthly rent. Using `P3 OliveGarden P6` gives `securityDeposit OliveGarden ≥ monthlyRent OliveGarden`, which must be combined with `P7` (monthly rent = 2000) through rewriting.

The corrected Lean code fixes this by:
1. Using `P3` directly to get `securityDeposit OliveGarden ≥ monthlyRent OliveGarden`
2. Rewriting with `P7` to convert this to `≥ 2000`
3. Proving the deposit exceeds $1500 using `P8`
4. Showing the rental condition fails due to the high deposit

However, the main proof of `¬TomRentsIn OliveGarden` fails because:
- Premise P9 only provides a sufficient condition for Tom to rent ("if" the pet/deposit condition holds)
- There is no premise stating this condition is necessary
- The deposit condition fails, but Tom might rent for other reasons
- No premises rule out other rental possibilities

Thus, the negation cannot be proven.
