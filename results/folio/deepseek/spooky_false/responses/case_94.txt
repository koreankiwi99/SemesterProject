The Lean code models the given premises and attempts to prove the negation of the statement: "The security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more." The negation is that the security deposit is less than $2000. However, the premises explicitly state that the security deposit is always at least the monthly rent, and the monthly rent at Olive Garden is $2000. This directly contradicts the possibility of the security deposit being less than $2000. Thus, the negation cannot be proven from the premises, resulting in "Failure."

ANSWER: Failure

Explanation:
- We successfully proved that the negation of "security deposit < 2000" leads to a contradiction using the deposit rule and rent information.
- This means "security deposit ≥ 2000" must be true, so the original statement ("is either $2000 or more") is actually true.
- Since we cannot prove the original statement is false (we proved it must be true), we return "Failure" as per requirements.
