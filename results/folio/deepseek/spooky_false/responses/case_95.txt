The premises do not provide sufficient information to prove that "The Harvard Weekly Book club has legal obligations" is false. The key observations are:

1. All legal entities have legal obligations, but there is no axiom stating that *only* legal entities have legal obligations. Thus, non-legal entities could potentially have legal obligations.
2. The Harvard Weekly Book Club is not explicitly stated to be a business organization, company, or legal entity.
3. The conditional premise "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company" provides no direct information about legal obligations.

In Lean, the formalization shows no contradiction arises when assuming the Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations, as it may be a non-legal entity with obligations. Similarly, there is no proof of the negation.

The compilation error occurred due to using `constant` instead of `axiom` for declaring the Harvard Weekly Book Club. In Lean 4, both can be used, but consistent use of `axiom` resolves parser ambiguities. The corrected code formalizes all declarations and premises accurately.

<lean>
axiom U : Type
axiom HarvardWeeklyBookClub : U
axiom BusinessOrganization : U → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : U → Prop
axiom Company : U → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : U → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : U → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : U → Prop

axiom all_business_legal : ∀ x : U, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom all_companies_business : ∀ x : U, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom all_private_companies : ∀ x : U, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom legal_created_under_law : ∀ x : U, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom legal_has_obligations : ∀ x : U, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom hwbc_created_not_private : CreatedUnderLaw HarvardWeeklyBookClub → ¬ PrivateCompany HarvardWeeklyBookClub
</lean>

**Reasoning for Failure:**  
We cannot prove the negation of the conclusion (¬HasLegalObligations HarvardWeeklyBookClub).  
- Premises establish that legal entities have obligations, but do not assert that *only* legal entities have them.  
- Harvard Weekly Book Club's properties are not fully constrained:  
  - It is not a private company (derivable but inconclusive for obligations),  
  - But may still be a non-private company (→ legal entity → obligations) or a non-entity (obligations unknown).  
- No premise forces it to be a non-entity or affirms non-obligations. Thus, the negation is unprovable.
