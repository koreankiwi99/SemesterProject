The reasoning involves translating the given premises into Lean axioms and attempting to prove that the statement "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law" is false. The negation of this implication is "The Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company and it has no legal obligations and is not created under law." However, the premises lead to a contradiction if we assume the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company:

1. If it is a private company, it must be a company (premise 3).
2. As a company, it is a business organization (premise 2).
3. As a business organization, it is a legal entity (premise 1).
4. As a legal entity, it is created under law (premise 4) and has legal obligations (premise 5).
5. Premise 6 states that if it is created under law, it cannot be a private company, contradicting the initial assumption.

Thus, the Harvard Weekly Book Club cannot be a private company. This makes the antecedent of the original implication false, so the implication is vacuously true. The negation cannot be proven, as it requires the Harvard Weekly Book Club to be a private company, which leads to a contradiction.

axiom obj : Type
axiom HWBC : obj
axiom BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : obj → Prop
axiom Company : obj → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : obj → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x : obj, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom T2 : ∀ x : obj, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom T3 : ∀ x : obj, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom T4 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom T5 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom T6 : CreatedUnderLaw HWBC → ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC

-- Attempt to prove the negation: PrivateCompany HWBC ∧ ¬HasLegalObligations HWBC ∧ ¬CreatedUnderLaw HWBC
-- This leads to a contradiction as shown below:
theorem not_private : ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC :=
  fun h : PrivateCompany HWBC =>
  have h1 : Company HWBC := T3 HWBC h
  have h2 : BusinessOrganization HWBC := T2 HWBC h1
  have h3 : LegalEntity HWBC := T1 HWBC h2
  have h4 : CreatedUnderLaw HWBC := T4 HWBC h3
  T6 h4 h   -- Contradiction: T6 h4 proves ¬PrivateCompany HWBC, but h is PrivateCompany HWBC

-- Since ¬PrivateCompany HWBC is provable, the antecedent of the original statement is false.
-- Therefore, the negation of the statement (which requires PrivateCompany HWBC) cannot be proven.
