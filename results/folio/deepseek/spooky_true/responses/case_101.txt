The premises and the statement about Luke are analyzed using Lean. The key steps are:

1. Formalizing the premises:
   - If born in multiple birth, spend time with siblings (P1)
   - If have siblings born together, then multiple birth (P2)
   - If complain about siblings, then have siblings born together (P3)
   - If live at home, then not live with strangers (P4)
   - If spend time with siblings, then live at home (P5)

2. Luke's disjunction:
   - Either (multiple birth ∧ live with strangers) OR (¬multiple birth ∧ ¬live with strangers)

3. Attempting to prove "Luke spends time with siblings":
   - Case 1 (multiple birth ∧ live with strangers): 
        - From P1, spend time with siblings
        - From P5, live at home
        - From P4, ¬live with strangers
        - Contradiction with "live with strangers"
        - Branch is inconsistent but yields spend time with siblings
   - Case 2 (¬multiple birth ∧ ¬live with strangers):
        - No premises connect ¬multiple birth to spending time with siblings
        - Cannot prove spend time with siblings
   - Since case 2 cannot be proven, the overall statement is unprovable

The Lean code formalizes this reasoning and shows that the proof fails in the second case.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Luke : obj

axiom MultipleBirth : obj → Prop
axiom SpendTimeWithSiblings : obj → Prop
axiom HasSiblingsBornTogether : obj → Prop
axiom ComplainAboutSiblings : obj → Prop
axiom LiveAtHome : obj → Prop
axiom LiveWithStrangers : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x, MultipleBirth x → SpendTimeWithSiblings x
axiom P2 : ∀ x, HasSiblingsBornTogether x → MultipleBirth x
axiom P3 : ∀ x, ComplainAboutSiblings x → HasSiblingsBornTogether x
axiom P4 : ∀ x, LiveAtHome x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x
axiom P5 : ∀ x, SpendTimeWithSiblings x → LiveAtHome x

axiom Luke_disj : (MultipleBirth Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) ∨ (¬ MultipleBirth Luke ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke)

theorem luke_spends_time : SpendTimeWithSiblings Luke := by
  cases Luke_disj with
  | inl h =>
      apply P1 Luke h.1
  | inr h =>
      have noMB : ¬ MultipleBirth Luke := h.1
      -- No premise allows deriving SpendTimeWithSiblings from ¬MultipleBirth
      fail
</lean>

The error occurred because the `fail` tactic was used in the proof, which is not allowed. After reevaluating the proof, it's determined that while the first branch leads to a contradiction, the second branch cannot prove the desired conclusion. Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Luke : obj

axiom MultipleBirth : obj → Prop
axiom SpendTimeWithSiblings : obj → Prop
axiom HasSiblingsBornTogether : obj → Prop
axiom ComplainAboutSiblings : obj → Prop
axiom LiveAtHome : obj → Prop
axiom LiveWithStrangers : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x, MultipleBirth x → SpendTimeWithSiblings x
axiom P2 : ∀ x, HasSiblingsBornTogether x → MultipleBirth x
axiom P3 : ∀ x, ComplainAboutSiblings x → HasSiblingsBornTogether x
axiom P4 : ∀ x, LiveAtHome x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x
axiom P5 : ∀ x, SpendTimeWithSiblings x → LiveAtHome x

axiom Luke_disj : (MultipleBirth Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) ∨ (¬ MultipleBirth Luke ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke)

theorem luke_spends_time : SpendTimeWithSiblings Luke := by
  cases Luke_disj with
  | inl h =>
      have S : SpendTimeWithSiblings Luke := P1 Luke h.1
      have H : LiveAtHome Luke := P5 Luke S
      have notLWS : ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke := P4 Luke H
      exact False.elim (notLWS h.2)
  | inr h =>
      -- No available premises allow derivation of SpendTimeWithSiblings Luke here
      -- ¬MultipleBirth Luke (h.1) blocks the only path via P1
      -- Other premises (P2, P3, P4, P5) don't provide alternative paths
      sorry  -- Proof incomplete for this branch
</lean>

**Explanation:**
- **First branch (`inl`):** Derives `SpendTimeWithSiblings Luke` via `P1`, but then encounters a contradiction between `¬LiveWithStrangers Luke` (from `P4` and `P5`) and the premise `LiveWithStrangers Luke`. This is resolved using `False.elim`.
- **Second branch (`inr`):** Has no path to prove `SpendTimeWithSiblings Luke` since:
  - `¬MultipleBirth Luke` (h.1) prevents using `P1`.
  - No other premises connect the available information (¬MultipleBirth, ¬LiveWithStrangers) to spending time with siblings.
  - `sorry` is used as a placeholder since the branch cannot be proven, making the overall theorem unprovable.

The conclusion does not follow from the premises.
