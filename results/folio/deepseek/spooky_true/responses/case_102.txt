The Lean code formalizes the given premises and attempts to prove that Luke complains often about annoying siblings. The premises are translated into axioms, and the disjunction about Luke's birth and living situation is included. However, no premise directly states that Luke complains, and the disjunction does not provide information about complaining. Attempts to derive the statement using the premises lead to contradictions or dead ends, as there is no path from the known facts to the conclusion. Therefore, the proof fails.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Luke : obj
axiom BornMultipleBirth : obj → Prop
axiom HasSiblingsBornTogether : obj → Prop
axiom SpendTimeWithSiblings : obj → Prop
axiom LiveAtHome : obj → Prop
axiom LiveWithStrangers : obj → Prop
axiom ComplainAboutAnnoyingSiblings : obj → Prop
axiom Baby : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x, BornMultipleBirth x → SpendTimeWithSiblings x
axiom P2 : ∀ x, HasSiblingsBornTogether x → BornMultipleBirth x
axiom P3 : ∀ x, ComplainAboutAnnoyingSiblings x → HasSiblingsBornTogether x
axiom P4 : ∀ x, LiveAtHome x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x
axiom P5 : ∀ x, SpendTimeWithSiblings x → LiveAtHome x
axiom Luke_disj : (Baby Luke ∧ BornMultipleBirth Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) ∨ (¬ Baby Luke ∧ ¬ BornMultipleBirth Luke ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke)

theorem prove_statement : ComplainAboutAnnoyingSiblings Luke :=
  by
    -- Attempt to use the disjunction about Luke
    cases Luke_disj with
    | inl h1 =>
        -- Case 1: Luke is a baby, born in multiple birth, lives with strangers
        -- No premise connects these facts to complaining about siblings
        -- Cannot derive ComplainAboutAnnoyingSiblings Luke
        sorry
    | inr h2 =>
        -- Case 2: Luke is not a baby, not born in multiple birth, does not live with strangers
        -- Again, no premise allows derivation of ComplainAboutAnnoyingSiblings Luke
        sorry
    -- Alternative approach: Assume ComplainAboutAnnoyingSiblings Luke and try to derive a contradiction?
    -- But the problem requires proving the statement true, not false.
    -- No successful proof found.
