The statement "It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test" is directly supported by the premise: "It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300." This establishes that the cost ($205) is less than $300. The additional information about Tom and financial aid is irrelevant to this specific cost fact.
