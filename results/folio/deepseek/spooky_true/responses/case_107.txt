The premises and Peter's description are translated into Lean. The goal is to prove that Peter is notably tidy. However, analysis shows:

- Peter has two possible cases based on the disjunction:
  1. Spills a lot and is cleanly → Leads to contradiction (spilling implies not tidy, but cleanly implies tidy).
  2. Does not spill a lot and is not cleanly → No premise forces Peter to be tidy (cleanly implies tidy, but the converse isn't true; lacking cleanly doesn't imply tidy).

Other premises (about clumsy foodies, family priorities, etc.) do not provide information about Peter's tidiness in the second case. Thus, "Peter is notably tidy" cannot be proven.
