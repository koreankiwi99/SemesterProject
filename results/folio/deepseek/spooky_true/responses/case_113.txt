The premises establish that the Picuris Mountains are in either New Mexico or Texas. The Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in these mountains and has been donated. The critical premise states that no mountain range in Texas has a donated mine. If the Picuris Mountains were in Texas, this would directly contradict the premises because the mine is donated and located there. Therefore, the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico. Consequently, the mine is located in a mountain range in New Mexico, making the conclusion false. Since the conclusion cannot be proven from the premises, the result is Failure.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was used without a clear contradiction in the context. The proof attempted to show the negation of the existential statement, but the premises actually imply that the existential is true. Specifically, the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico (not Texas) due to the donated mine contradicting the Texas premise. This means the Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in a mountain range in New Mexico, making the target statement false. Therefore, it cannot be proven.

The corrected Lean code defines the necessary types and predicates, includes the premises, proves that the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico, and demonstrates that the mine is located there. The target statement (negation of the existential) is attempted but cannot be proven without a contradiction, so `sorry` is used to indicate the unprovable step.
