The reasoning involves analyzing the premises and attempting to prove the statement "Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class," which translates to the existence of a man in Michael's class taller than Peter. The premises establish:

1. Peter is taller than Michael.
2. Michael is taller than every other man in his class.
3. Transitivity of "taller than" holds.
4. For any man in Michael's class (including Michael), Peter is taller than him (by transitivity: Peter > Michael > others).

This implies no man in Michael's class is taller than Peter. The information about Windy and blocking does not provide any height comparison involving Peter or men in Michael's class. Thus, the conclusion cannot be proven from the premises.

-- Attempt to prove the conclusion: ∃ x, Class x ∧ Man x ∧ Taller x Peter
theorem prove_conclusion : ∃ x, Class x ∧ Man x ∧ Taller x Peter := by
  -- No premises provide evidence for such x. Contradiction would arise if assumed.
  -- For instance, assuming such x exists leads to Peter being taller than himself (if we add irreflexivity), but irreflexivity isn't given.
  -- Without additional information, proof fails.
