The context provides several premises about people, their heights, and shooting abilities. The key to proving that Windy is a great shooter lies in the rules about Michael's blocking ability:

1. **Premise 5**: Michael can block any shooting from a person who does not jump.
   - Lean: `axiom MichaelBlock : ∀ s, ¬ JumpWhenShooting s → Block Michael s`
2. **Premise 6**: Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
   - Lean: `axiom BlockFailure : ¬ Block Michael Windy`

By contrapositive reasoning on these axioms:
- If Michael cannot block Windy (Premise 6), then Windy must jump when shooting (negation of Premise 5's condition).
- Formalizing this: `¬Block Michael Windy → ¬(¬JumpWhenShooting Windy) ≡ JumpWhenShooting Windy`.

3. **Premise 7**: Any shooter who jumps is a great shooter.
   - Lean: `axiom JumpGreat : ∀ s, JumpWhenShooting s → GreatShooter s`
- Thus, `JumpWhenShooting Windy → GreatShooter Windy`.

**Conclusion**: Windy jumps when shooting, so Windy is a great shooter.  
The other premises (about height relationships, Peter, transitivity, Michael's class) are unused but included for completeness.

The compilation errors occurred due to two main issues:
1. The tactic `by_contra` is not recognized in Lean 4 (should be `by_contradiction`)
2. The transitivity axiom name `Trans` conflicted with existing Lean definitions

The corrected code:
- Uses `by_contradiction` instead of `by_contra`
- Renames the transitivity axiom to `TallerTrans` to avoid conflicts
- Maintains the logical structure proving Windy is a great shooter

ANSWER: True

======================================================================
ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to the use of the `have` tactic with a nested `by_contradiction` proof. The solution simplifies the proof structure by:
1. Directly applying the `JumpGreat` axiom to reduce the goal to proving `JumpWhenShooting Windy`
2. Using `by_contradiction` to assume the negation (`¬JumpWhenShooting Windy`)
3. Deriving a contradiction between:
   - `MichaelBlock Windy h` (Michael blocks Windy if Windy doesn't jump)
   - `BlockFailure` (Michael cannot block Windy)

Here's the corrected Lean 4 code:
