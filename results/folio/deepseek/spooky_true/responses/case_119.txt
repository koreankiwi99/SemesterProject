ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect handling of constants and relations. The corrected approach defines the objects as an inductive type and properly declares the `locatedIn` relation and axioms. However, the proof attempt fails because the premises do not provide enough information to establish that Barutin Cove cannot be located in Antarctica. Specifically:

1. Transitivity allows deriving that Barutin Cove is in South Shetlands through both paths (via Snow Island and via Antarctica), but this does not create a contradiction.
2. No axioms assert disjointness between Snow Island and Antarctica or exclusivity of location.
3. The premises lack anti-symmetric properties or negative constraints that would prevent Barutin Cove from being in Antarctica.

Thus, the conclusion cannot be proven from the given premises.
