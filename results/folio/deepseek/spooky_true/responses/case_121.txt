The premises do not provide sufficient information to prove that John's car is a Tesla Model 3. The critical fifth premise ("If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car") is logically equivalent to the tautology `¬IsTeslaModel3 JohnCar → ¬IsTeslaModel3 JohnCar ∨ ¬SingleSeatElectricCar JohnCar`, which introduces no new constraints. The other premises describe relationships between categories but fail to link John's car definitively to any specific category. A proof attempt by contradiction proves impossible, as the negation of the goal ("John's car is not a Tesla Model 3") does not lead to any logical conflict with the premises.

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The Lean code has been corrected to address the compilation errors. The primary issue was the incorrect use of tactics in the proof attempt. The proof by contradiction was structured improperly, and the `assume` tactic was misapplied. The corrected code uses `by_contra` for the contradiction assumption and handles the disjunction from A5 with `cases`, but both branches still fail to derive a contradiction due to insufficient information about John's car.

The premises do not provide any information about John's car specifically. The fifth premise, when translated literally as a disjunction, is a tautology and adds no meaningful constraints. Even with a non-tautological interpretation (where the premise implies John's car is neither a Tesla Model 3 nor a single-seat electric car), the proof remains impossible because the premises do not force John's car to belong to any category that would yield a contradiction with the negation of the conclusion.

Thus, the theorem "John's car is a Tesla Model 3" cannot be proven from the given premises.
