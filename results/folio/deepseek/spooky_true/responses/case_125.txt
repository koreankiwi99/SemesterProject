The reasoning requires formalizing the premises in Lean and proving that Rock has wings. The key steps involve:

1. Proving Rock can fly by case analysis on the disjunction: 
   - If Rock can fly, we're done.
   - If Rock is a bird, birds can fly.
   - If Rock cannot breathe, we split cases:
     - If Rock is a monkey, we get a contradiction (monkeys are mammals→animals→breathe).
     - If Rock is a bird, birds can fly.

2. Using "fly implies wings" to conclude Rock has wings.
