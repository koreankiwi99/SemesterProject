The conclusion "Rock does not have wings" cannot be proven from the premises. Instead, the premises establish that Rock must have wings, which directly contradicts the conclusion.

**Reasoning:**
1. Rock is Peter's pet (given).
2. All Peter's pets are either monkeys or birds (premise 3).
3. If Rock is a monkey:
   - All monkeys are mammals (premise 2), so Rock is a mammal.
   - All mammals that are Peter's pets are animals (premise 1), so Rock is an animal.
   - All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe (premise 5), so Rock breathes.
   - Premise 8 states: Rock can fly OR is a bird OR cannot breathe. Since Rock breathes (and isn't a bird in this case), Rock must fly.
   - If Rock flies, then Rock has wings (premise 6).
4. If Rock is a bird:
   - Peter's birds can fly (premise 4), so Rock flies.
   - If Rock flies, then Rock has wings (premise 6).
5. Thus, in all cases, Rock has wings, making the conclusion "Rock does not have wings" unprovable.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the constants for properties (Mammal, Animal, etc.) were not properly declared as functions taking a `Pet` argument. The corrected code properly declares all properties as `Pet → Prop` and includes all premises as axioms. 

The conclusion "Rock does not have wings" (¬ HasWings Rock) cannot be proven from the premises. Instead, the premises imply that Rock must have wings:
1. Rock is Peter's pet (given)
2. All pets are monkeys or birds (P3)
3. If Rock is a monkey:
   - It's a mammal (P2) → animal (P1) → breathes (P5)
   - Premise 8: Since Rock breathes, it must fly or be a bird
   - If it flies, it has wings (P6)
   - If it's a bird, it flies (P4) and has wings
4. If Rock is a bird:
   - It flies (P4) and has wings (P6)

Thus, Rock has wings in all cases, making the conclusion unprovable.
