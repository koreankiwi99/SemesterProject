The premises establish that the Legend of Zelda was created by a Japanese company, all Top 10 games are Japanese-made, and million-copy sellers make the Top 10 list. While this proves the Legend of Zelda is Japanese-made (via premises 1, 3, and 4), no information connects FIFA 22 to these rules. Premise 2 is conditional on Top 10 status, but FIFA 22's sales or Top 10 inclusion are never mentioned. Thus, FIFA 22's origins cannot be proven from the given information.

axiom Game : Type
axiom LegendOfZelda : Game
axiom FIFA22 : Game
axiom Top10 : Game → Prop
axiom JapaneseMade : Game → Prop
axiom SellsOver1M : Game → Prop

axiom P1 : SellsOver1M LegendOfZelda
axiom P2 : ∀ g, SellsOver1M g → Top10 g
axiom P3 : ∀ g, Top10 g → JapaneseMade g
axiom P4 : JapaneseMade LegendOfZelda

theorem target : JapaneseMade FIFA22 := by
  /- 
  Attempted proof:
  - We know `JapaneseMade LegendOfZelda` (P4)
  - We know all Top10 games are Japanese-made (P3)
  - We know million-sellers enter Top10 (P2)
  But there are no axioms about FIFA22's sales, Top10 status, or maker.
  No deduction path exists to prove `JapaneseMade FIFA22`.
