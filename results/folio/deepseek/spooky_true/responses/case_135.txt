The premises state that plungers, vacuums, and vampires all share the property of sucking, while dusters do not suck. Additionally, space is identified as a vacuum. However, there is no premise linking vacuums to vampires beyond the shared property of sucking. Since multiple categories (plungers, vacuums, vampires) can suck without being equivalent, and no premise states that vacuums are vampires or that sucking implies being a vampire, we cannot conclude that space is a vampire.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Suck : obj → Prop
axiom Plunger : obj → Prop
axiom Vacuum : obj → Prop
axiom Vampire : obj → Prop
axiom HouseholdAppliance : obj → Prop
axiom Space : obj
axiom Duster : obj

axiom plungers_suck : ∀ x, Plunger x → Suck x
axiom vacuums_suck : ∀ x, Vacuum x → Suck x
axiom vampires_suck : ∀ x, Vampire x → Suck x
axiom space_vacuum : Vacuum Space
axiom duster_appliance : HouseholdAppliance Duster
axiom duster_no_suck : ¬ Suck Duster

theorem space_vampire : Vampire Space := by
  -- No axioms connect Vacuum to Vampire beyond the shared Suck property.
  -- Space sucks because it is a vacuum, but this does not imply it is a vampire.
  -- Without additional premises, the conclusion cannot be proven.
