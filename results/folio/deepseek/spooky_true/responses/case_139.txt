The Lean code below models the given premises and attempts to prove that "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" is rated General Audience. The proof succeeds only if the film is family-friendly animated (first disjunct of P7), but fails if it is appropriate for all ages without being family-friendly. Since no premise links "appropriate for all ages" to "rated General Audience", the proof remains incomplete in the second case.

<lean>
axiom Film : Type
axiom Hachi : Film
axiom AppropriateForAllAges : Film → Prop
axiom ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance : Film → Prop
axiom ContainsExcessiveEroticViolent : Film → Prop
axiom RatedGeneralAudience : Film → Prop
axiom IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated : Film → Prop
axiom IsInFrozenSeries : Film → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ f : Film, AppropriateForAllAges f → ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance f
axiom P2 : ∀ f : Film, ContainsExcessiveEroticViolent f → ¬ ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance f
axiom P3 : ∀ f : Film, RatedGeneralAudience f → AppropriateForAllAges f
axiom P4 : ∀ f : Film, IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated f → RatedGeneralAudience f
axiom P5 : ∀ f : Film, IsInFrozenSeries f → IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated f
axiom P7 : IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi

theorem goal : RatedGeneralAudience Hachi := by
  cases P7 with
  | inl h_fam => 
      exact P4 Hachi h_fam
  | inr _ => 
      sorry -- Stuck: No axiom proving appropriateness implies GA rating
