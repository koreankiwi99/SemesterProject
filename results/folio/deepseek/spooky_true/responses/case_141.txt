The premises provided do not allow us to definitively prove the conclusion. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - From P7, Hachi is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for all ages.
   - Using P4 and P3, family-friendly animated films are RatedGA and thus appropriate for all ages. Therefore, **Hachi is always appropriate for all ages**.
   - Using P1, **children can watch Hachi without guidance**.
   - Using P2, if Hachi had excessive content, children could not watch it without guidance, contradicting the above. So **Hachi has no excessive content**.

2. **Conclusion Evaluation**:  
   The conclusion states:  
   *(Hachi has excessive content and is in Frozen series) OR (Hachi has no excessive content and is not in Frozen series)*  
   Since we proved Hachi has no excessive content, this simplifies to:  
   *(false ∧ ...) ∨ (true ∧ ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi)* → **¬InFrozenSeries Hachi**

3. **Missing Premise**:  
   There are **no premises about whether Hachi is in the Frozen series**.  
   - If Hachi were in the Frozen series (by P5/P4/P3), it would be appropriate for all ages (consistent with what we know), but not forbidden.  
   - If not, it's also consistent.  
   **We cannot prove Hachi is NOT in the Frozen series.**

Since the conclusion depends on proving ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi (which is not derivable), the statement **cannot be proven**.

</lean>

We encounter a dead end in the proof because `should_be_proven` cannot be thoroughly proven with the given premises. Specifically, when `InFrozenSeries Hachi` is true, the first disjunct requires `ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi` (which is false) and the second requires ¬`InFrozenSeries Hachi` (which is false), leaving no path to complete the proof.

After analyzing the premises and attempting the proof in Lean, we find that the conclusion cannot be proven. Here's the corrected Lean code with a detailed explanation:

### Key Insights:
1. **Hachi has no excessive content**: From the premises, we deduce that Hachi is appropriate for all ages (using P7 and implications P5→P4→P3). This implies children can watch it without guidance (P1), which means it cannot have excessive content (P2).
2. **Missing critical information**: While we know Hachi isn't excessive, there are no premises to determine whether Hachi is in the Frozen series. The conclusion requires proving either:
   - *(Excessive AND InFrozen)* OR *(Not Excessive AND Not InFrozen)*  
   Given ¬Excessive, this simplifies to proving ¬InFrozenSeries.
3. **Unprovable case**: If Hachi were in the Frozen series (consistent with all premises but unknown), the conclusion fails:
   - *(false ∧ true)* OR *(true ∧ false)* → *false*

### Conclusion:
The proof fails in the case where `InFrozenSeries Hachi` is true. Since the premises neither confirm nor refute Hachi's inclusion in the Frozen series, the conclusion **cannot be proven**.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 3
======================================================================

After analyzing the problem, I've identified the core issue: while we can prove that "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" has no excessive content, we cannot determine its relationship to the Frozen series from the given premises. The proof fails because the conclusion requires knowledge about Frozen series membership that isn't provided.

Here's the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom Film : Type
axiom Hachi : Film
axiom AppropriateForAllAges : Film → Prop
axiom CanWatchWithoutGuidance : Film → Prop
axiom ContainsExcessiveContent : Film → Prop
axiom RatedGA : Film → Prop
axiom FamilyFriendlyAnimated : Film → Prop
axiom InFrozenSeries : Film → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ f : Film, AppropriateForAllAges f → CanWatchWithoutGuidance f
axiom P2 : ∀ f : Film, ContainsExcessiveContent f → ¬ CanWatchWithoutGuidance f
axiom P3 : ∀ f : Film, RatedGA f → AppropriateForAllAges f
axiom P4 : ∀ f : Film, FamilyFriendlyAnimated f → RatedGA f
axiom P5 : ∀ f : Film, InFrozenSeries f → FamilyFriendlyAnimated f
axiom P7 : FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi

theorem target : 
    (ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi ∧ InFrozenSeries Hachi) ∨ 
    (¬ ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi ∧ ¬ InFrozenSeries Hachi) := by 
  -- Prove Hachi has no excessive content
  have noExcessive : ¬ ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi := by
    have appropriate : AppropriateForAllAges Hachi := by
      cases P7 with
      | inl h => apply P3; exact (P4 Hachi h)
      | inr h => exact h
    exact fun he => P2 Hachi he (P1 Hachi appropriate)
  
  -- Prove the goal is equivalent to ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi
  have goal_equiv : (ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi ∧ InFrozenSeries Hachi) ∨ 
                    (¬ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi ∧ ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi) ↔ 
                    ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi := by 
    apply Iff.intro
    · intro h 
      cases h with
      | inl h1 => cases h1; contradiction  -- Uses noExcessive
      | inr h2 => exact h2.right
    · intro h 
      right 
      exact ⟨noExcessive, h⟩

  -- Goal reduces to proving ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi
  -- But NO premises provide information about Hachi's Frozen status
  -- Case analysis shows both branches are possible without contradiction:
  apply goal_equiv.mpr   -- Now we need ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi
  -- But we cannot prove Hachi isn't in Frozen series
  admit  -- Required to compile but proves nothing

</lean>

**Key insights from the proof attempt:**
1. We can prove ¬ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi using the premises:
   - Hachi is appropriate for all ages (from P7 and P3/P4)
   - Thus children can watch without guidance (P1)
   - Therefore it cannot have excessive content (P2)

2. The conclusion simplifies to ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi (see goal_equiv proof)

3. **Critical missing information**: There are no premises that:
   - Relate Hachi to the Frozen series
   - Specify that family-friendly films can/cannot be in Frozen series
   - Provide any information about Hachi's series membership

**Why Failure occurs:**  
The premises allow both possibilities for Hachi's Frozen status:
- If Hachi were in Frozen series, it would satisfy P5→P4→P3→P1 (consistent with all premises)
- If not, it's also consistent via P7
