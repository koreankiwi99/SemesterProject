The premises state that Heck cattle were bred back to resemble aurochs and that some animals bred back resemble extinct animals. However, there is no direct or indirect evidence that aurochs themselves are extinct. The existence of animals bred back that resemble extinct animals does not imply that every animal they resemble is extinct. Specifically, Heck cattle resemble aurochs, but this resemblance does not force aurochs to be extinct; they could be living. The premises do not provide sufficient information to conclude that aurochs are extinct.

-- Attempt to prove: Aurochs are extinct
theorem aurochs_extinct : Extinct Aurochs := by
  -- We know Heck cattle are bred back and resemble aurochs.
  -- The premise 'some_resemble_extinct' guarantees there exists some bred-back animal resembling an extinct animal.
  -- However, this does not specify that Heck cattle must be that animal or that aurochs must be the extinct animal.
  -- There could be multiple bred-back animals or multiple extinct animals.
  -- Without additional premises linking Heck cattle to the existential or forcing uniqueness, we cannot conclude aurochs are extinct.
  -- Attempt to use 'some_resemble_extinct' with Heck cattle:
  have ⟨x, hx_animal, hx_bred, ⟨y, hy_animal, hy_extinct, hx_resemble_y⟩⟩ := some_resemble_extinct
  -- We have Heck cattle as a candidate for x? But 'some_resemble_extinct' does not require x to be HeckCattle.
  -- Even if we assume x = HeckCattle (which we cannot), then y might not be Aurochs.
  -- The resemblance relation is not unique: Heck cattle resemble aurochs, but they might resemble another extinct animal instead.
  -- No premise states that resemblance to aurochs implies aurochs are extinct.
  -- Thus, we cannot prove Extinct Aurochs.
  sorry -- Proof fails

-- Since the theorem cannot be proven, we indicate failure.
