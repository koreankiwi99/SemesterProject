The reasoning involves showing that Ekaterina can participate in the election regardless of the case split from the premises. Premise 6 states that Ekaterina either can register to vote or is a Russian official. If she can register, premise 1 implies she can participate. If she is a Russian official, premise 4 implies she cannot hold Taiwanese citizenship, and premise 3 (that everyone has US or Taiwanese citizenship) forces her to have US citizenship. Then premise 2 implies she can register to vote, so again by premise 1 she can participate. Thus, Ekaterina always can participate, making the left disjunct of the conclusion true regardless of Vladimir.
