The reasoning follows directly from the premises. The context states that all books published by New Vessel Press are in English, and Neapolitan Chronicles is published by New Vessel Press. Therefore, Neapolitan Chronicles must be an English book. The information that it was translated from Italian is consistent with New Vessel Press's specialization but is not required for this deduction, as the second premise provides a universal claim about the publisher's books. The presence of Palace of Flies is noted but does not affect the proof.
