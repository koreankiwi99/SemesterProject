The reasoning involves proving that all squares are shapes based on the given premises. The premises state that all squares are four-sided and all four-sided things are shapes. Therefore, by transitivity, all squares must be shapes.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Square : obj → Prop
axiom FourSided : obj → Prop
axiom Shape : obj → Prop
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Square x → FourSided x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, FourSided x → Shape x
theorem all_squares_are_shapes : ∀ x : obj, Square x → Shape x :=
  fun x h =>
    have step1 : FourSided x := P1 x h
    P2 x step1
</lean>

The proof establishes the theorem by:
1. Assuming an arbitrary object `x` that is a square
2. Using premise P1 to show `x` is four-sided
3. Using premise P2 to show `x` is a shape

ANSWER: True
