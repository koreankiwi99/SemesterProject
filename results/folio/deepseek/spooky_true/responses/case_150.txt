The context provides no information about Harry Potter. The premises only mention specific books (Neapolitan Chronicles and Palace of Flies) published by New Vessel Press. There is no axiom or evidence linking Harry Potter to this publisher. Therefore, the statement "Harry Potter was published by New Vessel Press" cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Book : Type
axiom PublishedByNVP : Book → Prop
axiom nvc : Book
axiom pof : Book
axiom hp : Book
-- Axioms from context
axiom all_published_in_english : ∀ b, PublishedByNVP b → sorry  -- (not needed for this proof, but declared for completeness)
axiom nvc_published : PublishedByNVP nvc
axiom nvc_translated : sorry  -- (irrelevant for this proof)
axiom pof_published : PublishedByNVP pof
-- No axiom exists for hp
theorem statement : PublishedByNVP hp := by
  -- No available tactics can prove this since hp isn't mentioned in any axiom
  sorry
