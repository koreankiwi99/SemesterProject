The premises establish that the mixture cannot be a chemical compound due to the disjunction in axiom A6 and the contradiction with axiom A5. Since alkanes are hydrocarbons (A2), hydrocarbons are organic compounds (A1), and organic compounds are chemical compounds (A3), if the mixture were an alkane, it would be a chemical compound. However, we have proven that the mixture is not a chemical compound. Therefore, the mixture cannot be an alkane. While organic compounds contain carbon (A4), there are no premises linking non-organic compounds to carbon content. Hence, the statement that the mixture is both an alkane and contains carbon cannot be proven.

The corrected Lean code addresses the compilation errors and sets up the context for proving the statement. The key issues were:

1. In `mixture_not_chemical`, the proof now properly handles both cases of A6 by first assuming `ChemicalCompound mixture` and deriving contradictions in both disjuncts:
   - In the left case: Uses A5 to show contradiction between `ChemicalCompound mixture` and `ContainsOnlyOneElement mixture`
   - In the right case: Direct contradiction from assuming `ChemicalCompound mixture` when it's negated

2. `mixture_not_alkane` remains valid, showing that if the mixture were an alkane, it would lead to being a chemical compound (via hydrocarbons → organic → chemical), contradicting `mixture_not_chemical`.

3. For the target theorem:
   - We attempt to prove "The mixture is an alkane and contains carbon"
   - The first conjunct (`Alkane mixture`) cannot be proven (we've proved its negation)
   - The second conjunct (`ContainsCarbon mixture`) has no supporting axioms for non-organic compounds
   - Therefore, the proof is incomplete and requires `sorry`

The statement to evaluate does not follow from the premises because:
- The mixture cannot be an alkane (proven)
- While alkanes imply carbon content via the organic chain, the mixture's non-alkane status leaves its carbon content undetermined by the axioms

I've fixed the Lean code compilation errors by correcting the proof approach. The key issues were:
1. The `mixture_not_chemical` proof now correctly uses the introduced hypothesis `h_chem` in both cases
2. The `target` theorem properly acknowledges we cannot complete the proof

ANSWER: Failure

**Explanation:**  
The statement "The mixture is an alkane and contains carbon" cannot be proven because:
1. We've conclusively shown `mixture` cannot be an alkane (since alkanes are chemical compounds, and we've proven the mixture cannot be a chemical compound)
2. The premises only guarantee carbon content for organic compounds, but since the mixture cannot be organic (as organic compounds are chemical compounds), we have no information about its carbon content
3. Therefore, the conjunction fails on the first component (`Alkane mixture` is false)
