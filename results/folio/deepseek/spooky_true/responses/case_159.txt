The premises lead to a contradiction, which allows proving any conclusion, including that James takes the database course. Specifically:

- Premise 6 states James works in the lab (`works_in_lab James`).
- Premise 7 states it is not true that James works in the lab or has a university job (`¬ (works_in_lab James ∨ has_university_job James)`).
- From `works_in_lab James`, we derive `works_in_lab James ∨ has_university_job James` (by disjunction introduction), contradicting premise 7.
- This contradiction (`False`) allows proving `takes_database_course James` via ex falso quodlibet.
