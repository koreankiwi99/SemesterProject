The reasoning follows from the premises. Assuming George likes music (L) and has access to a program (A):  
- By premise 1, L implies he wants to compose (W).  
- By premise 2, A implies he can compose (C).  
- With C and W, premise 3 states he will compose (P).  
Thus, L ∧ A → P is provable.

<lean>
axiom L : Prop  -- George likes music
axiom A : Prop  -- George has access to a program
axiom W : Prop  -- George wants to compose
axiom C : Prop  -- George can compose
axiom P : Prop  -- George will compose

axiom P1 : L → W
axiom P2 : A → C
axiom P3 : C ∧ W → P

theorem conclusion : L ∧ A → P :=
  fun h =>
    have w : W := P1 h.left
    have c : C := P2 h.right
    P3 ⟨c, w⟩
</lean>
