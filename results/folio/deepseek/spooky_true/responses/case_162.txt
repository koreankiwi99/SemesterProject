The premises state that no hawk swims and that there exists at least one bird that is a hawk. The conclusion claims all birds swim. However, the hawk-bird from the second premise cannot swim (by the first premise), providing a counterexample to the universal claim. Thus, the conclusion cannot be proven from the premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Hawk : obj → Prop
axiom Bird : obj → Prop
axiom Swim : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x, Hawk x → ¬ Swim x
axiom P2 : ∃ x, Bird x ∧ Hawk x

theorem all_birds_swim : ∀ x, Bird x → Swim x :=
  fun x hBird =>
  -- Attempt to prove Swim x for arbitrary bird x
  -- No premise links Bird x directly to Swim x
  -- P2 provides a specific bird that is a hawk (and thus doesn't swim), 
  -- but offers no general rule for all birds.
  -- Without additional axioms (e.g., "all hawks are birds" or "all birds except hawks swim"),
  -- the conclusion cannot be proven.
