The premises state that Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician, which implies he was German. The conclusion is a disjunction: "German or Russian or both." Since we have established that Heinrich Schmidt was German, this satisfies the first disjunct (German), making the entire disjunction true regardless of the Russian condition. The additional information about political positions is irrelevant to his nationality.

axiom obj : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : obj
axiom German : obj → Prop
axiom Russian : obj → Prop

-- From "Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician" we infer his German nationality
axiom german_politician : German HeinrichSchmidt

-- Prove the disjunction: German ∨ Russian ∨ (German ∧ Russian) 
theorem statement : German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt ∨ (German HeinrichSchmidt ∧ Russian HeinrichSchmidt) := 
  Or.inl german_politician  -- Uses left disjunct since German is true

ANSWER: True
