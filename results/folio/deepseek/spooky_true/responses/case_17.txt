The reasoning involves analyzing the premises to determine if "Rockie is not a turtle" can be proven. The key steps are:

1. **Premises:**
   - All spotted rabbits are cute (irrelevant to conclusion).
   - Some turtles are spotted (shows turtles exist, but doesn't involve Rockie).
   - Only rabbits and squirrels are spotted near campus.
   - Skittish animals are not calm.
   - All spotted squirrels are skittish.
   - Rockie is spotted and calm.

2. **Analysis for Rockie:**
   - Since Rockie is spotted, by premise 3, Rockie must be a rabbit or squirrel.
   - If Rockie were a squirrel, premise 5 would make Rockie skittish, and premise 4 would make Rockie not calm. This contradicts premise 6 (Rockie is calm).
   - Therefore, Rockie cannot be a squirrel and must be a rabbit.

3. **Conclusion about turtles:**
   - Rockie is a rabbit, but there is no premise stating that rabbits cannot be turtles. The existence of spotted turtles (premise 2) does not imply Rockie cannot be a turtle, as an animal could potentially be both a rabbit and a turtle (no disjointness axiom).
   - Rockie's calmness does not conflict with being a turtle, as no premise links turtle species to calmness or skittishness.

4. **Proof outcome:**
   - While Rockie must be a rabbit (not a squirrel), the conclusion "Rockie is not a turtle" cannot be proven without additional premises about species exclusivity.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to the use of term-mode proofs with complex expressions that Lean had trouble parsing. The corrected code uses tactic-mode proofs, which are more robust and align with the requirement to use `by` followed by tactics.

### Key Corrections:
1. **Replaced term-mode proofs with tactic-mode proofs**:
   - Used `by` with structured tactics (`intro`, `have`, `exact`, `cases`) instead of lambda abstractions and `match` expressions.
2. **Explicitly handled disjunction** with `cases` tactic instead of `match`.
3. **Clarified proof structure** for lemmas to avoid type inference issues.

-- Attempt to prove ¬ Turtle Rockie fails due to lack of species exclusivity
-- No premise states that rabbits and turtles are disjoint
</lean>

### Proof Analysis:
- **Rockie is not a squirrel** (`not_squirrel_Rockie`):  
  If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish (by `A5`), contradicting Rockie's calmness (by `A4` and `A6`).
- **Rockie is a rabbit** (`rabbit_Rockie`):  
  Since Rockie is spotted and not a squirrel, it must be a rabbit (by `A3`).

**Why "Rockie is not a turtle" cannot be proven**:  
- Premises confirm Rockie is a rabbit, but **no axiom states rabbits and turtles are mutually exclusive**.  
- `A2` confirms turtles exist near campus, but Rockie could theoretically be both a rabbit and a turtle without contradiction.  
- Calmness (`A6`) doesn't conflict with turtle identity, as no premise links turtles to skittishness.

**Conclusion**: The statement "Rockie is not a turtle" is unprovable from the given premises.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to improper handling of the proof state in tactic mode. Specifically, the term `h_not_calm A6.right` in the first lemma was missing tactical structure (`exact`), and the `cases` tactic syntax needed adjustment. Here's the corrected code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Rockie : obj

axiom SpottedNearCampus : obj → Prop
axiom Skittish : obj → Prop
axiom Calm : obj → Prop
axiom Rabbit : obj → Prop
axiom Turtle : obj → Prop
axiom Squirrel : obj → Prop

axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Turtle x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, SpottedNearCampus x → Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Squirrel x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x → Skittish x
axiom A6 : SpottedNearCampus Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

lemma not_squirrel_Rockie : ¬ Squirrel Rockie := by
  intro h
  have h_spotted := A6.left
  have h_sq := ⟨h, h_spotted⟩
  have h_skittish := A5 Rockie h_sq
  have h_not_calm := A4 Rockie h_skittish
  exact h_not_calm A6.right

lemma rabbit_Rockie : Rabbit Rockie := by
  have h_spot := A6.left
  cases A3 Rockie h_spot with
  | inl h_rabbit => exact h_rabbit
  | inr h_squirrel => exact (not_squirrel_Rockie h_squirrel).elim
</lean>

### Reasoning Summary:
1. **Rockie is not a squirrel** (proven):
   - If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish (by `A5`)
   - Skittish animals are not calm (by `A4`), contradicting Rockie's calmness (by `A6`)

2. **Rockie is a rabbit** (proven):
   - Rockie is spotted (by `A6`)
   - Spotted animals are rabbits or squirrels (by `A3`)
   - Since Rockie isn't a squirrel, it must be a rabbit

3. **Rockie is not a turtle cannot be proven**:
   - While Rockie is a rabbit, no premise states rabbits and turtles are disjoint species
   - `A2` confirms there are spotted turtles, but Rockie could theoretically be both rabbit and turtle without logical contradiction
   - Calmness property doesn't constrain turtles, so no conflict exists
