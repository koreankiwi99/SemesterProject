The context provides several premises about health habits, but the statement about Taylor cannot be proven conclusively. Here's the Lean analysis:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Taylor : Person

axiom EatsSaladsRegularly : Person → Prop
axiom HealthConscious : Person → Prop
axiom GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome : Person → Prop
axiom FulfillsNutrition : Person → Prop
axiom DisregardsPhysicalWellbeing : Person → Prop
axiom VisitsGymDaily : Person → Prop

-- Premise 1: Salad eaters are health-conscious
axiom A1 : ∀ p, EatsSaladsRegularly p → HealthConscious p

-- Premise 2: Health-conscious homes lead to salad eating
axiom A2 : ∀ p, GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p → EatsSaladsRegularly p

-- Premise 3: Fulfilling nutrition implies health-conscious home
axiom A3 : ∀ p, FulfillsNutrition p → GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome p

-- Premise 4: Disregarding health implies not health-conscious
axiom A4 : ∀ p, DisregardsPhysicalWellbeing p → ¬ HealthConscious p

-- Premise 5: Daily gym visits ensure nutrition fulfillment
axiom A5 : ∀ p, VisitsGymDaily p → FulfillsNutrition p

-- Premise 6: Taylor's exclusive cases
axiom A6 : (GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor ∧ DisregardsPhysicalWellbeing Taylor) ∨ 
           (¬ GrewUpInHealthConsciousHome Taylor ∧ ¬ DisregardsPhysicalWellbeing Taylor)

theorem prove_taylor_eats : EatsSaladsRegularly Taylor := by 
  cases A6
  case inl h => 
    -- Case 1: Health-conscious home and disregards wellbeing
    let ⟨health_home, disregards⟩ := h
    -- Must eat salads by A2
    apply A2 Taylor health_home
  case inr h => 
    -- Case 2: Not health-conscious home and not disregards wellbeing
    let ⟨no_health_home, _⟩ := h
    -- No available premise to establish salad eating
    -- Attempting to derive a contradiction using gym visits...
    -- Could assume gym visits would imply nutrition → health_home (A3),
    -- but with no_gym/nutrition info, we cannot
    have : ¬ EatsSaladsRegularly Taylor := by 
      intro salad
      have health := A1 Taylor salad
      have home := (A2 Taylor).mp salad
      contradiction  -- Use of home contradicts no_health_home
    contradiction
</lean>

The proof attempt fails:
- Left case: `A2` gives salad eating from health-conscious home, but this case also contains `DisregardsPhysicalWellbeing`. Combining this with `A4` and `A1` yields a contradiction (`HealthConscious Taylor` vs `¬HealthConscious Taylor`), making this case inconsistent.
- Right case: There's no pathway from the premises to prove salad eating, and the negated conditions block all potential chains of reasoning.

Since neither case sustains the conclusion without unresolved dependencies, the statement cannot be proven.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect usage of `.mp` on implications and an invalid contradiction tactic. After correcting the Lean code, the proof attempt shows:

1. **Case 1 (Taylor grew up in a health-conscious home and disregards physical well-being)**:
   - `A2` proves Taylor eats salads regularly from her home background.
   - `A1` proves she is health-conscious from salad eating.
   - `A4` proves she is not health-conscious from disregarding physical well-being.
   - This creates a contradiction (`HealthConscious Taylor` vs `¬HealthConscious Taylor`), making Case 1 impossible.

2. **Case 2 (Taylor did NOT grow up in a health-conscious home and does NOT disregard physical well-being)**:
   - No premises connect these conditions to salad eating.
   - Gym visits/nutrition premises remain unused due to lack of data about Taylor.
   - Assuming salad eating doesn't yield contradictions (contrapositives of premises don't help).
   - Thus, `EatsSaladsRegularly Taylor` cannot be proven.

The conclusion does not follow from the premises.
