The context explicitly states that the last summer Olympic games were in Tokyo. The statement to evaluate claims the opposite: that they were not in Tokyo. This directly contradicts the premise. Therefore, it is impossible to prove the statement from the given context.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom last_summer_olympic : obj
axiom Tokyo : obj
axiom was_in : obj → obj → Prop
axiom last_in_tokyo : was_in last_summer_olympic Tokyo

-- The statement to evaluate: "The last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo"
theorem evaluate : ¬ was_in last_summer_olympic Tokyo := 
  by 
    -- Attempt to prove by contradiction or other means fails due to axiom
    -- We have the axiom `last_in_tokyo` as direct evidence against the negation
    -- No valid proof path exists given the premises
    sorry  -- Proof cannot be completed
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure
