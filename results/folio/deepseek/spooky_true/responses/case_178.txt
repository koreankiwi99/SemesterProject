The premises state that all horses have hooves and no humans have hooves. The conclusion claims that some humans are horses. However, these premises imply that horses and humans are disjoint categories because any entity that is a horse must have hooves, but no human can have hooves. Therefore, there cannot exist an entity that is both a human and a horse. Attempting to prove the existential statement "some humans are horses" leads to a contradiction under the given premises. Since no proof of the conclusion can be constructed from the premises, the result is Failure.

The compilation error occurred because the `intro` tactic was incorrectly applied to an existential goal (`∃ x, ...`). In Lean, existential goals require providing a witness using `exists` or similar tactics, not `intro`. However, in this case, the existential statement "Some humans are horses" is actually false given the premises. The premises imply that no entity can be both human and horse, making it impossible to prove the existential claim.

Corrected Lean code:
<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Horse : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Hooves : obj → Prop

axiom all_horses_have_hooves : ∀ x, Horse x → Hooves x
axiom no_humans_have_hooves : ∀ x, Human x → ¬ Hooves x

theorem some_humans_are_horses : ∃ x, Human x ∧ Horse x :=
  by
    -- Attempt to provide a witness fails due to contradictory premises
    -- Show that any candidate witness leads to contradiction
    intro h  -- Now correctly handles negation of existential? Wait, goal is positive existential.
    -- Correction: For positive existential, we must construct a term.
    -- Since we cannot, we demonstrate impossibility:
    have no_overlap : ∀ x, Human x → ¬ Horse x := 
      fun x hx_human hx_horse =>
        have hooves_x : Hooves x := all_horses_have_hooves x hx_horse
        have no_hooves : ¬ Hooves x := no_humans_have_hooves x hx_human
        no_hooves hooves_x
    
    -- But this doesn't directly help prove ∃; it shows why we can't
    sorry  -- Proof impossible

The compilation error occurred because `intro h` was incorrectly used on an existential goal (`∃ x, ...`). In Lean, existential goals require constructing a witness, not introducing an assumption. However, the premises imply that no entity can be both human and horse, making it impossible to prove the existential statement. The corrected code avoids invalid tactics and uses `sorry` to indicate an unprovable goal.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Horse : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Hooves : obj → Prop

axiom all_horses_have_hooves : ∀ x, Horse x → Hooves x
axiom no_humans_have_hooves : ∀ x, Human x → ¬ Hooves x

theorem some_humans_are_horses : ∃ x, Human x ∧ Horse x :=
  by
    -- Prove that any candidate witness leads to contradiction
    have no_such_x : ¬∃ x, Human x ∧ Horse x := 
      fun ⟨x, ⟨h_human, h_horse⟩⟩ => 
        have hooves_x : Hooves x := all_horses_have_hooves x h_horse
        no_humans_have_hooves x h_human hooves_x
    
    -- Cannot prove existential; goal remains unprovable
    sorry
