The reasoning is as follows:
- Rockie is spotted and calm (premise 6).
- Only rabbits or squirrels can be spotted (premise 3), so Rockie must be a rabbit or squirrel.
- If Rockie is a rabbit, then Rockie is cute (premise 1).
- If Rockie is a squirrel, then Rockie is skittish (premise 5). Skittish implies not calm (premise 4), but Rockie is calm – contradiction.
- Thus, Rockie cannot be a squirrel and must be a rabbit, meaning Rockie is cute.
- Cute satisfies "Rockie is a turtle or cute" via disjunction introduction.

This proof holds despite the seemingly contradictory existence of spotted turtles (premise 2). The existential claim about turtles doesn't affect Rockie's case. The conclusion follows.
