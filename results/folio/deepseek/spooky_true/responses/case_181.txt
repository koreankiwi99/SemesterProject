The premises provide the following information:
- No one can be both nice to animals and mean to animals.
- There exists at least one grumpy person who is mean to animals.
- All animal lovers are nice to animals.
- All pet owners are animal lovers.
- Tom is a pet owner.

From these, we deduce:
- Tom is a pet owner → Tom is an animal lover (A4)
- Tom is an animal lover → Tom is nice to animals (A3)
- Tom is nice to animals → Tom is not mean to animals (A1)

The second premise guarantees that some grumpy person exists but doesn't specify who. Since Tom is not mean to animals (contradicting a property shared by the known grumpy individuals), and no premises link pet ownership or animal love to grumpiness, we cannot infer that Tom is grumpy.

Lean verification confirms this conclusion:

axiom A3 : ∀ x : U, AnimalLover x → NiceToAnimals x

-- Proven properties of Tom

theorem Tom_nice : NiceToAnimals Tom := by
  apply A3 Tom Tom_animal_lover

theorem Tom_not_mean : ¬ MeanToAnimals Tom := by
  apply A1 Tom Tom_nice

-- Attempt to prove Tom is grumpy fails
theorem disproved : GrumpyPerson Tom := by
  -- Unable to find proof: 
  -- A2 shows existence of grumpy+mean, but Tom lacks mean property.
  -- No rule forces pet owners to be grumpy.
  sorry -- Proof fails
