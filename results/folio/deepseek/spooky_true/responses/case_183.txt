The premises establish that Tom is a pet owner, hence an animal lover (from "All pet owners love animals"), and therefore nice to animals (from "All animal lovers are nice to animals"). By the first premise, no one nice to animals is mean to animals, so Tom is not mean to animals. The antecedent of the statement, "Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals," is true because Tom is not mean to animals. However, the consequent, "Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover," is false because Tom is an animal lover. Thus, the implication (true → false) is false and cannot be proven from the premises.

The error occurred because attempting to prove `¬AnimalLover Tom` by contradiction is impossible since we already have `AnimalLover Tom` (from `Tom_animal_lover`). The target theorem requires proving `¬ GrumpyPerson Tom ∧ ¬ AnimalLover Tom` given the antecedent `¬(GrumpyPerson Tom ∧ MeanToAnimals Tom)`. However, the second conjunct `¬ AnimalLover Tom` directly contradicts the established fact `AnimalLover Tom`. 

While the antecedent is true (because Tom is not mean to animals), the consequent is false because Tom is an animal lover. Thus, the implication ("if...then...") does not hold, and we cannot prove it from the premises.

      sorry,    
    by          -- Second goal: ¬AnimalLover Tom (contradicts Tom_animal_lover)
      exact fun h_animal => h_animal Tom_animal_lover  -- This fails because `h_animal` expects false, but we have proof
    ⟩ 
</lean>

The second part of the proof fails because:
1. `Tom_animal_lover : AnimalLover Tom` is a fact
2. Assuming `¬AnimalLover Tom` leads to `AnimalLover Tom → False`
3. Applying this to `Tom_animal_lover` should derive `False`, but Lean cannot unify because:
   - `h_animal : ¬AnimalLover Tom = AnimalLover Tom → False`
   - `h_animal Tom_animal_lover : False`
   However, this proves `False` under the assumption, which would close the goal by contradiction, but only if we had contradictory hypotheses. In this case, there's no contradiction in the context - we're simply using the assumption to disprove itself with a known fact.

But note: this proves that the assumption `¬AnimalLover Tom` leads to a contradiction, which actually proves `AnimalLover Tom` (double negation). Therefore, we cannot use this to satisfy the goal of proving `¬AnimalLover Tom`.

Since we cannot prove the required `¬AnimalLover Tom` (as it contradicts the premises), the target theorem is unprovable.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred due to a logical inconsistency in attempting to prove `¬ AnimalLover Tom` while having `Tom_animal_lover : AnimalLover Tom` as an established fact. The proof attempt incorrectly tried to construct a function that would derive a contradiction, but this is impossible since there is no contradictory hypothesis in the context. The premises directly contradict the second conjunct (`¬ AnimalLover Tom`) of the conclusion.

theorem Tom_animal_lover : AnimalLover Tom := P4 Tom P5
theorem Tom_nice : NiceToAnimals Tom := P3 Tom Tom_animal_lover

theorem target : (¬ (GrumpyPerson Tom ∧ MeanToAnimals Tom)) → (¬ GrumpyPerson Tom ∧ ¬ AnimalLover Tom) := 
  fun h => 
    ⟨by  -- Goal: ¬GrumpyPerson Tom (no premises about Tom's grumpiness)
      sorry, 
    by  -- Goal: ¬AnimalLover Tom (contradicts Tom_animal_lover)
      exact absurd Tom_animal_lover  -- Attempt to derive contradiction fails
    ⟩
</lean>

**Explanation:**
1. The antecedent `¬ (GrumpyPerson Tom ∧ MeanToAnimals Tom)` is true (since `Tom_not_mean` makes the conjunction false).
2. The conclusion requires proving both:
   - `¬ GrumpyPerson Tom`: No premises provide information about Tom's grumpiness (unprovable).
   - `¬ AnimalLover Tom`: Directly contradicts `Tom_animal_lover` (provably false).
3. The `absurd` tactic fails because there is no contradictory hypothesis - `Tom_animal_lover` is a consistent fact.

Since the conclusion contains a false statement (`¬ AnimalLover Tom`), the implication cannot be proven from the premises.
