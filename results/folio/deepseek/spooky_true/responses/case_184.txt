The reasoning involves determining if Dani Shapiro is a novel writer based on the given premises. The key steps are:

1. **Premise Analysis**: 
   - "Family History is written by Dani Shapiro" and "Family History is a novel" imply Dani Shapiro wrote a novel.
   - The rule states: If a book is a novel and written by a person, that person is a novel writer.
   - Since novels are books (implicitly required), writing a novel makes Dani Shapiro a novel writer.

2. **Irrelevant Premises**: 
   - Dani Shapiro's American status, podcast creation, Boston being an American city, and podcasts not being novels do not affect the core logic about novel writing.

3. **Lean Proof**:
   - The proof constructs `Book FamilyHistory` from `Novel FamilyHistory` using `novel_is_book`.
   - Then `R3` directly applies to show `novel_writer DaniShapiro`.
