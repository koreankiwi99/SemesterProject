The reasoning involves evaluating whether "Family Secrets is a novel" follows from the given premises. The key steps are:

1. **Premise analysis**: 
   - "A podcast is not a novel" implies podcasts and novels are mutually exclusive.
   - "Dani Shapiro created a podcast called Family Secrets" establishes Family Secrets as a podcast.
   - Therefore, Family Secrets cannot be a novel.

2. **Proof attempt**: 
   - No premises connect podcasts to novels positively.
   - Premises about Dani Shapiro's nationality, birthplace, or other works (like Family History) are irrelevant to Family Secrets' classification.
   - Attempting to prove "Family Secrets is a novel" leads to contradiction with premise 1 but cannot be proven directly.

3. **Conclusion**: The statement "Family Secrets is a novel" does not follow from the premises and is contradicted by them. Thus, it cannot be proven.

-- Premise 1: A podcast is not a novel.
axiom P1 : ∀ w, Podcast w → ¬ Novel w

-- Premise 2: If born in American city, then American.
axiom P2 : ∀ (p : Person) (c : City), AmericanCity c → BornIn p c → American p

-- Premise 3: If a novel is written by a person, they are a novel writer.
axiom P3 : ∀ (w : Work) (p : Person), Novel w → WrittenBy w p → NovelWriter p

-- Premise 4: Dani Shapiro is American (writer part not used).
axiom P4 : American dani

-- Premise 5: Family History written by Dani Shapiro.
axiom P5 : WrittenBy familyHistory dani

-- Premise 6: Family History is a novel.
axiom P6 : Novel familyHistory

-- Premise 7: Dani created podcast Family Secrets.
axiom P7a : CreatedBy familySecrets dani
axiom P7b : Podcast familySecrets

-- Premise 8: Boston is an American city.
axiom P8 : AmericanCity boston

-- Attempt to prove Family Secrets is a novel.
theorem familySecrets_novel : Novel familySecrets := by
  -- No premises support Novel familySecrets.
  -- P7b and P1 prove ¬Novel familySecrets, causing contradiction if assumed.
  -- Other premises (about Dani's nationality, Family History) are irrelevant.
  -- Proof fails.
