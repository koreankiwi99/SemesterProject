The conclusion "If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player" does not follow from the premises. The premises prove that Yuri cannot be a professional basketball player (due to the chain: ¬activates leg muscles → ¬leaps → ¬jump shots → ¬professional player). Thus, the antecedent of the implication (Yuri is not an American professional basketball player) is true (since he isn't a professional player at all), but the consequent (Yuri is a professional basketball player) is false. This makes the entire implication false under the premises.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The conclusion states: "If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player." After analyzing the premises:

1. Some professional basketball players are not American (non-essential to Yuri)
2. All professional players can do jump shots
3. Jump shots imply leaping straight into the air
4. Leaping implies activating leg muscles
5. Yuri doesn't activate his leg muscles

We prove:  
- Yuri cannot be a professional player (using premises 2, 3, 4, and 5 by contradiction).  
- Thus, "Yuri is not an American professional player" is true.  
- However, "Yuri is a professional player" is false.  

The implication has a true antecedent and false consequent, which is false. The proof fails because we cannot derive the consequent under any assumptions. The Lean code reflects this impasse with `sorry`.
