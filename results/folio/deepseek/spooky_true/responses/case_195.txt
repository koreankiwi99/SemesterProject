The given premises do not allow us to prove that KiKi is terricolous. While we can prove that KiKi has legs (using the premises and classical logic), there is no path to deduce terricolousness specifically. The premises about Jane and dogs do not constrain KiKi's terricolous property, and the conditional premise regarding KiKi's jumping and leg status does not force terricolousness when combined with other facts.

The compilation errors arose due to missing explicit type annotations for the bound variables in the axioms. The corrected code adds `(x : obj)` to all quantified variables, ensuring Lean recognizes the types. 

The main issue is that the premises do not provide sufficient information to prove that KiKi is terricolous. Specifically:
- We know KiKi is an animal (P6).
- Premise P5 states that terricolous animals have legs, but not the converse.
- Premise P7 only applies if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, but we cannot establish this condition universally.
- Jane's preferences (P1-P3) relate to barking and jumping but do not constrain terricolousness.
- Case analysis on legs/jumping shows that terricolous can only be proven in one specific case (no legs and no jump), but other cases remain unprovable.

Thus, the conclusion "KiKi is terricolous" cannot be derived from the premises.
