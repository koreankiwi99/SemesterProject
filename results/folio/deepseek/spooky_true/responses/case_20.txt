The premises lead to a contradiction when combined with the existence of turtles (from premise 2) and the restriction that only rabbits and squirrels can be spotted (premise 3). However, this inconsistency doesn't force Rockie to be a turtle. Specifically:

- Rockie is spotted and calm (premise 6).
- By premise 3, Rockie must be a rabbit or squirrel.
- If Rockie were a squirrel, premise 5 would make Rockie skittish, contradicting premise 4 (skittish implies not calm, but Rockie is calm).
- Thus, Rockie must be a rabbit (premise 1 makes Rockie cute).
- The conclusion requires Rockie to be a skittish turtle, but Rockie is a rabbit (not a turtle) and calm (not skittish).

The implication "If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle" has a true antecedent (Rockie is cute and calm) but false consequent (Rockie is neither skittish nor a turtle), making the overall statement false. The premises don't prove this false conclusion.
