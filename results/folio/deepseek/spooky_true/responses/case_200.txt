The premises state that Ailton was loaned out to Braga and that Braga is a football club. Therefore, it follows that Ailton was loaned out to a football club (namely Braga). The statement to evaluate claims that Ailton was not loaned out to a football club, which directly contradicts the premises. Since we can prove the negation of the statement, it is impossible to prove the statement itself.

axiom fluminense : obj

-- The statement to prove: "Ailton was not loaned out to a football club"
theorem ailton_not_loaned : ¬∃ club : obj, Club club ∧ Loaned ailton club :=
by
  -- Proof attempt (leads to contradiction)
  intro h  -- Assume there exists a club to which Ailton was loaned
  let ⟨club, hClub, hLoaned⟩ := h  -- Extract a witness club
  -- We know Ailton was loaned to Braga (a club), which contradicts the theorem
  -- The premises directly falsify the theorem, so proof fails here
  sorry  -- Admit failure (cannot prove the theorem)
