The premises provide information about Ailton Silva's club affiliations with Braga (via loan) and Náutico (current club), and identify Fluminense as a football club. However, there is no direct or indirect connection established between Ailton Silva and Fluminense in the given context. The existence of Fluminense as a club doesn't imply Ailton Silva played for it, and the premises don't contain transitive properties or additional links that would support this conclusion.
