The reasoning involves proving that Ailton Silva was loaned out to a football club based on the given premises. The key steps are:
1. Premise 2 states "Ailton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga."
2. Premise 1 identifies "Ailton Silva" as commonly known as "Ailton," so they refer to the same entity.
3. Thus, Ailton Silva was loaned out to Braga.
4. Premise 4 states "Náutico is a football club along with Braga," meaning Braga is a football club.
5. Therefore, Braga is a football club to which Ailton Silva was loaned.

This proves the statement: ∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedOutTo ailton_silva c.
