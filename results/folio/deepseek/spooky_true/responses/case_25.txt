axiom obj : Type
axiom Beijing : obj
axiom LocatedInNorthernChina : obj → Prop
axiom LocatedInSouthernChina : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : LocatedInNorthernChina Beijing  -- From "Beijing is located in Northern China"

-- The statement to evaluate: "Beijing is located in southern China"
-- We attempt to prove LocatedInSouthernChina Beijing
theorem beijing_in_south : LocatedInSouthernChina Beijing := by
  -- We have no premise stating Beijing is in southern China.
  -- Premise T1 states Beijing is in Northern China.
  -- Without additional axioms linking Northern and Southern China (e.g., mutual exclusivity),
  -- we cannot derive LocatedInSouthernChina Beijing from the given context.
  -- Other context facts (Olympics, universities) are irrelevant to location.
  -- Thus, proof fails.
