After careful analysis of the premises and attempting to prove the statement "Marvin is an alien" in Lean, the proof cannot be completed due to a critical gap in the second case of the disjunction. The reasoning is as follows:

1. In the case where Marvin is from both Earth and Mars:
   - Premise "If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien" directly implies Marvin is an alien.

2. In the case where Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars:
   - Premise "If Marvin is not from Earth, then he is an extraterrestrial" applies, making Marvin extraterrestrial.
   - However, while "All aliens are extraterrestrials" (subset relation), there is no premise stating all extraterrestrials are aliens.
   - Other premises (e.g., intelligence, human-nonhuman distinctions) do not force extraterrestrials to be aliens in this context.

The conclusion fails in the second case, and since no contradiction exists to eliminate it, the statement is unprovable from the premises.

axiom P1 : ∀ b, Alien b → Extraterrestrial b
axiom P2 : ∀ b, FromMars b → Alien b
axiom P3 : ∀ b, Extraterrestrial b → ¬ Human b

axiom P5 : HighlyIntelligent Marvin
