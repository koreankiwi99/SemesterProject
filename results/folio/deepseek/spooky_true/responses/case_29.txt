    exact h_not_human
</lean>

**Explanation of the proof attempt:**
- **Case 1 (Marvin from both Earth and Mars):** This leads to a contradiction. From `FromMars Marvin`, we derive `Alien Marvin` (A2), then `Extraterrestrial Marvin` (A1), and finally `¬Human Marvin` (A3). However, from `FromEarth Marvin` and `HighlyIntelligent Marvin` (A5), A4 necessitates `Human Marvin`, yielding a contradiction.
- **Case 2 (Marvin from neither Earth nor Mars):** Using premise A7, `¬FromEarth Marvin` implies `Extraterrestrial Marvin`, which via A3 proves `¬Human Marvin`. This directly contradicts the goal `Human Marvin` (expected to hold under the implication). Since the implication's premise `¬FromMars Marvin` is true in this case, but the consequence `Human Marvin` is false, the conclusion does not hold.

The conclusion "If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human" **cannot be proven** from the premises. The second case (the only consistent scenario given premise contradictions) violates the implication.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After analyzing the compilation error and re-evaluating the proof, it's clear that the second case (where Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars) cannot produce a proof of `Human Marvin`. The premises lead to a contradiction in the first case (Marvin being from both Earth and Mars), but in the second case, the derivation of `¬Human Marvin` directly conflicts with the goal of proving `Human Marvin` under the assumption `¬FromMars Marvin`. 

The Lean code has been corrected by:
1. Removing the invalid `exact h_not_human` in the second case
2. Using `contradiction` in the first case (which succeeds due to conflicting proofs)
3. Acknowledging the dead end in the second case with `unreachable` since the first case is impossible, but the second case still cannot prove the goal

However, `unreachable` only works if Lean can prove the branch is impossible, which it cannot here. The proof remains incomplete, confirming the theorem is unprovable from the premises.

    unreachable  -- Marking as unreachable, but Lean fails as this branch is possible
</lean>

**Error Analysis:**  
The `unreachable` tactic causes a compilation error because Lean cannot verify that this branch is unreachable. The premises allow the second case (Marvin from neither planet), where:
- `¬FromEarth Marvin` implies `Extraterrestrial Marvin` (A7)
- `Extraterrestrial Marvin` implies `¬Human Marvin` (A3)  
Thus, the goal `Human Marvin` under `¬FromMars Marvin` is unattainable in this case.

Since the implication's antecedent (`¬FromMars Marvin`) is true in the second case but the consequent (`Human Marvin`) is false, the overall implication cannot be proven.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because in the second branch (where Marvin is from neither Earth nor Mars), the goal is to prove `Human Marvin`, but the premises lead to `¬Human Marvin`. This creates an unsolvable contradiction since the goal requires proving a statement that is directly negated by the derived evidence.

After re-evaluating the premises:
1. The first branch (Marvin from both Earth and Mars) leads to a contradiction due to conflicting conclusions about Marvin's humanity.
2. The second branch (Marvin from neither planet) derives:
   - `¬FromEarth Marvin` (from the case)
   - `Extraterrestrial Marvin` (from A7)
   - `¬Human Marvin` (from A3)
   
Under the assumption `¬FromMars Marvin`, the goal `Human Marvin` must be proven, but the premises establish its falsehood. This means the implication `¬FromMars Marvin → Human Marvin` cannot hold in this consistent scenario.

The corrected Lean code uses `False.elim` to handle the first branch's contradiction but leaves the second branch incomplete with `sorry`, acknowledging the unprovable goal. This reflects that the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
