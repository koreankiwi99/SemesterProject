The natural language context provides several premises, but they do not sufficiently prove that James has lunch in the company building. Key reasons include:
- James's employment status is not established. Premises discuss employees and managers, but James could be a non-employee.
- Even if James were an employee, he may not be a manager, allowing him to have lunch at home.
- Premises about remote work and other countries do not force James's lunch location.
No combination of premises conclusively proves "James has lunch in the company."

axiom has_lunch_in_company : obj → Prop

-- All employees who schedule meetings go to the company today
axiom T1 : ∀ (e : obj), Employee e → (schedules_meeting e → goes_to_company_today e)
-- Anyone lunching in company schedules meetings (no employee restriction)
axiom T2 : ∀ (x : obj), has_lunch_in_company x → schedules_meeting x
-- Employee lunch locations: company or home
axiom T3 : ∀ (e : obj), Employee e → (has_lunch_in_company e ∨ has_lunch_at_home e)
-- Lunch at home implies remote work for employees
axiom T4 : ∀ (e : obj), Employee e → (has_lunch_at_home e → works_remotely_from_home e)
-- Employees in other countries work remotely
axiom T5 : ∀ (e : obj), Employee e → (in_other_countries e → works_remotely_from_home e)
-- Managers do not work remotely
axiom T6 : ∀ (m : obj), IsManager m → ¬ works_remotely_from_home m
-- James appears iff he is a manager
axiom T7 : goes_to_company_today James ↔ IsManager James

-- We cannot prove James has lunch in the company
theorem target : has_lunch_in_company James := 
  by 
    -- James's employee status is unknown, so T3 (employee lunch location) is inapplicable.
    -- T2 links lunch-in-company to scheduling meetings, but this alone is insufficient.
    -- Even if James were an employee, non-manager employees could have lunch at home without contradiction.
    sorry  -- Proof fails here
