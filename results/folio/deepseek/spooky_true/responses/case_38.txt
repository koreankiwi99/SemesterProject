The natural language premises are translated into Lean axioms. The key premises are:
- Vienna Music Society is an orchestra (`Orchestra ViennaMusicSociety`).
- Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society (`Leads Beethoven ViennaMusicSociety`).
- Orchestras are led by conductors, interpreted universally: if any entity leads an orchestra, that entity must be a conductor (`∀ x y, Orchestra x → Leads y x → Conductor y`).

Using these, it can be proven that Beethoven is a conductor (`Conductor Beethoven`). Therefore, the statement "Beethoven is not a conductor" (`¬ Conductor Beethoven`) does not follow from the premises and cannot be proven. In fact, the premises contradict this statement.

-- Attempt to prove "Beethoven is not a conductor" (¬ Conductor Beethoven) fails
-- because we have a proof of Conductor Beethoven.
