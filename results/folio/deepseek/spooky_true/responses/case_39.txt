After analyzing the premises and the statement, I translated the natural language context into Lean axioms. The key points are:

1. Premises are modeled using universal quantifiers over designs
2. The conclusion ("A design by Max is a brutalist building") requires existential quantification
3. All premises describe properties only of designs that Max adores
4. There is no premise guaranteeing existence:
   - Any design adored by Max cannot have interesting geometries without contradiction
   - But no premise asserts existence of a design by Max (adored or not)

Proof attempt in Lean fails because:
- No existential witness for a design by Max
- Without evidence of any design (let alone a brutalist one), we cannot prove existence

axiom Design : Type
axiom Max_adores : Design → Prop
axiom in_ZH_style : Design → Prop   -- Zaha Hadid's style
axiom in_KW_style : Design → Prop   -- Kelly Wearstler's style
axiom brutalist_building : Design → Prop
axiom has_interesting_geometries : Design → Prop
axiom evocative : Design → Prop
axiom dreamy : Design → Prop
axiom design_by_Max : Design → Prop

-- Premises (from context)
axiom premise1 : ∀ d, Max_adores d → in_ZH_style d → has_interesting_geometries d
axiom premise2 : ∀ d, Max_adores d → brutalist_building d → ¬ has_interesting_geometries d
axiom premise3 : ∀ d, Max_adores d → (in_ZH_style d ∨ in_KW_style d)
axiom premise4 : ∀ d, Max_adores d → in_KW_style d → evocative d
axiom premise5 : ∀ d, Max_adores d → in_KW_style d → dreamy d
axiom premise6 : ∀ d, design_by_Max d → Max_adores d → has_interesting_geometries d → 
                 brutalist_building d ∧ evocative d

-- Conclusion: "A design by Max is a brutalist building"
theorem target : ∃ d, design_by_Max d ∧ brutalist_building d :=

    -- Attempted proof strategies:
    -- 1. Seek contradictions to force existence
    --    - Premises 1,2,3 imply Max cannot adore ZH designs without contradiction,
    --      but don't preclude KW designs or unadored designs
    -- 2. Check if premises imply existence of any brutalist structure
    --    - No. Premises constrain properties but don't assert existence  
    -- 3. Instantiate universal quantifiers - fails without explicit witness
    sorry   -- Proof fails
