The reasoning involves proving that Coco Gauff is among the most active Grand-Slam players based on the given premises. The key steps are:

1. Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022 (Premise 7), so she is classified as either female or male (Premise 4).
2. If female:
   - All female players lost to Iga Świątek (Premise 3)
   - Losers to Świątek are highly ranked by WTA (Premise 2)
   - WTA-highly-ranked players are very active (Premise 1)
3. If male:
   - All male players lost to Rafael Nadal (Premise 5)
   - Premise 6 states that if Coco was highly ranked or lost to Nadal, she cannot be male
   - This leads to a contradiction since both conditions occur
4. Her male case is impossible, so she must be female, triggering the first chain
