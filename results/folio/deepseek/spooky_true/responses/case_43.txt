The premises do not entail that Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022** (given).
2. All players are either female or male (premise 4), so Coco is female or male.
3. **Case 1: Coco is female**  
   - All female players lost to Iga Świątek (premise 3), so Coco lost to Iga.  
   - Anyone who lost to Iga is ranked highly by the WTA (premise 2), so Coco is ranked highly.  
   - Premise 6 states that if Coco is ranked highly or lost to Nadal, then Coco is not male. Since Coco is ranked highly, she is not male (consistent with being female).  
   - There is no premise stating that females lost to Nadal, so we cannot conclude she lost to Nadal.  
4. **Case 2: Coco is male**  
   - All male players lost to Nadal (premise 5), so Coco lost to Nadal.  
   - Premise 6: Since she lost to Nadal, she is not male. Contradiction (she cannot be both male and not male).  
   - Thus, this case is impossible.  
5. Only Case 1 (female) is possible. Since no premise forces females to lose to Nadal, we cannot prove Coco lost to Nadal.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The error in the previous code was in the `coco_not_male` theorem. The proof attempted to directly derive a contradiction in the male case but incorrectly tried to construct a negation proof and a false value simultaneously. The corrected proof uses the assumption of male to derive a contradiction through premises P4 and P5, which is now properly structured as a negation proof.

However, the main goal of proving "Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal" remains unprovable. After establishing that Coco is female (not male) and at Roland Garros 2022, we derive that she lost to Iga Świątek and is ranked highly. But there is no premise linking female players to losing to Rafael Nadal. 

The premises only state:
- All females lost to Iga (no mention of Nadal)
- All males lost to Nadal (but Coco is female)
- The conditional in P5 only provides information about male status when combined with ranking/Nadal-loss, but doesn't force females to lose to Nadal.

Thus, we cannot prove that Coco lost to Rafael Nadal.
