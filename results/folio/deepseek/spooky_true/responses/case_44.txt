The reasoning involves analyzing the premises to determine if the conclusion about Coco Gauff follows logically. The premises establish that Coco Gauff must be female (due to a contradiction in the male case) and derive that she both lost to Iga Świątek and is one of the most active players. This directly contradicts the conclusion, which asserts that Coco Gauff is **not** both. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be proven from the premises.
