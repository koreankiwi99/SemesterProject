The premises state that all cats are mammals and that there exists at least one pet that is not a mammal. The conclusion claims that no pets are cats, meaning there are no entities that are both pets and cats.

In Lean, we define the necessary types and predicates based on the context. We then attempt to prove the conclusion using the given premises. However, the premises do not provide enough information to establish that no pets are cats. Specifically:
- The existence of a non-mammalian pet (from premise 2) does not preclude the possibility of other pets that are mammals and could potentially be cats.
- Premise 1 (all cats are mammals) does not interact with the pet category in a way that forces all pets to be non-cats. A pet could be both a cat and a mammal without contradicting the premises.

Thus, the conclusion cannot be proven from the given premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Cat : obj → Prop
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom Pet : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x, Cat x → Mammal x
axiom T2 : ∃ x, Pet x ∧ ¬ Mammal x

theorem no_pets_are_cats : ¬ ∃ x, Pet x ∧ Cat x :=
  fun ⟨w, hw⟩ =>   -- Assume there exists an entity `w` that is both a pet and a cat.
  have pet_w : Pet w := hw.left
  have cat_w : Cat w := hw.right
  have mammal_w : Mammal w := T1 w cat_w   -- By T1, `w` must be a mammal.
  -- Now use T2: there exists some entity `y` that is a pet and not a mammal.
  let ⟨y, hy⟩ := T2
  have pet_y : Pet y := hy.left
  have not_mammal_y : ¬ Mammal y := hy.right
  -- We have two distinct entities: `w` (pet, cat, mammal) and `y` (pet, not mammal).
  -- No contradiction arises because `w` and `y` are not required to be the same entity.
  -- The premises allow for the existence of a pet cat (like `w`) alongside a non-mammalian pet (like `y`).
  -- Therefore, we cannot derive `False` from the assumption that a pet cat exists.
  sorry   -- Proof cannot be completed.
