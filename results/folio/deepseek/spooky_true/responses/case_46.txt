ANSWER: True

The premises directly support the conclusion: The axiom "vacation_summer" states that any student wanting a long vacation has summer as their favorite season. Since James wants a long vacation (per "james_vacation"), applying "vacation_summer" to James yields the desired conclusion. The information about Emma and Mia is irrelevant to James's case and doesn't affect the proof.
