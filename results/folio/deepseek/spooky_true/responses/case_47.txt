The given premises do not provide sufficient information to prove that Mia's favorite season is spring. While we know:
- Emma's favorite season is summer
- Mia's favorite season differs from Emma's (thus not summer)
- James's favorite season is summer (as he wants a long vacation)

Mia's favorite season could be spring, fall, or winter, as no premise specifies which non-summer season she prefers. The conclusion, therefore, cannot be proven from the given context.

The errors in the previous Lean code stemmed from:
1. Invalid `attribute [simp]` declarations for non-existent constants
2. Misuse of the `contradiction` tactic without sufficient contradictory hypotheses
3. Incorrect proof structure with nested `by` blocks

The corrected Lean code properly models the premises while showing the conclusion ("Mia's favorite season is spring") cannot be proven. The key insights:
- We know Mia's season isn't summer (from differing with Emma)
- But no premise forces it to be spring rather than fall/winter
- James's preferences don't constrain Mia's season

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to improper handling of the inequality hypothesis `mia_not_emma` and incorrect proof structure. The key issues were:
1. Attempting to rewrite in an inequality hypothesis (`mia_not_emma`) using `rw`, which requires an equality
2. Using `admit` instead of `sorry` for unprovable cases
3. Incorrect case analysis structure

The corrected Lean code properly proves that Mia's season cannot be summer but cannot prove it must be spring. The premises establish:
- Emma's favorite is summer
- Mia's favorite differs from Emma's (thus not summer)
- James prefers summer (due to wanting long vacation)

However, no premise specifies which non-summer season (spring, fall, winter) Mia prefers. The conclusion is therefore unprovable.
