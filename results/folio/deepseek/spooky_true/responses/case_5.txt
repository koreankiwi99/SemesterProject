ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After analyzing the premises and the statement to evaluate, it is determined that the biconditional cannot be proven. The key issue arises when James is in other countries: 
- By premise P5, James must work remotely from home.
- This makes the disjunction (HasLunchAtHome ∨ WorksRemotelyFromHome) true.
- However, the left side (Manager ∨ InOtherCountries) is also true in this scenario.
- The right side requires the negation of the disjunction, which would be false here.
- Thus, the forward implication fails for this case.

The reverse implication also fails because:
- While we can derive ¬Manager from (HasLunchAtHome ∨ WorksRemotelyFromHome), we cannot derive ¬InOtherCountries under the same assumption.

The premises do not provide sufficient constraints to prove the biconditional, as verified through attempted proofs and counterexample analysis.
