The premises lead to a contradiction if we assume Basque is a Romance language. If Basque were Romance, it would be related to Spanish (since all Romance languages are related). However, Basque is not related to any other language, including Spanish. This contradiction proves that Basque cannot be a Romance language. Therefore, the statement "Basque is a Romance language" does not follow from the premises.

<lean>
axiom Lang : Type
axiom french spanish german basque : Lang
axiom Romance : Lang → Prop
axiom Related : Lang → Lang → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ l, Romance l → IndoEuropean l
axiom IndoEuropean : Lang → Prop
axiom P3 : ∀ l1 l2, Romance l1 → Romance l2 → Related l1 l2
axiom P4 : Romance french ∧ Romance spanish
axiom P5 : Related german spanish
axiom P6 : ∀ l, l ≠ basque → ¬ Related basque l

-- Distinctness axioms
axiom french_ne_basque : french ≠ basque
axiom spanish_ne_basque : spanish ≠ basque
axiom german_ne_basque : german ≠ basque

-- Attempt to prove Romance basque leads to contradiction

The errors in the previous Lean code were due to:
1. Missing declaration of `IndoEuropean` before its use in `P1`
2. Incorrect binding order - constants must be declared after the type
3. Missing distinctness axioms for languages

Here is the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom Lang : Type
axiom french : Lang
axiom spanish : Lang
axiom german : Lang
axiom basque : Lang
axiom Romance : Lang → Prop
axiom IndoEuropean : Lang → Prop
axiom Related : Lang → Lang → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ l : Lang, Romance l → IndoEuropean l
axiom P2 : ∀ l₁ l₂ : Lang, Romance l₁ → Romance l₂ → Related l₁ l₂
axiom P3 : Romance french ∧ Romance spanish
axiom P4 : Related german spanish
axiom P5 : ∀ l : Lang, l ≠ basque → ¬ Related basque l

-- Distinctness axioms
axiom french_ne_basque : french ≠ basque
axiom spanish_ne_basque : spanish ≠ basque
axiom german_ne_basque : german ≠ basque

-- Attempt to prove: Basque is a Romance language (Romance basque)
theorem prove_basque_romance : Romance basque := 
  -- Cannot find any premise proving Basque is Romance
  -- Premises only provide information about Romance languages in general,
  -- but don't establish Basque's status
  sorry -- No proof found
</lean>

We cannot prove "Basque is a Romance language" because:
- The premises establish Romance language properties (P1, P2, P3)
- They show relations between languages (P4)
- And state Basque is unrelated to others (P5)
- But no premise provides direct or indirect evidence that Basque is a Romance language
