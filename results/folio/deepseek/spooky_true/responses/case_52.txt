The premises provide information about language relationships and families, but they do not establish that being related to a Romance language implies membership in the Romance language family. Specifically:
- German is related to Spanish (a Romance language), but this relationship could exist outside the Romance family (e.g., through shared Indo-European roots).
- The Basque axiom only confirms German ≠ Basque (since German relates to Spanish, while Basque relates to no one), but this doesn't affect German's Romance status.
- No premise forces languages related to Romance languages to be Romance themselves.

Thus, "German is a Romance language" does not follow from the premises.

  -- No available tactics can prove this. For instance:
  -- 1. A5 (Related German Spanish) and A4 (Romance Spanish) don't imply Romance German.
  -- 2. A2 requires both languages to be Romance to establish a relation, not vice versa.
  -- 3. A6 proves German ≠ Basque but is irrelevant to Romance membership.
  sorry -- Proof fails; no valid path exists.
