The statement "French is an Indo-European language" follows directly from the premises:
- All Romance languages are Indo-European (first premise).
- French is a Romance language (fourth premise).

The additional premises about language families and relations (including details about Spanish, German, and Basque) do not affect this conclusion, as the deduction relies solely on the categorization of French as a Romance language and the general rule about Romance languages.

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect handling of type declarations. In Lean 4, `constant` is deprecated, and `axiom` should be used for declaring both types and propositions. Additionally, languages should be defined as constructors of an inductive type rather than separate constants. The corrected code properly defines `Language` as an inductive type with specific languages as constructors and uses `axiom` consistently.

<lean>
inductive Language where
  | french : Language
  | spanish : Language
  | german : Language
  | basque : Language

axiom Romance : Language → Prop
axiom IndoEuropean : Language → Prop
axiom Related : Language → Language → Prop

-- All Romance languages are Indo-European
axiom A1 : ∀ (L : Language), Romance L → IndoEuropean L
-- Romance languages form a language family: any two Romance languages are related
axiom A2 : ∀ (L1 L2 : Language), Romance L1 → Romance L2 → Related L1 L2
-- French and Spanish are Romance languages
axiom A3 : Romance Language.french
axiom A4 : Romance Language.spanish
-- German is related to Spanish
axiom A5 : Related Language.german Language.spanish
-- Basque is not related to any other language
axiom A6 : ∀ (L : Language), L ≠ Language.basque → ¬ Related Language.basque L

-- Proof that French is Indo-European
theorem french_indo_european : IndoEuropean Language.french := 
  A1 Language.french A3
</lean>

The conclusion "French is an Indo-European language" follows directly from:
1. `A1`: All Romance languages are Indo-European
2. `A3`: French is a Romance language

The other premises (about language families, relations, German, and Basque) are irrelevant to this conclusion and remain unused in the proof. The theorem is successfully verified in Lean.
