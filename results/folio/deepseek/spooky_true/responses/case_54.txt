The conclusion "Robert Lewandowski is a soccer player" follows directly from the premises "Robert Lewandowski is a striker" and "Strikers are soccer players." The other premises about leaving Bayern Munchen and no longer playing for the team are irrelevant to this conclusion. The Lean proof establishes the conclusion using only the first two premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom RobertLewandowski : obj
axiom Striker : obj → Prop
axiom SoccerPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : Striker RobertLewandowski
axiom T2 : ∀ x, Striker x → SoccerPlayer x

theorem RL_soccer_player : SoccerPlayer RobertLewandowski := by
  exact T2 RobertLewandowski T1
</lean>

ANSWER: True
