After translating the textual context and statement to Lean, the following axioms and theorems are established. The premises clearly show that Robert Lewandowski is a striker (A1), strikers are soccer players (A2), he left Bayern Munich (A3), and leaving implies no longer playing for the team (A4). Deriving `T1` confirms he is a soccer player, and `T2` proves he does not play for Bayern Munich. The statement "Robert Lewandowski plays for Bayern Munich" (`PlaysFor Lewandowski BayernMunchen`) is directly refuted by `T2`. Since there is no evidence to support this statement and it contradicts the premises, it cannot be proven.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Lewandowski : obj
axiom BayernMunchen : obj
axiom Striker : obj → Prop
axiom SoccerPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom Leaves : obj → obj → Prop
axiom PlaysFor : obj → obj → Prop

axiom A1 : Striker Lewandowski
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Striker x → SoccerPlayer x
axiom A3 : Leaves Lewandowski BayernMunchen
axiom A4 : ∀ (p t : obj), SoccerPlayer p → Leaves p t → ¬ PlaysFor p t

theorem T1 : SoccerPlayer Lewandowski := A2 Lewandowski A1
theorem T2 : ¬ PlaysFor Lewandowski BayernMunchen := A4 Lewandowski BayernMunchen T1 A3

-- Attempt to prove the statement "PlaysFor Lewandowski BayernMunchen"
-- Result: Contradiction with T2. No axioms support this statement.
