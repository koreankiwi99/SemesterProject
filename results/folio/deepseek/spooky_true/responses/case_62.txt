The premises provide information about Brown Swiss cattle, cows, pets, domesticated animals, and alligators. Specifically:

- All Brown Swiss cattle are cows.
- Some pets are Brown Swiss cattle (implying there exists at least one pet that is a Brown Swiss cattle).
- All cows are domesticated animals.
- No alligators are domesticated animals.
- Ted is an alligator.

The goal is to prove that "Ted is a pet".

However, Ted is an alligator, and alligators are explicitly not domesticated animals. The only pet mentioned is a Brown Swiss cattle (which is a cow and therefore a domesticated animal). There is no evidence that all pets must be domesticated animals; the premises only state that some pets (specifically, the Brown Swiss cattle) are domesticated. Thus, it is possible for pets to exist that are not domesticated animals, but there is no information linking Ted to being a pet.

In fact, if Ted were a pet, it would not directly contradict the premises since pets are not universally required to be domesticated. However, the premises do not provide any logical path to conclude that Ted (an alligator) is a pet. The existential premise ("some pets are Brown Swiss cattle") does not generalize to all pets and cannot force Ted to be a pet. Therefore, the statement "Ted is a pet" cannot be proven from the given premises.

Lean formalization captures the premises but cannot prove the conclusion:
