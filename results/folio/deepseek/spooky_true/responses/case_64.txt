The reasoning involves proving a conditional statement: "If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet." The key steps are:

1. Assume Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle (for the conditional proof).
2. By premise 1 (all Brown Swiss cattle are cows), Ted would be a cow.
3. By premise 3 (all cows are domesticated animals), Ted would be a domesticated animal.
4. By premise 5 (Ted is an alligator) and premise 4 (alligators are not domesticated animals), Ted cannot be a domesticated animal.
5. Steps 3 and 4 produce a contradiction: Ted is both a domesticated animal (from step 3) and not a domesticated animal (from step 4).
6. From this contradiction, any proposition can be derived, including that Ted is not a pet (the consequent of the conditional).

Thus, the conditional statement holds true as its antecedent leads to a contradiction, implying the consequent regardless of other premises.

The premises are translated into Lean, and the proof uses the contradiction derived from the assumption to establish the conditional. Premise 2 (some pets are Brown Swiss cattle) is not needed for this proof since the conclusion depends solely on properties of Ted.
