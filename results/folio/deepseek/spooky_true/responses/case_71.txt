The translation involves defining the necessary predicates and axioms based on the given context, then attempting to prove the statement "KO is a stock and a growth stock".

Key observations:
1. Premises indicate that growth stocks are bought for rapid appreciation (T1)
2. Stocks bought for rapid appreciation are not suitable for retirement funds (T2)
3. Mature stocks are suitable for retirement funds (T4)
4. KO is a mature stock (T5)

Attempted proof structure:
- Prove KO is a stock (using implicit axiom that mature stocks are stocks)
- Prove KO is a growth stock (but this leads to contradiction)
- KO cannot be both mature and growth without violating suitability conditions

Contradiction:
- MatureStock KO → SuitableForRetirement KO (T4)
- GrowthStock KO → ¬SuitableForRetirement KO (via T1 and T2)

    -- At this point, we have proof that GrowthStock KO must be false
    fail "Cannot prove GrowthStock KO due to contradiction"
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

Explanation:
1. The premises establish that:
   - Growth stocks are not suitable for retirement funds (via T1 and T2)
   - Mature stocks are suitable for retirement funds (T4)
   - KO is a mature stock (T5)

2. Proving KO is a stock succeeds via `mature_implies_stock`.

3. Attempting to prove KO is a growth stock:
   - Leads to a contradiction: If KO were a growth stock, it would simultaneously be suitable (from mature status) and not suitable (from growth status) for retirement funds.
   - This is formalized in `ko_cannot_be_growth`.
   - The final `fail` tactic acknowledges the unprovable subgoal.

Since Lean cannot complete the proof of the second conjunct ("KO is a growth stock"), the overall statement is unprovable. The answer is Failure.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

After analyzing the premises and attempting to prove the statement "KO is a stock and a growth stock", we find that while KO can be proven to be a stock, it cannot be proven to be a growth stock. In fact, the premises lead to a contradiction if we assume KO is a growth stock. The corrected Lean code maintains the core logical structure but explicitly shows the attempted proof progression with proper tactic usage.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom KO : obj

axiom Stock : obj → Prop
axiom GrowthStock : obj → Prop
axiom MatureStock : obj → Prop
axiom BoughtForRapidAppreciation : obj → Prop
axiom SuitableForRetirement : obj → Prop

axiom mature_implies_stock : ∀ x, MatureStock x → Stock x
axiom growth_implies_stock : ∀ x, GrowthStock x → Stock x

-- Premises
axiom T1 : ∀ x, GrowthStock x → BoughtForRapidAppreciation x
axiom T2 : ∀ x, BoughtForRapidAppreciation x → ¬ SuitableForRetirement x
axiom T3 : ∃ x, Stock x ∧ GrowthStock x
axiom T4 : ∀ x, MatureStock x → SuitableForRetirement x
axiom T5 : MatureStock KO

theorem ko_stock_and_growth : Stock KO ∧ GrowthStock KO := by
  apply And.intro
  · exact mature_implies_stock KO T5  -- Successfully proves KO is a stock
  · 
    -- Attempt to prove KO is a growth stock leads to contradiction
    let h₁ := T4 KO T5  -- KO is suitable for retirement (SuitableForRetirement KO)
    show GrowthStock KO from ?_
    intro h_growth
    have h₂ : BoughtForRapidAppreciation KO := T1 KO h_growth
    have h₃ : ¬SuitableForRetirement KO := T2 KO h₂
    exact h₃ h₁  -- Contradiction: h₁ and h₃ cannot both be true
    done
</lean>

The proof attempt fails because:
1. The first conjunct (KO is a stock) is proven
2. The second conjunct (KO is a growth stock) leads to:
   - T5 + T4 imply KO is suitable for retirement
   - If KO were a growth stock, T1 + T2 imply KO is not suitable for retirement
   - This is an irreconcilable contradiction

Since the second conjunct is unprovable (and actually false under the premises), the statement cannot be proven. The answer is Failure.
