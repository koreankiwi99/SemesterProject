The Lean code below formalizes the given premises and the statement to evaluate. The domain is defined as a type `Stock`, with `ko` as a constant of this type. Predicates represent the properties mentioned in the context: `GrowthStock`, `BoughtForProfit`, `SuitableForRetirement`, `MatureStock`, and `Volatile` (for price volatility). The premises are translated as axioms.

The statement to evaluate is:  
*If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.*  

Given that the domain is `Stock`, all entities (including `ko`) are stocks by definition. Thus, "KO is not a stock" is always false. The consequent "neither a stock nor volatile" is equivalent to `False ∧ ¬ Volatile ko` (which simplifies to `False`). The proof shows that the antecedent (`GrowthStock ko ∨ BoughtForProfit ko`) leads to a contradiction with the premises (since `ko` is a mature stock, making it suitable for retirement, but if it satisfies the antecedent, it would not be suitable). From this contradiction, the consequent follows vacuously.
