The premises lead to a contradiction when applied to Hannah: 
- By the first premise and the fact that Hannah works, she must need money.
- By the definition in Hannah's specific case (premise 7), if she needs money, she does not need money (a contradiction).

This inconsistency allows proving any conclusion, including the required statement about Hannah, by contradiction elimination. Thus, the conclusion follows.

axiom P5 : ∀ x : U, AtMarySchool x → (EnjoysDiningHall x → SpendsTimeEating x)
