The natural language premises lead to a logical contradiction when applied to Hannah. Specifically:

1. Hannah works in student jobs on campus (from 7th premise).
2. Therefore, Hannah needs to earn money (from 1st premise).
3. The 7th premise also states: if Hannah needs money, then she is not picky and does not need money.
4. From (2) and (3), Hannah must not need money.
5. (2) and (4) are contradictory.

From this contradiction, any conclusion follows (via *ex falso quodlibet*). Therefore, the statement about Hannah follows necessarily from the premises.
