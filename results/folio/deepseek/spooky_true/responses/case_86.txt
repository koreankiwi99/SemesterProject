After carefully analyzing the premises and attempting to prove the conclusion, the following Lean formalization highlights the key relationships. However, critical gaps prevent proving that Sir Digby's nemesis does not win.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom SuperheroMovie : Type
axiom M : SuperheroMovie
axiom digby : Person
axiom nemesis : Person

-- Predicates
axiom GoodGuy : Person → SuperheroMovie → Prop
axiom Wins : Person → SuperheroMovie → Prop
axiom NamedAfter : SuperheroMovie → Person → Prop
axiom Fight : Person → Person → Prop
axiom WinsFight : Person → Person → Prop  -- WinsFight a b means 'a wins the fight against b'

-- Premises
axiom superhero_movie_good_guys_win : ∀ (m : SuperheroMovie) (p : Person), GoodGuy p m → Wins p m
axiom movie_named_after_good : ∀ (m : SuperheroMovie) (c : Person), NamedAfter m c → GoodGuy c m
axiom digby_movie_named : NamedAfter M digby
axiom digby_fights_nemesis : Fight digby nemesis
axiom fight_winner_exclusive : ∀ (a b : Person), Fight a b → (WinsFight a b → ¬ WinsFight b a)

-- Derived: Sir Digby is a good guy in movie M
theorem digby_good_guy : GoodGuy digby M := movie_named_after_good M digby digby_movie_named

-- Sir Digby wins in movie M
theorem digby_wins : Wins digby M := superhero_movie_good_guys_win M digby digby_good_guy

-- Attempt to prove nemesis doesn't win the fight
theorem nemesis_not_win_fight : ¬ WinsFight nemesis digby := by 
  -- We know Digby fights nemesis, but no premise links Wins (movie victory) to WinsFight (specific fight outcome).
  -- Without knowing if the fight occurs in movie M or that movie victory implies winning every fight, proof fails.
  sorry  -- Critical gap: Cannot connect movie win to fight win

-- The conclusion requires ¬ WinsFight nemesis digby, which remains unprovable
</lean>

**Key gaps in proof**:
1. **Fight context missing**: While `digby_fights_nemesis` is established, no premise confirms this fight occurs *within movie M*. Thus, the movie victory (`Wins digby M`) cannot be applied to the fight.
2. **No victory transfer**: Premises don't connect overall movie victory (`Wins`) to winning specific fights (`WinsFight`). A good guy "winning" in the movie might not entail winning every individual fight.
3. **Nemesis status unknown**: There's no premise confirming the nemesis is in movie M or classified as a bad guy, preventing application of superhero movie rules to the fight.

Since the conclusion ("Sir Digby’s nemesis does not win") depends on unprovable connections between movie victory and fight outcomes, the proof fails.

ANSWER: Failure
