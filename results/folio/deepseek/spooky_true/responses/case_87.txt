The reasoning hinges on two key premises:  
1. "Books contain tons of knowledge" implies all books contain knowledge.  
2. "Harry read the book Walden" explicitly identifies Walden as a book.  

Thus, Walden must contain knowledge by universal generalization from premise 1. The premises about reading/gaining knowledge are irrelevant to the conclusion about Walden's properties.

axiom Book : obj → Prop
axiom ContainsKnowledge : obj → Prop
axiom Walden : obj
axiom A1 : ∀ x, Book x → ContainsKnowledge x  -- Books contain knowledge
axiom A4 : Book Walden                        -- Walden is a book (from "the book Walden")
theorem walden_contains : ContainsKnowledge Walden := by
  apply A1 Walden A4
