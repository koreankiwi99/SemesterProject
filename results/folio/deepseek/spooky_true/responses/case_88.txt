The reasoning involves modeling states to capture the temporal change implied by "smarter than before." We introduce two states: `before` and `after`, representing Harry's state before and after reading "Walden." The premises are translated as follows:
- Reading a book causes a gain in knowledge during the state transition (A2).
- Gaining knowledge causes becoming smarter in the new state compared to the old state (A3).
- Harry reading "Walden" transitions from `before` to `after` (fact).

Using these, we prove Harry is smarter in `after` than in `before`.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Book : Type
inductive State : Type | before | after
axiom Harry : Person
axiom Walden : Book
axiom reads : Person → Book → State → State → Prop
axiom gains_knowledge : Person → State → State → Prop
axiom smarter : Person → State → State → Prop
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book) (s_in s_out : State), 
  reads p b s_in s_out → gains_knowledge p s_in s_out
axiom A3 : ∀ (p : Person) (s_in s_out : State), 
  gains_knowledge p s_in s_out → smarter p s_out s_in
axiom fact : reads Harry Walden State.before State.after
theorem harry_smarter : smarter Harry State.after State.before := by
  apply A3 Harry State.before State.after
  apply A2 Harry Walden State.before State.after
  exact fact
