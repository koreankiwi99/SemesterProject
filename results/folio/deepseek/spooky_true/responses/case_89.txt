The reasoning involves translating the given premises into Lean and proving the statement "A smarter person has gained knowledge." This statement is interpreted existentially: there exists at least one person who is smarter and has gained knowledge. The premises provide Harry as an example: Harry read "Walden," gained knowledge, and became smarter. Thus, Harry satisfies the existential claim.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Book : Type
axiom Harry : Person
axiom Walden : Book
axiom reads : Person → Book → Prop
axiom gains_knowledge : Person → Prop
axiom smarter : Person → Prop

-- Premise: When a person reads a book, they gain knowledge.
axiom reading_gains_knowledge : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), reads p b → gains_knowledge p

-- Premise: If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.
axiom knowledge_makes_smarter : ∀ (p : Person), gains_knowledge p → smarter p

-- Premise: Harry read "Walden".
axiom harry_read_walden : reads Harry Walden

-- Prove Harry gained knowledge from reading "Walden"
theorem harry_gained_knowledge : gains_knowledge Harry :=
  reading_gains_knowledge Harry Walden harry_read_walden

-- Prove Harry became smarter
theorem harry_smarter : smarter Harry :=
  knowledge_makes_smarter Harry harry_gained_knowledge

-- Prove the conclusion: There exists a smarter person who has gained knowledge (using Harry as witness)
theorem smarter_person_exists : ∃ p : Person, smarter p ∧ gains_knowledge p :=
  ⟨Harry, harry_smarter, harry_gained_knowledge⟩
</lean>
