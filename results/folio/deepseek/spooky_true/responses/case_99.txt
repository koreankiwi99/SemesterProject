The reasoning involves translating the given premises into Lean and attempting to prove the conclusion that Harry is either an invertebrate or a queen bee. The key challenge is that the premises do not explicitly state that bees are animals, which is necessary to apply the animal classification (invertebrate/vertebrate) to Harry.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom Invertebrate : obj → Prop
axiom Vertebrate : obj → Prop
axiom HasBackbone : obj → Prop
axiom ReproduceByMating : obj → Prop
axiom Bee : obj → Prop
axiom QueenBee : obj → Prop
axiom Harry : obj

-- Premises:
axiom P1 : ∀ x, Animal x → (Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x)
axiom P2 : ∀ x, Animal x → HasBackbone x → ReproduceByMating x
axiom P3 : ∀ x, Animal x → Vertebrate x → HasBackbone x
axiom P4 : ∀ x, Bee x → ¬ ReproduceByMating x
axiom P5 : ∀ x, QueenBee x → Bee x
axiom P6 : Bee Harry

-- Attempt to prove: Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee
theorem target : Invertebrate Harry ∨ QueenBee Harry :=
by
  -- We cannot prove this without knowing if Harry is an animal or a queen bee.
  -- Case 1: Assume Harry is an animal.
  --   By P1, Harry is invertebrate or vertebrate.
  --   If vertebrate:
  --     By P3, Harry has a backbone → by P2, Harry reproduces by mating.
  --     But P4 says bees (including Harry) don't reproduce by mating → contradiction.
  --   Thus, Harry must be invertebrate → left side of disjunction holds.
  -- Case 2: Harry is not an animal.
  --   Then Harry cannot be invertebrate (as invertebrates are animals).
  --   We need QueenBee Harry for the disjunction, but P6 only says Harry is a bee (not necessarily queen).
  --   Without additional premises, we cannot prove QueenBee Harry.
  -- Since we lack Animal Harry or QueenBee Harry, the theorem is unprovable.
  sorry -- Proof incomplete
