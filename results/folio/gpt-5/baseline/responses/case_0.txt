axiom Bonnie : obj

-- Contextual axioms translated
-- People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Club x ∧ PerformOften x → AttendEvents x ∧ EngagedEvents x

-- People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Club x → PerformOften x ∨ (Inactive x ∧ Disinterested x ∧ CommunityMember x)

-- People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Club x ∧ ChaperoneDances x → ¬ StudentAtSchool x

-- All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers are students who attend the school.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Club x ∧ (YoungChild x ∨ Teenager x) ∧ WishFurtherAcademic x → StudentAtSchool x

-- Bonnie facts:
-- Bonnie is in this club
axiom B1 : Club Bonnie
-- and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school
-- or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.
axiom B2 : (AttendEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedEvents Bonnie ∧ StudentAtSchool Bonnie)
          ∨ ((¬ (AttendEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedEvents Bonnie)) ∧ ¬ StudentAtSchool Bonnie)

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive PerformOften Bonnie or its negation.
-- Hence, the truth of "Bonnie performs in school talent shows often" is undecidable from the context.
