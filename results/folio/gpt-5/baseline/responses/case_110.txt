axiom obj : Type
axiom Fir : obj → Prop
axiom Evergreen : obj → Prop
axiom Worship : obj → Prop

-- All fir trees are evergreens.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Fir x → Evergreen x
-- Some objects of worship are fir trees.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Worship x ∧ Fir x

-- From the given information we can derive that some evergreens are objects of worship.
theorem exists_evergreen_worship : ∃ x : obj, Evergreen x ∧ Worship x := by
  cases A2 with
  | intro x hx =>
    cases hx with
    | intro hxW hxF =>
      exact Exists.intro x ⟨A1 x hxF, hxW⟩

-- Target statement would be: ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬Worship x
-- This cannot be proved or refuted from the given axioms alone.
-- We neither have information that some evergreen is not an object of worship,
-- nor that all evergreens are objects of worship.
