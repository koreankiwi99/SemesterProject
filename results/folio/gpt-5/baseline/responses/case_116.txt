-- If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
axiom R1 : ∀ x y : Person, Man x → Man y → Taller x y → CanBlock x y

-- Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
axiom T_Michael_man : Man Michael
axiom R_Michael_taller_class : ∀ y : Person, InClassOfMichael y → y ≠ Michael → Taller Michael y

-- Transitivity of taller
axiom trans_taller : ∀ x y z : Person, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z

-- Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
axiom T_Peter_man : Man Peter
axiom T_Peter_taller_Michael : Taller Peter Michael

-- Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
axiom R_Michael_blocks_nonjumpers : ∀ y : Person, ¬ JumpsWhenShooting y → CanBlock Michael y

-- Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
axiom T_Michael_cannot_block_Windy : ¬ CanBlock Michael Windy

-- Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.
axiom R_jumpers_great : ∀ y : Person, JumpsWhenShooting y → GreatShooter y

-- Goal: Peter can block Windy's shooting.
-- We cannot derive CanBlock Peter Windy from the given axioms:
--   - The blocking-from-taller rule requires both to be men and a Taller relation.
--   - We have no information that Windy is a man.
--   - We also lack any relation connecting Peter's height to Windy's.
-- Hence we cannot prove CanBlock Peter Windy, nor its negation, from the given information.
-- No theorem provided since it cannot be derived.
