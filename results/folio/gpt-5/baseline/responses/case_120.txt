axiom obj : Type
axiom Affection : obj → Prop
axiom Love : obj → Prop
axiom Positive : obj → Prop

-- Some affection is love.
axiom H1 : ∃ x : obj, Affection x ∧ Love x
-- Some love is positive.
axiom H2 : ∃ x : obj, Love x ∧ Positive x

-- From H1 and H2, we cannot derive ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x in general,
-- nor its negation, without additional assumptions.
-- No theorem or its negation can be proved from the given information.
