axiom SoloEV : obj → Prop

-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, TransportMany x → ¬ OneSeater x
-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Tesla3 x → TransportMany x
-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x
-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x
-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
axiom A5 : ¬ Tesla3 JohnCar → (¬ Tesla3 JohnCar ∨ SingleSeatElectricCar JohnCar)

-- Derived fact (not needed for the main question):
theorem tesla_not_one : ∀ x : obj, Tesla3 x → ¬ OneSeater x := by
  intro x hx
  have htm : TransportMany x := A2 x hx
  exact A1 x htm

-- From the given axioms, we cannot prove Tesla3 JohnCar or its negation.
-- Therefore, the truth of "John's car is a Tesla Model 3" is not derivable.
