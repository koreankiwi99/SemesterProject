-- All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MakesPlans x → Engaged x
-- All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InvitesOthers x → MakesPlans x
-- Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → InvitesOthers x
-- Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : obj, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and makes wedding plans.
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬ InvitesFriends John) ∧ MakesPlans John
-- If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InvitesFriends John)

-- A useful derived fact: well-attended → engaged (via invites-others → makes-plans → engaged)
theorem well_attended_implies_engaged : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → Engaged x :=
  fun x h => A1 x (A2 x (A3 x h))

-- Goal in question: LargerFamily John
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive LargerFamily John, nor its negation.
-- The existential A4 does not mention John, and A6 only gives consequences if John already has a larger family.
-- Therefore, neither LargerFamily John nor ¬ LargerFamily John is provable from the provided information.
