-- 1. All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MakePlans x → Engaged x
-- 2. All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InvitesOthers x → MakePlans x
-- 3. Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → InvitesOthers x
-- 4. Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : obj, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- 5. If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and makes wedding plans.
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬InvitesFriends John ∧ MakePlans John)
-- 6. If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InvitesFriends John)

-- Useful derived lemma: well-attended implies engaged (for any person)
theorem wellAttended_engaged : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → Engaged x :=
  fun x hx => A1 x (A2 x (A3 x hx))

-- We cannot derive ¬LargerFamily John or LargerFamily John from the given axioms.
-- Hence, the truth of "John does not have a larger family" is not provable nor refutable here.
