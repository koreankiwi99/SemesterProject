-- A Japanese game company created The Legend of Zelda.
axiom A1 : MadeByJapanese Zelda
-- All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
axiom A2 : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → MadeByJapanese g
-- If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
axiom A3 : ∀ g : Game, SoldOver1M g → Top10 g
-- The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.
axiom A4 : SoldOver1M Zelda

-- Derivable facts about Zelda (not needed for FIFA22, shown for consistency)
theorem zelda_top10 : Top10 Zelda := by
  apply A3
  exact A4

theorem zelda_made_by_japanese : MadeByJapanese Zelda := by
  apply A2
  exact zelda_top10

-- From the given information, we cannot prove MadeByJapanese FIFA22 or its negation.
-- Therefore, the truth of "FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese video game company" is uncertain.
