-- A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck.
axiom Duster_is_household : HouseholdAppliance Duster
axiom Duster_not_suck : ¬ Sucks Duster

-- Goal: Vampire Space
-- From the given axioms, we can derive Sucks Space (since Space is a Vacuum),
-- but we cannot derive Vampire Space, nor its negation.
-- Therefore, the truth of "Space is a vampire" is not determined by the axioms.
