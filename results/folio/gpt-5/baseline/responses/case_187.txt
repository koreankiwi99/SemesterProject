-- Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
axiom E1 : ∃ x : obj, ProBBall x ∧ ¬ American x

-- All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, ProBBall x → CanJumpShot x

-- If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, CanJumpShot x → LeapsStraight x

-- If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, LeapsStraight x → ActivatesLegMuscles x

-- Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.
axiom Y1 : ¬ ActivatesLegMuscles Yuri

-- From the rules, any professional basketball player activates their leg muscles.
theorem pro_implies_activate : ∀ x : obj, ProBBall x → ActivatesLegMuscles x := by
  intro x hx
  exact R3 x (R2 x (R1 x hx))

-- Hence, Yuri is not a professional basketball player.
theorem yuri_not_pro : ¬ ProBBall Yuri := by
  intro hpro
  have : ActivatesLegMuscles Yuri := pro_implies_activate Yuri hpro
  exact Y1 this

-- Cannot prove American Yuri or ¬ American Yuri from given axioms.
