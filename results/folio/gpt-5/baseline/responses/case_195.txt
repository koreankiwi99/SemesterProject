axiom obj : Type
axiom Kiki : obj

axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom Bark : obj → Prop
axiom Dog : obj → Prop
axiom Jumps : obj → Prop
axiom Legs : obj → Prop
axiom Terricolous : obj → Prop
axiom Likes : obj → Prop   -- "Likes x" means "Jane likes x"

-- Jane does not like any animals that bark.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Bark x) → ¬ Likes x

-- All dogs are animals that bark.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Dog x → (Animal x ∧ Bark x)

-- Jane likes all animals that jump.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Jumps x) → Likes x

-- If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Legs x) → Jumps x

-- If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Terricolous x) → Legs x

-- KiKi is an animal.
axiom A6 : Animal Kiki

-- If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
axiom A7 : (¬ Jumps Kiki ∧ ¬ Legs Kiki) → (Terricolous Kiki ∨ Legs Kiki)

-- Goal: Terricolous Kiki
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive Terricolous Kiki nor its negation.
-- No contradiction arises from assuming Terricolous Kiki (it would imply Legs and Jumps, and thus Likes),
-- and we have no information forcing Terricolous Kiki if it does not hold.
-- Therefore, the truth of Terricolous Kiki is underdetermined by the axioms.
