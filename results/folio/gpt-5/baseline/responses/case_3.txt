-- All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ SchedulesMeetingsWithCustomers x → GoesToCompanyBuildingToday x
-- Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, HasLunchInCompanyBuilding x → SchedulesMeetingsWithCustomers x
-- Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x → HasLunchInCompanyBuilding x ∨ HasLunchAtHome x
-- If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ HasLunchAtHome x → WorksRemotelyFromHome x

axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → WorksRemotelyFromHome x
-- No managers work remotely from home.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : Person, Manager x → ¬ WorksRemotelyFromHome x

-- From the given axioms alone, we cannot prove HasLunchInCompanyBuilding James

-- Therefore the truth value of "James has lunch in the company" is undetermined.
