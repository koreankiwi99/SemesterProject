axiom Person : Type
axiom Season : Type

-- Seasons
axiom Spring : Season
axiom Summer : Season
axiom Fall : Season
axiom Winter : Season

-- People
axiom Emma : Person
axiom Mia : Person
axiom James : Person

-- Predicates and functions
axiom FavoriteSeason : Person → Season
axiom Student : Person → Prop
axiom WantsLongVacation : Person → Prop

-- Rules and facts from the context
-- All students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.
axiom rule_students_longvac_summer :
  ∀ x : Person, Student x ∧ WantsLongVacation x → FavoriteSeason x = Summer

-- Emma's favorite season is summer.
axiom EmmaFavSummer : FavoriteSeason Emma = Summer

-- Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.
axiom MiaFavDiffEmma : FavoriteSeason Mia ≠ FavoriteSeason Emma

-- James wants to have a long vacation.
axiom JamesWantsLong : WantsLongVacation James

-- A derived fact: Mia's favorite season is not Summer.
theorem Mia_not_summer : FavoriteSeason Mia ≠ Summer := by
  intro h
  have h' : FavoriteSeason Mia = FavoriteSeason Emma := by
    simpa using Eq.trans h EmmaFavSummer.symm
  exact MiaFavDiffEmma h'

-- We cannot prove FavoriteSeason James = Summer from the given axioms,
-- since we do not know that James is a student, which is required by the rule.
-- Likewise, we cannot prove FavoriteSeason James ≠ Summer.
-- Therefore, the truth of "James's favorite season is summer" is undecidable from the given information.
