axiom Summer : Season
axiom Fall : Season
axiom Winter : Season

-- Predicates and functions
axiom Student : Person → Prop
axiom WantsLongVacation : Person → Prop
axiom Favorite : Person → Season

-- Individuals
axiom Emma : Person
axiom Mia : Person
axiom James : Person

-- Rules and facts
-- All students who want a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, Student x ∧ WantsLongVacation x → Favorite x = Summer
-- Emma's favorite season is summer.
axiom T1 : Favorite Emma = Summer
-- Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.
axiom T2 : Favorite Mia ≠ Favorite Emma
-- James wants to have a long vacation.
axiom T3 : WantsLongVacation James

-- From T1 and T2, we can deduce that Mia's favorite is not summer.
theorem mia_not_summer : Favorite Mia ≠ Summer := by
  intro h
  apply T2
  have : Favorite Mia = Favorite Emma := Eq.trans h (Eq.symm T1)
  exact this

-- Target statement: Favorite Mia = Spring
-- From the given information, we cannot prove Favorite Mia = Spring
-- nor can we prove its negation.
