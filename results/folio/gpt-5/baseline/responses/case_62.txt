axiom obj : Type
axiom Pet : obj → Prop
axiom BrownSwissCattle : obj → Prop
axiom Cow : obj → Prop
axiom Domesticated : obj → Prop
axiom Alligator : obj → Prop
axiom Ted : obj

-- All Brown Swiss cattle are cows.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BrownSwissCattle x → Cow x
-- Some pets are Brown Swiss cattle.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Pet x ∧ BrownSwissCattle x
-- All cows are domesticated animals.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Cow x → Domesticated x
-- Alligators are not domesticated animals.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Alligator x → ¬ Domesticated x
-- Ted is an alligator.
axiom A5 : Alligator Ted

theorem ted_not_domesticated : ¬ Domesticated Ted := A4 Ted A5

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive Pet Ted or ¬ Pet Ted.
-- No relation is provided between being a pet and being an alligator/domesticated that would decide Pet Ted.
