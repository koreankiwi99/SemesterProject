axiom Being : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Human : Being → Prop
axiom Mammal : Being → Prop
axiom Animal : Being → Prop
axiom MonkeypoxVirusOccurs : Being → Prop
axiom Monkeypox : Being → Prop
axiom Flu : Being → Prop
axiom Fever : Being → Prop
axiom Headache : Being → Prop
axiom MusclePains : Being → Prop
axiom Tired : Being → Prop

-- "When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox."
-- We model "may" as a separate possibility predicate rather than an implication to Monkeypox.
axiom CouldGetMonkeypox : Being → Prop
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Being, MonkeypoxVirusOccurs x → CouldGetMonkeypox x

-- "Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals." (existence of some animal with the virus)
axiom R2 : ∃ x : Being, Animal x ∧ MonkeypoxVirusOccurs x

-- "Humans are mammals. Mammals are animals."
axiom R3 : ∀ x : Being, Human x → Mammal x
axiom R4 : ∀ x : Being, Mammal x → Animal x

-- "Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness."
axiom R5 : ∀ x : Being, Monkeypox x → (Fever x ∧ Headache x ∧ MusclePains x ∧ Tired x)

-- "People feel tired when they get the flu." (modeled for all beings)
axiom R6 : ∀ x : Being, Flu x → Tired x

-- Target statement: "No one gets the flu." i.e., ∀ x, ¬ Flu x
-- From the given axioms, we cannot prove ∀ x, ¬ Flu x, nor can we prove ∃ x, Flu x.
-- Hence, the truth of the statement is undetermined from the context.
-- theorems for the statement or its negation are not derivable here.
