-- If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then it has not received many negative reviews.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Listed x → ¬ ManyNeg x
-- All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, RatingGT4 x → Listed x
-- Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, ¬ Takeout x ∧ ManyNeg x
-- All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Popular x → RatingGT4 x
-- The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.
axiom A5 : RatingGT4 Hamden ∨ Popular Hamden

-- From the premises we can derive that Hamden has not received many negative reviews.
theorem hamden_not_manyneg : ¬ ManyNeg Hamden := by
  have hRating : RatingGT4 Hamden :=
    Or.elim A5 (fun hR => hR) (fun hP => A4 Hamden hP)
  have hListed : Listed Hamden := A2 Hamden hRating
  exact A1 Hamden hListed

-- Cannot prove ¬Takeout Hamden or Takeout Hamden from the given axioms.
