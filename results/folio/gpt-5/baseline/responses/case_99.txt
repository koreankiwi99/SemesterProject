axiom Harry : obj

-- Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → (Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x)

-- All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, (Vertebrate x ∧ Animal x) → Backbone x

-- All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Backbone x) → MatesMF x

-- All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Bee x → ¬ MatesMF x

-- All queen bees are bees.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, QueenBee x → Bee x

-- Harry is a bee.
axiom A6 : Bee Harry

-- Goal: Invertebrate Harry ∨ QueenBee Harry
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive Invertebrate Harry nor QueenBee Harry.
-- In particular, we are not given that bees are animals, so A1–A3 cannot be applied to Harry.
-- Therefore, the statement and its negation are both unprovable from the given axioms.
