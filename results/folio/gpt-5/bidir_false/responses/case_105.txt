axiom Test : Type
axiom GRE : Test

-- Predicate: the test costs below $300
axiom Below300 : Test → Prop

-- From the context: "It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300."
axiom T_cost_below_300 : Below300 GRE

-- Irrelevant-to-statement contextual information (economic hardship, aid, Tom, etc.)
axiom Person : Type
axiom Tom : Person
axiom SingleParent : Person → Prop
axiom FewResources : Person → Prop
axiom EconomicHardship : Person → Prop
axiom GREApplicant : Person → Prop
axiom ETSProvidesAid : Person → Prop
axiom R_hardship : ∀ x : Person, (SingleParent x ∨ FewResources x) → EconomicHardship x
axiom R_aid : ∀ x : Person, (GREApplicant x ∧ EconomicHardship x) → ETSProvidesAid x
axiom F_single_parent_Tom : SingleParent Tom
axiom F_few_resources_Tom : FewResources Tom
axiom F_applying_Tom : GREApplicant Tom

-- The statement to evaluate is: Below300 GRE
-- We can prove the statement itself:
theorem gre_below_300 : Below300 GRE := by
  exact T_cost_below_300

-- But we are asked to try to prove its negation (i.e., ¬Below300 GRE).
-- This is impossible given T_cost_below_300, so we cannot derive ¬Below300 GRE.
-- Cannot prove ¬Below300 GRE from the given axioms.
