-- If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Spills x → ¬ Tidy x
-- All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new restaurants are people who spill a lot of food.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, ClumsyFoodieGoesOutFrequently x → Spills x
-- If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Cleanly x → Tidy x
-- If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, ValuesOrderSpotlessness x → Cleanly x
-- All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, FamilyPrioritizesOrderSpotlessness x → ValuesOrderSpotlessness x

-- Peter is either (spills and cleanly) or (not spills and not cleanly).
axiom Peter_disj : (Spills Peter ∧ Cleanly Peter) ∨ (¬ Spills Peter ∧ ¬ Cleanly Peter)

-- Cannot prove ¬ Tidy Peter from given axioms
