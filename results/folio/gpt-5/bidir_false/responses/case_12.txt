axiom Zelda : Game

axiom Japanese : Company → Prop
axiom CreatedBy : Game → Company → Prop
axiom Top10 : Game → Prop
axiom SoldOver1M : Game → Prop

-- A Japanese game company created The Legend of Zelda.
axiom A1 : ∃ c : Company, Japanese c ∧ CreatedBy Zelda c
-- All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
axiom A2 : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → ∃ c : Company, Japanese c ∧ CreatedBy g c
-- If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
axiom A3 : ∀ g : Game, SoldOver1M g → Top10 g
-- The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.
axiom A4 : SoldOver1M Zelda

-- From A3 and A4, we can derive that Zelda is on the Top 10 list.
theorem zelda_top10 : Top10 Zelda := A3 Zelda A4

-- Cannot prove ¬Top10 Zelda from given axioms (indeed, Top10 Zelda is derivable).
