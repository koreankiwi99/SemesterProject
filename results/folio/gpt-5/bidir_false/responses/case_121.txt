-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
axiom Ax1 : ∀ x : obj, TransportMulti x → ¬ OneSeater x
-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
axiom Ax2 : ∀ x : obj, Tesla3 x → TransportMulti x
-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
axiom Ax3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatEV x → OneSeater x
-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
axiom Ax4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatEV x
-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
axiom Ax5 : ¬ Tesla3 JohnCar → (¬ Tesla3 JohnCar ∨ SingleSeatEV JohnCar)

-- From Ax1 and Ax2, any Tesla Model 3 is not a one-seater
theorem tesla3_not_one_seater : ∀ x : obj, Tesla3 x → ¬ OneSeater x :=
  fun x hx => Ax1 x (Ax2 x hx)

-- Cannot prove ¬(Tesla3 JohnCar) from the given axioms
