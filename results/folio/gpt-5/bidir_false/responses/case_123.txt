-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MultiPassengers x → ¬ OneSeater x
-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, TeslaModel3 x → MultiPassengers x
-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatElectric x → OneSeater x
-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectric x
-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
axiom A5 : ¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar → (¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar ∨ SingleSeatElectric JohnCar)

-- Cannot prove SoloEV JohnCar from given axioms
