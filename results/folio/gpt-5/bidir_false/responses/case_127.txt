-- All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, MakeWeddingPlans x → Engaged x
-- All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, InviteOthersCeremony x → MakeWeddingPlans x
-- Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, WellAttendedWedding x → InviteOthersCeremony x
-- Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom R4 : ∃ x : obj, WellAttendedWedding x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- If John is engaged, then John does not (invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans).
axiom R5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InviteFriendsCeremony John ∧ MakeWeddingPlans John)
-- If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom R6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttendedWedding John ∨ InviteFriendsCeremony John)

-- Cannot prove ¬LargerFamily John from the given axioms
