-- James is a student working in the lab.
axiom A6 : Student James ∧ WorksLab James
-- James doesn't work in the lab nor have a part-time job offered by the university.
axiom A7 : ¬WorksLab James ∧ ¬PTUni James

-- Statement to evaluate: James either takes the database course or has a part-time job offered by the university.
-- We prove its negation from the premises.
