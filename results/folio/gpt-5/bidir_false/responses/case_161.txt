axiom obj : Type
axiom George : obj

axiom LikesMusic : obj → Prop
axiom WantsCompose : obj → Prop
axiom HasProgram : obj → Prop
axiom CanCompose : obj → Prop
axiom WillCompose : obj → Prop

-- If George likes music, he wants to compose.
axiom R1 : LikesMusic George → WantsCompose George
-- If George has access to a program, he can compose.
axiom R2 : HasProgram George → CanCompose George
-- If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.
axiom R3 : (CanCompose George ∧ WantsCompose George) → WillCompose George

def Statement : Prop := (¬WillCompose George) → (¬CanCompose George)

-- Cannot prove ¬Statement from the given axioms
