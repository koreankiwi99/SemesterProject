-- All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Zaha x ∧ Adores x → InterestingGeom x
-- No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Brutalist x ∧ Adores x → ¬InterestingGeom x
-- Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Style x ∧ Adores x → Zaha x ∨ Kelly x
-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Kelly x ∧ Adores x → Evocative x
-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Kelly x ∧ Adores x → Dreamy x
-- If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then it is a brutalist building and evocative.
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, ByMax x ∧ Adores x ∧ InterestingGeom x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- Goal to refute (negation of the statement): ¬∃ x, ByMax x ∧ Brutalist x
-- From the given axioms, there is no way to derive a contradiction from the existence of such an x,
-- since none of the rules link Brutalist x and ByMax x to a contradiction without also having Adores x and InterestingGeom x.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation of the statement from the premises.
