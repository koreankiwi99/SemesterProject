inductive Season where
| Spring : Season
| Summer : Season
| Fall : Season
| Winter : Season

axiom Person : Type
axiom Emma : Person
axiom Mia : Person
axiom James : Person

axiom fav : Person → Season

axiom Student : Person → Prop
axiom WantsLongVacation : Person → Prop

-- All students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.
axiom rule : ∀ x : Person, Student x → WantsLongVacation x → fav x = Season.Summer

-- Emma's favorite season is summer.
axiom emmaFav : fav Emma = Season.Summer

-- Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.
axiom miaFavNeEmma : fav Mia ≠ fav Emma

-- James wants to have a long vacation.
axiom jamesWants : WantsLongVacation James

-- From Mia not same as Emma and Emma likes Summer, Mia does not like Summer.
theorem mia_not_summer : fav Mia ≠ Season.Summer := by
  intro h
  have hme : fav Mia = fav Emma := Eq.trans h (Eq.symm emmaFav)
  exact miaFavNeEmma hme

-- Cannot prove ¬(fav James = Season.Summer) from given axioms
