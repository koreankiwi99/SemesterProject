axiom Ted : obj

-- Premises
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BrownSwiss x → Cow x
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Pet x ∧ BrownSwiss x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Cow x → Domesticated x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Alligator x → ¬Domesticated x
axiom A5 : Alligator Ted

-- From the premises, Ted cannot be BrownSwiss
theorem not_BrownSwiss_Ted : ¬BrownSwiss Ted := by
  intro hBS
  have hCow : Cow Ted := A1 Ted hBS
  have hDom : Domesticated Ted := A3 Ted hCow
  have hNotDom : ¬Domesticated Ted := A4 Ted A5
  exact hNotDom hDom

-- In fact, the statement to evaluate is true (vacuously, since BrownSwiss Ted leads to a contradiction)
theorem statement_true : (BrownSwiss Ted → ¬Pet Ted) := by
  intro hBS
  have hCow : Cow Ted := A1 Ted hBS
  have hDom : Domesticated Ted := A3 Ted hCow
  have hNotDom : ¬Domesticated Ted := A4 Ted A5
  exact fun _ => hNotDom hDom

-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation ¬(BrownSwiss Ted → ¬Pet Ted) from the given premises.
-- To prove that negation, we would need BrownSwiss Ted and Pet Ted, but ¬BrownSwiss Ted holds.
