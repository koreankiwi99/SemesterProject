axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom MVOccurs : obj → Prop            -- Monkeypox virus occurs
axiom Monkeypox : obj → Prop
axiom Fever : obj → Prop
axiom Headache : obj → Prop
axiom MusclePains : obj → Prop
axiom Tired : obj → Prop
axiom Flu : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MVOccurs x → Monkeypox x
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Animal x ∧ MVOccurs x          -- Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Human x → Mammal x             -- Humans are mammals
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Mammal x → Animal x            -- Mammals are animals
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Monkeypox x → Fever x ∧ Headache x ∧ MusclePains x ∧ Tired x
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Flu x → Tired x                -- People feel tired when they get the flu

-- Statement to evaluate: ∀ x, ¬Flu x
-- To refute it, we would need to derive ∃ x, Flu x from the axioms.
-- From the given axioms, there is no way to derive that anyone gets the flu.
-- Therefore we cannot prove the negation of the statement from the premises.
