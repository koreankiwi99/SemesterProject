-- All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Growth x → BoughtRapid x
-- If bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then not suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, BoughtRapid x → ¬Suitable x
-- Some stocks are growth stocks.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, Stock x ∧ Growth x
-- All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Mature x → Suitable x
-- KO is a mature stock (KO is a stock and KO is mature).
