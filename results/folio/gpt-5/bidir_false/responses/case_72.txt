-- All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
axiom Rg : ∀ x : obj, Growth x → BoughtForRapid x
-- If a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom Rb : ∀ x : obj, BoughtForRapid x → ¬SuitableForRetirement x
-- Some stocks are growth stocks.
axiom ExSome : ∃ x : obj, Stock x ∧ Growth x
-- All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom Rm : ∀ x : obj, Mature x → SuitableForRetirement x
-- KO is a mature stock.
axiom KO_mature : Mature KO
axiom KO_stock : Stock KO

-- Useful consequences
theorem KO_suitable : SuitableForRetirement KO := Rm KO KO_mature
theorem KO_not_bought : ¬BoughtForRapid KO := fun h => (Rb KO h) KO_suitable
theorem KO_not_growth : ¬Growth KO := fun hg => KO_not_bought (Rg KO hg)

-- Statement to evaluate
def Stmt : Prop := (Growth KO ∨ BoughtForRapid KO) → (¬Stock KO ∧ ¬Volatile KO)

-- We cannot prove ¬Stmt from the given axioms:
-- The antecedent (Growth KO ∨ BoughtForRapid KO) is refutable (both disjuncts are false),
-- so we cannot witness it to refute the implication.
