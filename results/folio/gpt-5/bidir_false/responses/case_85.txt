-- If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then it has not received many negative reviews.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Listed x → ¬ManyNeg x
-- All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, RatingGT4 x → Listed x
-- Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, NoTakeout x ∧ ManyNeg x
-- All restaurants popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Popular x → RatingGT4 x
-- The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.
axiom A5 : RatingGT4 HamdenPlaza ∨ Popular HamdenPlaza

-- From the premises, we can derive that Hamden Plaza has not received many negative reviews.
theorem hamden_not_manyneg : ¬ManyNeg HamdenPlaza := by
  have hRGorPop : RatingGT4 HamdenPlaza ∨ Popular HamdenPlaza := A5
  have hRG : RatingGT4 HamdenPlaza := by
    cases hRGorPop with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr hp => exact A4 HamdenPlaza hp
  have hListed : Listed HamdenPlaza := A2 HamdenPlaza hRG
  exact A1 HamdenPlaza hListed

-- Cannot prove ¬NoTakeout HamdenPlaza from the given axioms
