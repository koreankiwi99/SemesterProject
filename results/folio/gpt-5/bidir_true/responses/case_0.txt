axiom Bonnie : obj

-- People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ PerformsOften x → AttendEngagedEvents x
-- People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x → (PerformsOften x ∨ InactiveDisinterested x)
-- People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ Chaperone x → ¬ Student x
-- All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ InactiveDisinterested x → Chaperone x
-- All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ YoungOrTeen x ∧ WishFurtherAcademics x → Student x

-- Bonnie facts
axiom Bonnie_in : InClub Bonnie
-- Bonnie either (attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student) 
-- or (does not attend and is not a student).
axiom Bonnie_info : (AttendEngagedEvents Bonnie ∧ Student Bonnie) ∨ (¬AttendEngagedEvents Bonnie ∧ ¬Student Bonnie)

-- From these axioms, we cannot derive PerformsOften Bonnie.
-- A2 only yields PerformsOften Bonnie ∨ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.
-- If Bonnie is inactive, A4 and A3 imply ¬Student Bonnie, which is consistent with the second disjunct of Bonnie_info.
-- There is no way to rule out the inactive case or otherwise force PerformsOften Bonnie.
