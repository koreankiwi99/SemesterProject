-- People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend time with their siblings.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MultipleBirth x → SpendTimeWithSiblings x
-- If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, SiblingsBornTogether x → MultipleBirth x
-- If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Complains x → SiblingsBornTogether x
-- If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, LiveHome x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x
-- If people spend a lot of time with siblings, then they often live at home.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, SpendTimeWithSiblings x → LiveHome x

-- Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers,
-- or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.
axiom A6 :
  (Baby Luke ∧ MultipleBirth Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) ∨
  (¬ (Baby Luke ∧ MultipleBirth Luke) ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke)

-- Goal to evaluate: Complains Luke
-- From the given axioms, there is no way to derive Complains Luke.
-- The implications only go from Complains → ... and do not provide a way to infer Complains.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove Complains Luke from the provided information.
-- theorem luke_complains : Complains Luke := by
--   -- Cannot be derived from the premises
