axiom Peter : obj

-- Axioms from the context
-- If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, SpillsOnClothing x → ¬ NotablyTidy x

-- All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try spill a lot of food on their clothing.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, (Clumsy x ∧ Foodie x ∧ GoesOutFrequently x) → SpillsOnClothing x

-- If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Cleanly x → NotablyTidy x

-- If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, ValuesOrderAndSpotlessness x → Cleanly x

-- All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, FamilyPrioritizesOrderAndSpotlessness x → ValuesOrderAndSpotlessness x

-- Peter is either (spills and cleanly) or (not spills and not cleanly)
axiom A6 : (SpillsOnClothing Peter ∧ Cleanly Peter) ∨ (¬ SpillsOnClothing Peter ∧ ¬ Cleanly Peter)

-- From the left disjunct we can derive Peter is notably tidy
theorem tidy_of_left_disjunct : (SpillsOnClothing Peter ∧ Cleanly Peter) → NotablyTidy Peter :=
  fun h => A3 Peter h.right

-- However, from the right disjunct (¬spills ∧ ¬cleanly) we cannot derive NotablyTidy Peter with given axioms.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove NotablyTidy Peter from the provided premises.
