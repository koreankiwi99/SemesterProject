axiom obj : Type
axiom Fir : obj → Prop
axiom Evergreen : obj → Prop
axiom Worship : obj → Prop

-- All fir trees are evergreens.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Fir x → Evergreen x

-- Some objects of worship are fir trees.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Worship x ∧ Fir x

-- From these, we cannot derive that some evergreen is not an object of worship.
-- For example, it is consistent that all evergreens are objects of worship,
-- in which case the conclusion would be false.
-- Therefore, the statement does not follow from the premises.
