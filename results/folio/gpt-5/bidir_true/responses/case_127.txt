-- 1. All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MakeWeddingPlans x → Engaged x
-- 2. All people who invite others to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InviteOthersToCeremony x → MakeWeddingPlans x
-- 3. Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, WellAttendedWedding x → InviteOthersToCeremony x
-- 4. Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : obj, WellAttendedWedding x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- 5. If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and does not make wedding plans.
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬ InviteFriendsToCeremony John ∧ ¬ MakeWeddingPlans John)
-- 6. If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttendedWedding John ∨ InviteFriendsToCeremony John)

-- From these premises, there is no way to derive LargerFamily John.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove the statement "John has a larger family."
