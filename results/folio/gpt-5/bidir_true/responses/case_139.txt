-- If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, AppropriateForAllAges x → ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance x

-- If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, ContainsExcessiveEroticAndViolentContent x → ¬ ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance x

-- If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, RatedGeneralAudience x → AppropriateForAllAges x

-- All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, FamilyFriendlyAnimatedFilm x → RatedGeneralAudience x

-- All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, InFrozenSeries x → FamilyFriendlyAnimatedFilm x

-- “Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is a film.
axiom A6 : Film Hachi

-- “Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages.
axiom A7 : FamilyFriendlyAnimatedFilm Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi

-- Goal: RatedGeneralAudience Hachi
-- From A7, if Hachi is FamilyFriendlyAnimatedFilm, A4 gives RatedGeneralAudience Hachi.
-- But if Hachi is only AppropriateForAllAges, we have no axiom to conclude RatedGeneralAudience.
-- Therefore, we cannot derive RatedGeneralAudience Hachi from the given premises.
-- Cannot prove RatedGeneralAudience Hachi from given axioms.
