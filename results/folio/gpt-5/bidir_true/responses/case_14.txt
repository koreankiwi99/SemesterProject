axiom SoldOver1M : obj → Prop

-- A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.
axiom A1 : ∃ c : obj, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy Zelda c ∧ Game Zelda

-- All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
axiom A2 : ∀ g : obj, Top10 g → ∃ c : obj, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy g c

-- If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
axiom A3 : ∀ g : obj, SoldOver1M g → Top10 g

-- The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.
axiom A4 : SoldOver1M Zelda

-- From A3 and A4, we can derive that Zelda is on the Top 10 list.
theorem zelda_on_top10 : Top10 Zelda := A3 Zelda A4

-- Therefore, we cannot prove ¬ Top10 Zelda from the given premises.
-- the statement "The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list" is false given these axioms.
