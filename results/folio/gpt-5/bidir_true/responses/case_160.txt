-- If George likes music, he wants to compose.
axiom R1 : LikesMusic George → WantsToCompose George
-- If George has access to a program, he can compose.
axiom R2 : HasAccessProgram George → CanCompose George
-- If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.
axiom R3 : CanCompose George ∧ WantsToCompose George → WillCompose George

-- If George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose.
theorem george_will_compose :
  (LikesMusic George ∧ HasAccessProgram George) → WillCompose George := by
  intro h
  have hLike : LikesMusic George := And.left h
  have hAccess : HasAccessProgram George := And.right h
  have hw : WantsToCompose George := R1 hLike
  have hc : CanCompose George := R2 hAccess
  exact R3 (And.intro hc hw)
