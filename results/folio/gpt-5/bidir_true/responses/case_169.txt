-- If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Deadly x → LowSurvival x
-- Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, SevereCancer x → Deadly x
-- Bile duct cancer is a severe cancer.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x
-- All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x
-- Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
axiom A5 : LowSurvival MildFlu
-- Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.
axiom A6 : ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvival ColorectalCancer)

-- Some derived facts (not strictly necessary for the target statement):
theorem bileduct_low : ∀ x : obj, BileDuctCancer x → LowSurvival x := by
  intro x hB
  have hS : SevereCancer x := A3 x hB
  have hD : Deadly x := A2 x hS
  exact A1 x hD

theorem not_bileduct_colorectal : ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer := by
  intro hB
  have hL : LowSurvival ColorectalCancer := bileduct_low ColorectalCancer hB
  have hAnd : BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvival ColorectalCancer := And.intro hB hL

-- Cannot prove SevereCancer ColorectalCancer from given axioms
