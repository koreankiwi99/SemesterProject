axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Rabbit x ∧ Spotted x → Cute x
-- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x
-- The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Spotted x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x)
-- If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
-- All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Squirrel x ∧ Spotted x → Skittish x
-- Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.

-- Target to evaluate:
-- If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.
-- We cannot derive Skittish Rockie (it would contradict Calm Rockie), nor Turtle Rockie from the given axioms.
-- Hence, the implication (Cute Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie) → (Skittish Rockie ∧ Turtle Rockie) cannot be proved from the premises.
-- theorem target : (Cute Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie) → (Skittish Rockie ∧ Turtle Rockie) := by
