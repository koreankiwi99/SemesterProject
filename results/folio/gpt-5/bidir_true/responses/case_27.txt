-- All aliens are extraterrestrials.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Alien x → Extraterrestrial x
-- If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, FromMars x → Alien x
-- No extraterrestrials are human.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Extraterrestrial x → ¬ Human x
-- All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, HighlyIntelligent x ∧ FromEarth x → Human x
-- Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
axiom T1 : HighlyIntelligent Marvin
-- Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
axiom T2 : (FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin) ∨ (¬ FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬ FromMars Marvin)
-- If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.
axiom T3 : ¬ FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin

-- Some derived facts (showing partial progress):
theorem alien_if_mars : FromMars Marvin → Alien Marvin := by
  intro hm
  exact R2 Marvin hm

theorem alien_in_case1 : (FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin) → Alien Marvin := by
  intro h
  exact R2 Marvin h.right

theorem extraterrestrial_in_case2 : (¬ FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬ FromMars Marvin) → Extraterrestrial Marvin := by
  intro h
  exact T3 h.left

-- Cannot prove Alien Marvin from given axioms:
-- In the first disjunct of T2, FromMars Marvin holds, so Alien Marvin follows by R2.
-- In the second disjunct, we only get Extraterrestrial Marvin (by T3), but R1 is one-way (Alien → Extraterrestrial),
-- so we cannot conclude Alien Marvin.
