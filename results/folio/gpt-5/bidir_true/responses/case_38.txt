-- Facts from the context
axiom T1 : MusicPiece Symphony9
axiom T2 : Writes Beethoven Symphony9
axiom T3 : Premiered ViennaMusicSociety Symphony9
axiom T4 : Orchestra ViennaMusicSociety
axiom T5 : Leads Beethoven ViennaMusicSociety

-- Orchestras are led by conductors: anyone who leads an orchestra is a conductor
axiom R_orch_conductor : ∀ o l, Orchestra o → Leads l o → Conductor l

-- From the above, we can derive that Beethoven is a conductor
theorem beethoven_is_conductor : Conductor Beethoven := by
  apply R_orch_conductor ViennaMusicSociety Beethoven
  · exact T4
  · exact T5

-- Goal to evaluate: ¬ Conductor Beethoven
-- Cannot prove this, since we have proved Conductor Beethoven above.
