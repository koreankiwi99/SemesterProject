-- All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Zaha x ∧ Adores x → Interesting x
-- No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, Brutalist x ∧ Adores x → ¬ Interesting x
-- Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Adores x → Zaha x ∨ Kelly x
-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, Kelly x ∧ Adores x → Evocative x
-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
axiom P5 : ∀ x : obj, Kelly x ∧ Adores x → Dreamy x
-- If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.
axiom P6 : ∀ x : obj, ByMax x ∧ Adores x ∧ Interesting x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- We can derive a contradiction from assuming a design by Max is adored and has interesting geometries.
theorem no_bymax_adored_interesting : ∀ x : obj, ByMax x ∧ Adores x ∧ Interesting x → False := by
  intro x hx
  have hBE : Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x := P6 x hx
  have hB : Brutalist x := And.left hBE
  have hA : Adores x := And.left (And.right hx)
  have hNotI : ¬ Interesting x := P2 x (And.intro hB hA)
  exact hNotI (And.right (And.right hx))

-- Desired statement would be: ∃ x, ByMax x ∧ Evocative x ∧ Dreamy x
-- There is no premise guaranteeing existence of any design by Max, or connecting "ByMax" to Kelly-styles he adores.
-- Hence we cannot prove the existential conclusion from the given premises.
