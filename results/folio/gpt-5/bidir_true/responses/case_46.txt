axiom T2 : fav Mia ≠ fav Emma

-- James wants to have a long vacation.
axiom T3 : WantsLongVacation James

-- Goal: James's favorite season is summer.
-- We cannot derive fav James = Summer without knowing that James is a Student.
-- the following cannot be proven from the given axioms:
-- theorem james_fav_summer : fav James = Summer := ?
