axiom obj : Type
axiom French : obj
axiom Spanish : obj
axiom German : obj
axiom Basque : obj

axiom Romance : obj → Prop
axiom IndoEuropean : obj → Prop
axiom Related : obj → obj → Prop

-- All Romance languages are Indo-European
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Romance x → IndoEuropean x
-- Romance languages form a family: any two Romance languages are related
axiom A2 : ∀ x y : obj, Romance x → Romance y → Related x y
-- French and Spanish are Romance languages
axiom A3 : Romance French
axiom A4 : Romance Spanish
-- German is related to Spanish
axiom A5 : Related German Spanish
-- Basque is not related to any other language
axiom A6 : ∀ y : obj, y ≠ Basque → ¬ Related Basque y

-- From these axioms, we cannot derive that German is a Romance language.
-- There is no axiom stating that being related to a Romance language implies being Romance.
