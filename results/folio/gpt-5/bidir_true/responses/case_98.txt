axiom Harry : obj

-- Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x
-- All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → Backbone x → MFMate x
-- All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Vertebrate x → Backbone x
-- All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Bee x → ¬ MFMate x
-- All queen bees are bees.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, QueenBee x → Bee x
-- Harry is a bee.
axiom A6 : Bee Harry

-- We can derive that Harry does not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
theorem harry_not_mfmating : ¬ MFMate Harry := A4 Harry A6

-- There is no way to derive that Harry is a queen bee from the given axioms.
-- In particular, we lack any premise implying all bees are queen bees or that Harry is a queen.
