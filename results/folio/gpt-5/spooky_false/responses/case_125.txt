-- All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Pet x ∧ Mammal x → Animal x
-- All monkeys are mammals.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Monkey x → Mammal x
-- Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Pet x → (Monkey x ∨ Bird x)
-- Peter's birds can fly.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Pet x ∧ Bird x → CanFly x
-- All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Pet x ∧ Animal x → CanBreathe x
-- If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Pet x ∧ CanFly x → HasWings x
-- Rock is Peter's pet.
axiom A7 : Pet Rock
-- Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.
axiom A8 : CanFly Rock ∨ Bird Rock ∨ ¬CanBreathe Rock

-- From the premises, Rock has wings.
