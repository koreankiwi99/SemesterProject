axiom CreatedBy : Company → Game → Prop

-- A Japanese game company created The Legend of Zelda.
axiom A1 : ∃ c : Company, Japanese c ∧ CreatedBy c Zelda
-- All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
axiom A2 : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → ∃ c : Company, Japanese c ∧ CreatedBy c g
-- If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
axiom A3 : ∀ g : Game, SellsOver1M g → Top10 g
-- The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.
axiom A4 : SellsOver1M Zelda

-- The negation of the statement to evaluate: Zelda is on the Top 10 list.
theorem zelda_on_top10 : Top10 Zelda := by
  have hz1 : SellsOver1M Zelda := A4
  have hz2 : Top10 Zelda := A3 Zelda hz1
  exact hz2

-- Therefore, the statement "The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list" leads to a contradiction.
theorem statement_is_false : (¬ Top10 Zelda) → False := by
  intro hnot
  exact hnot zelda_on_top10
