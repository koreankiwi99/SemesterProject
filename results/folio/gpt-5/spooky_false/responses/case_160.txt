axiom LikesMusic : Prop
axiom AccessProgram : Prop
axiom WantsCompose : Prop
axiom CanCompose : Prop
axiom WillCompose : Prop

-- Premises from the textual context
axiom P1 : LikesMusic → WantsCompose
axiom P2 : AccessProgram → CanCompose
axiom P3 : CanCompose ∧ WantsCompose → WillCompose

-- The given statement is derivable from the premises
theorem will_compose_from_likes_and_access : (LikesMusic ∧ AccessProgram) → WillCompose := by
  intro h
  have hm : LikesMusic := And.left h
  have ha : AccessProgram := And.right h
  have hw : WantsCompose := P1 hm
  have hc : CanCompose := P2 ha
  exact P3 (And.intro hc hw)

-- Consequently, the negation of the statement is refutable
theorem not_negation : ¬(LikesMusic ∧ AccessProgram ∧ ¬WillCompose) := by
  intro h
  have hm : LikesMusic := And.left h
  have ha_and_not : AccessProgram ∧ ¬WillCompose := And.right h
  have ha : AccessProgram := And.left ha_and_not
  have hn : ¬WillCompose := And.right ha_and_not
  have hw : WantsCompose := P1 hm
  have hc : CanCompose := P2 ha
  have w : WillCompose := P3 (And.intro hc hw)
