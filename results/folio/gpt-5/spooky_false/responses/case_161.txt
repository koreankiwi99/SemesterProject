axiom obj : Type
axiom George : obj

-- Predicates
axiom LikesMusic : obj → Prop
axiom WantsCompose : obj → Prop
axiom CanCompose : obj → Prop
axiom WillCompose : obj → Prop
axiom HasAccessProgram : obj → Prop

-- Premises from the textual context (specialized to George)
axiom P1 : LikesMusic George → WantsCompose George
axiom P2 : HasAccessProgram George → CanCompose George
axiom P3 : CanCompose George ∧ WantsCompose George → WillCompose George

-- What we can derive from the premises:
-- From P3, the contrapositive form we can prove intuitionistically:
-- If George will not compose, then it's not the case that he both can compose and wants to compose.
theorem not_will_implies_not_can_and_not_wants :
  ¬WillCompose George → ¬(CanCompose George ∧ WantsCompose George) :=
by
  intro hNotWill
  intro hCanAndWants
  have hWill : WillCompose George := P3 hCanAndWants
  exact hNotWill hWill

-- Note: The statement to evaluate is:
--    (¬WillCompose George) → (¬CanCompose George)
-- From the premises we only obtain:
--    (¬WillCompose George) → ¬(CanCompose George ∧ WantsCompose George)
-- which does not suffice to conclude (¬CanCompose George) without additional information.
