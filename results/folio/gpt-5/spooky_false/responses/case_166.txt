axiom Person : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : Person

axiom German : Person → Prop
axiom Russian : Person → Prop
axiom Politician : Person → Prop
axiom MemberPrussianStateParliament : Person → Prop
axiom MemberNaziReichstag : Person → Prop

-- From the context: "Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician."
axiom G_HS : German HeinrichSchmidt
axiom P_HS : Politician HeinrichSchmidt

-- Additional contextual facts (not needed for the main logical point)
axiom PSP_HS : MemberPrussianStateParliament HeinrichSchmidt
axiom NR_HS : MemberNaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt

-- The statement to evaluate: German HS ∨ Russian HS
theorem stmt_true : German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt := by
  apply Or.inl
  exact G_HS

-- Attempt to prove the negation leads to a contradiction (so the negation is not provable)
theorem negation_implies_false : (¬ (German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt)) → False := by
  intro hneg
  have disj : German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt := by
    apply Or.inl
    exact G_HS
  exact hneg disj
