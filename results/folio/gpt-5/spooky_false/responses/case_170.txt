axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, SevereCancer x → Deadly x                         -- Severe cancer → Deadly
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x                 -- Bile duct cancer → Severe cancer
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x           -- Cholangiocarcinoma → Bile duct cancer
axiom P5 : ∀ x : obj, MildFlu x → LowSurvival x                         -- Mild flu → Low survival
