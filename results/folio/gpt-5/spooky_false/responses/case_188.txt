-- All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
axiom all_pro_can_jump_shots : ∀ x : obj, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x → CanJumpShot x

-- If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
axiom jump_shots_implies_leap : ∀ x : obj, CanJumpShot x → LeapsStraightIntoAir x

-- If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles.
axiom leap_implies_activate_legs : ∀ x : obj, LeapsStraightIntoAir x → ActivatesLegMuscles x

-- Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.
axiom yuri_not_activate_legs : ¬ActivatesLegMuscles Yuri

-- From the chain of implications: professional -> can jump shot -> leap -> activate legs
theorem pro_implies_activate_legs : ∀ x : obj, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x → ActivatesLegMuscles x := by

  have h2 : LeapsStraightIntoAir x := jump_shots_implies_leap x h1
  have h3 : ActivatesLegMuscles x := leap_implies_activate_legs x h2
  exact h3

-- Hence Yuri cannot be a professional basketball player.
theorem yuri_not_pro : ¬ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri := by
