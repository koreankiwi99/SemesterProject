axiom Event : Type
axiom Happy : Event → Prop
axiom Sad : Event → Prop

-- "Events are either happy or sad" interpreted as exclusive or for each event
axiom exclusive : ∀ e : Event, (Happy e ∧ ¬Sad e) ∨ (Sad e ∧ ¬Happy e)

-- "At least one event is happy"
axiom exists_happy : ∃ e : Event, Happy e

-- Negation of: "All events are sad"
theorem not_all_events_sad : ¬(∀ e : Event, Sad e) := by
  intro allSad
  rcases exists_happy with ⟨w, hw⟩
  have hx := exclusive w
  cases hx with
  | inl h1 =>
      -- h1 : Happy w ∧ ¬Sad w
      have ns : ¬Sad w := h1.right
      have sw : Sad w := allSad w
      exact ns sw
  | inr h2 =>
      -- h2 : Sad w ∧ ¬Happy w, contradicts hw : Happy w
      exact h2.right hw
