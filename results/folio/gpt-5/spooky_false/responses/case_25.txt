axiom obj : Type
axiom Beijing : obj

axiom LocatedInNorthernChina : obj → Prop
axiom LocatedInSouthernChina : obj → Prop

-- Premise from the text
axiom H_north : LocatedInNorthernChina Beijing

-- Background knowledge: Northern and Southern China are disjoint
axiom disjoint_regions : ∀ x : obj, LocatedInNorthernChina x → ¬LocatedInSouthernChina x

theorem beijing_not_southern : ¬LocatedInSouthernChina Beijing := by
  exact disjoint_regions Beijing H_north
