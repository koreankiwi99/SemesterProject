axiom obj : Type

-- Entities
axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom Imperium : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj
axiom CreedBrothers : obj
axiom RoderickStrong : obj

-- Predicates/Relations
axiom ProStable : obj → Prop
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Feud : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom FormedInWWE : obj → Prop

-- Premises from the context
axiom DM_is_prostable : ProStable DiamondMine
axiom DM_formed_in_WWE : FormedInWWE DiamondMine
axiom Strong_leads_DM : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
axiom DM_includes_Creed : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
axiom DM_includes_Ivy : Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom Imperium_feuds_DM : Feud Imperium DiamondMine

-- The statement to evaluate:
-- "Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile."
def Statement : Prop := ¬∃ s : obj, ProStable s ∧ Includes s IvyNile ∧ Feud Imperium s

-- Construct a witness that contradicts the statement
theorem witness : ∃ s : obj, ProStable s ∧ Includes s IvyNile ∧ Feud Imperium s := by
  refine Exists.intro DiamondMine ?h
  refine And.intro DM_is_prostable ?h'
  exact And.intro DM_includes_Ivy Imperium_feuds_DM

-- Therefore, assuming the statement leads to a contradiction (False)
theorem statement_implies_false : Statement → False := by
  intro h
  exact h witness
