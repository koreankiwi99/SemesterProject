-- If someone is ranked highly by the WTA, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, RankedHighly x → MostActive x
-- Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the WTA.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, LostIga x → RankedHighly x
-- All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, (Female x ∧ RG x) → LostIga x
-- All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, RG x → Female x ∨ Male x
-- All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, (Male x ∧ RG x) → LostNadal x
-- If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at RG 2022.
axiom A6 : (RankedHighly Coco ∨ LostNadal Coco) → ¬ (Male Coco ∧ RG Coco)
-- Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.
axiom A7 : RG Coco

-- Negation of the statement: Coco both lost to Iga and is one of the most active players.
