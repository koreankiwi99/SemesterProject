axiom obj : Type

-- Entities
axiom French : obj
axiom Spanish : obj
axiom German : obj
axiom Basque : obj

-- Predicates and relations
axiom Romance : obj → Prop
axiom IndoEuropean : obj → Prop
axiom Related : obj → obj → Prop
axiom LanguageFamily : (obj → Prop) → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Romance x → IndoEuropean x
axiom P2 : LanguageFamily Romance
axiom P3 : ∀ F : obj → Prop, LanguageFamily F → ∀ x y : obj, F x → F y → Related x y
axiom P4F : Romance French
axiom P4S : Romance Spanish
axiom P5 : Related German Spanish
axiom P6 : ∀ y : obj, y ≠ Basque → ¬Related Basque y ∧ ¬Related y Basque

-- From the premises, we can derive that French is Indo-European
theorem french_is_indo_european : IndoEuropean French := by
  exact P1 French P4F

-- Also derivable: French and Spanish are related (since Romance is a language family)
theorem french_related_spanish : Related French Spanish := by
  exact P3 Romance P2 French Spanish P4F P4S
