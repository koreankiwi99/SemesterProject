axiom Person : Type
axiom Mike : Person

axiom IntlUS : Person → Prop        -- is an international student in the US
axiom F1 : Person → Prop            -- has an F1 visa
axiom J1 : Person → Prop            -- has a J1 visa
axiom WantsWorkUS : Person → Prop   -- wants to work in the US
axiom NeedsCPT : Person → Prop      -- needs to apply for CPT
axiom NeedsOPT : Person → Prop      -- needs to apply for OPT

-- International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, IntlUS x → (F1 x ∨ J1 x)

-- An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, IntlUS x ∧ F1 x ∧ WantsWorkUS x → (NeedsCPT x ∨ NeedsOPT x)

-- Mike is an international student (in the US).
axiom A3 : IntlUS Mike

-- Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.
axiom A4 : WantsWorkUS Mike → NeedsCPT Mike

-- From A1 and A3 we can only conclude Mike has F1 or J1.
theorem Mike_has_F1_or_J1 : F1 Mike ∨ J1 Mike := A1 Mike A3
