axiom Ted : obj

-- Premises
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BrownSwiss x → Cow x
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Pet x ∧ BrownSwiss x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Cow x → Domesticated x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Alligator x → ¬ Domesticated x
axiom A5 : Alligator Ted

-- From the premises, Ted cannot be a Brown Swiss cattle

  have hCow : Cow Ted := A1 Ted hB
  have hDom : Domesticated Ted := A3 Ted hCow
