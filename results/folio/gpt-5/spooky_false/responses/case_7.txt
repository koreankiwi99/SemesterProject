-- When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox (modeled as implication here).
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, MpoxVirusOccurs x → HasMonkeypox x

-- Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals (existence of some animal with occurrence).
axiom R2 : ∃ x : obj, Animal x ∧ MpoxVirusOccurs x

-- Humans are mammals.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Human x → Mammal x

-- Mammals are animals.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Mammal x → Animal x

-- Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, HasMonkeypox x → Fever x ∧ Headache x ∧ MusclePains x ∧ Tired x

-- People feel tired when they get the flu (restricting to humans).
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Human x ∧ Flu x → Tired x

-- From the premises we can derive that someone is tired (due to Monkeypox),
-- but this does not imply that anyone gets the flu.
