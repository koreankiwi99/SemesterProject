inductive obj where
| a : obj
| b : obj

open obj

def Affection : obj → Prop
| a => True
| b => False

def Love : obj → Prop
| a => True
| b => True

def Positive : obj → Prop
| a => False
| b => True

-- Premise 1: Some affection is love.
theorem premise1 : ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Love x := by
  refine ⟨a, ?_⟩
  constructor
  · simp [Affection]
  · simp [Love]

-- Premise 2: Some love is positive.
theorem premise2 : ∃ x, Love x ∧ Positive x := by
  refine ⟨b, ?_⟩
  constructor
  · simp [Love]
  · simp [Positive]

-- Conclusion to evaluate: Some affection is positive. This is false in this model.
theorem not_conclusion : ¬ ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x := by
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨x, hx⟩
  rcases hx with ⟨hA, hP⟩
  cases x with
  | a => simpa [Positive] using hP
  | b => simpa [Affection] using hA
