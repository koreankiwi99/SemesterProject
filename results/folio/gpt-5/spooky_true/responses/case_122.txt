-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then it is not a one-seater.
axiom H1 : ∀ x : obj, CanTransportMultiplePassengers x → ¬ OneSeater x
-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
axiom H2 : ∀ x : obj, TeslaModel3 x → CanTransportMultiplePassengers x
-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
axiom H3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x
-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
axiom H4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x
-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
-- This is a tautology (P → P ∨ Q), so we prove it directly rather than assume it.
theorem H5 : ¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar → (¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar ∨ SingleSeatElectricCar JohnCar) :=
  fun h => Or.inl h

-- Some derived consequences (do not yield the target conclusion).
theorem SoloEV_implies_OneSeater : SoloEV JohnCar → OneSeater JohnCar :=
  fun h => H3 JohnCar (H4 JohnCar h)

theorem TeslaModel3_implies_not_OneSeater : TeslaModel3 JohnCar → ¬ OneSeater JohnCar :=
  fun hTm3 => H1 JohnCar (H2 JohnCar hTm3)
