-- All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, MakePlans x → Engaged x
-- All people who invite others to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
-- Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
-- Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : Person, WellAttended x ∧ LargeFamily x
-- If John is engaged, then John does not (invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans).
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InviteFriends John ∧ MakePlans John)
-- If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargeFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)
