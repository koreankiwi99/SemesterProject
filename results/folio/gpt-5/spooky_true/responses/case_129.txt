-- 1. All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MakePlans x → Engaged x

-- 2. All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x

-- 3. Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x

-- 4. Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : obj, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x

-- 5. If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
-- Interpreted as: Engaged John → (¬InviteFriends John ∧ MakePlans John)
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬ InviteFriends John ∧ MakePlans John)

-- 6. If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- Useful derived lemma: well-attended implies engaged (for any person)
theorem well_attended_implies_engaged : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → Engaged x := by

  apply A1
  apply A2
  apply A3
  exact hx

-- From (5), if John is engaged then John makes wedding plans
theorem engaged_John_implies_makeplans : Engaged John → MakePlans John := by

-- From (1), if John makes plans then John is engaged
theorem makeplans_implies_engaged_John : MakePlans John → Engaged John := by
