-- Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.
axiom S1 : ∃ s : obj, Show s ∧ AirsMon8 s ∧ GivesRosesOnTV s

-- If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Show x ∧ GivesRosesOnTV x → EpisodeOfBachelor x

-- The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
axiom R2 : PortraysRealPeople Bachelor

-- All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Show x ∧ PortraysRealPeople x → RealityTV x

-- Breaking Bad is a show.
axiom BB1 : Show BreakingBad

-- Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.
axiom BB2 : ¬ RealityTV BreakingBad

-- A derived but unrelated fact: there exists some show that airs at 8 pm on Monday.
theorem some_show_monday8 : ∃ s : obj, AirsMon8 s := by
  rcases S1 with ⟨s, h⟩
  rcases h with ⟨_, h'⟩
  rcases h' with ⟨hAirs, _⟩
  exact ⟨s, hAirs⟩

-- Restating a given premise as a theorem.
theorem not_reality_bb : ¬ RealityTV BreakingBad := by
  exact BB2
