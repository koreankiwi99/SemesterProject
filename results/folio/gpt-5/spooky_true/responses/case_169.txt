-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Deadly x → LowSurvival x                          -- If something is deadly, then it has a low survival rate
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, SevereCancer x → Deadly x                         -- Severe cancers are deadly diseases
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, BileDuct x → SevereCancer x                       -- Bile duct cancer is a severe cancer
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuct x                 -- All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer
axiom P5 : LowSurvival MildFlu                                          -- Mild flu comes with a low survival rate
axiom P6 : ¬ (BileDuct ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvival ColorectalCancer) -- CRC is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate

-- A derived lemma: bile duct cancers have low survival (by chaining P3, P2, P1)
theorem bileDuct_low : ∀ x : obj, BileDuct x → LowSurvival x := by
  intro x
  intro hBD
  have hSev : SevereCancer x := P3 x hBD
  have hDead : Deadly x := P2 x hSev
  exact P1 x hDead

-- From P6 and the above, CRC cannot be a bile duct cancer
theorem not_bileDuct_CRC : ¬ BileDuct ColorectalCancer := by
  intro hBD
  have hLow : LowSurvival ColorectalCancer := bileDuct_low ColorectalCancer hBD
  have hBoth : BileDuct ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvival ColorectalCancer := And.intro hBD hLow
  exact P6 hBoth

-- Note: From the given premises, we cannot derive SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.
-- We only derive ¬ BileDuct ColorectalCancer.
