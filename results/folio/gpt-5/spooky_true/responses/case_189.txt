-- Premises
axiom some_pro_not_american : ∃ x : obj, ProBB x ∧ ¬ American x
axiom all_pro_can_jump : ∀ x : obj, ProBB x → CanJumpShot x
axiom jump_implies_leap : ∀ x : obj, CanJumpShot x → LeapStraight x
axiom leap_implies_activate : ∀ x : obj, LeapStraight x → ActivateLegMuscles x
axiom yuri_not_activate : ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri

-- Derived: professional basketball players activate leg muscles
theorem pro_implies_activate : ∀ x : obj, ProBB x → ActivateLegMuscles x :=
by
  intro x
  intro hx
  have hj : CanJumpShot x := all_pro_can_jump x hx
  have hl : LeapStraight x := jump_implies_leap x hj
  exact leap_implies_activate x hl

-- Hence, Yuri is not a professional basketball player
theorem not_pro_yuri : ¬ ProBB Yuri :=
by
  intro hpro
  have hact : ActivateLegMuscles Yuri := pro_implies_activate Yuri hpro
  exact yuri_not_activate hact

-- Therefore, Yuri is not an American professional basketball player
theorem not_american_pro_yuri : ¬ (American Yuri ∧ ProBB Yuri) :=
by
  intro h
  exact not_pro_yuri (And.right h)
