-- Statement to evaluate: Ailton was not loaned out to a football club.
def Statement : Prop := ¬ ∃ c : obj, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedTo Ailton c

-- From the facts, we can exhibit a football club (Braga) to which Ailton was loaned.
theorem loaned_to_a_club : ∃ c : obj, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedTo Ailton c := by
  exact ⟨Braga, ⟨F6, F2⟩⟩

-- Therefore, the statement is false.
