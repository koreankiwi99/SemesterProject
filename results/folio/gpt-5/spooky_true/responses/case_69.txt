-- Premises from the textual context
-- "Badults is a British Sitcom series starring members of Pappy's."
-- We capture that at least one member of Pappy's starred in Badults.
axiom P1 : ∃ p : Person, PappysMember p ∧ StarsIn p Badults

-- "Badults was piloted in July 2013 on BBC Three."
axiom P2 : PilotedOnBBC3 Badults

-- "The Working title 'The Secret Dude Society' was used for Badults."
axiom P3 : WorkingTitleUsedFor "The Secret Dude Society" Badults

-- "Andrew Collins was the script editor for Badults."
axiom P4 : ScriptEditorOf AndrewCollins Badults

-- The statement to evaluate:
-- "No members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three."
def NoPappysMemberStarInBBC2or3 : Prop :=
  ∀ p : Person, PappysMember p → ∀ s : Show, (PilotedOnBBC2 s ∨ PilotedOnBBC3 s) → ¬ StarsIn p s

-- We show this statement is false given the premises.
