axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom HasMonkeypoxVirus : obj → Prop
axiom Monkeypox : obj → Prop
axiom Fever : obj → Prop
axiom Headache : obj → Prop
axiom MusclePains : obj → Prop
axiom Tired : obj → Prop
axiom Flu : obj → Prop

-- Premises from the text
-- When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox.
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, HasMonkeypoxVirus x → Monkeypox x

-- Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals. (existential reading)
axiom P2 : ∃ x : obj, Animal x ∧ HasMonkeypoxVirus x

-- Humans are mammals.
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Human x → Mammal x

-- Mammals are animals.
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, Mammal x → Animal x

-- Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.
axiom P5 : ∀ x : obj, Monkeypox x → Fever x ∧ Headache x ∧ MusclePains x ∧ Tired x

-- People feel tired when they get the flu. (generalized to all beings)
axiom P6 : ∀ x : obj, Flu x → Tired x

-- Some derived facts we can prove from the premises (not the target statement)
theorem humans_are_animals : ∀ x : obj, Human x → Animal x :=
by
  intro x hx
  have hm : Mammal x := P3 x hx
  exact P4 x hm

theorem monkeypox_implies_tired : ∀ x : obj, Monkeypox x → Tired x :=
by
  intro x hmp
  have h := P5 x hmp
  -- h : Fever x ∧ Headache x ∧ MusclePains x ∧ Tired x
  have h2 := And.right h
  have h3 := And.right h2
  exact And.right h3

-- Note: From these premises, there is no derivation that no one gets the flu (∀ x, ¬ Flu x).
-- The premises only state that if someone has the flu, they are tired, which does not preclude flu from occurring.
