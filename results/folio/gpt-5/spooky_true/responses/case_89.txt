axiom Book : obj → Prop
axiom Reads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom GainsKnowledge : obj → Prop
axiom Smarter : obj → Prop

-- When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.
axiom R1 : ∀ x y : obj, Person x → Book y → Reads x y → GainsKnowledge x
-- If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Person x → GainsKnowledge x → Smarter x

-- Facts about Harry and Walden
axiom Harry : obj
axiom Walden : obj
axiom HPerson : Person Harry
axiom WBook : Book Walden
axiom HReadsW : Reads Harry Walden

-- Statement to evaluate: A smarter person has gained knowledge.
-- Interpreted as: there exists a person who is smarter and has gained knowledge.
