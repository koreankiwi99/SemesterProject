-- If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, SpillsFoodOnClothing x → ¬ NotablyTidy x
-- All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try spill a lot of food on their clothing.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, (ClumsyFoodie x ∧ GoOutFrequentlyForNewRestaurants x) → SpillsFoodOnClothing x
-- If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, Cleanly x → NotablyTidy x
-- If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, ValuesOrderSpotlessness x → Cleanly x
-- All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, FamilyPrioritizeOrderSpotlessness x → ValuesOrderSpotlessness x

-- Peter is either someone who spills a lot and is cleanly, or someone who does not spill a lot and is not cleanly.
axiom Peter_info : (SpillsFoodOnClothing Peter ∧ Cleanly Peter) ∨ (¬ SpillsFoodOnClothing Peter ∧ ¬ Cleanly Peter)

-- Goal: NotablyTidy Peter
-- From the left disjunct of Peter_info, we obtain both NotablyTidy Peter (via A3) and ¬ NotablyTidy Peter (via A1).
-- From the right disjunct, we can derive neither NotablyTidy Peter nor its negation from the given axioms.
-- Hence, we cannot prove NotablyTidy Peter or its negation from the premises.
