axiom obj : Type
axiom Affection : obj → Prop
axiom Love : obj → Prop
axiom Positive : obj → Prop

-- Some affection is love.
axiom A1 : ∃ x : obj, Affection x ∧ Love x
-- Some love is positive.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Love x ∧ Positive x

-- From A1 and A2, we cannot derive ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x,
-- since the witnesses for the two existentials may be different.
-- We also cannot derive its negation from the given information.
-- Hence the status is undecidable from the premises.
