-- 1. All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MakePlans x → Engaged x
-- 2. All people who invite others to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
-- 3. Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
-- 4. Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : obj, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- 5. If John is engaged, then not (John invites friends to their ceremony and makes wedding plans).
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InviteFriends John ∧ MakePlans John)
-- 6. If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- A derived useful fact: anyone with a well-attended wedding is engaged.
theorem well_attended_implies_engaged : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → Engaged x := by
  intro x hx
  have hIO : InviteOthers x := A3 x hx
  have hMP : MakePlans x := A2 x hIO
  exact A1 x hMP

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive Engaged John nor its negation.
-- No axiom links John to WellAttended or LargerFamily outright, and A5 is only conditional.
-- Therefore, the truth of Engaged John is underdetermined by the premises.
