axiom MadeByJapanese : Game → Prop
axiom Top10 : Game → Prop
axiom SoldMillionPlus : Game → Prop

-- A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.
axiom A1 : MadeByJapanese Zelda

-- All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
axiom R1 : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → MadeByJapanese g

-- If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
axiom R2 : ∀ g : Game, SoldMillionPlus g → Top10 g

-- The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.
axiom F1 : SoldMillionPlus Zelda

-- From the above, we can derive that The Legend of Zelda is made by a Japanese company (redundantly)
theorem zelda_japanese : MadeByJapanese Zelda :=
  R1 Zelda (R2 Zelda F1)

-- Question: Is FIFA 22 made by a Japanese video game company?
