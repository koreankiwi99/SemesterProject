-- Some derivations about Vladimir (not directly answering the question)
theorem vladimir_US : USCitizen Vladimir :=
by
  have h := A3 Vladimir
  cases h with
  | inl hu => exact hu
  | inr ht => exact False.elim (A5a ht)

theorem vladimir_can_register : CanRegisterUS Vladimir := A2 Vladimir vladimir_US
theorem vladimir_can_participate : CanParticipate2024 Vladimir := A1 Vladimir vladimir_can_register

-- From the given axioms, we cannot prove RussianOfficial Vladimir nor its negation.
