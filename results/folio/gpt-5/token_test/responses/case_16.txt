-- Axioms from the context
-- All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, (Rabbit x ∧ Near x) → Cute x
-- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Turtle x ∧ Near x
-- The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Near x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x)
-- If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
-- All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, (Squirrel x ∧ Near x) → Skittish x
-- Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.

-- From the given axioms, we cannot prove Turtle Rockie or ¬ Turtle Rockie.
-- The "only ... are rabbits and squirrels" gives Near x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x),
-- which does not exclude also being a Turtle.
-- Therefore, Rockie being a Turtle is not derivable nor refutable here.
-- No theorem about (Turtle Rockie) or its negation is provable with the given axioms.
