-- If George likes music, he wants to compose.
axiom R1 : LikesMusic George → WantsCompose George
-- If George has access to a program, he can compose.
axiom R2 : HasAccessProgram George → CanCompose George
-- If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.
axiom R3 : CanCompose George ∧ WantsCompose George → WillCompose George

-- If George likes music and has access to a program, he will compose.
theorem george_will_compose :
  (LikesMusic George ∧ HasAccessProgram George) → WillCompose George := by
  intro h
  have hL : LikesMusic George := And.left h
  have hA : HasAccessProgram George := And.right h
  have hW : WantsCompose George := R1 hL
  have hC : CanCompose George := R2 hA
  exact R3 (And.intro hC hW)
