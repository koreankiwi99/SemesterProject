axiom obj : Type
axiom George : obj

axiom LikesMusic : obj → Prop
axiom WantsCompose : obj → Prop
axiom HasProgramAccess : obj → Prop
axiom CanCompose : obj → Prop
axiom WillCompose : obj → Prop

-- If George likes music, he wants to compose.
axiom R1 : LikesMusic George → WantsCompose George
-- If George has access to a program, he can compose.
axiom R2 : HasProgramAccess George → CanCompose George
-- If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.
axiom R3 : CanCompose George ∧ WantsCompose George → WillCompose George

-- Goal: (¬ WillCompose George) → (¬ CanCompose George)
-- From the given axioms, this implication cannot be derived.
-- Also, its negation cannot be derived from the given axioms.
