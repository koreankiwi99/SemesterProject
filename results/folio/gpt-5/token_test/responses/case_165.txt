axiom TheBachelor : obj
axiom BreakingBad : obj

-- Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.
axiom ExMon8Roses : ∃ s : obj, Show s ∧ AirsMon8 s ∧ GivesRoses s
-- If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
axiom RosesImpliesBachelorEp : ∀ s : obj, GivesRoses s → EpisodeOfBachelor s
-- The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
axiom TB_portrays_real : PortraysReal TheBachelor
-- All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.
axiom RealPeopleImpliesRealityTV : ∀ s : obj, Show s ∧ PortraysReal s → RealityTV s
-- Breaking Bad is a show.
axiom BB_is_show : Show BreakingBad
-- Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.
axiom BB_not_reality : ¬ RealityTV BreakingBad

-- Goal: If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm.
-- That is, GivesRoses BreakingBad → AirsMon8 BreakingBad.
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive AirsMon8 BreakingBad from GivesRoses BreakingBad.
-- We also cannot derive ¬GivesRoses BreakingBad (which would make the implication vacuously true),
-- since there is no link stating that episodes of The Bachelor (or shows that give roses) are reality TV.
-- Hence we cannot prove the statement or its negation from the provided information.
