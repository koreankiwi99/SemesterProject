axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Deadly : obj → Prop
axiom LowSurvival : obj → Prop
axiom Severe : obj → Prop
axiom BileDuctCancer : obj → Prop
axiom Cholangiocarcinoma : obj → Prop

-- Constants (entities)
axiom MildFlu : obj
axiom ColorectalCancer : obj

-- Axioms from the context
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Deadly x → LowSurvival x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Severe x → Deadly x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, BileDuctCancer x → Severe x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x
axiom A5 : LowSurvival MildFlu
axiom A6 : ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvival ColorectalCancer)

-- A derived fact: Colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer
theorem not_bile_duct_crc : ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer := by
  intro hB
  have hS : Severe ColorectalCancer := A3 ColorectalCancer hB
  have hD : Deadly ColorectalCancer := A2 ColorectalCancer hS
  have hL : LowSurvival ColorectalCancer := A1 ColorectalCancer hD
  exact A6 (And.intro hB hL)

-- Cannot prove Severe ColorectalCancer or its negation from the given axioms
