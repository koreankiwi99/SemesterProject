-- All who eat salads regularly are very conscious
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, EatsSaladsRegularly x → VeryConscious x
-- All who grew up in health-conscious homes eat salads regularly
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, HealthHome x → EatsSaladsRegularly x
-- All who fulfill daily nutrition grew up in health-conscious homes
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, FulfillsDailyNutrition x → HealthHome x
-- All who disregard their well-being are not very conscious
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, DisregardsWellBeing x → ¬ VeryConscious x
-- Visiting gym daily implies fulfilling daily nutrition
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, VisitsGymDaily x → FulfillsDailyNutrition x

-- Taylor either (H ∧ D) or (¬H ∧ ¬D)
axiom A6 :
  (HealthHome Taylor ∧ DisregardsWellBeing Taylor) ∨
  (¬ HealthHome Taylor ∧ ¬ DisregardsWellBeing Taylor)

-- The (H ∧ D) case is impossible
