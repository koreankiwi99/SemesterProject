-- No one nice to animals is also mean to animals.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Nice x → ¬ Mean x
-- Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Grumpy x ∧ Mean x
-- All animal lovers are nice to animals.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, AnimalLover x → Nice x
-- All pet owners love animals.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, PetOwner x → AnimalLover x
-- Tom is a pet owner.
axiom A5 : PetOwner Tom

theorem nice_Tom : Nice Tom :=
  A3 Tom (A4 Tom A5)

theorem not_mean_Tom : ¬ Mean Tom :=
  A1 Tom nice_Tom

-- From the given information, we cannot prove Grumpy Tom or ¬ Grumpy Tom.
-- The existence of some grumpy-and-mean person does not imply Tom is grumpy,
-- and Tom being nice (hence not mean) does not preclude him from being grumpy.
