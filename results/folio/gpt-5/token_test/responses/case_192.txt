axiom Event : Type
axiom Happy : Event → Prop
axiom Sad : Event → Prop

-- "Events are either happy or sad" interpreted as exclusive or:
axiom cover : ∀ x : Event, Happy x ∨ Sad x
axiom exclusive : ∀ x : Event, Happy x → ¬ Sad x

-- "At least one event is happy."
axiom exists_happy : ∃ x : Event, Happy x

-- Statement to assess: "All events are sad."
-- We prove its negation from the assumptions.
theorem not_all_events_sad : ¬ (∀ x : Event, Sad x) := by
  intro hAllSad
  rcases exists_happy with ⟨e, heHappy⟩
  have heSad : Sad e := hAllSad e
  have heNotSad : ¬ Sad e := exclusive e heHappy
  exact heNotSad heSad
