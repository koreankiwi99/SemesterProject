-- Jane does not like any animals that bark.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x ∧ Bark x → ¬ Likes Jane x
-- All dogs are animals that bark.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Dog x → Animal x ∧ Bark x
-- Jane likes all animals that jump.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x ∧ Jumps x → Likes Jane x
-- If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x ∧ Legs x → Jumps x
-- If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x ∧ Terricolous x → Legs x
-- KiKi is an animal.
axiom A6 : Animal KiKi
-- If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
axiom A7 : (¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ Legs KiKi) → (Terricolous KiKi ∨ Legs KiKi)

-- Some derived consequences (do not prove KiKi is terricolous)
theorem terricolous_implies_legs : Terricolous KiKi → Legs KiKi :=
by
  intro hT
  have hA : Animal KiKi := A6
  have h : Animal KiKi ∧ Terricolous KiKi := And.intro hA hT
  exact (A5 KiKi) h

theorem legs_implies_jumps : Legs KiKi → Jumps KiKi :=
by
  intro hL
  have hA : Animal KiKi := A6
  have h : Animal KiKi ∧ Legs KiKi := And.intro hA hL
  exact (A4 KiKi) h

-- From the given information, we cannot derive Terricolous KiKi nor its negation.
-- No theorem for Terricolous KiKi or ¬ Terricolous KiKi can be proved from the axioms.
