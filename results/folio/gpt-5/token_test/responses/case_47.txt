axiom Person : Type
axiom Season : Type

axiom Spring : Season
axiom Summer : Season
axiom Fall : Season
axiom Winter : Season

-- The four seasons are distinct
axiom Spring_ne_Summer : Spring ≠ Summer
axiom Spring_ne_Fall : Spring ≠ Fall
axiom Spring_ne_Winter : Spring ≠ Winter
axiom Summer_ne_Fall : Summer ≠ Fall
axiom Summer_ne_Winter : Summer ≠ Winter
axiom Fall_ne_Winter : Fall ≠ Winter

axiom FavoriteSeason : Person → Season

axiom Emma : Person
axiom Mia : Person
axiom James : Person

axiom WantsLongVacation : Person → Prop

-- All who want a long vacation have Summer as their favorite season
axiom R1 : ∀ p : Person, WantsLongVacation p → FavoriteSeason p = Summer
-- Emma's favorite season is Summer
axiom T_Emma : FavoriteSeason Emma = Summer
-- Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's
axiom T_Mia_diff : FavoriteSeason Mia ≠ FavoriteSeason Emma
-- James wants to have a long vacation
axiom T_James : WantsLongVacation James

theorem james_fav_summer : FavoriteSeason James = Summer := R1 James T_James

theorem mia_not_summer : FavoriteSeason Mia ≠ Summer := by
  simpa [T_Emma] using T_Mia_diff

-- Target: FavoriteSeason Mia = Spring
-- From the given axioms, we can only conclude FavoriteSeason Mia ≠ Summer.
-- We cannot prove FavoriteSeason Mia = Spring nor its negation.
