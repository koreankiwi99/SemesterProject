axiom obj : Type

-- Entities (languages)
axiom French : obj
axiom Spanish : obj
axiom German : obj
axiom Basque : obj

-- Predicates
axiom Romance : obj → Prop
axiom IndoEuropean : obj → Prop
axiom Related : obj → obj → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
-- All Romance languages are Indo-European languages.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Romance x → IndoEuropean x

-- "Romance languages are a language family" together with
-- "All languages within a language family are related to each other"
-- is captured here specifically for the Romance family:
axiom Romance_family_related : ∀ x y : obj, Romance x → Romance y → Related x y

-- French and Spanish are Romance languages.
axiom French_romance : Romance French
axiom Spanish_romance : Romance Spanish

-- German is related to Spanish.
axiom German_related_Spanish : Related German Spanish

-- Basque is not related to any other language.
axiom Basque_isolate : ∀ x : obj, ¬ Related Basque x ∧ ¬ Related x Basque

-- Goal: German is a Romance language.
-- We cannot derive Romance German from the given axioms,
-- nor can we derive ¬ Romance German.
-- The fact that German is related to Spanish and that Romance languages are mutually related
-- does not imply that only members of the same family are related.
-- Hence, the statement is undecidable from the given information.
-- (No theorem provided since it cannot be proved or refuted from the axioms.)
