-- All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Growth x → BoughtRapid x
-- If a stock is bought for rapid appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, BoughtRapid x → ¬ SuitableRetirement x
-- Some stocks are growth stocks.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, Stock x ∧ Growth x
-- All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund (interpreted as: if x is mature and a stock, then x is suitable).
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, (Mature x ∧ Stock x) → SuitableRetirement x
-- KO is a mature stock.
axiom A5m : Mature KO
axiom A5s : Stock KO

-- KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
theorem ko_suitable : SuitableRetirement KO := by
  have h : Mature KO ∧ Stock KO := And.intro A5m A5s
  exact A4 KO h

-- Therefore, KO is not a growth stock.
theorem ko_not_growth : ¬ Growth KO := by
  intro hG
  have hBR : BoughtRapid KO := A1 KO hG
  have hNotS : ¬ SuitableRetirement KO := A2 KO hBR
  have hS : SuitableRetirement KO := by
    have h : Mature KO ∧ Stock KO := And.intro A5m A5s
    exact A4 KO h
  exact hNotS hS

-- The queried statement "KO is a stock and a growth stock" is false.
theorem not_ko_stock_and_growth : ¬ (Stock KO ∧ Growth KO) := by
  intro h
  exact ko_not_growth h.right
