-- Rules for people at Mary's school
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, AtMS x → Work x → Need x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Person, AtMS x → OrderTakeout x → Work x
axiom R3 : ∀ x : Person, AtMS x → (OrderTakeout x ∨ EnjoyDiningHall x)
axiom R4 : ∀ x : Person, AtMS x → EnjoyDiningHall x → ¬ Picky x
axiom R5 : ∀ x : Person, AtMS x → EnjoyDiningHall x → SpendTimeDiningHalls x

-- Facts about Hannah
axiom H_atMS : AtMS Hannah
axiom H_work_and_cond :
  Work Hannah ∧ (Need Hannah → (¬ Picky Hannah ∧ ¬ Need Hannah))

-- From Hannah's conditional alone, we can derive ¬ Need Hannah
theorem hannah_not_need : ¬ Need Hannah := by
  intro hN
  have hcond : Need Hannah → (¬ Picky Hannah ∧ ¬ Need Hannah) :=
    And.right H_work_and_cond
  have hNotNeed : ¬ Need Hannah := And.right (hcond hN)
  exact hNotNeed hN

-- Note: We can also derive Need Hannah from AtMS and Work:
theorem hannah_need : Need Hannah :=
  R1 Hannah H_atMS (And.left H_work_and_cond)
