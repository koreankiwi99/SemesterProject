Thus P \u2192 E \u2192 S and I \u2192 \u00acS. Therefore for Bonnie, P and I are mutually exclusive. Also, with C, D \u2194 I (since I \u2192 D and S \u2192 \u00acD while P \u2192 S).\n\nQuestion 1:\n- From C \u2192 (P \u2228 I) and exclusivity, Bonnie is either P or I. Both cases are consistent with the premises; we cannot determine P specifically. Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- For Bonnie, S \u2228 I is always true: if P then S; if not, then I. Hence any implication with consequent (S \u2228 I) is true regardless of the antecedent. Answer: True.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- Antecedent simplifies to (P \u2228 D), which is always true for Bonnie (if not I then P; if I then D).\n- Consequent is (Y \u2227 W) \u2227 I. But with C, Y \u2227 W \u2192 S, and I \u2192 \u00acS; thus (Y \u2227 W) \u2227 I is impossible. So the implication is True \u2192 False, which is false.

From LH -> R, contraposition gives \u00acR -> \u00acLH, so \u00acLH. Since (LC or LH) and \u00acLH, we get LC. So if M, then LC.\n- If \u00acM: From Ap \u2194 M, \u00acM -> \u00acAp.

But if OC (for an employee), then OC -> R, making \u00ac(LH or R) false. So A can fail (e.g., James is an employee in other countries).\n- For B: If LH or R, then R is true (since LH -> R). From M -> \u00acR, contraposition gives R -> \u00acM, so we get \u00acM. But nothing lets us infer \u00acOC from R; in fact OC -> R, so it\u2019s consistent to have OC with R, making the consequent (\u00acM and \u00acOC) fail.

Hence, Coco is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\n\n- Since Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022 as a player and all tennis players there are either female or male, and she is not male, she is a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\n\n- All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek; therefore Coco lost to Iga.\n\n- Everyone who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the WTA; and anyone ranked highly by the WTA is one of the most active players in major (Grand-Slam) tennis.\n\nQuestion 1:\n- From the above, Coco is ranked highly by the WTA, so she is among the most active players in major/Grand-Slam tennis.

We don\u2019t. Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\nNot living with strangers does not imply complaining. Complaining is compatible (choose not-baby) or not. Unknown.\n\nQuestion 3:\nClaim is \u00acBornMultiple \u2227 \u00acComplain. We cannot establish either conjunct; both may be true or false in different consistent scenarios.

Jane does not like any animals that bark.\nAll dogs are animals that bark.\nJane likes all animals that jump.\nIf an animal has legs, then it jumps.\nIf an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. \nKiKi is an animal.\nIf KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n\nQuestion 1: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? KiKi is terricolous.\n\nQuestion 2: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain?

    "model_response": "Reasoning:\n\nFirst, derive properties of KiKi:\n- If an animal is terricolous then it has legs; if it has legs then it jumps. \n- Given: If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n  Assume (for contradiction) KiKi neither jumps nor has legs. Then by the given rule, KiKi is terricolous or has legs. With \u201cnot legs,\u201d this forces terricolous; but terricolous implies legs, contradicting \u201cnot legs.\u201d So the assumption is impossible. Hence KiKi must have jumps or legs; since legs imply jumps, KiKi jumps.\n\nFrom Jane\u2019s preferences:\n- Jane likes all animals that jump; KiKi is an animal and jumps, so Jane likes KiKi.\n- Jane does not like any animals that bark; therefore KiKi cannot bark. So KiKi does not bark.\n\nFrom dogs barking:\n- All dogs bark; since KiKi does not bark, KiKi is not a dog.\n\nNow answer the questions:\n\n1) Is KiKi terricolous? We have no information forcing terricolous (it\u2019s consistent either way), so Unknown.\n\n2) Is KiKi a barking dog? Since KiKi does not bark and is not a dog, False.\n\n3) Does KiKi not bark and is he not a dog? Yes, as derived above, True.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: False\n3: True",
