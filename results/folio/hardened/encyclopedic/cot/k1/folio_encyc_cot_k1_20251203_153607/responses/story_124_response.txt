Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.
The Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated.
There are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- The Picuris Mountains are stated to be in New Mexico or Texas. The Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated. There are no mountain ranges in Texas that have donated mines. Therefore, the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas. Given the disjunction, they must be in New Mexico.
- Juan de Oñate visited the Picuris Mountains; thus he visited a mountain range in New Mexico, not Texas.
- Since the mine is located in the Picuris Mountains, and those are in New Mexico, it is located in a mountain range in New Mexico.
