Story ID: 131
Premises: (大阪外環状鉄道株式会社, Ōsaka Sotokanjō Tetsudō Kabushiki Kaisha) as a Category-3 railway business under the Railway Business Act of Japan. Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms.
Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.
The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- ML categories: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning (RL).
- Unsupervised learning does not require labeled data.
- The SOTA text summarization model is trained with ML, and the ML algorithm used requires labeled data.
- RL is explicitly not used.

Therefore:
- Since the algorithm requires labeled data, it cannot be unsupervised. RL is excluded. The remaining category is supervised.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
