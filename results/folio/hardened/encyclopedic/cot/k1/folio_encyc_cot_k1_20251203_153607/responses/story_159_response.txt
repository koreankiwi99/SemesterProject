Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
Question 1:
- Rule: All students who want a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.
- Fact: James wants a long vacation, but we are not told James is a student.
- Therefore, the rule may not apply; we cannot conclude James’s favorite season.

Question 2:
- Emma’s favorite season is summer.
- Mia’s favorite season is not the same as Emma’s, so not summer.
- With four seasons total, Mia could favor spring, fall, or winter. We can’t determine which.
