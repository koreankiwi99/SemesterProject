Story ID: 166
Premises: The breed can also be prone to skin disorders such as the breed-specific condition hyperplastic dermatosis. Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Tom will rent if: (allowed with Fluffy) AND (deposit ≤ $1500).
- At The Olive Garden, rent is $2000. The security deposit for a managed building is equal to the monthly rent or more, so deposit ≥ $2000, and $2000 > $1500.
- Thus the deposit ≤ $1500 condition fails. The given rule is only a sufficient condition, not necessary, so we cannot conclude whether Tom will rent.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Fluffy is a cat; cats are pets.
- If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.
- We only know that some managed buildings allow pets; it is not specified that The Olive Garden allows pets.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The Olive Garden is a managed building with monthly rent $2000.
- For managed buildings, the security deposit is equal to the monthly rent or more. Hence at The Olive Garden, deposit ≥ $2000.
- Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: True
