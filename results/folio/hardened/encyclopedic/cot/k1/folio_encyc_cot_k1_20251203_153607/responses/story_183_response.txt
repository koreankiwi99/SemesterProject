Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Michael is taller than everyone else in his class.
- Peter is taller than Michael.
- By transitivity, Peter is taller than everyone in Michael’s class.
- Therefore, Peter is not shorter than any man in Michael’s class. The statement is false.

Question 2:
- If a person does not jump when shooting, Michael can block them. Contrapositive: If Michael cannot block someone, that person jumps when shooting.
- Michael cannot block Windy’s shooting ⇒ Windy jumps when shooting.
- Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter. Windy shoots and jumps ⇒ Windy is a great shooter. The statement is true.

Question 3:
- A man taller than another man can block the other’s shooting. To use this, we’d need Windy to be a man and Peter to be taller than Windy; neither is established.
- The blocking rule about non-jumpers applies only to Michael, not Peter.
- We know Windy jumps when shooting, but have no rule about Peter blocking jumpers.
- Thus, we cannot determine whether Peter can block Windy. The statement is unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: False
