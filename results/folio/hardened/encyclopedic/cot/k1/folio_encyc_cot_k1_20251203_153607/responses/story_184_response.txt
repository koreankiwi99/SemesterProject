==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- "Stranger Things" is a popular Netflix show.
- If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it. Therefore, Karen binge-watches "Stranger Things."
- If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa. Therefore, she will share "Stranger Things" with Lisa.
Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show, and Karen does not download it.
- For Netflix shows, Karen binge-watches iff she downloads. So not downloading "Black Mirror" implies she does not binge-watch it.
- If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it. Contrapositive (for Netflix shows): if she does not binge-watch it, then it is not popular.
- Therefore, "Black Mirror" is not popular.
Conclusion: False.

Question 3:
- From above, Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror."
- The only sharing rule is: if she binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it. Lack of binge-watching does not imply she won’t share.
- Thus, we cannot determine whether she shares "Black Mirror."
Conclusion: Unknown.

1: True
