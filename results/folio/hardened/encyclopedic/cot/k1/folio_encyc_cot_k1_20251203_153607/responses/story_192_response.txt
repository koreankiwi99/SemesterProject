Story ID: 192
Premises: Common examples include strut seals, hydraulic pump seals, axle seals, power steering seals, and valve stem seals. International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
Mike is an international student.
Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- The text says: International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa. Mike is an international student, but it does not state he is in the US.
- The rule about CPT/OPT applies to international students in the US with an F1 visa: if they want to work in the US, they need CPT or OPT.
- We are told: Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US. This matches the consequent of the F1 rule but does not allow us to infer the antecedent (avoiding affirming the consequent). Also, nothing in the text states that only F1 students need CPT.
- Therefore, we cannot deduce whether Mike has an F1 or a J1 visa from the given information.
