Story ID: 197
Premises: The southern terminus of the route is at the Virginia state line (and southern city limits of Bluefield), where WV 598 continues southward as Virginia State Route 598. It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
Tom lives in a single-parent family.
Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them. 
Tom is applying to take the GRE test.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. ETS provides aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship. People in single-parent families or with few resources can prove hardship. Tom is an applicant and fits those conditions, but “can prove” does not entail that he actually proves it. So we cannot conclude he receives aid.
2. The text states the GRE costs $205, which is cheaper than $300. Therefore, the cost is below $300.
3. ETS has a policy to provide aid to applicants who prove hardship, but the text does not establish that any specific person who actually takes the GRE has received aid. Therefore, we cannot determine the universal claim that no test taker has aid.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: Unknown
