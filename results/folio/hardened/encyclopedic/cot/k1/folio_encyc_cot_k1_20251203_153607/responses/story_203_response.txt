Premises: Smith was a right-handed batsman and played three innings in two first-class matches, making a total of 9 runs. Plungers suck.
Vacuums suck.
Vampires suck.
Space is a vacuum.
A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) Given: Vacuums suck. Given: Space is a vacuum. Therefore, by modus ponens, Space sucks. So the statement “Space sucks” is true.
2) Given: Vampires suck. This does not imply that everything that sucks is a vampire. We have no statement linking vacuums (or space) to being vampires. So we cannot conclude that space is a vampire. Unknown.
3) Given: A duster is a household appliance that doesn’t suck. This is a counterexample to the universal claim “If something is a household appliance, it sucks.” Therefore the claim is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
