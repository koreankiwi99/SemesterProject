==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Romance languages are a language family, and all members of a language family are related to each other.
- French and Spanish are Romance languages, so any Romance language would be related to them.
- Basque is not related to any other language.
- Therefore, Basque cannot be a Romance language. So the statement is false.

Question 2:
- German is related to Spanish.
- From the premises, being in the same language family implies relatedness, but we are not told that being related implies being in the same family.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude that German is a Romance language; nor can we rule it out based on the given information. So it is unknown.

Question 3:
