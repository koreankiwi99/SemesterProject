Story ID: 217
Premises: 8-mile-long rail trail in Oakland County, Michigan. If George likes music, he wants to compose.
If George has access to a program, he can compose.
If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- If George likes music, then he wants to compose.
- If George has access to a program, then he can compose.
- If he can compose and wants to compose, then he will compose.
- Therefore, if he likes music and has access to a program, he both wants and can compose, which implies he will compose. So the statement is true.

Question 2:
- From (can compose and wants to compose) -> will compose, the contrapositive is: if he will not compose, then not(can and wants), i.e., either he cannot compose or he does not want to compose.
- This does not imply specifically that he cannot compose; he might be able to compose but not want to. Thus, the statement "If George will not compose, George cannot compose" is not entailed. Its truth is undetermined from the given information.

ANSWERS:
1: True
