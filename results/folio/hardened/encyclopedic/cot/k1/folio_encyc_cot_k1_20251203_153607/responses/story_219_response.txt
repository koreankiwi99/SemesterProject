Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. We know: Composers write music pieces. Beethoven wrote a music piece (Symphony No. 9). From "Composers write music pieces" we cannot infer the converse that anyone who writes a music piece is a composer. So it cannot be concluded that Beethoven is a composer from the given facts.
2. Vienna Music Society is an orchestra, and it premiered Symphony No. 9. Symphony No. 9 is a music piece. Therefore, at least one orchestra premiered a music piece.
3. Orchestras are led by conductors. Vienna Music Society is an orchestra. Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society. Therefore, Beethoven is a conductor. Hence, the statement that he is not a conductor is false.
