" can be placed on a subsequent line. Yale University is a private Ivy League research university.
Yale University moved to New Haven in 1716.
Yale university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion.
A list of residential colleges at Yale: Benjamin Franklin College, Berkeley College, Branford College, Davenport College, Ezra Stiles College, Grace Hopper College, Jonathan Edwards College, Morse College, Pauli Murray College, Pierson College, Saybrook College, Silliman College, Timothy Dwight College, and Trumbull College.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. The text states Yale University is a private Ivy League research university and that it moved to New Haven in 1716. Therefore, there exists a private Ivy League research university that moved to New Haven.
2. The text gives Yale’s endowment value ($42.3 billion) but provides no comparative information about other institutions’ endowments. We cannot conclude it is the largest.
3. The text lists Pierson College among Yale’s residential colleges, so the statement is supported.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: True
