Some pets are not mammals.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- All cats are mammals, so the set of cats is a subset of mammals.
- Some pets are not mammals, which only tells us that at least one pet lies outside the set of mammals; it does not rule out that some pets could be mammals.
- Therefore, it's possible that some pets are cats (which would be mammals), and it's also possible that no pets are cats. The given information does not determine which is the case.
