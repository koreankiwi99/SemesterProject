Story ID: 259
Premises: Evelyn Baring, 1st Baron Howick of Glendale, was the third son of the first Earl. All horses have hooves.
No humans have hooves.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "All horses have hooves": If something is a horse, it has hooves.
- From "No humans have hooves": If something is a human, it does not have hooves.
- If some humans were horses, there would exist an entity that is both human and horse. Then it would both have hooves (as a horse) and not have hooves (as a human), a contradiction.
- Therefore, no humans are horses, making the statement "Some humans are horses" false.
- The detail about Evelyn Baring is irrelevant to this logical relation.

ANSWERS:
1: False
