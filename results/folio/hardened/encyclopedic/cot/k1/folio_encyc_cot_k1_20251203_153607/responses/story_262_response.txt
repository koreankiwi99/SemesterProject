Some objects of worship are fir trees.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Premises: All fir trees are evergreens (F ⊆ E). Some objects of worship are fir trees (∃x: W(x) ∧ F(x)).
- Therefore, some objects of worship are evergreens (∃x: W(x) ∧ E(x)).
- The claim asks: Some evergreens are not objects of worship (∃x: E(x) ∧ ¬W(x)).
- The premises do not establish that any evergreens are not objects of worship; it is consistent that all evergreens are objects of worship. Hence the statement cannot be determined from the given information.
