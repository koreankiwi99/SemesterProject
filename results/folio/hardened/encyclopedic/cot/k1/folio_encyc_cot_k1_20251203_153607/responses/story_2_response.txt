Story ID: 2
Premises: There is a museum and tea shop on one side of the lake and a restaurant on the other. Billings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.
The state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.
White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.
The city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.
Any city in Butte is not in St Pierre.
A city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1 reasoning:
- The text states that Butte is in Montana and that St Pierre is not in Montana.
- Since a city can only be in one state (and neither is an exception), they cannot be in the same state.
- Therefore, the statement is false.

Question 2 reasoning:
- The text gives no information about Bismarck’s state.
- We only know St Pierre is not in Montana; nothing links St Pierre and Bismarck to the same state.
- Therefore, the truth of the statement cannot be determined from the given information.

Question 3 reasoning:
- The text explicitly says Montana includes Missoula.
- Therefore, the statement is true.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: Unknown
3: True
