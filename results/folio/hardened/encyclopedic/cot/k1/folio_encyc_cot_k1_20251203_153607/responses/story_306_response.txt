Story ID: 306
Premises: Judith Ellen Retchin (born May 24, 1952) is a senior judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews.
All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From “All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four” and “The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents,” we deduce that the Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than 4.
- From “All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations,” it follows the store is listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
- From “If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews,” it follows the store has not received many negative reviews.

Question 1:
- The antecedent assumes the store provides take-out and receives many negative reviews. But we know the store has not received many negative reviews, so the antecedent cannot be true. Therefore, the implication is vacuously true.

Question 2:
- “Provides take-out or does not receive many negative reviews.” We know it does not receive many negative reviews, so the disjunction is true.

Question 3:
- We have no information implying whether the store provides take-out or not. The existence claim about some no-take-out restaurants getting many negative reviews does not apply to this specific store. So this is undetermined.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
