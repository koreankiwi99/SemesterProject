Premises: 2926 for restoration. If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- Rules:
  - If something can transport multiple passengers, then it is not a one-seater.
  - All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers; hence any Tesla Model 3 is not a one-seater.
  - All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
  - All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars; hence any Solo EV is a one-seater.
  - The statement about John’s car: If not Tesla Model 3, then (not Tesla Model 3 or single-seat electric car), is a tautology and gives no information about whether John’s car is a Tesla Model 3 or a Solo EV.

- Q1: There is no information establishing that John’s car is a Tesla Model 3. Unknown.
- Q2: There is no information establishing that John’s car is a Solo EV. Unknown.
- Q3: We also cannot conclude that John’s car is not a Solo EV; nothing rules it out. Unknown.
