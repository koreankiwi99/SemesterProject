Story ID: 318
Premises: Joppa is now largely residential, but salt was once produced from seawater by evaporation at Joppa Pans. Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.
If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.
Breaking Bad is a show.
Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- We know only that there exists some show that airs at 8 pm on Monday and gives out roses. Nothing links this to Breaking Bad.
- We have no information about Breaking Bad’s schedule.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement requires that Breaking Bad both gives out roses and does so at 8 pm on Monday.
- Premises only assert existence of some show with those properties, not that Breaking Bad is that show.
- If Breaking Bad gave out roses, it would be an episode of The Bachelor, but this is neither confirmed nor contradicted by the premises.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The premise gives only an existential: some show that gives roses airs Monday at 8 pm. It does not state that any show that gives roses must air then.
- There is no rule tying “gives roses” for Breaking Bad to “Monday at 8 pm.”
- The implication is not entailed, and its negation is not entailed either.
- Conclusion: Unknown.
