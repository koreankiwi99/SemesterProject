Story ID: 319
Premises: Harry Elliott Alger (April 8, 1924 – January 27, 2010) was a provincial level politician from Alberta, Canada. No baked sweets are spicy.
All cupcakes are baked sweets.
All mala hotpots are spicy.
All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.
Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- No baked sweets are spicy, and all cupcakes are baked sweets. All mala hotpots are spicy. All Baked by Melissa products are cupcakes (thus baked sweets).
- Dried Thai chilies are (spicy) or (mala hotpots) or (not baked sweets). In any of these cases, they end up not being baked sweets:
  - If spicy, then not baked sweet (since no baked sweets are spicy).
  - If mala hotpot, then spicy, hence not baked sweet.
  - Or explicitly not baked sweet.
- Therefore, Dried Thai chilies are not baked sweets.
- Since all Baked by Melissa products are baked sweets, Dried Thai chilies cannot be products of Baked by Melissa.

Question 1: False (they cannot be Baked by Melissa products because they are not baked sweets).
Question 2: True (as above).
Question 3: Unknown (the disjunction allows mala hotpot as one possibility but does not entail it).
Question 4: True (they are not baked sweets and thus not Baked by Melissa products).
Question 5: False (being cupcakes and Baked by Melissa products would make them baked sweets, contradicting the deduction).

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: Unknown
