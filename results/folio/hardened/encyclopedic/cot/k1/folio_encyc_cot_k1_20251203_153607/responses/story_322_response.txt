Premises: Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival (JJF) is one of the largest jazz festivals in the world. All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
Some stocks are growth stocks.
All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
KO is a mature stock.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation” and “If a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund,” we get: Growth(x) -> BoughtRapid(x) -> NotSuitable(x). Thus Growth(x) -> NotSuitable(x). Contrapositive: Suitable(x) -> NotGrowth(x). Also from BoughtRapid(x) -> NotSuitable(x), contrapositive gives Suitable(x) -> NotBoughtRapid(x).
- From “All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund” and “KO is a mature stock,” we conclude KO is Suitable. Also, being a “mature stock” entails being a stock.

Question 1:
- KO is a mature stock; hence KO is a stock. True.

Question 2:
- KO is a stock, but KO is Suitable, so KO is not a growth stock (by Suitable -> NotGrowth). The conjunction “stock and growth stock” is false. False.

Question 3:
- KO is Suitable, so KO is neither Growth nor BoughtRapid. Therefore the antecedent “KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation” is false, making the implication true regardless of the consequent. True.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: True
