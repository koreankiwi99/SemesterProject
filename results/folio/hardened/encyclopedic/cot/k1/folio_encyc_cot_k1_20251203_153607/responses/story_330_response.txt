Story ID: 330
Premises: The terms allopatry and vicariance are often used in biogeography to describe the relationship between organisms whose ranges do not significantly overlap but are immediately adjacent to each other—they do not occur together or only occur within a narrow zone of contact. All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the general rules: Well-attended wedding → invites others (to the ceremony) → makes wedding plans → engaged. So WA(x) → IO(x) → W(x) → E(x).
- The existential claim that some people with well-attended weddings have larger families does not specify John, so it gives no direct information about John.
- Distinguish “invites others” (IO) from “invites friends” (IF); only IO links to plans and engagement via the chain above.
- For John specifically:
  - If John is engaged, then he does not both invite friends and make plans (this does not by itself assert that he is engaged).
  - If John has a larger family, then he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends (this does not assert that he has a larger family).

Question 1: Nothing in the premises entails that John has a larger family; the existential in general does not apply specifically to John. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Likewise, nothing entails that John does not have a larger family. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3: John being engaged would follow if we knew he makes plans, invites others, or has a well-attended wedding; none of these are given about John. The conditional about engagement does not establish engagement. Answer: Unknown.

Question 4: “Neither has a larger family nor invites others” asserts both ¬LF and ¬IO. We cannot infer either ¬LF or ¬IO for John from the premises. Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
