Premises: Although the Mercedes-Benz M-Class was introduced more than a year prior to the X5, the X5 was the first to utilise a monocoque chassis. Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.
Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player.
All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities.
All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes.
If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid.
If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous.
All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens.
Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Everyone at the mixer is either a Grand Slam champion (GSC) or an Oscar-nominated actor (ONA).
- GSC -> professional tennis player -> athlete; athlete -> famous.
- ONA -> celebrity -> well-paid; well-paid -> lives in tax havens.
- Special for Djokovic: if he is a famous athlete, then he is well-paid.

Question 1:
- Djokovic is at the mixer, so he is GSC or ONA. We are not told which. Not derivable that he must be GSC.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Case 1: If Djokovic is ONA, then celebrity -> well-paid -> lives in tax havens.
- Case 2: If Djokovic is GSC, then athlete and famous; by the special rule, famous athlete -> well-paid -> lives in tax havens.
- In all cases, Djokovic lives in a tax haven.
- Conclusion: True.

Question 3:
- Negation of the established result in Question 2.
- Conclusion: False.
