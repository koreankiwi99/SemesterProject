Premises: He was subsequently re-elected in the redistricted Mayo-Tatchun in the 1992 election. No digital media are analog.
Every printed text is analog media.
All streaming services are digital media.
If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.
If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Given:
  - No digital media are analog. (Digital -> not Analog)
  - Every printed text is analog media. (Printed -> Analog)
  - All streaming services are digital media. (Streaming -> Digital)
  - If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text. (Hardcover -> Printed)
  - If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book. (Streaming(1984) -> Hardcover(1984))

- Derivation by contradiction:
  - Assume 1984 is a streaming service.
  - Then Hardcover(1984) (by the last rule), hence Printed(1984), hence Analog(1984).
  - Also Streaming(1984) implies Digital(1984), hence not Analog(1984).
  - Contradiction (Analog and not Analog). Therefore, 1984 is not a streaming service.

Question 1: To conclude 1984 is printed text, we would need a premise implying Printed(1984). The only chain to Printed(1984) comes from Streaming(1984), which we just showed is false. No other rule implies Printed(1984). So Unknown.

Question 2: From the contradiction above, 1984 is not a streaming service. So the statement that it is a streaming service is False.

Question 3: As derived, 1984 is not a streaming service. So True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
