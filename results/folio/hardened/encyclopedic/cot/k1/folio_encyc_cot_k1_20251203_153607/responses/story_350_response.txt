Story ID: 350
Premises: S. All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- The statements about interesting geometries and the brutalist implication apply only to designs by Max that he adores and that have interesting geometries. Combined with “No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries,” this implies there are no designs by Max that he adores with interesting geometries. It does not tell us about designs by Max in general (without those conditions).
- The evocative and dreamy properties are asserted only for Kelly Wearstler’s design styles that Max adores, not for designs by Max in general.
- There is no information guaranteeing the existence of any particular design by Max, nor any rule linking designs by Max to the adored styles.

Question 1: We cannot conclude that a design by Max (without further conditions) is a brutalist building. Unknown.

Question 2: We cannot conclude that a design by Max is evocative and dreamy; the relevant rules concern adored Kelly styles, not designs by Max generally. Unknown.

Question 3: Likewise, we cannot conclude that a design by Max is either evocative or dreamy. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
