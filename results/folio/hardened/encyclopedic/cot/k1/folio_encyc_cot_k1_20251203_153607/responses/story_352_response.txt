Premises: Some of Sellow's scientific collections from Uruguay and Brazil are divided between the Museum of Natural History of Berlin, the Ethnological Museum of Berlin, and the Museum of Natural History of Vienna. All business organizations are legal entities.
All companies are business organizations.
All private companies are companies.
All legal entities are created under law. 
All legal entities have legal obligations.
If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the universal rules: Private company -> Company -> Business organization -> Legal entity. Legal entity -> Created under law and Legal obligations.
- Special rule for HWBC: If created under law, then not a private company.
- Therefore, if HWBC were a private company, it would be a legal entity, hence created under law, which by the special rule implies not a private company. Thus HWBC is not a private company.

Question 1: We can only conclude HWBC has legal obligations if it’s a legal entity. We have no information that it is a legal entity (we only know it is not a private company). So this is unknown.

Question 2: This requires HWBC to be a private company, but we deduced it is not. So the conjunction is false.

Question 3: If HWBC is a private company, then it is a legal entity, hence it has legal obligations and is created under law. Therefore, the implication holds.

ANSWERS:
