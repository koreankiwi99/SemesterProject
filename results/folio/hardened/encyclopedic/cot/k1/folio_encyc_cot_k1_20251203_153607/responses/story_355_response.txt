Story ID: 355
Premises: The party put forward 142 candidates for the 52 seats in the National Assembly. All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.
All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.
All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let S = eats salads regularly; C = very health-conscious; G = grew up in a health-conscious home; N = fulfills daily nutrition; D = disregards physical well-being; Gym = visits gym daily.
- Given: S → C; G → S; N → G; D → ¬C; Gym → N.
- Taylor: (G ∧ D) ∨ (¬G ∧ ¬D).

First, (G ∧ D) would imply G → S → C and D → ¬C, a contradiction (C ∧ ¬C). So that disjunct is impossible. Therefore Taylor has ¬G ∧ ¬D.

From ¬G and N → G, by contrapositive ¬G → ¬N. From ¬N and Gym → N, by contrapositive ¬N → ¬Gym. Hence ¬Gym.

Question 1: Taylor eats salads regularly?
- We have ¬G and ¬Gym, but neither implies ¬S. Nothing else forces S or ¬S. So this is undetermined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Taylor visits the gym at least once a day?
- We derived ¬Gym. Answer: False.

Question 3: Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day?
- We have ¬G and ¬Gym. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
