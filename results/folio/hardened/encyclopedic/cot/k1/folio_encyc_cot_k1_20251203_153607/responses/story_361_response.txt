Story ID: 361
Premises: A. If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let S = “spills a lot of food,” L = “cleanly,” T = “notably tidy,” C = “clumsy foodie who goes out frequently,” V = “values order and spotlessness,” F = “family prioritizes order and spotlessness.”
- Given: S -> ¬T; L -> T; C -> S; V -> L; F -> V; and (S ∧ L) ∨ (¬S ∧ ¬L) for Peter.
- If S ∧ L were true, then T and ¬T would both follow, which is impossible. Hence Peter must satisfy ¬S ∧ ¬L.
- From ¬S and C -> S, contraposition gives ¬C. From ¬L and V -> L, contraposition gives ¬V; from ¬V and F -> V, contraposition gives ¬F.

Question 1: We have ¬S and ¬L, but neither implies T or ¬T. So whether Peter is notably tidy is not determined.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: “Peter is either C or F.” But we derived ¬C and ¬F, so this disjunction is false.
Answer: False.

Question 3: “Peter is either both C and F or neither C nor F.” We have ¬C ∧ ¬F, so the second disjunct holds.
Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
