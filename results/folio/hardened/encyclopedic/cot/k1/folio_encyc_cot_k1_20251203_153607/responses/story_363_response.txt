Story ID: 363
Premises: It is also known by its product code FR9. All hydrocarbons are organic compounds .
All alkanes are hydrocarbons
All organic compounds are chemical compounds.
All organic compounds contain carbon.
No chemical compounds contain only one element.
The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “No chemical compounds contain only one element” and “The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither,” the first option is impossible. Thus, the mixture is neither: it is not a chemical compound and does not contain only one element.
- From “All alkanes are hydrocarbons,” “All hydrocarbons are organic compounds,” and “All organic compounds are chemical compounds,” we get: All alkanes are chemical compounds. Since the mixture is not a chemical compound, it is not an alkane.
- “All organic compounds contain carbon” does not allow us to infer anything about carbon for non-organic/non-compound things.

Question 1:
- We have no rule that non-compounds or non-organics cannot contain carbon. So whether the mixture contains carbon is not determined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The mixture is not an alkane, so “is an alkane and contains carbon” is false regardless of the carbon part.
- Answer: False.

Question 3:
- The consequent “the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane” is already true (as shown above). Therefore, the implication “If (only one element or carbon) then (neither a chemical compound nor an alkane)” is true.
- Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
