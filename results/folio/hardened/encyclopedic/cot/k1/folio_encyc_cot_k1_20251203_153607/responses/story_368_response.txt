Story ID: 368
Premises: They released an album on Crypt Records in 1994 and a sophomore effort on Au Go Go Records in 1996. If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition.
If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus.
People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.
If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters.
If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.
Hannah is at Mary's school.
Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Let W = works in student jobs on campus, N = needs to earn money to help pay tuition, T = orders takeout frequently, E = enjoys dining hall meals, P = picky eater, S = spends a lot of time eating/catching up in dining halls.

Given:
- If W then N.
- If T then W.
- T or E (for people at Mary’s school).
- If E then not P.
- If E then S.
- Hannah is at Mary’s school.
- Hannah: W, and (if N then (not P and not N)).

From W, we get N. From N and (N -> (not P and not N)), we get both not P and not N. So we have both N and not N (a contradiction), and also not P. Nothing lets us conclude E (and thus S) from other facts.

Question 1:
- We have both N and not N for Hannah. Since the statement is both supported and contradicted, its truth is uncertain. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- At school: true.
- Not picky: true (from N -> not P and N).
- S: unknown (requires E; from T or E we can’t infer E).
- The conjunction requires S, which is not established. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- At school: true.
- The disjunction “not P or (if P then S)” is satisfied because not P is established.
- Hence the whole conjunction is true. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: True
