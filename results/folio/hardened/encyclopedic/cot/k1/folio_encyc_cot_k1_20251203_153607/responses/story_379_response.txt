Story ID: 379
Premises: Shanker Adhikari is the chairman of the union. People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.
If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.
If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. 
Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- If someone is born in a multiple birth, then they spend a lot of time with their siblings → they live at home → they do not live with strangers.
- Luke is stated to be either: (born in a multiple birth and live with strangers) or (not born in a multiple birth and not live with strangers).
- The first option (born in multiple birth and live with strangers) contradicts the rule that those who live at home do not live with strangers. Therefore, the only consistent option is: Luke is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.
- Complaining about annoying siblings implies having siblings born together, which implies being born in a multiple birth. Since Luke is not born in a multiple birth, by modus tollens he does not complain.

Question 1:
- We only know Luke is not born in a multiple birth (and does not complain). There is no rule that forces him to spend a lot of time with siblings without those triggers. So this cannot be concluded.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- As above, complaining implies being born in a multiple birth, but Luke is not born in a multiple birth. Hence he does not complain.
- Answer: False.

Question 3:
- We have shown Luke is not born in a multiple birth and he does not complain.
- Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
