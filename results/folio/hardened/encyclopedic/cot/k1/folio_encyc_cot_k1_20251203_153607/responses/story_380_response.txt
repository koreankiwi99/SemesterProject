Story ID: 380
Premises: Matthew Gray (born 24 June 1973) is an Australian archer. People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. 
Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Let C = in the club, P = performs in school talent shows often, E = attends and is very engaged with school events, S = student who attends the school, I = inactive/disinterested community member, D = chaperones high school dances, Y = young child or teenager, W = wishes to further academic opportunities.

From the context:
- C ∧ P → E.
- C → (P ∨ I).
- C ∧ I → D and C ∧ D → ¬S, so for club members I → ¬S.
- For Bonnie: C holds, and (E ∧ S) ∨ (¬E ∧ ¬S), so E ↔ S. Thus P → E → S and I → ¬S. Therefore for Bonnie, P and I are mutually exclusive. Also, with C, D ↔ I (since I → D and S → ¬D while P → S).

Question 1:
- From C → (P ∨ I) and exclusivity, Bonnie is either P or I. Both cases are consistent with the premises; we cannot determine P specifically. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- For Bonnie, S ∨ I is always true: if P then S; if not, then I. Hence any implication with consequent (S ∨ I) is true regardless of the antecedent. Answer: True.

Question 3:
- Antecedent simplifies to (P ∨ D), which is always true for Bonnie (if not I then P; if I then D).
- Consequent is (Y ∧ W) ∧ I. But with C, Y ∧ W → S, and I → ¬S; thus (Y ∧ W) ∧ I is impossible. So the implication is True → False, which is false. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
