Story ID: 385
Premises: Matthew Gray (born 24 June 1973) is an Australian archer. If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. 
Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Assume “Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022” means she is a tennis player at RG 2022.
- By “All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male,” Coco is either female or male at RG 2022.
- If Coco were male, then by “All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal,” she lost to Nadal. Then by “If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022,” she would not be male — a contradiction. Hence, Coco is not male; thus she is female.
- Being a female tennis player at RG 2022 implies she lost to Iga Świątek (given). Therefore she is ranked highly by the WTA (given), and thus is among the most active players in major tennis (given).

Question 1:
- From the above, Coco is ranked highly by the WTA, so she is among the most active Grand-Slam players. True.

Question 2:
- We only know male players lost to Nadal. Coco is not male. There is no rule stating non-males did not lose to Nadal. Therefore we cannot determine whether she lost to Nadal. Unknown.

Question 3:
- We have both: Coco lost to Iga Świątek and Coco is among the most active players in major tennis. Therefore the statement “Coco is not both lost-to-Świątek and most-active” is false. False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
