Story ID: 386
Premises: From 1980 to 1988, Stewart wrote two books about Merlin, translating and exploring medieval texts on the topic (now published in one volume as Merlin: the Prophetic Vision and Mystic Life, by Penguin Arkana). If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
First, collect the logical consequences:
- Deadly(x) -> LowSurvival(x).
- SevereCancer(x) -> Deadly(x) -> LowSurvival(x).
- BileDuctCancer(x) -> SevereCancer(x) -> LowSurvival(x).
- Cholangiocarcinoma(x) -> BileDuctCancer(x).
- MildFlu(x) -> LowSurvival(x).
- Given: not(BileDuctCancer(CRC) and LowSurvival(CRC)). Since BileDuctCancer(x) -> LowSurvival(x), this entails not BileDuctCancer(CRC). Then by contrapositive of Cholangiocarcinoma -> BileDuctCancer, not Cholangiocarcinoma(CRC). We know nothing about whether CRC is SevereCancer or MildFlu.

Question 1:
We only know CRC is not a bile duct cancer; nothing tells us CRC is (or is not) severe via any other route. So we cannot conclude it is a severe cancer.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
Antecedent: “CRC is a bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma” is equivalent to BileDuctCancer(CRC) (since Cholangiocarcinoma implies bile duct). But we derived not BileDuctCancer(CRC), so the antecedent is false. Therefore the implication is vacuously true.
Answer: True.

Question 3:
The statement amounts to (Cholangiocarcinoma(CRC) and MildFlu(CRC)) or BileDuctCancer(CRC), or both. We have not Cholangiocarcinoma(CRC) and not BileDuctCancer(CRC), so each disjunct is false. Hence the whole statement is false.
Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
