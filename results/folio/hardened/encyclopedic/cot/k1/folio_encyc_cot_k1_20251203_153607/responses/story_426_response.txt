Story ID: 426
Premises: pɔ. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. 
Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. 
Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. 
No managers work remotely from home. 
James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Let LC = “James has lunch in the company building,” LH = “James has lunch at home,” S = “James schedules meetings with customers,” Go = “James goes to the company building today,” Ap = “James appears in the company today,” M = “James is a manager,” OC = “James is in other countries,” R = “James works remotely from home.”

Given:
- LC -> S
- (Employee ∧ S) -> Go
- Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home (so LC or LH)
- LH -> R (for employees)
- OC -> R (for employees)
- M -> ¬R
- Ap ↔ M
- Going to the company building implies appearing in the company today (Go -> Ap)

Question 1: Does James have lunch in the company?
- If M: M -> ¬R. From LH -> R, contraposition gives ¬R -> ¬LH, so ¬LH. Since (LC or LH) and ¬LH, we get LC. So if M, then LC.
- If ¬M: From Ap ↔ M, ¬M -> ¬Ap. If LC, then LC -> S -> Go -> Ap, contradiction. Thus ¬LC, hence LH.
- We don’t know whether M or ¬M. Therefore we cannot determine LC.
Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2: Does James not have lunch in the company?
- From the same case split: If M then LC (so “not LC” is false); if ¬M then ¬LC (so “not LC” is true).
- Since M status is unknown, we cannot determine “not LC.”
Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3: The statement is the conjunction of two implications:
A) (M or OC) -> ¬(LH or R)
B) (LH or R) -> (¬M and ¬OC)

- For A: If M, then ¬R and by ¬R -> ¬LH, we get ¬(LH or R), so holds. But if OC (for an employee), then OC -> R, making ¬(LH or R) false. So A can fail (e.g., James is an employee in other countries).
- For B: If LH or R, then R is true (since LH -> R). From M -> ¬R, contraposition gives R -> ¬M, so we get ¬M. But nothing lets us infer ¬OC from R; in fact OC -> R, so it’s consistent to have OC with R, making the consequent (¬M and ¬OC) fail. Thus B can fail.
- Since each implication can be true in some scenarios and false in others consistent with the premises, the overall statement is not determined.
Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown

Q1: James has lunch in the company.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: James does not have lunch in the company.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q3: If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home. If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries. [contrapositive is more natural]
