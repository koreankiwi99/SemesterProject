Story ID: 435
Premises: The Blues EP is the second recording by Some Girls. None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department. 
All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. 
All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department. 
All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. 
All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.
James is a student working in the lab. 
James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David” and “James is a student working in the lab,” James is taking a class with Professor David.
- From “All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course,” James is taking the database course.
- From “All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department,” James is from the CS department.
- From “All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library” and “None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department,” having a university-offered part-time job would imply not being from CS. This would conflict with James being from CS if he had such a job.
- It is explicitly stated: “James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university,” which reads as “James does not work in the lab and James does not have a part-time job,” contradicting the earlier “James is working in the lab” but still directly giving us that James does not have a part-time job.

Question 1: James has a part-time job offered by the university.
- Directly contradicted by the explicit statement that he does not have such a job.
- Answer: False.

Question 2: James does not have a part-time job offered by the university.
- Explicitly stated.
- Answer: True.

Question 3: James either takes the database course or has a part-time job offered by the university.
- From the lab premise, James takes the database course; thus the disjunction holds.
- Answer: True.

Question 4: James takes the database course.
- Derived via lab → David’s class → database course.
- Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
4: True
