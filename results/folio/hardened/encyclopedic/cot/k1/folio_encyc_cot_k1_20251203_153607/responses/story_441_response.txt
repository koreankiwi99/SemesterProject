Premises: This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gilman, D. No one nice to animals is also mean to animals.
Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
All animal lovers are nice to animals.
All pet owners love animals.
Tom is a pet owner.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- From Tom is a pet owner → Tom loves animals → Tom is nice to animals.
- From nice → not mean, Tom is not mean.
- Nothing in the premises determines whether Tom is grumpy.
- Therefore, whether Tom is grumpy is not determined.

Question 2:
- As above, Tom is not mean.
- Therefore Tom cannot be both grumpy and mean.
- The statement "Tom is not both grumpy and mean" is true.

Question 3:
- Antecedent: "Tom is not both grumpy and mean" is true (from Q2).
- Consequent: "Tom is neither grumpy nor an animal lover" is false because Tom is an animal lover.
- A true antecedent and false consequent makes the implication false.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
