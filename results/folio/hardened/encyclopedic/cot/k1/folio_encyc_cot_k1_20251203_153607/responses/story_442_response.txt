==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Premises:
- All Brown Swiss cattle are cows.
- All cows are domesticated animals.
- Some pets are Brown Swiss cattle.
- Alligators are not domesticated animals.
- Ted is an alligator.

Derived:
- From Ted is an alligator and alligators are not domesticated animals, Ted is not domesticated.
- From Brown Swiss cattle → cows → domesticated, any Brown Swiss cattle is domesticated.
- Since Ted is not domesticated, Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle (modus tollens).

Question 1:
- No premise links being a pet to being (non-)domesticated in general. Ted being an alligator (and thus not domesticated) does not determine whether Ted is a pet. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- We established Ted is not Brown Swiss cattle. Therefore, “Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle” is false regardless of the pet part. Answer: False.

Question 3:
- Since Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle, the antecedent is false in all models consistent with the premises, so the implication holds vacuously. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
