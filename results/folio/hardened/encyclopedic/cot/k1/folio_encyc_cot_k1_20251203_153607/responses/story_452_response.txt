Story ID: 452
Premises: On January 1, 2006, Wasseiges had a total population of 2,517. All aliens are extraterrestrials.
If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.
No extraterrestrials are human.
All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.
Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let E = “Marvin is from Earth,” M = “Marvin is from Mars,” H = “Marvin is human,” X = “Marvin is extraterrestrial,” A = “Marvin is an alien,” and I = “Marvin is highly intelligent.”
- Given: A → X; M → A; X → ¬H; (I ∧ E) → H; I; (E ∧ M) ∨ (¬E ∧ ¬M); ¬E → X.

1) From (E ∧ M): M → A → X and I ∧ E → H, so we get H and X, contradicting X → ¬H. Hence (E ∧ M) is impossible, so by the disjunction we must have ¬E ∧ ¬M.
2) From ¬E and ¬E → X, we get X, and from X → ¬H, we get ¬H.

Question 1: Is Marvin an alien?
- We have X and ¬M. A → X does not allow X → A. So A is not entailed nor refuted. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Is Marvin neither a human nor from Mars?
- We have ¬H and ¬M. Answer: True.

Question 3: If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human.
- We have ¬M true and ¬H true, so the conditional (¬M → H) is false. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
