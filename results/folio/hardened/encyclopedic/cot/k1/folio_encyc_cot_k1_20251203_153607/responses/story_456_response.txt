Story ID: 456
Premises: The trust was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange in December 2009. Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. 
Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: All professional basketball players (PBP) → can do jump shots (JS) → leap straight into the air (L) → activate leg muscles (A).
- Contrapositives: ¬A → ¬L → ¬JS → ¬PBP.
- Given Yuri does not activate his leg muscles (¬A), we deduce: ¬L, ¬JS, and therefore ¬PBP (Yuri is not a professional basketball player).
- No information links Yuri to being an American national; the existence of some non-American PBPs is irrelevant to Yuri.

Question 1: Whether Yuri is an American national is not determined by the premises. Unknown.

Question 2: Since Yuri is not a professional basketball player, he cannot be an American professional basketball player. True.

Question 3: This asserts Yuri is an American professional basketball player, but we know ¬PBP. False.

Question 4: Antecedent ¬L is true (from ¬A). Consequent “American ∧ PBP” is false (since ¬PBP). True → False makes the implication False.

Question 5: Antecedent “not (American ∧ PBP)” is true (since ¬PBP). Consequent PBP is false. True → False makes the implication False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
4: False
5: False
