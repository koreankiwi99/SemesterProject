Story ID: 459
Premises: Bush to be the U. Jane does not like any animals that bark.
All dogs are animals that bark.
Jane likes all animals that jump.
If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. 
KiKi is an animal.
If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

First, derive properties of KiKi:
- If an animal is terricolous then it has legs; if it has legs then it jumps. 
- Given: If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
  Assume (for contradiction) KiKi neither jumps nor has legs. Then by the given rule, KiKi is terricolous or has legs. With “not legs,” this forces terricolous; but terricolous implies legs, contradicting “not legs.” So the assumption is impossible. Hence KiKi must have jumps or legs; since legs imply jumps, KiKi jumps.

From Jane’s preferences:
- Jane likes all animals that jump; KiKi is an animal and jumps, so Jane likes KiKi.
- Jane does not like any animals that bark; therefore KiKi cannot bark. So KiKi does not bark.

From dogs barking:
- All dogs bark; since KiKi does not bark, KiKi is not a dog.

Now answer the questions:

1) Is KiKi terricolous? We have no information forcing terricolous (it’s consistent either way), so Unknown.

2) Is KiKi a barking dog? Since KiKi does not bark and is not a dog, False.

3) Does KiKi not bark and is he not a dog? Yes, as derived above, True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
