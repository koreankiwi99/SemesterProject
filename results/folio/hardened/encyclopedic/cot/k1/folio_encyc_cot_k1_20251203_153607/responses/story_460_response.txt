Story ID: 460
Premises: Junior Francisco Félix Sánchez (born October 3, 1967) is a Dominican former professional baseball player who played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder from 1989–1994. If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.
If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.
All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.
“Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is a film.
“Hachi: A dog’s Tale”  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience” and “If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages,” we have F(x) -> R(x) -> A(x).
- Given “Hachi is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages,” we conclude A(Hachi) holds in either case.
- From “If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance” we get C(Hachi).
- From “If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance,” by contrapositive (and since Hachi is a film), C(Hachi) implies not E(Hachi). So E(Hachi) is false.
- We have no information about whether Hachi is in the Frozen series.

Question 1:
- From the disjunction, if Hachi is family-friendly animated, then it is rated GA. If instead it is merely appropriate for all ages, we cannot conclude it is rated GA (since A does not imply R). Therefore, we cannot determine R(Hachi).
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement is E(Hachi) or Z(Hachi). We established not E(Hachi). So the statement reduces to Z(Hachi), which is not determined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The statement is (E(Hachi) and Z(Hachi)) or (not E(Hachi) and not Z(Hachi)). Since not E(Hachi), this reduces to not Z(Hachi), which is not determined.
- Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
