Story ID: 467
Premises: George Howard Monks (1853–1933) was an American surgeon who also invented board games. All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.
All monkeys are mammals. 
Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. 
Peter's birds can fly.
All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
Rock is Peter's pet.
Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- From "Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds" and "Rock is Peter's pet," Rock is either a monkey or a bird.
- Nothing forces Rock to be a monkey; it's consistent that Rock is a bird (which would satisfy all premises).
- Therefore, we cannot conclude Rock is a monkey.

Question 2:
- Case 1: If Rock is a bird, then as a Peter's bird he can fly, and as a pet that can fly, he has wings.
- Case 2: If Rock is not a bird, then as a pet he must be a monkey. Monkeys are mammals; pet mammals are animals; pet animals can breathe. Given the disjunction "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe," and since "bird" is false and "cannot breathe" is false, Rock must be able to fly. As a pet that can fly, he has wings.
- In all cases, Rock has wings.

Question 3:
- This is the negation of Question 2’s conclusion; since Rock has wings, "Rock does not have wings" is false.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
