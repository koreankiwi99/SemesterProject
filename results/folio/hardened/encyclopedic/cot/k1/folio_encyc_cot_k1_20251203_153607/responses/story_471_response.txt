Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “Rockie can be spotted near the campus” and “The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels,” Rockie is a rabbit or a squirrel.
- If Rockie were a squirrel, then since squirrels spotted near the campus are skittish and skittish implies not calm, Rockie would not be calm. But Rockie is calm. Hence Rockie is not a squirrel.
- Therefore Rockie is a rabbit. All rabbits spotted near the campus are cute, so Rockie is cute.
- From skittish → not calm and Rockie is calm, Rockie is not skittish.
- Nothing specifies whether Rockie is a turtle.
