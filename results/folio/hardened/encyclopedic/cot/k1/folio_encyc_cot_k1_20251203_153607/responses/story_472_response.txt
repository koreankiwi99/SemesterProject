Story ID: 472
Premises: Wall Street is a street which runs through the Financial District of New York City, which due to many financial centers being located on the street is further a metonym for the Economy of the United States. Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. 
All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
All queen bees are bees.
Harry is a bee.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Given: All queen bees are bees; Harry is a bee.
- There is no rule that all bees are queen bees.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude Harry is a queen bee.
Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- We need: Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee.
- From Harry is a bee, we get he does not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
- From “All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating,” contrapositive gives: if not reproducing that way, then not (animal with backbone). This does not establish that Harry is an invertebrate, especially since we are not given that bees are animals.
- We also have no information that Harry is a queen bee.
- Hence the disjunction is not determined.
Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- Antecedent: (Harry is both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone) or (Harry is neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone).
- From Harry is a bee ⇒ not reproducing male-and-female; by contrapositive of “All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating,” we get: Harry is not an animal with a backbone. So the first disjunct of the antecedent cannot hold; the antecedent reduces to “Harry is not a vertebrate.”
- We cannot determine whether Harry is not a vertebrate from the premises.
- Moreover, there is a model where antecedent is true (e.g., take Harry not vertebrate) and the consequent false (e.g., Harry is an invertebrate), while all premises hold. Thus the implication is not entailed.
Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
