Premises: KTH is ranked 73rd in the world among all universities in the 2024 QS World University Rankings, which is higher than any other university in the Nordic countries. Books contain tons of knowledge.
When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge. 
If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.
Harry read the book “Walden” by Henry Thoreau.

==================================================
Model Response:
