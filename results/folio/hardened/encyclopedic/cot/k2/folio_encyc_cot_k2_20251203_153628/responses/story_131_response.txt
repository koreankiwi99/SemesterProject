Story ID: 131
Premises: (大阪外環状鉄道株式会社, Ōsaka Sotokanjō Tetsudō Kabushiki Kaisha) as a Category-3 railway business under the Railway Business Act of Japan. Centuries ago words were added to many of the melodies and these words provided the names of the tunes as we know them today. Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms.
Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.
The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- ML categories: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement.
- The SOTA text summarization model is trained with ML algorithms.
- Reinforcement learning is not used.
- The ML algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.
- Unsupervised learning does not require labeled data, so it cannot be the algorithm used.
- Therefore, the remaining category that requires labeled data is supervised learning.
- Conclusion: Supervised learning is used.

Question 2:
- Unsupervised learning does not require labeled data.
- The training algorithm for text summarization requires labeled data.
- Therefore, unsupervised learning is not used.
- Conclusion: The statement is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
