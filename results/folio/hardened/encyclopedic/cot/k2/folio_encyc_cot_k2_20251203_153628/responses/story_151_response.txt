Story ID: 151
Premises: Roraima is the least populous state in Brazil, with an estimated population of 631,181 inhabitants as of 2020. It is endemic to Colombia. Barutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.
Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island.
Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands.
Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands. 
If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- We are told explicitly that Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin. There is no information suggesting it is named after any islands, let alone all islands in Antarctica. Therefore the statement in Q1 is false.
- Barutin Cove is on Snow Island; Snow Island is in the South Shetland Islands. We are also told (even if counter to real-world facts) that Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands. This does not let us conclude Barutin Cove is in Antarctica (we lack a chain showing South Shetland Islands is in Antarctica or that Barutin Cove is in Antarctica). Thus we cannot confirm there exists a cove in Antarctica named after a Bulgarian place; it remains unknown.
- Similarly, we cannot conclude Barutin Cove is not in Antarctica; the provided relations are insufficient to establish either inclusion or exclusion. Hence the negation is also unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
