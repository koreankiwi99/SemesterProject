Premises: The breed can also be prone to skin disorders such as the breed-specific condition hyperplastic dermatosis. The complex features a central LED pillar and interactive floor which is prominent next to BAR36. Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Tom will rent a managed building apartment if: (a) he’s allowed to move in with Fluffy, and (b) the security deposit is ≤ $1500.
- The Olive Garden is a managed building, but we don’t know if it allows pets; “Pets are allowed in some managed buildings” doesn’t imply Olive Garden allows them.
- The deposit amount at the Olive Garden is not specified. We only know it can be equal to rent or more in some cases; that’s a possibility, not a certainty for this building.
- The sufficient conditions for Tom renting are not established. Also, the statement is only an “if” (sufficient), not “iff” (necessary).
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. Fluffy is a cat and cats are pets.
- We do not know whether the Olive Garden allows pets; “some managed buildings” does not entail this one does.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- Monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
- The rule: the security deposit can be equal to the monthly rent or more indicates possibilities, not the actual policy for this building.
- Therefore we cannot conclude the deposit at the Olive Garden is $2000 or more; it might be, but it’s not entailed.
- Conclusion: Unknown.
