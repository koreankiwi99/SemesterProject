==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Michael is taller than everyone in his class.
- Peter is taller than Michael.
- By transitivity, Peter is taller than everyone in Michael’s class.
- Therefore, Peter is not shorter than any man in Michael’s class. If there are no men in the class, the existential statement is still false.
Answer: False.

Question 2:
- Michael can block any shooting from a person if the person does not jump when shooting.
- Michael cannot block Windy’s shooting.
- Therefore, Windy must jump when shooting.
- Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.
- Hence, Windy is a great shooter.
Answer: True.

Question 3:
- The only general blocking rule (besides Michael’s special rule) is: if a man is taller than another man, the taller can block the other’s shooting.
- We do not know Windy’s gender or height relative to Peter; we only know Windy jumps when shooting.
- Thus, we cannot determine whether Peter can block Windy’s shooting.
Answer: Unknown.

1: False
