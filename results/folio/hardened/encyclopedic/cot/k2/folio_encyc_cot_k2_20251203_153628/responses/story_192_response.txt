An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
Mike is an international student.
Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa” and “Mike is an international student,” Mike has either F1 or J1.
- The rule given: If an international student has an F1 visa and wants to work, they need to apply for CPT or OPT.
- We are told: “Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.” This is consistent with F1, but the provided information does not state that only F1 students need CPT or that J1 students cannot also need CPT. The implication given is one-way (F1 ⇒ needs CPT/OPT), not biconditional. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Mike is F1 or J1.
