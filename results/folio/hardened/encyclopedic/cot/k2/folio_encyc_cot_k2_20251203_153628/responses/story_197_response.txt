==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Relevant facts:
  - ETS provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
  - Those living in single-parent families or having few resources can prove economic hardship.
  - Tom lives in a single-parent family, has few resources, and is applying to take the GRE.

Question 1:
- Tom is a GRE applicant and can prove economic hardship. However, the condition for aid is that he proves it, not merely that he can prove it. The text does not state that he actually proved hardship. Therefore, we cannot conclude he receives aid.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The text states it costs $205 to take the GRE, which is cheaper than $300. Therefore, it costs below $300.
- Conclusion: True.

Question 3:
- The statement claims no one taking the GRE has financial aid provided by anything. We know ETS provides aid to applicants who prove hardship, but we are not told that any specific test-taker actually receives aid. Without a concrete instance, we cannot declare the universal statement false, nor can we confirm it true.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: Unknown
