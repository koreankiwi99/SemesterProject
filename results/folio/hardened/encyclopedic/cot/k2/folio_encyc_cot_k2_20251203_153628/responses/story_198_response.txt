==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) The text states "Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals," which implies that some animals exist. Therefore, there is at least one animal.
2) The text says "People feel tired when they get the flu," which is a conditional statement and does not assert whether anyone actually gets the flu. So we cannot conclude "No one gets the flu."
3) The text lists Monkeypox symptoms as "fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness." Coughing is not mentioned, and the list may not be exhaustive. We cannot conclude that coughing is included.
