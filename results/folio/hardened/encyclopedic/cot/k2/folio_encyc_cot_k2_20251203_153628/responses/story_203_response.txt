Premises: Smith was a right-handed batsman and played three innings in two first-class matches, making a total of 9 runs.

Plungers suck.
Vacuums suck.
Vampires suck.
Space is a vacuum.
A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. Premises: "Vacuums suck." and "Space is a vacuum." From these, by modus ponens, space sucks. So the statement is true.
2. "Vampires suck." does not imply that anything that sucks is a vampire. We have no statement linking vacuums (or space) to vampires. So we cannot determine; it's unknown.
3. The statement claims all household appliances suck. But "A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck." provides a counterexample. Therefore the universal claim is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
