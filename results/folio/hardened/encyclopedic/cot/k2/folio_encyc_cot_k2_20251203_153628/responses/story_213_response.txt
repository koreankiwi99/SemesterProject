==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Romance languages are a language family.
- All languages within a language family are related to each other.
- French and Spanish are Romance, so the Romance family has multiple members.
- Basque is not related to any other language.
- If Basque were Romance, it would be related to French/Spanish, contradicting the premise.
- Therefore, the statement is false.

Question 2:
- German is related to Spanish, and Spanish is Romance.
- We know: same family implies related, but we are not given that related implies same family.
- Thus, German being related to a Romance language does not entail German is Romance.
- Insufficient information to conclude; it could be either way.
- Therefore, the statement is unknown.

Question 3:
- All Romance languages are Indo-European.
- French is a Romance language.
- Therefore, French is Indo-European.
- The statement is true.

ANSWERS:
