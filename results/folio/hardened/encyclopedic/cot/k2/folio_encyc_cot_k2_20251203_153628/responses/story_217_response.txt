Story ID: 217
Premises: 8-mile-long rail trail in Oakland County, Michigan. The Henry August (or Augustus) Rowland House is a historic row house at 915 Cathedral Street in Baltimore, Maryland. If George likes music, he wants to compose.
If George has access to a program, he can compose.
If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- If George likes music, then he wants to compose.
- If he has access to a program, then he can compose.
- If he can compose and wants to compose, then he will compose.
- Therefore, if he likes music and has access to a program, he both wants and can compose, which implies he will compose. So the statement is true.

Question 2:
- We have: (can compose ∧ wants to compose) -> will compose.
- From not will compose, we can only infer not(can ∧ wants), which means either not can or not wants.
- It does not follow that not will implies not can specifically; he might be able to compose but not want to. Hence the statement cannot be concluded as true or false from the given info. It is unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
