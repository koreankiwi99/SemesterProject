Premises: Aksana Miankova, also transliterated as Oksana Menkova, (Belarusian: Аксана Мянькова, born 28 March 1982) is a Belarusian former hammer thrower. Its length is up to 39 centimetres (15 in). All cats are mammals.
Some pets are not mammals.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "All cats are mammals," every cat belongs to the set of mammals.
- From "Some pets are not mammals," there exists at least one pet that is not a mammal.
- This does not rule out that some other pets could be mammals, and thus could be cats. Nor does it assert that any pet is a cat.
- Therefore, the statement "No pets are cats" is not entailed or contradicted by the premises.
