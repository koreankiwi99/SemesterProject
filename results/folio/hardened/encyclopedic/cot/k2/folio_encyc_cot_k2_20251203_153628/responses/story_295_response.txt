Some love is positive.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Some affection is love," there exists at least one entity that is both affection and love.
- From "Some love is positive," there exists at least one entity that is both love and positive.
- These two existential statements could refer to different instances of love. Therefore, we cannot conclude that there exists an entity that is both affection and positive.
- Hence, the statement "Some affection is positive" is not entailed; it is possible but not guaranteed.
