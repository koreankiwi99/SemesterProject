Premises: Judith Ellen Retchin (born May 24, 1952) is a senior judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. E. If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews.
All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations" and "If listed, then not many negative reviews": R(x) → L(x) → ¬N(x).
- From "All popular among locals have ratings >4": P(x) → R(x).
- Given for Hamden Plaza Subway store: R(H) ∨ P(H). With P(H) → R(H), we conclude R(H). Therefore L(H) and ¬N(H).

Question 1:
- Antecedent: T(H) ∧ N(H). But we have ¬N(H). So the antecedent is false, making the implication true (vacuously).

Question 2:
- T(H) ∨ ¬N(H). Since ¬N(H) is true, the disjunction is true.

Question 3:
- No information determines T(H) or ¬T(H). So this is uncertain.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
