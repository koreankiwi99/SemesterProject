Story ID: 315
Premises: 2926 for restoration. pɔ. If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. 
If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: 
  - If something can transport multiple passengers, then it is not a one-seater.
  - All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers, hence any Tesla Model 3 is not a one-seater.
  - All Solo EV are single-seat electric cars, and all single-seat electric cars are one-seaters. Hence any Solo EV is a one-seater.
  - Therefore, Tesla Model 3 and Solo EV are mutually exclusive categories (one implies not one-seater; the other implies one-seater).
- The conditional about John’s car (“If John’s car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John’s car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car”) is a tautology (A -> A ∨ B) and adds no information about whether John’s car is a Tesla Model 3 or a Solo EV.
- There is no explicit information about what John’s car is, so none of the specific claims about John’s car can be determined.

Question 1: We have no evidence that John’s car is a Tesla Model 3. Unknown.

Question 2: We have no evidence that John’s car is a Solo EV. Unknown.

Question 3: Since we don’t know whether John’s car is a Solo EV, we cannot assert it is not one. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
