Premises: Joppa is now largely residential, but salt was once produced from seawater by evaporation at Joppa Pans. A member of the Sisodia dynasty, he controlled parts of present-day Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Sindh, and Uttar Pradesh with his capital at Chittorgarh. Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.
If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.
Breaking Bad is a show.
Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV” and “If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor,” we know there exists a Monday 8 pm show that is (an episode of) The Bachelor.
- The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people, and all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. Hence, shows that give out roses are reality TV.
- Breaking Bad is a show and is not a reality TV show. Therefore, Breaking Bad does not give out roses and is not the Monday 8 pm rose-giving show.
- We have no information about Breaking Bad’s airing time.
- The statement “If roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm” has a false antecedent (since Breaking Bad does not give out roses), making the implication vacuously true.
