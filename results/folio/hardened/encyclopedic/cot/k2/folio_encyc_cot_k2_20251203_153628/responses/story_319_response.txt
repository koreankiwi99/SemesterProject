==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the rules: Cupcake -> Baked sweet; BBM product -> Cupcake -> Baked sweet; Baked sweet -> not Spicy, so Spicy -> not Baked sweet (contrapositive). Also Not Baked sweet -> Not Cupcake -> Not BBM product (via contrapositives).
- Given: Dried Thai chilies (DTC) are Spicy or Mala hotpots or Not baked sweets. Since Mala hotpot -> Spicy, this reduces to DTC are Spicy or Not baked sweets. In either case, DTC are Not baked sweets (because Spicy -> Not baked sweets).
- Therefore DTC are Not baked sweets, hence Not cupcakes, hence Not BBM products.

Question 1: DTC are BBM products? From above, DTC are Not BBM products. So False.

Question 2: DTC are not BBM products? True (as deduced).

Question 3: DTC are a mala hotpot? The disjunction doesn’t force mala hotpot; Unknown.

Question 4: DTC are neither BBM products nor baked sweets? Both negations hold; True.

Question 5: DTC are cupcakes and BBM products? Both are false; the conjunction is False.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: Unknown
4: True
5: False
