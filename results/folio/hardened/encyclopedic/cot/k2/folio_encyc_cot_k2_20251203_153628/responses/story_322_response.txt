==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Given: All growth stocks -> bought for rapid price appreciation.
- Given: If something is bought for rapid price appreciation -> not suitable for a retirement fund.
- Therefore: All growth stocks -> not suitable for a retirement fund.
- Given: All mature stocks -> suitable for a retirement fund.
- Given: KO is a mature stock -> KO is a stock and KO is suitable for a retirement fund.
- Contraposition steps used:
  - From (growth -> not suitable), we get (suitable -> not growth).
  - From (bought-for-rapid -> not suitable), we get (suitable -> not bought-for-rapid).

Question 1:
- KO is a mature stock, hence KO is a stock. True.

Question 2:
- KO is a stock (True) but, as shown, KO is not a growth stock (since KO is suitable). So “KO is a stock and a growth stock” is False.

Question 3:
- Antecedent: “KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.”
- From suitability, KO is neither a growth stock nor bought for rapid price appreciation, so the antecedent is False.
- A conditional with a false antecedent is True regardless of the consequent. Therefore the statement is True.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: True
