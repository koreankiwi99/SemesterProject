Premises: The terms allopatry and vicariance are often used in biogeography to describe the relationship between organisms whose ranges do not significantly overlap but are immediately adjacent to each other—they do not occur together or only occur within a narrow zone of contact. A Liberal, he was elected again in 1917 and 1921. All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let E(x): engaged, W(x): makes wedding plans, I_o(x): invites others, I_f(x): invites friends, A(x): well-attended wedding, L(x): has a larger family.
- Given:
  - W(x) -> E(x).
  - I_o(x) -> W(x).
  - A(x) -> I_o(x).
  - ∃x (A(x) and L(x)) [not necessarily John].
  - For John: E(J) -> (not I_f(J) and W(J)).
  - For John: L(J) -> (A(J) or I_f(J)).

- From these, for John: E(J) -> W(J) and W(J) -> E(J), so E(J) iff W(J). No premise asserts E(J), W(J), L(J), A(J), I_o(J), or I_f(J) for John.

Question 1: Nothing entails L(J), and models exist where L(J) is true or false. So Unknown.

Question 2: Same reasoning: not(L(J)) is not entailed. Unknown.

Question 3: E(J) is not entailed; it would follow if, e.g., A(J) or I_o(J) or W(J) held, but none are given. Unknown.

Question 4: The conjunction not L(J) and not I_o(J) is not entailed; there are models where it is true and models where it is false (e.g., if A(J) then I_o(J) holds). Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
4: Unknown
