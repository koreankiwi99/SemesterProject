Premises: He was subsequently re-elected in the redistricted Mayo-Tatchun in the 1992 election. Most commonly the more electronegative atom keeps the pair of electrons becoming anionic while the more electropositive atom becomes cationic. No digital media are analog.
Every printed text is analog media.
All streaming services are digital media.

If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- From premises: Hardcover → Printed, and (If 1984 is Streaming) → Hardcover. Thus, if 1984 were streaming, it would be printed.
- However, we do not have any premise that asserts 1984 is streaming or hardcover outright.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude 1984 is printed. Status: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Assume 1984 is a streaming service. Then:
  - Streaming → Digital (all streaming services are digital).
  - Digital → not Analog (no digital media are analog).
  - Also, Streaming → Hardcover (given), and Hardcover → Printed, and Printed → Analog.
  - Thus, Streaming implies both Analog and not Analog, a contradiction.
- Therefore, 1984 is not a streaming service. The statement "1984 is a streaming service" is False.

Question 3:
- From the reasoning in Question 2, we derived not Streaming(1984).
- Therefore, "1984 is not a streaming service" is True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
