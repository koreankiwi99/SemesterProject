Story ID: 350
Premises: S. However, due to the Greco-Turkish War during that period and the political instability that followed it soon became evident that the large telescope for the observatory would not materialise. All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- The premises only give conditional statements about items Max adores (styles or designs). They do not assert that any design by Max exists, nor that any particular property (brutalist, evocative, dreamy) applies to any existing design by Max.
- From “If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative” together with “No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries,” we can infer that no design by Max that he adores can have interesting geometries. This still does not establish the existence of any design by Max, nor that any is brutalist, evocative, or dreamy.

Question 1: “A design by Max is a brutalist building.”
- There is no existential guarantee of any design by Max being brutalist (or existing). Unknown.

Question 2: “A design by Max is evocative and dreamy.”
- Only adored Kelly Wearstler styles are guaranteed evocative and dreamy, but there’s no existence claim tying this to a design by Max. Unknown.

Question 3: “A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy.”
- Same issue: no existential guarantee. Unknown.
