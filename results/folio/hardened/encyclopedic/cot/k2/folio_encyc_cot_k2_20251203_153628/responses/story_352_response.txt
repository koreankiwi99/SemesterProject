==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the universal rules: private company → company → business organization → legal entity. Legal entity → created under law and legal obligations.
- Specific to H: If H is created under law, then H is not a private company.
- Therefore, if H were a private company, then it would be a legal entity and hence created under law, which would imply it is not a private company. So private company(H) → not private company(H), which entails that H is not a private company.

Question 1:
- To conclude H has legal obligations, it would suffice to know H is a legal entity. We have no information that H is a legal entity (or otherwise has legal obligations). Thus this cannot be determined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement requires both “has legal obligations” and “is a private company.” We have deduced H is not a private company. Hence the conjunction is false.
- Answer: False.

Question 3:
- If H is a private company, then by the chain above H is a legal entity, which implies both legal obligations and created under law. Therefore, if H is a private company, then it has legal obligations or is created under law.
- Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
