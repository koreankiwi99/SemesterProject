Premises: The party put forward 142 candidates for the 52 seats in the National Assembly. In 2023, it was the 212th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.
All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.
All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let S = eats salads regularly, C = very conscious about health/eating habits, H = grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, N = fulfills daily nutritional intakes, D = disregards physical well-being, G = visits the gym at least once a day.
- Given: S -> C; H -> S; N -> H; D -> ¬C; G -> N.
- For Taylor: (H ∧ D) ∨ (¬H ∧ ¬D).
- If H ∧ D held, then H -> S -> C and D -> ¬C, yielding C ∧ ¬C, a contradiction. So the first disjunct is impossible, hence Taylor satisfies ¬H ∧ ¬D.

Question 1:
- From ¬H we cannot infer ¬S (we only have H -> S, not its converse). No other rule determines S. Therefore unknown.

Question 2:
- From ¬H and N -> H, by contrapositive ¬H -> ¬N. From ¬N and G -> N, by contrapositive ¬N -> ¬G. Hence Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day. Therefore false.

Question 3:
- We have ¬H and, as shown above, ¬G. So the statement that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day is true.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
