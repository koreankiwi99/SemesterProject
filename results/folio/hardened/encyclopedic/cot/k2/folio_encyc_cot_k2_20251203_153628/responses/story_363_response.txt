Story ID: 363
Premises: It is also known by its product code FR9. p. All hydrocarbons are organic compounds .
All alkanes are hydrocarbons
All organic compounds are chemical compounds.
All organic compounds contain carbon.
No chemical compounds contain only one element.
The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “No chemical compounds contain only one element” and “The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither,” the first option (both) is impossible. Therefore, the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor contains only one element.
- Contrapositives:
  - From “All organic compounds are chemical compounds,” not chemical compound ⇒ not organic.
  - From “All hydrocarbons are organic compounds,” not organic ⇒ not hydrocarbon.
  - From “All alkanes are hydrocarbons,” not hydrocarbon ⇒ not alkane.
- “All organic compounds contain carbon” does not imply that non-organic things lack carbon; thus, whether the mixture contains carbon is undetermined.

Question 1: We have no rule determining carbon content for non-organic/non-compound items. So Unknown.

Question 2: The mixture is not an alkane; hence “alkane and contains carbon” is false regardless of carbon. So False.

Question 3: The consequent (“neither a chemical compound nor an alkane”) is true as deduced, making the implication true regardless of the antecedent. So True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True

Questions and Results:
==================================================
Q1: The mixture contains carbon.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: The mixture is an alkane and contains carbon.
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes

Q3: If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane.
