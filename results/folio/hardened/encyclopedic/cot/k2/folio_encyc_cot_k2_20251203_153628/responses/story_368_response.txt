Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Facts and rules: At(Hannah). W(Hannah). If At ∧ W then N. If At then (O ∨ E). If At ∧ E then ¬P and S. Also: If N then (¬P ∧ ¬N).
- From At and W and (At ∧ W -> N), we get N(Hannah).
- From N(Hannah) and (N -> ¬P ∧ ¬N), we get ¬P(Hannah) and ¬N(Hannah). So we have both N and ¬N, creating a contradiction about N.

Question 1:
- We derived both N(Hannah) and ¬N(Hannah). Therefore, whether she needs to earn money is not determinable. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Need At ∧ ¬P ∧ S. We have At and ¬P (from N -> ¬P and the earlier derivation of N). But S requires E (since At ∧ E -> S), and we only know O ∨ E, not E itself. So S is not entailed nor refuted. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- Need At ∧ [¬P ∨ (P -> S)]. At is true. ¬P is derivable as above, so the disjunction holds. Hence the whole statement holds. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: True
