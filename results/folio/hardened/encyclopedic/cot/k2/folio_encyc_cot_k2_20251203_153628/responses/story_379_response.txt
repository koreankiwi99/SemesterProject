Story ID: 379
Premises: Shanker Adhikari is the chairman of the union. It was also reported from Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.
If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.
If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. 
Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers

Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- Rules:
  - If someone is born in a multiple birth (M), then they spend a lot of time with siblings (S).
  - If someone complains about annoying siblings (C), then they have siblings born together ⇒ they were born in a multiple birth (C -> M).
  - If someone spends a lot of time with siblings (S), then they live at home (H), and if they live at home (H), then they do not live with strangers (¬Str).
  - Thus: M -> S -> H -> ¬Str, and C -> M -> S -> H -> ¬Str.

- Luke’s disjunction: either (Baby∧M ∧ Str) or (¬(Baby∧M) ∧ ¬Str).
  - The first branch (Baby∧M ∧ Str) implies M, hence S, hence ¬Str, which contradicts Str. So the first branch is impossible.
  - Therefore the second branch must hold: ¬(Baby∧M) and ¬Str. This only tells us ¬Str and not(Baby∧M); it does not determine M or S or C.

Question 1: Does Luke spend a lot of time with his siblings (S)?
- We know ¬Str, but there is no rule ¬Str -> S. Also ¬(Baby∧M) does not imply ¬M. So S cannot be determined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Does Luke complain often about annoying siblings (C)?
- C would imply ¬Str, which is consistent with what we know, but we cannot infer C from ¬Str. Both C and ¬C remain possible.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 3: Is Luke neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often (¬M ∧ ¬C)?
- We cannot deduce ¬M (since ¬(Baby∧M) allows M if not a baby), nor can we deduce ¬C. So the conjunction cannot be established.
- Answer: Unknown.

1: Unknown
