Story ID: 380
Premises: Matthew Gray (born 24 June 1973) is an Australian archer. Władysław III of Poland may refer to:

Władysław III of Poland (1424-1444), also known as Władysław III of Varna, King of Poland
Władysław III Spindleshanks (1165?-1231), High Duke of Poland. People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. 
Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

Set up predicates for club members:
- P: performs in school talent shows often
- G: attends and is very engaged with school events
- S: student who attends the school
- I: inactive and disinterested community member
- C: chaperones high school dances
- Y: young child or teenager
- W: wishes to further academic career/educational opportunities

Given rules (for people in this club):
1) P -> G
2) P ∨ I
3) C -> ¬S
4) I -> C (so I -> ¬S)
5) (Y ∧ W) -> S
6) For Bonnie: (G ∧ S) ∨ (¬G ∧ ¬S), i.e., S ↔ G

From these, Bonnie has two consistent cases:
- Case A: G ∧ S. Then I is false (else I -> ¬S), so by (2) P is true. Also C is false (since C -> ¬S). Y and W are unconstrained.
- Case B: ¬G ∧ ¬S. Then P is false (else P -> G), so by (2) I is true, hence C is true. Also Y ∧ W must be false (else (5) would force S).

Question 1: Is “Bonnie performs in school talent shows often” true?
- Case A: P true. Case B: P false. Not determined uniquely. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Antecedent: “either (Y ∧ W ∧ C) or not (Y ∧ W)” which is equivalent to C ∨ ¬(Y ∧ W). Consequent: S ∨ I.
- Case A: C is false, so antecedent is ¬(Y ∧ W) (could be true or false). If true, consequent S ∨ I is true (S true). If false, conditional is vacuously true.
- Case B: Y ∧ W is false, so antecedent true; consequent S ∨ I is true (I true).
Thus the conditional holds in all models. Answer: True.

Question 3: Antecedent: “either C or, if not C, then P” simplifies to C ∨ P. By (2) and I -> C, for Bonnie either P or C holds in all models, so the antecedent is always true (Case A: P true; Case B: C true). Consequent: (Y ∧ W) ∧ I.
- Case A: I is false, so the consequent is false. Since the antecedent is true here, the conditional is false in at least one consistent model. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False

Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
