Story ID: 385
Premises: Matthew Gray (born 24 June 1973) is an Australian archer. By placing the wood into water, the moisture and heat from the bending iron will reform the structure of the wood, reorganizing the fibers of the wood to prevent the wood from springing back to its original state. If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. 
Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022" and "All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male," Coco is female or male.
- Case analysis:
  - If female: then she lost to Iga Świątek; hence ranked highly; hence among the most active players in major tennis; thus by the conditional, she is not male.
  - If male: then she lost to Rafael Nadal; by the conditional, she is not male.
- Therefore, in all cases, Coco is not male. Using "female or male" and "not male," we conclude she is female.
- As female at Roland Garros 2022, she lost to Iga Świątek; hence ranked highly; hence among the most active players in major tennis.

Question 1: From above, Coco is among the most active players in major tennis. True.

Question 2: We only know all male players lost to Nadal. Since Coco is not male (and we have no rule that only males lost to Nadal), whether she lost to Nadal is not determined. Unknown.

Question 3: We established Coco both lost to Iga Świątek and is among the most active players in major tennis. So the statement that she is not both is false. False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
