Story ID: 386
Premises: From 1980 to 1988, Stewart wrote two books about Merlin, translating and exploring medieval texts on the topic (now published in one volume as Merlin: the Prophetic Vision and Mystic Life, by Penguin Arkana). Inspired by Fascist Italy and Vichy France, the group attracted support from many young nationalists during the Algerian war (1954–62), especially in the French colonial army. If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given facts:
- Deadly disease -> Low survival.
- Severe cancer -> Deadly disease -> Low survival.
- Bile duct cancer -> Severe cancer -> Low survival.
- Cholangiocarcinoma -> Bile duct cancer -> Low survival.
- Mild flu -> Low survival.
- Not (Colorectal is bile duct cancer AND colorectal has low survival).

From Bile duct -> Low survival and Not (Bile duct ∧ Low survival), we deduce colorectal is not bile duct cancer. From Cholangiocarcinoma -> Bile duct, we also deduce colorectal is not Cholangiocarcinoma.

Question 1:
We have no information linking colorectal cancer to severe cancer except via bile duct cancer, which we know it is not. So we cannot conclude it is severe. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
Antecedent: colorectal is bile duct cancer or Cholangiocarcinoma. Both disjuncts are false, so the antecedent is false; hence the conditional is vacuously true. Answer: True.

Question 3:
The statement is (Cholangiocarcinoma and mild flu) or bile duct cancer (or all of the above). Since Cholangiocarcinoma implies bile duct cancer, this reduces to “bile duct cancer.” We established colorectal is not bile duct cancer, so the statement is false. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
