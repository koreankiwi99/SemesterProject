Story ID: 426
Premises: pɔ. No pursuit was attempted because Wellesley was superseded by Sir Harry Burrard and then Sir Hew Dalrymple (one having arrived during the battle, the second soon after). All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. 
Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. 
Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. 
No managers work remotely from home. 
James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Let:
- Lc = James has lunch in the company building.
- H = James has lunch at home.
- R = James works remotely from home.
- M = James is a manager.
- C = James is in other countries.
- A = James appears in the company today.

Given:
- Lc -> schedules -> goes to company building -> A.
- A iff M.
- H -> R.
- C -> R.
- No managers work remotely: M -> ¬R, hence by contrapositive R -> ¬M.
- From H -> R, contrapositive gives ¬R -> ¬H.
- Lunch is either in the building or at home (exclusive), so exactly one of Lc, H holds.

From these:
- Lc -> A -> M, so Lc -> M.
- M -> ¬R -> ¬H, and by exclusivity of lunch locations, ¬H -> Lc. Thus M -> Lc.
- Therefore Lc iff M. Also, if ¬M then ¬A, hence ¬Lc (since Lc -> A), so H is true and R is true. So two consistent branches remain:
  - M true: Lc true, H false, R false, C false.
  - M false: Lc false, H true, R true, and C may be either true or false (if C true, still consistent).

Question 1: Is “James has lunch in the company” true?
- Since Lc iff M and we do not know whether M holds, Lc is undetermined.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Is “James does not have lunch in the company” true?
- As above, since Lc is undetermined, its negation is also undetermined.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 3: The statement is the conjunction of:
- (M or C) -> not (H or R), and
- (H or R) -> (not M and not C).

Note H or R is equivalent to R (because H -> R and ¬R -> ¬H).
So these become:
- (M or C) -> ¬R, and
- R -> (¬M ∧ ¬C).

We know M -> ¬R, but C -> R, so if C is true then the first implication fails. Since C can be true in a model consistent with the premises (non-manager, remote), the overall statement is not entailed. In other models (e.g., M true, C false; or M false, C false) the statement holds. Hence its truth is undetermined.
Answer: Unknown.

1: Unknown

Q1: James has lunch in the company.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: James does not have lunch in the company.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q3: If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home. If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries. [contrapositive is more natural]
