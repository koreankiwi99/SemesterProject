Story ID: 435
Premises: The Blues EP is the second recording by Some Girls. It breeds in Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands and Japan; it winters in south toward the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, Hainan and the northern Philippines. None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department. 
All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. 
All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department. 
All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. 
All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.
James is a student working in the lab. 
James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “James is a student working in the lab” and the rules: Lab → Class with David → Database → Computer Science. So James takes the database course.
- From “James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university,” read as “neither works in the lab nor has a university-offered part-time job,” we get that James does not have such a part-time job. This conflicts with “James is working in the lab,” but the part-time job negation still stands and there is no statement asserting he does have one.
- Therefore:
  - Q1 (James has a part-time job): contradicted by the explicit negation → False.
  - Q2 (James does not have a part-time job): explicitly stated → True.
  - Q3 (James either takes the database course or has a part-time job): database course is true, so the disjunction is true → True.
  - Q4 (James takes the database course): follows from Lab → David → Database → True.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
4: True
