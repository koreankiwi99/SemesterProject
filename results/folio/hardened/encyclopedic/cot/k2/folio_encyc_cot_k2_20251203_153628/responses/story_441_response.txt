Some grumpy people are mean to animals.

Tom is a pet owner.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From: All pet owners love animals; All animal lovers are nice to animals; No one nice to animals is also mean to animals; and Tom is a pet owner.
- Therefore: Tom loves animals (is an animal lover) → Tom is nice to animals → Tom is not mean to animals.

Question 1:
- Nothing relates grumpiness directly to being a pet owner, animal lover, or nice (except that some grumpy people are mean, not all).
- We cannot deduce whether Tom is grumpy.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Since Tom is not mean to animals, he cannot be both grumpy and mean.
- Answer: True.

Question 3:
- Antecedent: “Tom is not both grumpy and mean” is true (Tom is not mean).
- Consequent: “Tom is neither grumpy nor an animal lover” is false because Tom is an animal lover.
- A true antecedent and false consequent makes the conditional false.
- Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
