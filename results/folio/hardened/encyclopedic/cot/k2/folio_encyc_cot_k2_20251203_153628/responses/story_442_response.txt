==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given facts:
- All Brown Swiss cattle are cows. So B(x) → C(x).
- All cows are domesticated animals. So C(x) → D(x).
- Therefore, all Brown Swiss cattle are domesticated. So B(x) → D(x).
- Alligators are not domesticated animals. So A(x) → ¬D(x).
- Ted is an alligator. So A(Ted), hence ¬D(Ted).
- From B(x) → D(x) and ¬D(Ted), we get ¬B(Ted).

Question 1:
We have no rule relating being a pet to domestication. The fact that some pets are Brown Swiss cattle doesn’t imply anything about Ted. Thus whether Ted is a pet is not determined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
The statement asserts Ted is both a pet and Brown Swiss cattle. We have deduced ¬B(Ted). Therefore the conjunction is false. Answer: False.

Question 3:
If Ted is Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet. Since ¬B(Ted), the antecedent is false, making the implication true (vacuously). Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
