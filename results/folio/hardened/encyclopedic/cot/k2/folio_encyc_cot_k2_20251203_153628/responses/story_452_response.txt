Story ID: 452
Premises: On January 1, 2006, Wasseiges had a total population of 2,517. The Bloodstone Lands is a module for the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for the 2nd edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. All aliens are extraterrestrials.
If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.
No extraterrestrials are human.
All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.
Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.

Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- Let E = Marvin is from Earth; M = Marvin is from Mars; A = Marvin is an alien; X = Marvin is an extraterrestrial; H = Marvin is human; I = Marvin is highly intelligent.

- Given: A -> X; M -> A; X -> ¬H; (I ∧ E) -> H; I; (E ∧ M) ∨ (¬E ∧ ¬M); ¬E -> X.

- Consider the first disjunct E ∧ M:
  - From M -> A -> X -> ¬H.
  - From I ∧ E and I true, we get H.
  - Contradiction (H and ¬H). So E ∧ M is impossible.

- Therefore, by the given (E ∧ M) ∨ (¬E ∧ ¬M), we must have ¬E ∧ ¬M.

- From ¬E and ¬E -> X, we get X. From X -> ¬H, we get ¬H.

Question 1: Is Marvin an alien?
- We have M false, so cannot use M -> A. We have X true, but only A -> X is given, not X -> A. So A is not determined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Is Marvin neither a human nor from Mars?
- We derived ¬H and ¬M.
- Answer: True.

Question 3: If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human?
- Antecedent ¬M is true; consequent H is false. So the implication is false.
- Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
