Story ID: 456
Premises: The trust was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange in December 2009. Jean Lemire crossed the Atlantic Ocean between 1650 and 1653. Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. 
Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let P(x) = x is a professional basketball player; A(x) = x is an American national; J(x) = x can do jump shots; L(x) = x leaps straight into the air; M(x) = x activates leg muscles.
- Given: P -> J; J -> L; L -> M. Yuri: ¬M.
- By contrapositive chaining: ¬M -> ¬L -> ¬J -> ¬P. So Yuri is not a professional basketball player.

Question 1: No information about Yuri’s nationality. Unknown.

Question 2: “Yuri is not an American professional basketball player” means ¬(A ∧ P). Since ¬P, this is true. True.

Question 3: Claims A ∧ P. Since ¬P, this is false. False.

Question 4: If ¬L then A ∧ P. We have ¬L (from ¬M). But ¬P, so the consequent A ∧ P is false. True antecedent, false consequent → False.

Question 5: If ¬(A ∧ P) then P. Antecedent true (since ¬P implies ¬(A ∧ P)), consequent false (¬P). True antecedent, false consequent → False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
4: False
5: False
