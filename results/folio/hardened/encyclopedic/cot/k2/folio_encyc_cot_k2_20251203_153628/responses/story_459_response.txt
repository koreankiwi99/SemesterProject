Story ID: 459
Premises: Bush to be the U. It is critically acclaimed and regarded by many as their best work. Jane does not like any animals that bark.
All dogs are animals that bark.
Jane likes all animals that jump.
If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. 
KiKi is an animal.
If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From If an animal has legs, then it jumps and If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs, and the special rule If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs:
  Assume KiKi does not jump. Then by contrapositive of (legs -> jumps), KiKi does not have legs. Then the special rule’s antecedent holds, yielding terricolous or has legs. With not having legs, this reduces to terricolous. But terricolous implies has legs, contradicting not having legs. Hence the assumption is false; KiKi does jump. This does not tell us whether KiKi is terricolous.

- Since KiKi is an animal that jumps, Jane likes KiKi (Jane likes all animals that jump). Jane does not like any animals that bark means (Animal ∧ Barks) -> ¬Likes; by contrapositive, Likes -> ¬(Animal ∧ Barks). Given KiKi is an animal and Jane likes KiKi, KiKi does not bark.

- All dogs are animals that bark implies dogs bark. Since KiKi does not bark, KiKi is not a dog.
