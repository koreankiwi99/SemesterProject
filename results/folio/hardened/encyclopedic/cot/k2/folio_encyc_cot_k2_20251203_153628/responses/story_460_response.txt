If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Let:
  - AA(x): appropriate for all ages
  - K(x): children can watch without guidance
  - GA(x): rated General Audience
  - E(x): contains excessive erotic and violent content
  - FFA(x): family-friendly animated
  - Fr(x): in the Frozen series

- Rules:
  1) AA → K
  2) E → ¬K (contrapositive: K → ¬E)
  3) GA → AA
  4) FFA → GA
  5) Fr → FFA

- Facts:
  - Hachi is a film.
  - Hachi is FFA or AA.

From “FFA or AA”:
- If FFA, then GA (by 4), then AA (by 3), then K (by 1).
- If AA, then K (by 1).
Thus, in any case, K(Hachi) holds. By contrapositive of 2, K → ¬E, so ¬E(Hachi). We have no information about Fr(Hachi).

Question 1:
- GA(Hachi)? If FFA, yes; if only AA, not necessarily. Therefore Unknown.

Question 2:
- E(Hachi) or Fr(Hachi)? We have ¬E(Hachi); Fr(Hachi) is unknown. Therefore Unknown.

Question 3:
- (E ∧ Fr) ∨ (¬E ∧ ¬Fr). Since ¬E is true and Fr is unknown, this disjunction is Unknown (true if ¬Fr, false if Fr).

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
