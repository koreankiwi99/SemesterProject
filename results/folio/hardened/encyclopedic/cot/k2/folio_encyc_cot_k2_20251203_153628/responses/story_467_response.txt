Premises: George Howard Monks (1853–1933) was an American surgeon who also invented board games. Montepuez is the second largest city in the province of Cabo Delgado in Mozambique, after the provincial capital of Pemba. All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.
All monkeys are mammals. 
Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. 
Peter's birds can fly.
All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
Rock is Peter's pet.
Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Rock is Peter's pet. Every Peter’s pet is either a monkey or a bird. All monkeys are mammals; any Peter’s pet that is a mammal is an animal; any Peter’s pet that is an animal can breathe. Thus any Peter’s pet that is a monkey must breathe.
- Peter’s birds can fly, and any Peter’s pet that can fly has wings.
- We also know: Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.

Key deduction about wings:
- Suppose Rock neither flies nor is a bird. Then the disjunction forces “Rock cannot breathe.” But if Rock is not a bird and is a Peter’s pet, then he must be a monkey (by the either/or), hence a mammal, hence an animal, hence can breathe—contradiction. Therefore, Rock must either fly or be a bird. In either case (bird implies fly), Rock can fly, and thus Rock has wings.

Question 1: Rock is a monkey.
- From “pet -> (monkey or bird),” Rock could be a bird (and need not be a monkey). Nothing forces him to be a monkey. So this is not entailed.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Rock has wings.
- As shown above, Rock must fly; any flying Peter’s pet has wings.
Answer: True.

Question 3: Rock does not have wings.
- This contradicts the conclusion that Rock has wings.
Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
