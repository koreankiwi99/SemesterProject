Story ID: 471
Premises: With no fish passage facilities, the dam blocked passage of anadromous Pacific Salmon from the upper 50+ miles of the Elwha watershed located within Olympic National Park. His state mainly comprised the town of Radhanpur in Gujarat with some adjoining areas. All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. 
Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. 
The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Premises:
  - All spotted rabbits are cute.
  - Some turtles are spotted near the campus (existence).
  - If an animal can be spotted near the campus, then it is a rabbit or a squirrel.
  - Skittish -> not calm.
  - All spotted squirrels are skittish.
  - Rockie is spotted and calm.

- From Rockie is calm and skittish -> not calm, we infer Rockie is not skittish.
- If Rockie were a squirrel (and is spotted), then Rockie would be skittish; contradiction. So Rockie is not a squirrel.
- Whether Rockie is a turtle is not determined. Whether Rockie is a rabbit (and thus cute) depends on whether Rockie is an animal; that is not given. Rockie could be a non-animal object that is spotted and calm.

Question 1: Rockie is a turtle.
- Not determined by the premises; existence of some spotted turtles does not entail Rockie is one.
Answer: Unknown

Question 2: Rockie is not a turtle.
- Also not determined; consistent models allow Rockie to be a turtle (e.g., also a rabbit) or not.
Answer: Unknown

Question 3: Rockie is a turtle or cute.
- Could be false in a consistent model where Rockie is a non-animal, hence neither turtle nor (guaranteed) cute. Not entailed true nor false.
Answer: Unknown

Question 4: If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish.
- Antecedent is true (Rockie is not a squirrel). Consequent reduces to “Rockie is cute” since Rockie is not skittish; that is undetermined. Hence the implication is not determined.
Answer: Unknown

Question 5: If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.
- There is a consistent model where Rockie is a cute, calm rabbit (not a turtle, not skittish), making the implication false there; but other models make it vacuously true. So not determined.
