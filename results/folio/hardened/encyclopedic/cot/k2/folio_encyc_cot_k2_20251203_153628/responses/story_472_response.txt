Story ID: 472
Premises: Wall Street is a street which runs through the Financial District of New York City, which due to many financial centers being located on the street is further a metonym for the Economy of the United States. The Howden Insurance Mile is a New Zealand Thoroughbred horse race run at Hastings Racecourse in Hawke's Bay. Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. 
All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
All queen bees are bees.
Harry is a bee.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Given: All queen bees are bees; Harry is a bee.
- This only gives that queen bee implies bee, not that bee implies queen bee.
- Therefore we cannot conclude whether Harry is a queen bee.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- From: All animals with backbones -> reproduce by male-and-female mating.
- From: Bees -> not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
- By contraposition, not reproduce by male-and-female mating -> not (animal with a backbone). So Harry is not an animal with a backbone.
- From: All vertebrates have a backbone; by contraposition, not backbone -> not vertebrate. So Harry is not a vertebrate.
- None of this implies Harry is an invertebrate (we lack that Harry is an animal), and we still don’t know if he is a queen bee.
- The disjunction “invertebrate or queen bee” is not entailed nor contradicted.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- As above, Harry is not an animal with a backbone and not a vertebrate, so the antecedent “either both vertebrate and with a backbone, or neither” holds (the “neither” case).
- The consequent “neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee” is not supported: we cannot infer not-invertebrate (we don’t even know Harry is an animal) nor not-queen.
- Hence the implication is not entailed; it can be false in a model where Harry is a queen bee.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
