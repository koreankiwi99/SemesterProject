When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge. 
If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.
Harry read the book “Walden” by Henry Thoreau.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

1) Walden is explicitly called “the book ‘Walden’.” Given “Books contain tons of knowledge,” any book contains knowledge. Therefore, Walden contains knowledge. Conclusion: True.

2) Harry read the book Walden. From “When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge,” Harry gains knowledge. From “If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter,” Harry becomes smarter than he was before reading. Conclusion: True.

3) We are given only that gaining knowledge implies becoming smarter. The converse (“if someone is smarter, then they have gained knowledge”) is not entailed. So we cannot conclude it. Conclusion: Unknown.
