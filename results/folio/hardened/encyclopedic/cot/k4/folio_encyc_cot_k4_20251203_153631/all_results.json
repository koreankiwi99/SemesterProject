Since A is not ruled out, this implication is not entailed.\n- Second implication: (LH \u2228 R) -> (\u00acM \u2227 \u00acA). From R -> \u00acM we get \u00acM, but we cannot infer \u00acA from R (indeed A -> R). So this implication also can fail (e.g., if A is true).\n- Because A is unconstrained, the combined statement is not determined by the premises. Therefore Unknown.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: Unknown\n3: Unknown",

    "model_response": "First, derive immediate consequences:\n- Rockie can be spotted near the campus and is calm.\n- From \u201cIf something is skittish, then it is not calm,\u201d we get that calm implies not skittish. So Rockie is not skittish.\n- All squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish. Since Rockie is spotted and not skittish, Rockie is not a squirrel.\n- Nothing states Rockie is an animal, so the \u201conly animals spotted are rabbits and squirrels\u201d statement does not by itself classify Rockie.\n\nQuestion 1:\nWe have no information tying Rockie to being a turtle. Not provable true or false. Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\nWe also cannot conclude Rockie is not a turtle. Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\u201cRockie is a turtle or cute.\u201d Neither disjunct is established. It\u2019s possible Rockie is neither. Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 4:\nAntecedent \u201cRockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel\u201d holds because Rockie is not a squirrel. The consequent \u201ccute or skittish\u201d is not known: skittish is false and cute is unknown. The conditional\u2019s truth is therefore undetermined. Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 5:\nIf Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle. Since calm implies not skittish, whenever the antecedent holds, the consequent would be false; but we don\u2019t know if the antecedent (cute) holds. So the overall conditional cannot be determined from the information. Answer: Unknown.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: Unknown\n3: Unknown\n4: Unknown\n5: Unknown",

Using M(Hannah), we infer \u00acP(Hannah) and \u00acM(Hannah).\n- Thus we have both M(Hannah) and \u00acM(Hannah): a contradiction about whether she needs money. However, we do get \u00acP(Hannah).\n- We cannot derive that Hannah enjoys dining hall meals (E) or that she spends a lot of time in dining halls (D), since S -> (T \u2228 E) does not let us conclude E, and D only follows from E.\n\nQuestion 1:\n- We derived both M and \u00acM. Therefore it is not determinately true or false whether she needs money. Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- S(Hannah) is true and \u00acP(Hannah) is true, but D(Hannah) is not derivable (nor is its negation). The full conjunction S \u2227 \u00acP \u2227 D is therefore not established. Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- S(Hannah) is true. The disjunction \"not picky or (if picky then D)\" is satisfied by \u00acP(Hannah), which we have. Hence the whole statement is true. Answer: True.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: Unknown\n3: True",

    "model_response": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n- From the rules: spilling implies not tidy (S -> \u00acT), and being cleanly implies tidy (C -> T).\n- If Peter were in the first disjunct (S \u2227 C), he would be both tidy and not tidy, a contradiction. So that disjunct is impossible.\n- Therefore, Peter must be in the second disjunct: \u00acS \u2227 \u00acC (he does not spill and is not cleanly).\n\nQuestion 1:\n- From \u00acS and \u00acC, no rule determines T(P). S -> \u00acT doesn\u2019t apply (since \u00acS), and C -> T doesn\u2019t apply (since \u00acC). So whether Peter is notably tidy is undetermined.\n- Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- All clumsy foodies who go out frequently (CF) spill: CF -> S. From \u00acS, by contrapositive, \u00acCF.\n- If family prioritizes order (F), then values order (V), then cleanly (C); so F -> C. From \u00acC, by contrapositive, \u00acF.\n- Thus both disjuncts (CF or F) are false; the OR statement is false.\n- Answer: False.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- We have \u00acCF and \u00acF. The statement is (CF \u2227 F) \u2228 (\u00acCF \u2227 \u00acF), which evaluates to false \u2228 true = true.\n- Answer: True.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: False\n3: True",

There is no premise that he does or does not have a larger family. Therefore, cannot conclude.\nAnswer: Unknown\n\nQuestion 2: \u201cJohn does not have a larger family.\u201d\n- No premise rules out John having a larger family.

None of these are established for John.

So (\u00acJ \u2227 \u00acL) \u2192 L. But the antecedent includes \u00acL, yielding a contradiction; thus \u00ac(\u00acJ \u2227 \u00acL), i.e., J \u2228 L.\n- From: If an animal has legs then it jumps (L \u2192 J) and KiKi is an animal, J \u2228 L entails J. Therefore, KiKi jumps.\n\nQuestion 1:\n- We only know KiKi jumps; jumping does not imply terricolous. No rule gives T from J. So this cannot be determined.\n- Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- \u201cBarking dog\u201d amounts to being a dog (since all dogs bark). We have no information that KiKi is a dog. So this cannot be determined.\n- Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- We cannot conclude that KiKi does not bark, nor that KiKi is not a dog, from the given information. So the conjunction cannot be determined.\n- Answer: Unknown.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: Unknown\n3: Unknown",

    "model_response": "Reasoning:\n- From the context: \"Ailton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\" Therefore, \"Ailton\" refers to Ailton Silva.\n- \"Ailton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\" and \"N\u00e1utico is a football club along with Braga.\" So Braga is a football club.\n- \"Ailton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for N\u00e1utico.\" So he is Brazilian and plays for the football club N\u00e1utico.\n- \"Fluminense is a football club.\" No link stated between Ailton Silva and Fluminense.\n\nQuestion 1: Since Ailton Silva is Brazilian and plays for N\u00e1utico, the claim that no one playing for N\u00e1utico is Brazilian is contradicted. False.\n\nQuestion 2: He plays for N\u00e1utico, a football club, so the statement that he does not play for a football club is false. False.\n\nQuestion 3: He was loaned out to Braga, which is a football club, so the statement that he was not loaned out to a football club is false. False.\n\nQuestion 4: There is no information that he played for Fluminense; only that Fluminense is a football club.
