- The text says the Picuris Mountains are in “New Mexico or Texas,” that Juan de Oñate visited the Picuris Mountains, and that the Harding Pegmatite Mine located in the Picuris Mountains was donated. It also states there are no mountain ranges in Texas that have donated mines.
- Since the Picuris Mountains contain a donated mine, they cannot be in Texas. Therefore, they must be in New Mexico.
- Thus, Oñate visited a mountain range in New Mexico, not Texas.
