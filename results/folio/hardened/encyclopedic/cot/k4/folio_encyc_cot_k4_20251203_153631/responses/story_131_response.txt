Premises: (大阪外環状鉄道株式会社, Ōsaka Sotokanjō Tetsudō Kabushiki Kaisha) as a Category-3 railway business under the Railway Business Act of Japan. Centuries ago words were added to many of the melodies and these words provided the names of the tunes as we know them today. The ground, previously Chapel Fields, is named after John Walker, the Middlesex player who founded the ground. L. Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms.
Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.
The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- ML algorithms categories: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement.
- Unsupervised does not require labeled data.
- The SOTA text summarization model is trained with ML algorithms.
- Reinforcement learning is not used.
- The algorithm used requires labeled data.
- Therefore, it cannot be unsupervised; the only remaining category is supervised.
