Question 1:
- Rule: All students who want a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.
- Fact: James wants to have a long vacation.
- Missing: Whether James is a student.
- Without knowing James is a student, the rule does not necessarily apply. So we cannot conclude his favorite season is summer.

Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Emma's favorite season is summer.
- Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's, so not summer.
