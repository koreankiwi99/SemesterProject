The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Tom will rent if both: (a) he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and (b) the deposit is no more than $1500.
- At The Olive Garden (a managed building), the monthly rent is $2000. The security deposit at a managed building is equal to or more than the monthly rent, so it is at least $2000, which is more than $1500. Thus condition (b) fails.
- We also do not know whether The Olive Garden allows pets, so (a) is unknown.
- Since the sufficient condition for Tom to rent is not satisfied, we cannot conclude he will rent (but we also cannot conclude he won’t, because the statement is only a sufficient condition).
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Fluffy is a cat; cats are pets; so Fluffy is a pet.
- If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.
- We are not told whether The Olive Garden allows pets; “Pets are allowed in some managed buildings” does not imply The Olive Garden is one of them.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The Olive Garden is a managed building with monthly rent $2000.
- In managed buildings, the security deposit is either equal to the monthly rent or more, so it is at least $2000.
- Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
