NORAD Tracks Santa, also called NORAD Santa Tracker, is an annual official program in which North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) publishes the tracking of Santa Claus, who leaves the North Pole to travel around the world on his mission to deliver presents to children every year on Christmas Eve. Before the 1970s, the idea of rolling luggage was shunned by the travel industry, who viewed it as much less masculine than traditional luggage. If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z
Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Michael is taller than everyone else in his class.
- Peter is taller than Michael.
- By transitivity, Peter is taller than everyone in Michael’s class.
- Therefore, there is no man in Michael’s class taller than Peter. The statement asserting such a man exists is false.

Question 2:
- If a person does not jump when shooting, Michael can block them.
- Michael cannot block Windy’s shooting, so by contrapositive Windy jumps when shooting.
- Windy is a shooter (since there is shooting to be blocked).
- Anyone who can jump when shooting is a great shooter; if Windy jumps when shooting, Windy can jump when shooting.
- Therefore, Windy is a great shooter.

Question 3:
- A man taller than another man can block the other’s shooting.
- We know Peter is a man, but we do not know Windy’s gender or relative height to Peter.
- Windy jumping prevents Michael (not Peter) from blocking via the “non-jumping” rule; there is no analogous rule for Peter except the “taller man vs. man” rule.
- Insufficient information to conclude Peter can block Windy’s shooting.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: Unknown
