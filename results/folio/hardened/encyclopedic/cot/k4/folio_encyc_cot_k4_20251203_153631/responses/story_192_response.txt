Question 1 reasoning:
- Given: International students in the US have either F1 or J1. F1 students who want to work in the US need CPT or OPT.
- Facts: Mike is an international student. If he wants to work in the US, he needs to apply for CPT.
- The requirement to apply for CPT is consistent with having an F1 visa but does not rule out other possibilities based on the given information. We are not told that only F1 students need CPT or that J1 students cannot need CPT.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mike has an F1 visa.

Question 2 reasoning:
- From the same facts, we only know Mike is an international student and would need CPT to work in the US.
- Nothing in the given information indicates he specifically has a J1 visa.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mike has a J1 visa.
