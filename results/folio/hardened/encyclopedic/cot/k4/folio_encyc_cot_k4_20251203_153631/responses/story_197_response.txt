==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Q1: ETS provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship. People in single-parent families or with few resources can prove hardship. Tom is an applicant, lives in a single-parent family, and has few resources, so he can prove hardship; thus ETS provides him financial aid.
- Q2: The cost is stated as $205, which is cheaper than $300, so it is below $300.
- Q3: Since ETS provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove hardship (and Tom qualifies), it is not the case that no one taking the GRE has financial aid provided to them.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
