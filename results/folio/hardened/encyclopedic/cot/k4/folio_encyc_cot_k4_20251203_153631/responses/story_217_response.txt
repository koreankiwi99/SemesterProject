Reasoning:

Question 1:
- If George likes music, then he wants to compose.
- If George has access to a program, then he can compose.
- If he can compose and wants to compose, then he will compose.
- Therefore, if he likes music and has access to a program, he will compose. True.

Question 2:
- From (can ∧ wants) -> will compose, contraposition gives: if not will compose, then not(can ∧ wants), i.e., not can or not wants.
- This does not entail not can specifically; he could fail to compose because he doesn’t want to, even if he can.
- Thus the statement does not follow; its truth cannot be determined from the premises. Unknown.
