Some pets are not mammals.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the context: All cats are mammals. Some pets are not mammals.
- Statement to evaluate: No pets are cats (i.e., there are zero pets that are cats).
- Since all cats are mammals, any pet that is a cat would be a mammal. The fact that some pets are not mammals does not rule out that some other pets could be mammals (and possibly cats).
- We are not given that any pet is a cat, nor that no pet is a cat. Therefore, the truth of "No pets are cats" cannot be determined from the given information.
