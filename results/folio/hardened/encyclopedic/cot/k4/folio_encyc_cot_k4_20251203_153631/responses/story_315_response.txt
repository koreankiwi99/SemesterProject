Premises: 2926 for restoration. pɔ. Allopatric speciation (from Ancient Greek  ἄλλος (állos) 'other' and  πατρίς (patrís) 'fatherland') – also referred to as geographic speciation, vicariant speciation, or its earlier name the dumbbell model – is a mode of speciation that occurs when biological populations become geographically isolated from each other to an extent that prevents or interferes with gene flow. It debuted at number 13 on the US Billboard 200, also reaching number four on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. 
If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the premises:
  - If something can transport multiple passengers, then it is not a one-seater.
  - All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers, hence all Tesla Model 3 are not one-seaters.
  - All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
  - All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars, hence all Solo EV cars are one-seaters.
  - The conditional about John: If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. This is a tautology of the form P -> (P ∨ Q) and provides no information about whether John’s car is a Tesla Model 3 or a Solo EV.

Question 1: There is no information that implies John’s car is a Tesla Model 3, nor its negation. Unknown.

Question 2: There is no information that implies John’s car is a Solo EV. Unknown.

Question 3: There is no information that implies John’s car is not a Solo EV. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
