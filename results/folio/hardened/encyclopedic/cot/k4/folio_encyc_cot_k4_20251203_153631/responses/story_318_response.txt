Story ID: 318
Premises: Joppa is now largely residential, but salt was once produced from seawater by evaporation at Joppa Pans. A member of the Sisodia dynasty, he controlled parts of present-day Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Sindh, and Uttar Pradesh with his capital at Chittorgarh. Prior to 2019, the district was located in the northeastern part of the state. Josef Mayr (June 16, 1900 in Augsburg – August 2, 1957 in La Spezia, Italy) was the mayor of Augsburg, Germany, between 1934 and 1945. Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.
If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.
Breaking Bad is a show.
Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- We are told that some (at least one) show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses. No information links this show to Breaking Bad.
- If a show gives out roses, then it is an episode of The Bachelor. We are not given that Breaking Bad gives out roses, nor that it airs at 8 pm on Monday.
- The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people, and all such shows are reality TV. Breaking Bad is explicitly not a reality TV show, but there is no rule connecting “episode of The Bachelor” to “portrays real people” for that episode, so we cannot derive a contradiction or further constraints on Breaking Bad’s schedule or rose-giving.

Question 1: No information about Breaking Bad’s airing time is provided. Unknown.

Question 2: This asserts both that Breaking Bad gives out roses and that it airs Monday at 8 pm. Neither is supported by the premises. Unknown.

Question 3: We have no rule that connects “roses are given during Breaking Bad” to “it is on Monday at 8 pm.” The existence of some show at that time giving roses does not imply all rose-giving must occur then. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
