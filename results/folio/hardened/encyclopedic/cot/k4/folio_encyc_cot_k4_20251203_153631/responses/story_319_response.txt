==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- No baked sweets are spicy. So: baked sweet -> not spicy, and spicy -> not baked sweet.
- All cupcakes are baked sweets. All Baked by Melissa (BMB) products are cupcakes, hence baked sweets.
- All mala hotpots are spicy.
- Dried Thai chilies (DTC) are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets. Since mala hotpot implies spicy, this reduces to: DTC are spicy or not baked sweets.
- Either way (spicy or not baked sweets), DTC are not baked sweets (because spicy -> not baked sweet). Therefore DTC are not baked sweets, hence not cupcakes, hence not BMB products.

Question 1: DTC are BMB products. False (they are not baked sweets; all BMB products are baked sweets).
Question 2: DTC are not BMB products. True (as above).
Question 3: DTC are a mala hotpot. Unknown (the disjunction doesn’t force mala hotpot).
Question 4: DTC are neither BMB products nor baked sweets. True (we derived both negations).
Question 5: DTC are cupcakes and BMB products. False (would imply baked sweets, contradicted).
