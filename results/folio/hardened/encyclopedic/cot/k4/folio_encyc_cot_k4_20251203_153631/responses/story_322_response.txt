All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.

Some stocks are growth stocks.
All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
KO is a mature stock.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- All growth stocks are bought for rapid price appreciation. (Growth -> Bought)
- If a stock is bought for rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund. (Bought -> ¬Suitable)
- Therefore, Growth -> ¬Suitable. By contrapositive, Suitable -> ¬Growth.
- All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. (Mature -> Suitable)
- KO is a mature stock. Hence KO is suitable for a retirement fund, and KO is a stock.
- From Suitable(KO) and Bought -> ¬Suitable, by contrapositive we get ¬Bought(KO).
- From Suitable(KO) and Growth -> ¬Suitable, by contrapositive we get ¬Growth(KO).

Question 1:
- KO is a mature stock, which implies KO is a stock. True.

Question 2:
- KO is a stock, but not a growth stock (from Suitable -> ¬Growth). So “stock and growth stock” is false.

Question 3:
- Antecedent: “KO is a growth stock or bought for rapid appreciation” is false (both disjuncts are false: ¬Growth(KO) and ¬Bought(KO)).
- A conditional with a false antecedent is true (vacuously), regardless of the consequent about being neither a stock nor price volatility. True.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: True
