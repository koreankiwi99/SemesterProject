Premises: The terms allopatry and vicariance are often used in biogeography to describe the relationship between organisms whose ranges do not significantly overlap but are immediately adjacent to each other—they do not occur together or only occur within a narrow zone of contact. A Liberal, he was elected again in 1917 and 1921. The Art of Noise was a short-lived radio program that aired in December 1994.

If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given rules:
- If someone makes wedding plans, then they are engaged.
- If someone invites others to their ceremony, they make wedding plans (thus are engaged).
- If someone has a well-attended wedding, they invite others (thus make plans and are engaged).
- Some people (not necessarily John) with well-attended weddings have larger families. This is an existential claim about unspecified individuals.
- If John is engaged, then he does not both invite friends to his ceremony and make wedding plans. (Note: “invite friends” is distinct from “invite others.”)
- If John has a larger family, then John either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to his ceremony.

Question 1: “John has a larger family.”
- The only statement about John’s larger family is a conditional (if he has one, then ...). There is no premise that he does or does not have a larger family. Therefore, cannot conclude.
Answer: Unknown

Question 2: “John does not have a larger family.”
- No premise rules out John having a larger family. The existential about some people having larger families does not apply specifically to John. Therefore, cannot conclude the negation either.
Answer: Unknown

Question 3: “John is engaged.”
- To infer John is engaged, we would need that he makes wedding plans or invites others or has a well-attended wedding. None of these are established for John. The conditional about engagement only constrains what follows if he is engaged; it doesn’t establish that he is.
Answer: Unknown

Question 4: “John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding.”
- We have no information establishing either conjunct (not larger family, not inviting others). Hence the conjunction cannot be concluded.
