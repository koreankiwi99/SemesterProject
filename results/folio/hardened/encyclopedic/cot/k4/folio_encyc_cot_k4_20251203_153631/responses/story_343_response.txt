No digital media are analog.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the rules:
  - All streaming services are digital media.
  - No digital media are analog (equivalently, digital -> not analog, and analog -> not digital).
  - Every printed text is analog media.
  - If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.
  - If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.

- Chain for 1984 if it were a streaming service:
  Streaming(1984) -> Hardcover(1984) -> Printed(1984) -> Analog(1984).
  Also, Streaming(1984) -> Digital(1984) -> Not Analog(1984).
  Thus, Streaming(1984) implies Analog(1984) and Not Analog(1984), a contradiction.
  Therefore, Not Streaming(1984).

Question 1: We only know that if 1984 were streaming, then it would be printed; but since it is not streaming, nothing establishes that it is printed. So this is unknown.

Question 2: From the contradiction above, 1984 is not a streaming service. So the statement that it is a streaming service is false.

Question 3: As shown, 1984 is not a streaming service. So this is true.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
