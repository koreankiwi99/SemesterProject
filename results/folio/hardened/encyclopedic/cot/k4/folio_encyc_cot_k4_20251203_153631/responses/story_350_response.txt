No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From “If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative” and “No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries,” it follows that no design that Max adores can have interesting geometries (otherwise we get a contradiction: interesting geometries implies brutalist, but adored brutalist designs cannot have interesting geometries).
- All Zaha Hadid styles that Max adores have interesting geometries. Therefore Max does not adore any Zaha Hadid styles.
- Every style Max adores is either Zaha Hadid or Kelly Wearstler. Since none are Zaha, all adored styles are Kelly Wearstler.
- All Kelly Wearstler styles that Max adores are evocative and dreamy. Hence, any design/style Max adores is evocative and dreamy.
- Nothing given forces adored designs to be brutalist (they could be, but it’s not entailed).
