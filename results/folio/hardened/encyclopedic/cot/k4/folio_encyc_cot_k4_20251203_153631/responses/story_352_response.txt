==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- We know: All legal entities have legal obligations.
- But we do not know that the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a legal entity (we only know that if it were a private company, it would be a legal entity; and if it were created under law, then it would not be a private company. Neither is established).
- Therefore, we cannot conclude it has legal obligations.
Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- From the chains: Private company → Company → Business organization → Legal entity → Created under law.
- Given: If created under law, then not a private company.
- Hence Private company ⇒ Created under law ⇒ Not a private company, so Private company leads to a contradiction, and thus the club is not a private company.
- Therefore, “has legal obligations and is a private company” is false because the “is a private company” part is false.
Conclusion: False.

Question 3:
- Assume the club is a private company. Then by the same chain: Private company → Company → Business organization → Legal entity → (has legal obligations and is created under law).
- Therefore, if it is a private company, it certainly has legal obligations or is created under law (indeed both).
Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
