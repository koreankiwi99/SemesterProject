Premises: The party put forward 142 candidates for the 52 seats in the National Assembly. In 2023, it was the 212th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. Nightmare Detective 2 was released in 2008. El Caño is a town and corregimiento in Natá District, Coclé Province, Panama. All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.
All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.
All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let A = grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, B = disregards physical well-being, V = visits the gym at least once a day, E = eats salads regularly, C = very conscious, F = fulfills daily nutritional intake.
- Given: A -> E; E -> C; B -> ¬C; V -> F; F -> A.
- If A and B both held, then C and ¬C would both hold (contradiction). The premise says Taylor either (A ∧ B) or neither (¬A ∧ ¬B). Since (A ∧ B) is impossible, we conclude ¬A ∧ ¬B.

Question 1:
- From ¬A, we cannot infer whether E holds. E could still be true without A. So Unknown.

Question 2:
- V -> F -> A, so V -> A. Given ¬A, by contrapositive, ¬V. Thus the statement “Taylor visits the gym at least once a day” is False.

Question 3:
- We have ¬A from above, and also ¬V from Q2. So “neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day” is True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
