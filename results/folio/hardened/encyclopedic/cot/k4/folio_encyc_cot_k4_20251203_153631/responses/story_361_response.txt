Story ID: 361
Premises: A. In enzymology, a 4-(hydroxymethyl)benzenesulfonate dehydrogenase (EC 1. The battle began as a battle of manoeuvre, with French troops attempting to outflank the British left, but Wellesley was able to redeploy his army to face the assault. They have alternate evolutionary lines in Slowbro and Slowking, although the latter was introduced in the later Pokémon Gold and Silver titles. If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly

Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the rules: spilling implies not tidy (S -> ¬T), and being cleanly implies tidy (C -> T).
- If Peter were in the first disjunct (S ∧ C), he would be both tidy and not tidy, a contradiction. So that disjunct is impossible.
- Therefore, Peter must be in the second disjunct: ¬S ∧ ¬C (he does not spill and is not cleanly).

Question 1:
- From ¬S and ¬C, no rule determines T(P). S -> ¬T doesn’t apply (since ¬S), and C -> T doesn’t apply (since ¬C). So whether Peter is notably tidy is undetermined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- All clumsy foodies who go out frequently (CF) spill: CF -> S. From ¬S, by contrapositive, ¬CF.
- If family prioritizes order (F), then values order (V), then cleanly (C); so F -> C. From ¬C, by contrapositive, ¬F.
- Thus both disjuncts (CF or F) are false; the OR statement is false.
- Answer: False.

Question 3:
- We have ¬CF and ¬F. The statement is (CF ∧ F) ∨ (¬CF ∧ ¬F), which evaluates to false ∨ true = true.
- Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
