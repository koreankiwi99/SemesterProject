Premises: It is also known by its product code FR9. p. The University of Florida campus encompasses over 2,000 acres (8. Megalographa culminicola is a moth of the family Noctuidae. All hydrocarbons are organic compounds .
All alkanes are hydrocarbons
All organic compounds are chemical compounds.
All organic compounds contain carbon.
No chemical compounds contain only one element.
The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given facts:
- All alkanes → hydrocarbons → organic compounds → chemical compounds.
- All organic compounds contain carbon.
- No chemical compounds contain only one element. So Chemical → not SingleElement.
- For the mixture: either (Chemical and SingleElement) or (not Chemical and not SingleElement). Thus the mixture is Chemical iff SingleElement.

From Chemical → not SingleElement and (Chemical iff SingleElement), the “both” option is impossible; therefore the mixture must be neither: not Chemical and not SingleElement. Since all alkanes are chemical compounds, not Chemical implies the mixture is not an alkane.

Question 1:
We know the mixture is not Chemical and not SingleElement. Nothing links that to containing carbon unless it is organic (which it is not). So whether it contains carbon is not determined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
“The mixture is an alkane and contains carbon.” The mixture is not an alkane, so the conjunction is false regardless of the carbon part. Answer: False.

Question 3:
“If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane.”
We already have that the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane. Hence the consequent is true, making the implication true regardless of the antecedent. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
