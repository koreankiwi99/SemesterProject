Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From "Hannah is at Mary's school" and "If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money..." plus "Hannah works in student jobs on campus," we get: M(Hannah) (she needs to earn money).
- Also given: If M(Hannah) then (not picky and not need money), i.e., M(Hannah) -> (¬P(Hannah) ∧ ¬M(Hannah)). Using M(Hannah), we infer ¬P(Hannah) and ¬M(Hannah).
- Thus we have both M(Hannah) and ¬M(Hannah): a contradiction about whether she needs money. However, we do get ¬P(Hannah).
- We cannot derive that Hannah enjoys dining hall meals (E) or that she spends a lot of time in dining halls (D), since S -> (T ∨ E) does not let us conclude E, and D only follows from E.

Question 1:
- We derived both M and ¬M. Therefore it is not determinately true or false whether she needs money. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- S(Hannah) is true and ¬P(Hannah) is true, but D(Hannah) is not derivable (nor is its negation). The full conjunction S ∧ ¬P ∧ D is therefore not established. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- S(Hannah) is true. The disjunction "not picky or (if picky then D)" is satisfied by ¬P(Hannah), which we have. Hence the whole statement is true. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: True
