==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let MB = born in a multiple birth; Spend = spends a lot of time with siblings; Home = lives at home; Strangers = lives with strangers; Complains = complains about annoying siblings.
- Rules:
  - MB -> Spend.
  - Complains -> have siblings born together -> MB.
  - Spend -> often live at home (not the same as “live at home”).
  - Home -> not Strangers.
- The Luke statement: Either (Baby ∧ MB ∧ Strangers) or (¬(Baby ∧ MB) ∧ ¬Strangers). This does not determine whether MB holds, and “often live at home” does not entail “live at home,” so we cannot eliminate the first disjunct.

Question 1:
- Spend is guaranteed if MB, but MB is undetermined. So we cannot conclude Spend.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Complains would imply MB, but nothing given determines whether Luke complains. Both disjuncts allow Complains without contradiction.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- “Neither MB nor Complains” requires ¬MB and ¬Complains. The first disjunct would make this false; the second disjunct does not fix Complains and does not necessarily give ¬MB. So it’s undetermined.
- Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
