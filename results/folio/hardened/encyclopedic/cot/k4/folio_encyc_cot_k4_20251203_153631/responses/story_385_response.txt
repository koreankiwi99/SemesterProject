If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022" and "All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male," Coco is either female or male.
- If she is male, then by "All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal," she lost to Nadal. Then, by "If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022," she is not male. Contradiction in the male case implies not male.
- If she is female, then by "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek," she lost to Świątek; thus by "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the WTA," she is ranked highly; hence by the same conditional, she is not male. So in either case, she is not male.
- From "either female or male" and "not male," she must be female.
- Being female implies she lost to Świątek, which implies ranked highly by the WTA, which implies "one of the most active players in major tennis" (i.e., Grand Slams).

Question 1: She is one of the most active players in major tennis. True.
Question 2: We cannot deduce she lost to Nadal; only male players are guaranteed to have lost to Nadal, and she is not male. Unknown.
Question 3: She both lost to Świątek and is one of the most active players; the statement denying this conjunction is therefore false. False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
