Premises: From 1980 to 1988, Stewart wrote two books about Merlin, translating and exploring medieval texts on the topic (now published in one volume as Merlin: the Prophetic Vision and Mystic Life, by Penguin Arkana). Inspired by Fascist Italy and Vichy France, the group attracted support from many young nationalists during the Algerian war (1954–62), especially in the French colonial army. It is the second trading card arcade by Sega following World Club Champion Football. They won the 2012 OFC Nations Cup after playing the final vs New Caledonia. If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- Deadly → LowSurvival.
- SevereCancer → Deadly.
- BileDuctCancer → SevereCancer.
- Cholangiocarcinoma → BileDuctCancer.
- MildFlu → LowSurvival.
- Not (BileDuct(CRC) and LowSurvival(CRC)).

From BileDuct → Severe → Deadly → LowSurvival, if CRC were a bile duct cancer, CRC would also have low survival, contradicting the given "not both." Therefore, CRC is not a bile duct cancer. Since Cholangiocarcinoma implies bile duct cancer, CRC is not a Cholangiocarcinoma either. Nothing links CRC to being a severe cancer or to being a mild flu.

Question 1:
We only know bile duct cancers are severe; CRC is not a bile duct cancer and there’s no other rule making CRC severe. So we cannot conclude severe nor its negation. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
Antecedent is (CRC is bile duct cancer or Cholangiocarcinoma). We established CRC is neither, so the antecedent is false. A material implication with a false antecedent is true. Answer: True.

Question 3:
The statement is effectively a disjunction involving (Cholangiocarcinoma ∧ MildFlu), or (BileDuct), or (all of the above). Since CRC is neither Cholangiocarcinoma nor a bile duct cancer, all disjuncts are false regardless of MildFlu status. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
