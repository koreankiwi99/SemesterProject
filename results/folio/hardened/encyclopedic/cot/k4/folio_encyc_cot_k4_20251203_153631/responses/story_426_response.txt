Premises: pɔ. No pursuit was attempted because Wellesley was superseded by Sir Harry Burrard and then Sir Hew Dalrymple (one having arrived during the battle, the second soon after). Requirements for the award are a number of Adventure Skills, Special Interest Badges, an Expedition, and camp with an inter-cultural aspect. In the book, Aron chastised French intellectuals for what he described as their harsh criticism of capitalism and democracy and their simultaneous defense of the actions of the communist governments of the East. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. 
Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. 
Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. 
No managers work remotely from home. 
James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Let M = “James is a manager,” Go = “James goes/appears in the company building today,” LC = “James has lunch in the company building,” LH = “James has lunch at home,” R = “James works remotely from home,” A = “James is in other countries.”

Given:
- LC -> schedules -> Go.
- Go ↔ M (James appears in the company today iff he is a manager).
- LH -> R.
- A -> R.
- M -> ¬R (no managers work remotely).
- Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home (at least one; not both).

Derived:
- LC -> Go -> M, so LC -> M.
- LH -> R and M -> ¬R, so LH -> ¬M.
- Since James must lunch either at company or at home, and LC -> M and LH -> ¬M, we get:
  - M -> ¬LH and thus (by the “either/or” lunch rule) M -> LC.
  - ¬M -> ¬LC (contraposing LC -> M), hence (by the “either/or” lunch rule) ¬M -> LH.
  Therefore LC ↔ M and LH ↔ ¬M.

Question 1: “James has lunch in the company.”
- This is equivalent to M, but nothing determines whether James is a manager. Therefore Unknown.

Question 2: “James does not have lunch in the company.”
- This is equivalent to ¬M, which is also not determined. Therefore Unknown.

Question 3: “If James is either a manager or in other countries, then he neither has lunch at home nor works remotely. If James either has lunch at home or works remotely, then he is neither a manager nor in other countries.”
- First implication: (M ∨ A) -> ¬(LH ∨ R). If A holds, then A -> R, contradicting ¬R; so this implication fails whenever A is true. Since A is not ruled out, this implication is not entailed.
- Second implication: (LH ∨ R) -> (¬M ∧ ¬A). From R -> ¬M we get ¬M, but we cannot infer ¬A from R (indeed A -> R). So this implication also can fail (e.g., if A is true).
- Because A is unconstrained, the combined statement is not determined by the premises. Therefore Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown

Q1: James has lunch in the company.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: James does not have lunch in the company.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q3: If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home. If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries. [contrapositive is more natural]
