Premises: The Blues EP is the second recording by Some Girls. It breeds in Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands and Japan; it winters in south toward the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, Hainan and the northern Philippines. Commonly known as the gray shag, it is edible, but must be used promptly after collecting. It was placed on numerous widely circulated lists of the best albums of all time and has had an enduring effect on both listeners and musicians. None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department. 
All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. 
All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department. 
All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. 
All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.
James is a student working in the lab. 
James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "James is a student working in the lab" and the rules: Lab -> class with Prof. David -> database course, we derive that James takes the database course.
- The statement "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university" is read as “neither works in the lab nor has a part-time job,” giving not-lab and not-part-time. This contradicts the lab fact but does not provide any reason to conclude not-database.
- We have an explicit statement that James does not have a part-time job and no rule implying that he does.

Question 1: The claim that James has a part-time job conflicts with the explicit statement that he does not. False.
Question 2: Directly stated that James does not have a part-time job. True.
Question 3: From the lab fact and rules, James takes the database course; thus “database course or part-time job” is satisfied. True.
Question 4: From lab -> David -> database course. True.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
4: True
