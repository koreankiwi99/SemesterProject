No one nice to animals is also mean to animals.
Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
All animal lovers are nice to animals.
All pet owners love animals.
Tom is a pet owner.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "All pet owners love animals" and "Tom is a pet owner," Tom is an animal lover.
- From "All animal lovers are nice to animals," Tom is nice to animals.
- From "No one nice to animals is also mean to animals," Tom is not mean to animals.

Question 1:
- Nothing states whether Tom is grumpy. Being nice does not preclude being grumpy. So we cannot determine if Tom is grumpy.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Since Tom is not mean to animals, he cannot be both grumpy and mean. Therefore "Tom is not both grumpy and mean" is true.
- Answer: True.

Question 3:
- The antecedent "Tom is not both grumpy and mean" is true (from Q2).
- The consequent "Tom is neither grumpy nor an animal lover" is false because Tom is an animal lover.
- A true antecedent and false consequent makes the implication false.
- Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
