==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1 reasoning:
- Ted is an alligator, and alligators are not domesticated animals, so Ted is not domesticated.
- There is no rule that all pets are domesticated, nor any rule linking alligators and pet status.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether Ted is a pet.

Question 2 reasoning:
- From Ted being an alligator, Ted is not domesticated.
- All cows are domesticated; thus, by contrapositive, Ted is not a cow.
- All Brown Swiss cattle are cows; thus, Ted is not Brown Swiss cattle.
- Therefore, “Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle” is false because the second part is false.

Question 3 reasoning:
- As shown, Ted is not Brown Swiss cattle, so the antecedent is false.
- A conditional with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).
- Hence, “If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet” is true.
