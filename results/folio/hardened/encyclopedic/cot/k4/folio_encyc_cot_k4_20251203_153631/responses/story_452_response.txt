Premises: On January 1, 2006, Wasseiges had a total population of 2,517. The Bloodstone Lands is a module for the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for the 2nd edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. A pawn storm usually involves adjacent pawns on the flank of the board, such as the queenside (a-, b-, and c-files) or the kingside (f-, g-, and h-files). T. All aliens are extraterrestrials.
If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.
No extraterrestrials are human.
All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.
Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let E = “Marvin is from Earth,” M = “Marvin is from Mars,” A = “Marvin is an alien,” X = “Marvin is an extraterrestrial,” H = “Marvin is a human,” HI = “Marvin is highly intelligent.”
- Given: A -> X; M -> A; X -> ¬H; (HI ∧ E) -> H; HI; (E ∧ M) ∨ (¬E ∧ ¬M); ¬E -> X.
- If E ∧ M held, then M -> A -> X -> ¬H, but also HI ∧ E -> H, contradiction. So E ∧ M is impossible. Since (E ∧ M) ∨ (¬E ∧ ¬M) is given true, it must be ¬E ∧ ¬M.
- From ¬E and ¬E -> X, we get X. Then X -> ¬H, so ¬H.

Question 1: Marvin is an alien.
- We have X but only A -> X, not X -> A. With ¬M, M -> A gives no info. A could be either true or false. Unknown.

Question 2: Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars.
- We derived ¬H and ¬M. True.

Question 3: If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human.
- We have ¬M true and ¬H true, so the implication “¬M -> H” is false. False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
