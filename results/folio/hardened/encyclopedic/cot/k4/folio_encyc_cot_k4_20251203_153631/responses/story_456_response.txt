==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- All professional basketball players (Pro) can do jump shots (JS). JS -> Leap -> ActivateLeg (AL).
- Given: ¬AL(Yuri). By contraposition: ¬AL -> ¬Leap -> ¬JS -> ¬Pro. So Yuri is not a professional basketball player.
- No information links Yuri’s nationality to these properties.

Question 1:
- We have no information about Yuri’s nationality. Unknown.

Question 2:
- “Not an American professional basketball player” means not (American ∧ Pro).
- Since ¬Pro(Yuri), not (American ∧ Pro) is true. True.

Question 3:
- “American professional basketball player” means American ∧ Pro.
- Since ¬Pro(Yuri), this is false. False.

Question 4:
- Antecedent ¬Leap(Yuri) is true (from ¬AL).
- Consequent (American ∧ Pro) is false (since ¬Pro).
- True -> False makes the implication false. False.

Question 5:
- Antecedent “not an American professional basketball player” is true (since ¬Pro).
- Consequent Pro is false.
- True -> False makes the implication false. False.
