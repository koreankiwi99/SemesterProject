All dogs are animals that bark.
Jane likes all animals that jump.
If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. 
KiKi is an animal.
If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
First, derive what we can about KiKi:
- From: If terricolous then has legs (T → L).
- From: If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs: (¬J ∧ ¬L) → (T ∨ L).
- Using T → L, (T ∨ L) implies L. So (¬J ∧ ¬L) → L. But the antecedent includes ¬L, yielding a contradiction; thus ¬(¬J ∧ ¬L), i.e., J ∨ L.
- From: If an animal has legs then it jumps (L → J) and KiKi is an animal, J ∨ L entails J. Therefore, KiKi jumps.

Question 1:
- We only know KiKi jumps; jumping does not imply terricolous. No rule gives T from J. So this cannot be determined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- “Barking dog” amounts to being a dog (since all dogs bark). We have no information that KiKi is a dog. So this cannot be determined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- We cannot conclude that KiKi does not bark, nor that KiKi is not a dog, from the given information. So the conjunction cannot be determined.
- Answer: Unknown.
