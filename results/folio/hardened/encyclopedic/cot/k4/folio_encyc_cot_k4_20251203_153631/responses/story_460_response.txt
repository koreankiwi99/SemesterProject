If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From "All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience" and "If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages," we have: family-friendly animated -> GA -> appropriate for all ages -> children can watch without guidance.
- From "If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance," appropriate for all ages -> children can watch without guidance.
- Given: Hachi is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for all ages. In either case, children can watch without guidance.
- From "If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance," contraposition gives: if children can watch without guidance, then it does not contain excessive erotic and violent content. Hence Hachi does not contain excessive erotic and violent content.
- We have no information that Hachi is in the Frozen series, and F does not imply Frozen (only Frozen implies F).

Question 1: If Hachi is family-friendly animated, then it is GA; if it is merely appropriate for all ages (without being family-friendly animated), GA does not follow. Therefore, Unknown.

Question 2: The statement is (contains excessive content) or (is in Frozen). We have established Hachi does not contain excessive content; we do not know if it is in Frozen. Therefore, Unknown.

Question 3: The statement is (excessive AND Frozen) OR (not excessive AND not Frozen). We know not excessive, so it reduces to not Frozen, which is not known. Therefore, Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
