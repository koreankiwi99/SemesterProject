==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1 reasoning:
- Rock is Peter’s pet, so Rock is either a monkey or a bird.
- Nothing rules out Rock being a bird or forces Rock to be a monkey.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether Rock is a monkey.

Question 2 reasoning:
- Case 1: If Rock is a bird, then as Peter’s bird Rock can fly; since a pet that can fly has wings, Rock has wings.
- Case 2: If Rock is not a bird, then since every pet is either a monkey or a bird, Rock is a monkey. Monkeys are mammals; Peter’s mammal pets are animals; Peter’s animal pets can breathe. So Rock can breathe. Given the disjunction “Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe,” with Bird false and “cannot breathe” false, Rock must be able to fly. Hence, as a pet that can fly, Rock has wings.
- In all cases, Rock has wings.

Question 3 reasoning:
- From Question 2, Rock has wings, so “Rock does not have wings” is false.
