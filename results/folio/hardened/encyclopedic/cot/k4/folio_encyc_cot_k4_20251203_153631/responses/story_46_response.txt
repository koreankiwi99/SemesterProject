Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
Question 1:
- Breeding back is stated to be a form of artificial selection.
- Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s.
- Therefore, Heck cattle underwent artificial selection. Hence, at least some Heck cattle are artificially selected.

Question 2:
- The text says aurochs are animals.
- It also says some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals.
- While Heck cattle were bred back to resemble the aurochs, the text does not explicitly state that aurochs are extinct. The general statement about resembling extinct animals does not entail that aurochs are extinct.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude from the given text that aurochs are extinct.
