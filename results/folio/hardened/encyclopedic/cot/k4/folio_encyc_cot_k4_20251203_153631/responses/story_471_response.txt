==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "If something is skittish, then it is not calm," we get its contrapositive: if something is calm, then it is not skittish. Rockie is calm, so Rockie is not skittish.
- All squirrels near the campus are skittish. Rockie is near the campus and not skittish, so Rockie is not a squirrel.
- The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels. Rockie is near the campus and not a squirrel, so Rockie is a rabbit.
- All rabbits near the campus are cute. Therefore, Rockie is cute.
- We only know that some turtles are near the campus; nothing specifies Rockie is or is not a turtle.

Question 1: We cannot determine whether Rockie is a turtle. Unknown.

Question 2: We also cannot determine that Rockie is not a turtle. Unknown.

Question 3: Rockie is a turtle or cute. Since Rockie is cute, the disjunction is true. True.

Question 4: If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish. Rockie is not a squirrel, so the antecedent holds; Rockie is cute, so the consequent holds. True.

Question 5: If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle. The antecedent is true (Rockie is cute and calm), but calm implies not skittish, so Rockie is not skittish. The consequent is therefore false. False.
