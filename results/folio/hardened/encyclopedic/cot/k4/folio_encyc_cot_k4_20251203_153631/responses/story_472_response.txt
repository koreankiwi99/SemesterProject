Story ID: 472
Premises: Wall Street is a street which runs through the Financial District of New York City, which due to many financial centers being located on the street is further a metonym for the Economy of the United States. The Howden Insurance Mile is a New Zealand Thoroughbred horse race run at Hastings Racecourse in Hawke's Bay. He plays his club football and hurling with  St Kiernan’s. The date of authorship is uncertain. Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. 
All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
All queen bees are bees.
Harry is a bee.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given facts:
- Bee(Harry).
- All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating → Bees have ¬R (no M-F mating).
- All queen bees are bees → QueenBee → Bee.
- All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating: (Animal ∧ Backbone) → R.
- From ¬R for Harry and the contrapositive of the above: ¬(Animal ∧ Backbone) for Harry.
- All vertebrate animals have a backbone (interpretable as Vertebrate → Backbone, or (Vertebrate ∧ Animal) → Backbone).
- Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates: Animal → (Invertebrate ∨ Vertebrate).
- No premise links Bee to Animal.

Question 1:
- From Bee(Harry) and QueenBee → Bee, we cannot infer Bee → QueenBee.
- Both QueenBee(Harry) and ¬QueenBee(Harry) are consistent with the premises.
Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- We cannot infer Animal(Harry), so cannot use Animal → (Invertebrate ∨ Vertebrate) to get Invertebrate(Harry).
- QueenBee(Harry) is not entailed either.
- The disjunction (Invertebrate ∨ QueenBee) could be true or false depending on unspecified facts.
Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- Antecedent P: (Vertebrate ∧ Animal ∧ Backbone) ∨ (¬Vertebrate ∧ ¬(Animal ∧ Backbone)).
- From ¬R and (Animal ∧ Backbone) → R, we have ¬(Animal ∧ Backbone). Thus the first disjunct of P is false, and P reduces to (¬Vertebrate ∧ ¬(Animal ∧ Backbone)).
- Even if P holds (e.g., set Vertebrate false), the consequent “neither invertebrate nor queen bee” does not follow from the premises (Harry could still be a queen bee, or an invertebrate if he were an animal).
- There are models where P is true and the consequent is false, and models where the implication is vacuously true (P false).
Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown

Questions and Results:
==================================================
Q1: Harry is a queen bee.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee.
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: No

Q3: If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.
Ground Truth: False
