==================================================
Reasoning:
- From: USC(x) -> Register(x) -> Participate(x).
- From: For all persons, USC(x) or TC(x).
- From: Official(x) -> not TC(x). Combining with USC(x) or TC(x), we get Official(x) -> USC(x) -> Register(x) -> Participate(x).

Vladimir:
- Given: not TC(V), not Manager(V).
- From USC(V) or TC(V) and not TC(V), infer USC(V) -> Register(V) -> Participate(V).
- No info about being an official; undetermined.

Ekaterina:
- Given: Register(E) or Official(E).
- Since Official(E) -> Register(E), we conclude Register(E) is true. Hence Participate(E) is true.

Question 1:
We only know Vladimir is not TC and not a Gazprom manager; nothing implies he is an official. Unknown.

Question 2:
No basis to conclude he is not an official either. Unknown.

Question 3:
Participate(E) is true, so Participate(E) or Manager(E) is true. True.

Question 4:
Participate(E) is true, so Participate(E) or Manager(V) is true. True.

Question 5:
Register(E) is true and Participate(V) is true, so the conjunction holds; its negation is false. False.
