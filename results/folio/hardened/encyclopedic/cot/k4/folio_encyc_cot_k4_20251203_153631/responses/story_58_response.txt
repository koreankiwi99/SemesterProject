==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) Walden is a book. The context says “Books contain tons of knowledge,” which implies any book contains knowledge. Therefore, Walden contains knowledge.

2) Harry read a book. The context states: reading a book → gains knowledge; gains knowledge → becomes smarter. Therefore, Harry became smarter than before.

3) The context gives only one direction: gains knowledge → becomes smarter. It does not state the converse (smarter → gained knowledge). So we cannot conclude that a smarter person necessarily has gained knowledge from the given information.
