Premises: Not true and true is false. There are six types of wild turkeys: Eastern wild turkey, Osceola wild turkey, Gould’s wild turkey, Merriam’s wild turkey, Rio Grande wild turkey, and Ocellated wild turkey.
Tom is not an Eastern wild turkey.
Tom is not an Osceola wild turkey.
Tom is not a Gould's wild turkey.
Tom is neither a Merriam's wild turkey nor a Rio Grande wild turkey.
Tom is a wild turkey.
Conclusion: Tom is an Ocellated wild turkey.
