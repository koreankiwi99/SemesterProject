-- We are asked to prove the NEGATION of the conclusion. This is not derivable from the premises.
-- Attempt (will fail, since conclusion_true provides a witness to the existential):
theorem neg_goal : ¬ (∃ s : Series, WorkingTitleIs s SecretDudeSociety ∧ ScriptEditor AndrewCollins s) := by
  intro h
  -- From the premises we have the existential:
  have pos : ∃ s : Series, WorkingTitleIs s SecretDudeSociety ∧ ScriptEditor AndrewCollins s := conclusion_true
  -- But 'h' asserts that such an existential leads to False, which contradicts 'pos'.
  -- We cannot complete this proof of ¬(...) because the existential actually holds.
