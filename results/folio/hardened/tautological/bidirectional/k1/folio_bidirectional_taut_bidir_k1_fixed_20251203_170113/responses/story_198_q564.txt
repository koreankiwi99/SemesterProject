Premises: Not false is true. When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox. 
Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals.
Humans are mammals.
Mammals are animals.
Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness. 
People feel tired when they get the flu.
Conclusion: No one gets the flu.
