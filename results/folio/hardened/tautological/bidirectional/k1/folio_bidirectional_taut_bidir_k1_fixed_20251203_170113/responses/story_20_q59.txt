Lean Code:
axiom Game : Type
axiom Company : Type

axiom Zelda : Game

axiom JapaneseCompany : Company → Prop
axiom Created : Company → Game → Prop
axiom Top10 : Game → Prop
axiom SoldOver1M : Game → Prop

-- Premise: "False or not true is false."
axiom premise1 : (False ∨ ¬ True) → False

-- Premise: A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.
axiom premise2 : ∃ c : Company, JapaneseCompany c ∧ Created c Zelda

-- Premise: All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
axiom premise3 : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → ∃ c : Company, JapaneseCompany c ∧ Created c g

-- Premise: If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
axiom premise4 : ∀ g : Game, SoldOver1M g → Top10 g

-- Premise: The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.
axiom premise5 : SoldOver1M Zelda

-- From the premises, we can derive that The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.
theorem zeldaTop10 : Top10 Zelda := by
  exact premise4 Zelda premise5

-- Conclusion to analyze: The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list.
theorem conclusion : ¬ Top10 Zelda := by
  -- From the premises we actually get Top10 Zelda.
  have hTop : Top10 Zelda := zeldaTop10
  -- This contradicts the desired conclusion, so the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
