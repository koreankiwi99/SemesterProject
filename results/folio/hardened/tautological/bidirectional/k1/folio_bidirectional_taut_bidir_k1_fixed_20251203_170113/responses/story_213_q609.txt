-- Premise: All Romance languages are Indo-European languages.
axiom Romance_subset_IndoEuropean : ∀ x : Language, InFamily x Romance → IndoEuropean x

-- Premise: Romance languages are a language family.
-- (We model this by having 'Romance : Family'.)

-- Premise: All languages within a language family are related to each other.
axiom related_within_family : ∀ (F : Family) (a b : Language), InFamily a F → InFamily b F → Related a b

-- Premise: French and Spanish are both Romance languages.

axiom Spanish_in_Romance : InFamily Spanish Romance

-- Premise: German is related to Spanish.
axiom German_related_Spanish : Related German Spanish

-- Premise: Basque is not related to any other language.
axiom Basque_is_isolate : ∀ x : Language, x ≠ Basque → ¬ Related Basque x

-- Conclusion to analyze: German is a Romance language.
theorem German_is_Romance : InFamily German Romance := by
  -- From the given premises, 'Related German Spanish' does not imply that
  -- German and Spanish are in the same family, since we only know
  -- that being in the same family implies being related, not the converse.
  -- Hence the conclusion cannot be derived from the premises provided.

  intro hGermanRomance
  -- From Romance(Spanish) and Romance(German), we can derive that they are related.
  have hRel1 : Related German Spanish :=
    related_if_both_romance German Spanish hGermanRomance spanish_romance
  -- But we already have that German is related to Spanish by premise; no contradiction arises.
  -- No given premise links "being related" to "being in the same language family" in the reverse direction,
  -- and nothing rules out German being Romance. Hence we cannot derive a contradiction.
