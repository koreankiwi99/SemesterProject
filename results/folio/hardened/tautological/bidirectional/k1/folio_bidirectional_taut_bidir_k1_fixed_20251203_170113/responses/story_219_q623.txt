-- Interpreting "Orchestras are led by conductors" as: anyone who leads an orchestra is a conductor.

-- Conclusion to analyze: Beethoven is not a conductor.
theorem conclusion : ¬ Conductor Beethoven := by
  intro h
  -- From the premises, we can derive that Beethoven is a conductor:
  have hC : Conductor Beethoven :=
    orchestras_led_by_conductors ViennaMusicSociety Beethoven beethoven_leads_vms
  -- We now have h : Conductor Beethoven and also hC : Conductor Beethoven,
  -- but there is no way to derive a contradiction from these premises.
  -- Hence the desired conclusion does not follow from the given premises.
