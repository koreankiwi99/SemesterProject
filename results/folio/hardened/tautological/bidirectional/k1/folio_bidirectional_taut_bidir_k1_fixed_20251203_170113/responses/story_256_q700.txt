Some pets are not mammals.
Conclusion: No pets are cats.

Lean Code:
universe u

axiom Thing : Type u

axiom Cat : Thing → Prop
axiom Mammal : Thing → Prop
axiom Pet : Thing → Prop

-- Premise 1: "False and true is not true."
axiom premise1 : ¬ (False ∧ True)

-- Premise 2: All cats are mammals.
axiom allCatsAreMammals : ∀ x : Thing, Cat x → Mammal x

-- Premise 3: Some pets are not mammals.
axiom somePetNotMammal : ∃ x : Thing, Pet x ∧ ¬ Mammal x

-- Conclusion to analyze: No pets are cats.
theorem noPetsAreCats : ∀ x : Thing, Pet x → ¬ Cat x := by
  intro x
  intro hxPet
  intro hxCat
  -- From hxCat and the premise that all cats are mammals, we get that x is a mammal.
  have hxMammal : Mammal x := allCatsAreMammals x hxCat
  -- We only know that there exists some (possibly different) pet that is not a mammal.
  -- This does not yield a contradiction for this particular x.
