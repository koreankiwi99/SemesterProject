-- "Billings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S."
axiom premise1 : InState Billings Montana

-- "The state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula."
axiom premise2a : InState Butte Montana
axiom premise2b : InState Helena Montana

-- "White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S."
-- We formalize this as: for any state s, WSS is in s iff Butte is in s.

-- "The city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana."
axiom premise4 : ¬ InState StPierre Montana

-- "Any city in Butte is not in St Pierre."
-- Interpreted as: Butte and St Pierre are not in the same state (for any state s).

-- "A city can only be in one state in U.S. except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City."

  -- From the premises we have directly that Missoula is in Montana:

  -- Thus there is no way to derive a contradiction here from the given premises.
