Premises: False or not false is true. All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.
Conclusion: A design by Max is a brutalist building.

-- 1. "False or not false is true."

-- Useful derived lemmas (attempts to use the premises)

-- Conclusion to analyze: "A design by Max is a brutalist building."
-- We formalize this as: there exists a design (in the domain of Max's designs) that is brutalist.

  -- Attempt: From the given premises, there is no way to produce an existential witness
  -- of a brutalist design. The premises constrain properties of adored designs,

  -- Thus, this goal does not follow from the premises.
