-- Negation of the conclusion to analyze: James has lunch in the company.
theorem goal : LunchInCompany James := by
  -- Attempt to derive LunchInCompany James from the given premises.
  -- Observation: The premises that constrain lunch locations and remote work apply only to employees.
  -- There is no premise that James is an employee, nor any premise connecting "appears/goes to company" with lunch.
  -- Hence, from the given premises alone, LunchInCompany James is not derivable.
