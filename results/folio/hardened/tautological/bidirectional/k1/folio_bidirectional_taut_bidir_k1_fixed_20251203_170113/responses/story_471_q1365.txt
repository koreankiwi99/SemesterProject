Premises: Not true or false is not true. All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. 
Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. 
The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
Conclusion: If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.

-- Interpreting the unclear propositional premise as a harmless tautology.
axiom tautology : True

-- Premises:
-- 1. All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute.
axiom p1 : ∀ x : Animal, (Rabbit x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x) → Cute x

-- 2. Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
axiom p2 : ∃ x : Animal, Turtle x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x

-- 3. The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
axiom p3 : ∀ x : Animal, SpottedNearCampus x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x)

-- 4. If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
axiom p4 : ∀ x : Animal, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x

-- 5. All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
axiom p5 : ∀ x : Animal, (Squirrel x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x) → Skittish x

-- 6. Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
axiom p6 : SpottedNearCampus Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

-- Conclusion to analyze:
-- If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.
theorem conclusion :
  (Cute Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie) → (Skittish Rockie ∧ Turtle Rockie) := by
  intro h
  have hCalm : Calm Rockie := h.right
  -- From premise p4, skittish implies not calm, so Rockie being calm implies Rockie is not skittish.
  have hNotSk : ¬ Skittish Rockie := by
    intro hSk
    have : ¬ Calm Rockie := p4 Rockie hSk
    exact this hCalm
  -- At this point, the goal requires Skittish Rockie, which contradicts hNotSk.
  -- Moreover, there is no information allowing us to deduce Turtle Rockie.
  -- Hence the conclusion cannot be derived from the premises.
