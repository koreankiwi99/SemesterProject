-- Premise: Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.

-- Conclusion to analyze: James has lunch in the company.
theorem goal : LunchInCompany James := by
  -- From the given premises alone, the conclusion does not follow.
  -- There is no premise asserting that James is an employee, nor that he appears/goes to the company,
  -- and there is no link between appearing and going to the building. Hence we cannot derive LunchInCompany James.
