Hence, Coco is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\n- All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male. Since Coco is at Roland Garros 2022 and not male, she is female.\n- All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.

In any of these cases, not BakedSweet holds (since Spicy or MalaHotpot each imply not BakedSweet). Therefore DTC are not BakedSweet.\n- From not BakedSweet and Cupcake -> BakedSweet, we get not Cupcake.\n- From not Cupcake and (BBMProduct -> Cupcake), we get not BBMProduct.\n- Whether DTC are Spicy or MalaHotpot remains undetermined from the given disjunction.\n\nQuestion 1: Are Dried Thai chilies products of Baked by Melissa?\n- We derived not BBMProduct.

True.\n\nQuestion 3: Are Dried Thai chilies a mala hotpot?\n- Not entailed; disjunction allows being merely not BakedSweet.

This only links MB and LWS to have the same truth value; it does not tell us which case holds. There is no rule connecting MB to LWS via H because S implies often live at home (OH), not necessarily live at home (H). Therefore, we cannot eliminate either branch.\n\nQuestion 1: Whether Luke spends a lot of time with siblings (S) depends on MB, which is unknown from the given information.

So S is unknown.\n\nAnswers to questions:\n1) Taylor eats salads regularly? Undetermined from \u00acH and \u00acD. So Unknown.\n2) Taylor visits the gym at least once a day?
