Story ID: 166
Premises: True or true is true. Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Tom will rent if: (allowed to move in with Fluffy) AND (security deposit ≤ $1500).
- At The Olive Garden: monthly rent = $2000; security deposit is equal to rent or more ⇒ deposit ≥ $2000 ⇒ deposit ≤ $1500 is false.
- The sufficient condition for renting is not met. The converse is not given, so we cannot conclude whether he will rent.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Fluffy is a cat; cats are pets ⇒ Fluffy is a pet.
- If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.
- We only know that some managed buildings allow pets; we do not know whether The Olive Garden allows pets.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The Olive Garden is a managed building; its monthly rent is $2000.
- Security deposit at a managed building is equal to the monthly rent or more ⇒ at least $2000 at The Olive Garden.
- Statement “either $2000 or more” is therefore satisfied.
- Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
