Premises: True or true is true. If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.

If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z
Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Michael is taller than everyone else in his class. Peter is taller than Michael. By transitivity, Peter is taller than every person in Michael’s class. Therefore, there is no man in Michael’s class taller than Peter; the claim that Peter is shorter than a man in Michael’s class is false.
- If a person does not jump when shooting, Michael can block them. Since Michael cannot block Windy’s shooting, Windy must jump when shooting. Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter. Hence, Windy is a great shooter.
- For Peter to be able to block Windy via the given rule, Windy would need to be a man and shorter than Peter; neither is established. The special blocking rule about non-jumping applies only to Michael. Thus we cannot determine whether Peter can block Windy.
