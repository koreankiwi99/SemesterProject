==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- "Stranger Things" is a popular Netflix show.
- If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it → Karen binge-watches "Stranger Things."
- If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa → Karen shares "Stranger Things."
Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show.
- If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it → Binge-watches iff Downloads. Therefore, not download implies not binge-watch.
- Karen does not download "Black Mirror" → Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror."
- If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it. Contrapositive (for a Netflix show): if she does not binge-watch it, it is not popular.
- Therefore, "Black Mirror" is not popular.
Conclusion: False (the statement “Black Mirror is popular” is false).

Question 3:
- From above, Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror."
- If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa → only gives share from binge; it does not state she shares only if she binge-watches.
- We cannot infer she will share or not share "Black Mirror."
Conclusion: Unknown.
