Machine translation is a natural language processing task.
The output of machine translation is a text sequence.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Machine translation (MT) is a natural language processing (NLP) task.
- The output of MT is a text sequence.
- Given: If the output of an NLP task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.
- Therefore, MT is a language generation task. Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- Given: An NLP task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task (taken as mutually exclusive categories).
- From Question 1, MT is a language generation task.
- Therefore, MT is not a language understanding task. Conclusion: False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
