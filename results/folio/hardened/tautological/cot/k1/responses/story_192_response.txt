Story ID: 192
Premises: False and true is not true. International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
Mike is an international student.
Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Given: International students in the US have either an F1 or a J1 visa. If an international student in the US has an F1 visa and wants to work in the US, they need to apply for CPT or OPT. Mike is an international student. Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.
- We are not told Mike is in the US.
- The rule about CPT/OPT is one-way: F1 and wanting to work implies needing CPT or OPT. Knowing that Mike needs CPT does not imply he has F1 (no converse is given), and nothing links J1 to CPT. Therefore, we cannot conclude which visa Mike has.
