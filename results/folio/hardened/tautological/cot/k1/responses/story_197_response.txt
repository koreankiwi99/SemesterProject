Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- ETS provides aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
- People in single-parent families or with few resources can prove hardship.
- Tom is a GRE applicant and fits those conditions, so he can prove hardship.
- However, the text does not say that Tom actually did prove it; therefore we cannot conclude he receives aid.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The text states the GRE costs $205 and that this is cheaper than $300.
- Therefore, it costs below $300.
- Conclusion: True.

Question 3:
- The statement claims no GRE test taker has financial aid provided to them.
- The text says ETS provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove hardship, making it possible that some do receive aid.
- But we are not told that any specific test taker actually received aid.
- Conclusion: Unknown.
