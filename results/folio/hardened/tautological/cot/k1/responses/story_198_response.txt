Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- The statement "Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals" implies that there exist animals in which it can occur. Therefore, at least one animal exists.
- Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- We only know: "People feel tired when they get the flu." This is conditional and does not state whether anyone actually gets the flu.
- We cannot infer that no one gets the flu, nor do we have a counterexample.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The text lists Monkeypox symptoms as including fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness. "Include" suggests a non-exhaustive list, so coughing might or might not be a symptom.
- We cannot conclude that coughing is included from the given information.
- Conclusion: Unknown.
