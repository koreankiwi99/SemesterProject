==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Romance languages form a language family.
- All languages within a language family are related to each other.
- French and Spanish are Romance languages, so the Romance family has multiple members.
- Basque is not related to any other language, so it cannot be in a family with other languages, including the Romance family.
