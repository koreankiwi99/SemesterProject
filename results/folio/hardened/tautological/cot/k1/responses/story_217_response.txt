Story ID: 217
Premises: Not false and true is true. If George likes music, he wants to compose.
If George has access to a program, he can compose.
If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- If George likes music (L), then he wants to compose (W).
- If George has access to a program (A), then he can compose (C).
- If he can compose and wants to compose (C ∧ W), then he will compose (P).
- From L ∧ A, we get W and C, hence C ∧ W, hence P. So the implication holds.

Question 2:
- From (C ∧ W) -> P, the contrapositive is ¬P -> (¬C ∨ ¬W).
- This does not entail ¬C alone. It could be that he can compose but does not want to (C true, W false), making P false without implying ¬C.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude ¬C from ¬P; the statement’s truth is not determined.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
