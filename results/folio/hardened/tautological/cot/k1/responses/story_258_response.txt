==================================================
Reasoning:
- Premises: All humans are mortal. All Greeks are humans.
- From these, it follows universally that all Greeks are mortal (if something is a Greek, then it is mortal).
- However, universal statements do not guarantee existence. We are not told that any Greeks exist.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude that there exists at least one Greek who is mortal.
