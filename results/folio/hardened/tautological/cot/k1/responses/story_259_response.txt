Story ID: 259
Premises: Not true and true is false. All horses have hooves.
No humans have hooves.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "All horses have hooves": For any x, if x is a horse, then x has hooves.
- From "No humans have hooves": For any x, if x is a human, then x does not have hooves.
- If any human were a horse, they would both have hooves and not have hooves, a contradiction. Hence no human is a horse.
- Therefore, the statement "Some humans are horses" is false.
- The sentence "Not true and true is false." is irrelevant to the quantifier reasoning.

ANSWERS:
1: False
