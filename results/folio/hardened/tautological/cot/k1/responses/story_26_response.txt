Premises: True and true is not false. Some mammals have teeth.
Platypuses have no teeth.
Platypuses are mammals. 
Humans have teeth.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. The text states “Platypuses have no teeth” and “Platypuses are mammals.” Combining these, the statement “Platypuses are mammals with no teeth” is directly supported. True.
2. The text says platypuses are mammals, but provides no information about reptiles or whether mammals and reptiles are mutually exclusive. So we cannot conclude they are reptiles. Unknown.
3. The text says “Humans have teeth” and “Some mammals have teeth,” but that does not imply that humans are mammals (having teeth does not entail being a mammal). No direct statement that humans are mammals is given. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
