==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- "Events are either happy or sad" indicates each event falls into exactly one of the two categories.
- "At least one event is happy" means there exists at least one event that is happy.
- If all events were sad, there could be no happy events. This contradicts the given that at least one event is happy.
- Therefore, the statement "All events are sad" is false.
