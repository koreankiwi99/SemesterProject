Premises: True is not false. Some affection is love.
Some love is positive.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let A = affection, L = love, P = positive.
- Premises: (1) Some A are L (∃x: x∈A∧x∈L). (2) Some L are P (∃y: y∈L∧y∈P).
- The individuals x and y need not be the same. Without a universal statement linking L to P or A to L, we cannot infer ∃z: z∈A∧z∈P.
- Countermodel: Take L = {a, b}, A = {a}, P = {b}. Then both premises hold, but A∩P = ∅, so the conclusion fails in this model.
- Therefore, the statement does not logically follow; its truth is undetermined from the given information.
