Story ID: 2
Premises: Not false and true is true. Billings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.
The state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.
White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.
The city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.
Any city in Butte is not in St Pierre.
A city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. Butte is in Montana. St Pierre is not in Montana. Cities (except listed exceptions, which do not include these) can only be in one state. Therefore, they cannot be in the same state.
2. The text gives no information about Bismarck’s state. We only know St Pierre is not in Montana. We cannot determine whether St Pierre and Bismarck share a state.
3. The text explicitly states that Montana includes Missoula.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: Unknown
3: True
