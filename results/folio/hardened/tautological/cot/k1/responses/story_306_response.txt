Story ID: 306
Premises: Not true and true is false. If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews.
All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From: All popular restaurants have ratings > 4; and H (Hamden Plaza Subway store) is either > 4 or popular. Therefore, H has rating > 4.
- From: All with rating > 4 are listed in Yelp’s recommendations; and all listed have not received many negative reviews. Therefore, H does not receive many negative reviews (¬N(H)).
- We have no information about whether H provides take-out service (T(H)).

Question 1:
- Statement: If H provides take-out and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is > 4 and it does not provide take-out.
- Since we know ¬N(H), the antecedent (T(H) ∧ N(H)) is false. A false antecedent makes the implication true.

Question 2:
- Statement: H provides take-out or does not receive many negative reviews.
- We know ¬N(H), so the disjunction is true.

Question 3:
- Statement: The Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service.
- We have no information about H’s take-out, and "Hamden Plaza store" is not clearly identified as the same as H. Either way, we cannot conclude ¬T. Hence unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
