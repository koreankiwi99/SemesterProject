Story ID: 318
Premises: Not false and false is false. Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.
If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.
Breaking Bad is a show.
Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the premises: If a show gives out roses on TV, then it is an episode of The Bachelor. The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people, and all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. Therefore, any show that gives out roses on TV is a reality TV show. Since Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, it follows (by modus tollens) that Breaking Bad does not give out roses on TV.

Question 1:
- We only know that some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses; nothing links Breaking Bad to that timeslot. No information implies or denies that Breaking Bad airs then. So this is uncertain.

Question 2:
- The statement asserts that Breaking Bad is a show in which roses are given out (at Monday 8 pm). But we deduced Breaking Bad does not give out roses at all. Hence this statement is false.

Question 3:
- Since Breaking Bad does not give out roses, the antecedent “roses are given out during Breaking Bad” is false in all models consistent with the premises. Therefore, the conditional is vacuously true.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
