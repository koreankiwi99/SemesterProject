==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "No baked sweets are spicy," we get: BakedSweet -> not Spicy, and thus Spicy -> not BakedSweet.
- Cupcake -> BakedSweet.
- Baked by Melissa product -> Cupcake -> BakedSweet.
- Mala hotpot -> Spicy -> not BakedSweet.
- Dried Thai chilies (DTC) satisfy: Spicy or MalaHotpot or not BakedSweet. In any of these cases, not BakedSweet holds (since Spicy or MalaHotpot each imply not BakedSweet). Therefore DTC are not BakedSweet.
- From not BakedSweet and Cupcake -> BakedSweet, we get not Cupcake.
- From not Cupcake and (BBMProduct -> Cupcake), we get not BBMProduct.
- Whether DTC are Spicy or MalaHotpot remains undetermined from the given disjunction.

Question 1: Are Dried Thai chilies products of Baked by Melissa?
- We derived not BBMProduct. So False.

Question 2: Are Dried Thai chilies not products of Baked by Melissa?
- Yes, as above. True.

Question 3: Are Dried Thai chilies a mala hotpot?
