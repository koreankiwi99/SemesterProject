Premises: True or true is true. All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
Some stocks are growth stocks.
All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
KO is a mature stock.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation. (Growth → Bought)
- If a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund. (Bought → ¬Suitable)
- Some stocks are growth stocks. (∃x Stock(x) ∧ Growth(x))
- All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. (Mature → Suitable)
- KO is a mature stock. (Mature(KO))

From KO is a mature stock, KO is a stock and Mature(KO). From Mature(KO) and Mature → Suitable, we get Suitable(KO).
Using contrapositive of Bought → ¬Suitable, we get Suitable → ¬Bought, so ¬Bought(KO).
Using contrapositive of Growth → Bought, we get ¬Bought → ¬Growth, so ¬Growth(KO).

Question 1:
- KO is a mature stock, hence a stock. True.

Question 2:
- We have KO is a stock, but also ¬Growth(KO). So “KO is a stock and a growth stock” is false.

Question 3:
- Antecedent: “KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation” is (Growth(KO) ∨ Bought(KO)), which is false since ¬Growth(KO) and ¬Bought(KO).
- A conditional with a false antecedent is true regardless of the consequent. Hence the statement is true.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: True
