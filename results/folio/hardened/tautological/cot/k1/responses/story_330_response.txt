Story ID: 330
Premises: Not true and false is false. All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the premises:
  - InviteOthers(x) -> MakePlans(x) -> Engaged(x).
  - WellAttended(x) -> InviteOthers(x).
  - Some x: WellAttended(x) and LargerFamily(x) (existential; not necessarily John).
  - If Engaged(John), then John does not invite friends and John makes wedding plans (so for John, Engaged ↔ MakePlans).
  - If LargerFamily(John), then WellAttended(John) or InviteFriends(John).
- There is no premise directly asserting anything about John having a larger family, inviting others, or being engaged. The rules are conditional and/or existential about someone, not specifically John, except the implications that don’t trigger without antecedents.

Question 1: Does John have a larger family?
- Only conditional: LargerFamily(John) -> (WellAttended(John) or InviteFriends(John)). No trigger is given. The existential about “some people” does not identify John.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2: Does John not have a larger family?
- No rule excludes John from having a larger family. Neither LargerFamily(John) nor its negation is derivable.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3: Is John engaged?
- John would be engaged if he makes plans or invites others (which entails plans) or has a well-attended wedding (which entails inviting others). None is given for John.
- The conditional “If John is engaged, then …” does not allow concluding he is engaged.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 4: Does John neither have a larger family nor invite others to his wedding?
- Both components (not LargerFamily(John) and not InviteOthers(John)) are individually undetermined; thus their conjunction is undetermined.
- Conclusion: Unknown.
