==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Given: Djokovic is at the mixer. Everyone at the mixer is either a Grand Slam champion (GSC) or an Oscar-nominated actor (ONA).
- If GSC at the mixer → professional tennis player → athlete; and athletes at the mixer are famous.
- If ONA at the mixer → celebrity; and celebrities at the mixer are well-paid.
- All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens.
- Special fact about Djokovic: If he is a famous athlete, then he is well-paid.

Question 1:
- From “at the mixer” we only know Djokovic is GSC or ONA, but we cannot determine which. So whether Djokovic is a GSC is not entailed.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Case 1 (ONA): At + ONA → celebrity → well-paid → lives in a tax haven.
- Case 2 (GSC): At + GSC → PTP → athlete; At + athlete → famous; Famous + athlete (Djokovic-specific rule) → well-paid; At + well-paid → lives in a tax haven.
- In either case, Djokovic lives in a tax haven.
- Answer: True.

Question 3:
- This is the negation of Question 2’s conclusion, which we derived as true.
- Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
