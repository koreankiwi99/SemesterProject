==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Premises:
  - Streaming service → digital media.
  - No digital media are analog (digital → not analog).
  - Printed text → analog media.
  - Hardcover book → printed text.
  - If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.

- Deriving about 1984 being a streaming service:
  - Assume 1984 is a streaming service.
  - Then 1984 is digital and a hardcover book.
  - Hardcover book → printed text → analog.
  - So 1984 would be both digital and analog, contradicting “no digital media are analog.”
  - Therefore, 1984 is not a streaming service.

Question 1: To be printed text, we would need 1984 to be a hardcover book (or otherwise given as printed). The only path given is via being a streaming service, which we just ruled out. No other information implies it is printed text. So Unknown.

Question 2: As shown, 1984 is not a streaming service. So the claim that it is a streaming service is False.

Question 3: As shown, 1984 is not a streaming service. So the claim “1984 is not a streaming service” is True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
