Story ID: 350
Premises: False or not false is true. All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative” and “No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries,” it follows that there cannot be any design by Max that he adores which has interesting geometries (otherwise we get a contradiction).
- “All of Zaha Hadid’s design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries,” so Max adores no Zaha Hadid styles.
- “Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid’s or Kelly Wearstler’s,” hence any adored style (if any exist) would be Kelly Wearstler’s, and thus evocative and dreamy by the given rules.
- However, nothing in the premises guarantees the existence of any design or style that Max adores (or any design by Max at all), nor of any brutalist building. Therefore, the existential claims in all three questions cannot be established from the premises.
