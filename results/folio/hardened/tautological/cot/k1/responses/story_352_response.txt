Premises: Not false is true. All business organizations are legal entities.

All private companies are companies.
All legal entities are created under law. 
All legal entities have legal obligations.
If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the universals: Private company -> Company -> Business organization -> Legal entity. Also, Legal entity -> Created under law and Legal entity -> Has legal obligations.
- Therefore, for any x: Private company(x) -> Created under law(x), and Private company(x) -> Has legal obligations(x).
- Given specifically: If the Harvard Weekly Book Club (H) is created under law, then it is not a private company: Created under law(H) -> not Private company(H).

Question 1:
- To conclude H has legal obligations, we would need H to be a legal entity. Nothing given establishes that H is a legal entity (or that it is a company/business organization). The conditional about being created under law does not assert that H is created under law.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether H has legal obligations.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- From the chains above, Private company(H) -> Created under law(H). Combined with Created under law(H) -> not Private company(H), we get Private company(H) -> not Private company(H), which entails not Private company(H).
- Hence H is not a private company. The conjunction “has legal obligations and is a private company” is therefore false (regardless of the obligations part).
- Answer: False.

Question 3:
- If H were a private company, then by the chains it would be a legal entity, hence have legal obligations, and also be created under law. Thus the consequent “has legal obligations or is created under law” would be true under that assumption.
- Therefore the conditional is true.
- Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
