Story ID: 361
Premises: Not false is true. If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let S = spills a lot; C = cleanly; T = notably tidy; CF = clumsy foodie who goes out frequently; F = family prioritizes order.
- Given: S ⇒ ¬T; C ⇒ T; CF ⇒ S; F ⇒ value ⇒ C.
- Peter: (S ∧ C) ∨ (¬S ∧ ¬C).

Eliminate S ∧ C: If S and C, then ¬T and T, a contradiction. Therefore Peter must satisfy ¬S ∧ ¬C.

Question 1:
- From ¬S and ¬C, we cannot conclude T or ¬T (only S ⇒ ¬T and C ⇒ T are given; their contrapositives are T ⇒ ¬S and ¬T ⇒ ¬C). So Peter’s tidiness is undetermined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- From ¬S and CF ⇒ S, by contraposition ¬S ⇒ ¬CF, so Peter is not CF.
- From ¬C and F ⇒ C (via F ⇒ value ⇒ C), by contraposition ¬C ⇒ ¬F, so Peter is not F.
- Thus “CF or F” is false.
- Answer: False.

Question 3:
- We have ¬CF ∧ ¬F, so the disjunction “(CF ∧ F) or (¬CF ∧ ¬F)” holds via the second disjunct.
- Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
