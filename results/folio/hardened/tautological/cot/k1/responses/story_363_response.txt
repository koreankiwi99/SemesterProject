Story ID: 363
Premises: Not true or true is true. All hydrocarbons are organic compounds .
All alkanes are hydrocarbons
All organic compounds are chemical compounds.
All organic compounds contain carbon.
No chemical compounds contain only one element.
The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “No chemical compounds contain only one element” and “The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither,” the first option (both) is impossible. Therefore the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor single-element: ¬CC(mixture) and ¬OneElement(mixture).
- Using contraposition on the universal statements:
  - All organic compounds are chemical compounds (OC -> CC) gives ¬CC -> ¬OC, so the mixture is not organic.
  - All hydrocarbons are organic compounds (HC -> OC) gives ¬OC -> ¬HC, so the mixture is not a hydrocarbon.
  - All alkanes are hydrocarbons (Alk -> HC) gives ¬HC -> ¬Alk, so the mixture is not an alkane.
- The only rule about carbon is: All organic compounds contain carbon (OC -> C). From ¬OC we cannot infer ¬C, so carbon content remains undetermined.

Question 1: We cannot deduce whether the mixture contains carbon. Unknown.

Question 2: The mixture is not an alkane, so “alkane and contains carbon” is false regardless of carbon. False.

Question 3: The consequent “neither a chemical compound nor an alkane” is true from the above deductions; hence the conditional is true. True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
