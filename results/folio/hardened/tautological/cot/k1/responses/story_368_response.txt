Story ID: 368
Premises: Not true and true is false. If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition.
If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus.
People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.
If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters.
If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.
Hannah is at Mary's school.
Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- For anyone at Mary's school: work_on_campus -> needs_money.
- order_takeout -> work_on_campus.
- order_takeout or enjoy_dining.
- enjoy_dining -> not_picky.
- enjoy_dining -> spends_time_in_dining_halls.
- Hannah is at Mary's school.
- Hannah works_on_campus, and if she needs_money then (not_picky and not needs_money).

Derivations:
- From Hannah works_on_campus and work_on_campus -> needs_money, we get needs_money(Hannah).
- From the conditional about Hannah, needs_money(Hannah) -> (not_picky(Hannah) and not needs_money(Hannah)), so we also get not_picky(Hannah) and not needs_money(Hannah). This yields a contradiction about needs_money, but not_picky(Hannah) still follows.
- We cannot determine enjoys_dining(Hannah), so we cannot derive spends_time_in_dining_halls(Hannah).

Question 1:
- needs_money(Hannah) is derivable (from work_on_campus), so True.

Question 2:
- At_school(Hannah): True.
- not_picky(Hannah): True.
- spends_time_in_dining_halls(Hannah): not derivable.
- The conjunction requires all three; therefore Unknown.

Question 3:
- At_school(Hannah): True.
- not_picky(Hannah) is derivable, so the disjunction [not_picky or (picky -> spends_time)] is true via the first disjunct.
- Conjunction holds: True.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: True
