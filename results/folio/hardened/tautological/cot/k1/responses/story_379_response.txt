Story ID: 379
Premises: False and not true is false. People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.
If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.
If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. 
Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the rules:
  - Born in a multiple birth with siblings -> spends a lot of time with siblings (S).
  - Have siblings born together -> born in a multiple birth (MB).
  - Complain often about annoying siblings (CA) -> have siblings born together -> MB.
  - Spend a lot of time with siblings -> often live at home (OH). Note: OH does not imply live at home (H).
  - Live at home (H) -> not live with strangers (¬LWS).

- The disjunction about Luke says: either (MB and LWS) or (¬MB and ¬LWS). This only links MB and LWS to have the same truth value; it does not tell us which case holds. There is no rule connecting MB to LWS via H because S implies often live at home (OH), not necessarily live at home (H). Therefore, we cannot eliminate either branch.

Question 1: Whether Luke spends a lot of time with siblings (S) depends on MB, which is unknown from the given information. So Unknown.

Question 2: Complaining often (CA) would imply MB, but since MB itself is undetermined by the premises, we cannot determine CA. So Unknown.

Question 3: The claim “neither MB nor CA” requires both ¬MB and ¬CA. We cannot establish ¬MB, nor ¬CA, from the information. So Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
