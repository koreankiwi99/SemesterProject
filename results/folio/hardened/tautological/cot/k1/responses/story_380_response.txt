People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Let P = performs in school talent shows often, A = attends and is very engaged with school events, S = student who attends the school, C = chaperones high school dances, I = inactive/disinterested community member, Y = young child/teenager who wishes to further academic careers/opportunities.

Given:
- P → A.
- P ∨ I.
- C → ¬S.
- I → C, hence I → ¬S.
- Y → S.
- For Bonnie: (A ∧ S) ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬S), i.e., A ↔ S.

Question 1:
- From P ∨ I.
- If I, then ¬S and by A ↔ S, ¬A; P is not forced to be true.
- If ¬I, then by P ∨ I we get P; then P → A and A ↔ S gives S.
- Both branches are consistent, so P(bonnie) is not determined.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- For Bonnie, from P ∨ I: if I then the consequent S ∨ I holds. If ¬I then P, hence A, and by A ↔ S we get S; thus S ∨ I holds.
- Therefore the consequent always holds regardless of the antecedent, making the implication true.
Answer: True.

Question 3:
- Antecedent: C ∨ (¬C → P) ≡ C ∨ (C ∨ P) ≡ C ∨ P.
- From P ∨ I and I → C, we get C ∨ P always true.
- Consequent: Y ∧ I. But Y → S and I → ¬S imply Y ∧ I is impossible (would yield S ∧ ¬S). Hence ¬(Y ∧ I) is entailed.
- Thus antecedent true and consequent false, so the implication is false.
Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
