Story ID: 385
Premises: True and false is not true. If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. 
Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- If Coco Gauff were a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, then by “All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal,” she would have lost to Nadal. Then, by “If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022,” she would not be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022—a contradiction. Hence, Coco is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
- All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male. Since Coco is at Roland Garros 2022 and not male, she is female.
- All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek. Therefore, Coco lost to Iga.
- Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the WTA. Hence, Coco is ranked highly.
- If someone is ranked highly by the WTA, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis (i.e., Grand-Slam players). Therefore, Coco is among the most active Grand-Slam players.

Question 1: True, as shown above.

Question 2: Unknown. The only rule about losing to Rafael Nadal applies to male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022. We have established Coco is not male, and there is no rule stating non-male players lost to Nadal, so it cannot be determined.

Question 3: False. We have that Coco lost to Iga and is one of the most active players in major tennis, so she is both; the negation of that conjunction is therefore false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
