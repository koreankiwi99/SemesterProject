Story ID: 386
Premises: Not true or false is not true. If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given premises:
- Bile duct cancer -> severe cancer -> deadly disease -> low survival rate.
- Cholangiocarcinoma -> bile duct cancer.
- Mild flu -> low survival rate.
- Colorectal cancer is not (bile duct cancer and low survival).

From bile duct -> low survival and not(bile duct and low survival), we deduce colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer. Since Cholangiocarcinoma implies bile duct cancer, colorectal cancer is also not Cholangiocarcinoma. We have no information linking colorectal cancer to being severe or to being mild flu.

Question 1:
No premise states colorectal cancer is severe, nor can it be derived. Unknown.

Question 2:
Antecedent (bile duct cancer or Cholangiocarcinoma) is false (both are excluded). Hence the implication is vacuously true. True.

Question 3:
The statement effectively says: (Cholangiocarcinoma and mild flu) or bile duct cancer (the “all of the above” is redundant). Since Cholangiocarcinoma implies bile duct cancer, this reduces to bile duct cancer. We have shown colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer. False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False

==================================================
Q1: Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu.
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes

Q3: Colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above.
Ground Truth: False
