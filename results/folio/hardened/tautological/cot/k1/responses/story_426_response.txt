Story ID: 426
Premises: Not true and false is false. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. 
Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. 
Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. 
No managers work remotely from home. 
James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the rules: lunch in the company building -> schedules meeting -> goes to/appears at the company today.
- James appears at the company today iff he is a manager.
- Lunch at home -> works remotely from home. No managers work remotely.
- Employees have lunch either in the building or at home. If James is a manager (and hence not remote), then he cannot have lunch at home, so (assuming he is an employee) he must have lunch in the building. If he is not a manager, lunch in the building would force appearing at the company, contradicting “not a manager,” so then he must have lunch at home. But we are not told whether James is a manager, nor whether he is in other countries.
- Therefore, whether James has lunch in the company is undetermined.

Question 1:
- If James is a manager, then (as above) he has lunch in the company; if he is not a manager, then he does not. Since we do not know whether he is a manager, this is undetermined.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- This is the negation of Question 1’s claim. For the same reason, it is undetermined.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The two implications given are contrapositives of each other and together amount to: (Manager or In-other-countries) -> neither lunch at home nor remote, and equivalently (Lunch at home or Remote) -> neither manager nor in other countries.
- Given the rules, if James is in other countries, then he is remote, which would make the first implication’s consequent false. If James is a manager (and not in other countries), the implication can hold. Because both truth and falsity are possible under the given information, the statement is not determined.
Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
