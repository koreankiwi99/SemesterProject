Story ID: 435
Premises: True is not false. None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department. 
All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. 
All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department. 
All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. 
All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.
James is a student working in the lab. 
James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David” and “All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course,” James working in the lab implies James takes the database course.
- From “All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department,” James is CS.
- From “All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library” and “None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department,” any university part-time job would imply not CS. This conflicts with James being CS, but we have no premise that James has such a job.
- The statement “James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university” reads as “not (lab OR university PT),” i.e., not lab and not university PT. This contradicts “James is a student working in the lab,” yielding both lab and not lab. However, we still have an explicit “not university PT,” and there is no rule deriving that he does have a university PT job. Also, there is no rule giving not-database, while we have a direct chain from lab to database.

Question 1:
- We have an explicit “not university PT” and no support for “has university PT.” So the claim “James has a part-time job offered by the university” is false.

Question 2:
- As above, “not university PT” is explicitly stated and not contradicted by any rule; thus “James does not have a part-time job offered by the university” is true.

Question 3:
- From lab → professor David → database, James takes the database course; thus “database OR university PT” holds, regardless of the PT part. So true.

Question 4:
- From lab → professor David → database, James takes the database course. No premise gives not-database. So true.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
4: True
