Story ID: 442
Premises: False is not true. All Brown Swiss cattle are cows.
Some pets are Brown Swiss Cattle.
All cows are domesticated animals.
Alligators are not domesticated animals.
Ted is an alligator.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From Alligators are not domesticated animals and Ted is an alligator, we get Ted is not domesticated.
- From All cows are domesticated animals, by contrapositive, anything not domesticated is not a cow; hence Ted is not a cow.
- From All Brown Swiss cattle are cows, by contrapositive, Ted is not Brown Swiss cattle.

Question 1:
- Nothing links being a pet to being domesticated in the premises. Ted could be a pet or not; we can’t conclude either way.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Since Ted is not Brown Swiss cattle, the conjunction “Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle” is false regardless of whether Ted is a pet.
- Answer: False.

Question 3:
- The antecedent “Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle” is false; a conditional with a false antecedent is true (vacuously).
- Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
