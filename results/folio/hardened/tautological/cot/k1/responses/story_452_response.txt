Story ID: 452
Premises: Not false or true is not false. All aliens are extraterrestrials.
If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.
No extraterrestrials are human.
All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.
Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Set up:
- Alien -> Extraterrestrial (ET).
- From Mars -> Alien -> ET.
- ET -> not Human.
- HighlyIntelligent ∧ FromEarth -> Human.
- Marvin is HighlyIntelligent.
- Either (FromEarth ∧ FromMars) or (not FromEarth ∧ not FromMars).
- If not FromEarth then ET.

Case analysis on the either/or:
- If FromEarth ∧ FromMars: FromMars -> Alien -> ET -> not Human, but HighlyIntelligent ∧ FromEarth -> Human. Contradiction (Human and not Human). So this case is impossible.
- Therefore the other case holds: not FromEarth ∧ not FromMars.

From not FromEarth: ET, hence not Human.

Thus we have: not FromEarth, not FromMars, ET, not Human. No rule gives Alien from ET, so Alien status remains undetermined.

Question 1: Marvin is an alien.
- We only know ET and not Human; Alien does not follow. Not provable nor disprovable.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars.
- We derived not Human and not FromMars.
- Answer: True.

Question 3: If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human.
- Antecedent true (not FromMars), consequent false (not Human). The implication is false.
- Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
