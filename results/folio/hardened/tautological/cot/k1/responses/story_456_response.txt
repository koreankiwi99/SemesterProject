Story ID: 456
Premises: False or not false is true. Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. 
Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: Professional → JumpShot → Leap → ActivateLeg.
- Contraposition chain: ¬ActivateLeg → ¬Leap → ¬JumpShot → ¬Professional.
- Given Yuri does not activate his leg muscles, we infer Yuri is not a professional basketball player.
- No information determines Yuri’s nationality.

Question 1: We have no information about Yuri’s nationality. Unknown.

Question 2: “Not an American professional basketball player” is ¬(American ∧ Professional). Since Yuri is not a professional, this is true. True.

Question 3: “American professional basketball player” requires Professional, which Yuri is not. False.

Question 4: Antecedent (Yuri does not leap) is true (from ¬ActivateLeg). Consequent (American ∧ Professional) is false (since ¬Professional). A true antecedent and false consequent makes the implication false. False.

Question 5: Antecedent (not an American professional) is true (from ¬Professional). Consequent (Professional) is false. True antecedent, false consequent → implication false. False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
4: False
5: False
