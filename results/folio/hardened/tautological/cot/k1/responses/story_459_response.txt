Story ID: 459
Premises: Not true or true is true. Jane does not like any animals that bark.
All dogs are animals that bark.
Jane likes all animals that jump.
If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. 
KiKi is an animal.
If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Shared deductions:
- From Animal(KiKi).
- If an animal is terricolous then it has legs; if an animal has legs then it jumps.
- Special rule: (¬Jumps(KiKi) ∧ ¬Legs(KiKi)) ⇒ (Terricolous(KiKi) ∨ Legs(KiKi)).
- Using Terricolous ⇒ Legs, the special rule implies (¬J ∧ ¬L) ⇒ L, which is impossible if ¬L holds; hence ¬(¬J ∧ ¬L), i.e., Jumps(KiKi) ∨ Legs(KiKi).
- With Animal(KiKi) and Legs ⇒ Jumps, we conclude Jumps(KiKi) is true.

Also:
- Jane likes all animals that jump ⇒ Likes(Jane, KiKi).
- Jane does not like any animals that bark. If Bark(KiKi) were true, we’d get both Likes and ¬Likes for Jane and KiKi, a contradiction. Hence ¬Bark(KiKi).
- All dogs are animals that bark ⇒ Dog(x) ⇒ Bark(x). With ¬Bark(KiKi), we get ¬Dog(KiKi).

Question 1: KiKi is terricolous.
- We have no way to conclude Terricolous(KiKi) or its negation from the above. Unknown.

Question 2: KiKi is a barking dog.
- We derived ¬Bark(KiKi) and ¬Dog(KiKi). The statement is false.

Question 3: KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog.
- We derived both ¬Bark(KiKi) and ¬Dog(KiKi). The statement is true.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
