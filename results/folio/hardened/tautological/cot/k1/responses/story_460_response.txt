Story ID: 460
Premises: Not true or false is not true. If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.
If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.
All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.
“Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is a film.
“Hachi: A dog’s Tale”  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “Hachi is either a family-friendly animated film or appropriate for all ages” and the rules:
  - If family-friendly animated film → General Audience → appropriate for all ages → children can watch without guidance.
  - If appropriate for all ages → children can watch without guidance.
  Therefore, in either case, children can watch Hachi without guidance, so C(Hachi) holds.
- From “If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance” we get E → ¬C, whose contrapositive is C → ¬E. Since C(Hachi), we deduce ¬E(Hachi).

Question 1:
- To be rated General Audience, either Hachi must be a family-friendly animated film (which would imply it) or have some other reason; from the disjunction we only know FFA(Hachi) or A(Hachi). If only A(Hachi) holds, G(Hachi) need not hold. Hence not entailed nor contradicted: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement is E(Hachi) ∨ Frozen(Hachi). We have ¬E(Hachi), and no information about Frozen(Hachi). So the disjunction is uncertain: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The statement is (E ∧ Frozen) ∨ (¬E ∧ ¬Frozen). With ¬E(Hachi), this simplifies to ¬Frozen(Hachi). We have no information to conclude ¬Frozen(Hachi). Thus: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
