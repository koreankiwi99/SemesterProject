Story ID: 467
Premises: False and not true is false. All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.
All monkeys are mammals. 
Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. 
Peter's birds can fly.
All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
Rock is Peter's pet.
Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Rock is Peter's pet. All Peter's pets are either monkeys or birds, so Rock is a monkey or a bird.
- If Rock is a bird, then Rock can fly; and any Peter’s pet that can fly has wings.
- If Rock is not a bird, then by the pet rule Rock must be a monkey; then Rock is a mammal, hence an animal, hence can breathe. Given the disjunction “Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe,” and since Rock is not a bird and can breathe, it follows that Rock can fly. Therefore Rock has wings.
- Thus, regardless of whether Rock is a bird or a monkey, Rock has wings. However, we cannot determine whether Rock is specifically a monkey, because Rock could be a bird instead.

Question 1: Rock is a monkey.
- Could be a bird instead; not entailed. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Rock has wings.
- As shown above, in all cases Rock can fly and is a pet, so Rock has wings. Answer: True.

Question 3: Rock does not have wings.
- Contradicts the conclusion above. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
