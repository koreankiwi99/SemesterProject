==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Breeding back is a form of artificial selection.
- Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s.
- Therefore, artificial selection was applied in producing Heck cattle; at least some Heck cattle (those selected in the breeding process) are artificially selected.
Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- We know aurochs are animals.
- Some animals bred back resemble extinct animals.
- Heck cattle were bred back to resemble aurochs.
- From “some ... resemble extinct animals” we cannot conclude that aurochs are extinct; the “some” does not specify aurochs.
Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
