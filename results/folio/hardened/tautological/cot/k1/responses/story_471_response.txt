Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
First, derive what we can from the premises:

- Rockie is spotted near the campus and calm.
- Only rabbits or squirrels are spotted near the campus. Since Rockie is spotted, Rockie is a rabbit or a squirrel.
- All spotted squirrels are skittish, and skittish implies not calm. Since Rockie is calm, Rockie is not skittish; therefore Rockie cannot be a squirrel. Hence Rockie is a rabbit.
- All spotted rabbits are cute. Therefore Rockie is cute.

Now evaluate each statement:

1) Rockie is a turtle.
- We have no information that rules this in or out. Unknown.

2) Rockie is not a turtle.
- Also not entailed; Rockie could be both a rabbit and a turtle. Unknown.

3) Rockie is a turtle or cute.
- Rockie is cute, so the disjunction is true. True.

4) If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish.
- Rockie is not a squirrel, so the antecedent is true. Rockie is cute, so the consequent is true. The implication is True.

5) If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.
- Antecedent is true (Rockie is cute and calm). But calm implies not skittish, so Rockie is not skittish; the consequent (skittish turtle) is false. Therefore the implication is False.
