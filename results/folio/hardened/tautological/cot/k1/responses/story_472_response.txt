Story ID: 472
Premises: Not true is false. Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. 
All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
All queen bees are bees.
Harry is a bee.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Q1:
- We know: All queen bees are bees; Harry is a bee.
- The converse (all bees are queen bees) is not given, nor anything else identifying Harry as a queen.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Harry is a queen bee.
- Answer: Unknown.

Q2:
- Disjunction: Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee.
- From Q1, queen bee status is unknown.
- "Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates" classifies animals, but we are not told Harry (a bee) is an animal.
- From bee → not reproduce MF and (animal with backbone) → reproduce MF, we can infer Harry is not an animal with a backbone, but that does not establish he is an animal (hence invertebrate).
- Neither disjunct is established.
- Answer: Unknown.

Q3:
- From bee → not reproduce MF and (animal with backbone) → reproduce MF, by contraposition Harry is not an animal with a backbone.
- The antecedent is (vertebrate and animal-with-backbone) or (not vertebrate and not animal-with-backbone). Since “animal-with-backbone” is false for Harry, this antecedent reduces to “not vertebrate,” which is itself unknown.
- The consequent says Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee; both are unknown.
- There isn’t enough information to determine that whenever the antecedent holds, the consequent must hold; the implication’s truth is undetermined.
- Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
