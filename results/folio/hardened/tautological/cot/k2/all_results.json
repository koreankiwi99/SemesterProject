Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- Antecedent is (H \u2227 C) \u2228 \u00acH, which simplifies to (\u00acH \u2228 C).\n- For Bonnie, in both cases above, S \u2228 I is true (case 1: S true; case 2: I true). Hence the implication holds. Answer: True.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- Antecedent \u201cC or (if not C then P)\u201d simplifies to C \u2228 P, which is true in both cases (case 1: P true; case 2: C true).\n- Conclusion requires H \u2227 I.

CreatedUnderLaw does not imply LegalEntity (only the converse is given). Knowing \u00acPrivateCompany(H) doesn\u2019t help.\n- Therefore, whether H has legal obligations is not determined.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- Since \u00acPrivateCompany(H) is entailed, the conjunction \u201chas legal obligations and is a private company\u201d is false (one conjunct is false).\n\nQuestion 3:\n- If H were a private company, then by the chains H would be a legal entity, hence would have legal obligations and be created under law.

Hence \u00acP and, by equivalence, \u00acQ. From A \u2192 P and \u00acP, we get \u00acA.\n\nQuestion 1:\nWe know \u00acP and \u00acQ, but there is no rule connecting \u201cnot a chemical compound\u201d to (not) containing carbon. The carbon fact is only guaranteed for organic compounds, and \u00acP implies \u00acorganic (contrapositive), but non-organic things might still contain carbon. Therefore, whether the mixture contains carbon is undetermined. Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\nAn alkane would imply P, but \u00acP holds, so \u00acA. Thus \u201cthe mixture is an alkane and contains carbon\u201d is false due to the first conjunct. Answer: False.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWe have already established \u00acP and \u00acA; thus the consequent \u201cthe mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane\u201d is true regardless of the antecedent (\u201ccontains only one element or contains carbon\u201d). A conditional with a true consequent is true. Answer: True.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: False\n3: True",
