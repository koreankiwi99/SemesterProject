Premises: Not true and false is false. False or not false is true. Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician. 
Heinrich Schmidt was also a member of the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) The statement is a disjunction including “German.” The text says Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician, so he is German. Therefore “German or Russian or both” is true.
2) The text states Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician and was a member of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag. Thus, there exists a German politician who was part of both bodies.
3) The text provides a counterexample (Heinrich Schmidt) to the claim that no politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag. Hence the universal claim is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: False
