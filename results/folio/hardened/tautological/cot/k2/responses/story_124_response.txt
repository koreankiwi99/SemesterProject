==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- The Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in the Picuris Mountains and was donated.
- The text states: There are no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines that have been donated. Therefore, the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas (otherwise there would be a Texas mountain range with a donated mine).
- The text also states: The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas. Since they are not in Texas, they must be in New Mexico.
- Juan de Oñate visited the Picuris Mountains, so he visited a mountain range in New Mexico, not Texas.
- Since the Harding Pegmatite Mine is in the Picuris Mountains in New Mexico, it is located in a mountain range in New Mexico.
