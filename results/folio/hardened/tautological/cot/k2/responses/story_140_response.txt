All people on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic participated in the 1992 du Maurier Classic.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Q1: The context explicitly states "The winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic was Steinhauer." Therefore, the statement "Steinhauer was not the winner..." contradicts the given information and is false.
- Q2: We know there was one six-way tie on the leaderboard, and at least one person in that tie was from Belgium. We also know Descampe is Belgian and on the leaderboard. However, nothing states that Descampe is the Belgian in the six-way tie; there could be other Belgian players on the leaderboard. Thus, it cannot be determined.

ANSWERS:
1: False
