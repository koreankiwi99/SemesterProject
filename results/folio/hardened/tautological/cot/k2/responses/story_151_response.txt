Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Given: “Barutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.”
- Therefore it is not named after islands in Antarctica, let alone all of them. The statement contradicts the given naming source.
- Conclusion: False.

Question 2:
- We need a cove in Antarctica named after a place in Bulgaria.
- Barutin Cove is named after a Bulgarian settlement, but its location chain is: Barutin Cove on Snow Island; Snow Island in the South Shetland Islands; and we only know “Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands,” not that Snow Island (or South Shetland) is in Antarctica.
- Without a provided link placing Barutin Cove in Antarctica, existence cannot be confirmed.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- We cannot derive that Barutin Cove is in Antarctica, but we also cannot derive that it is not in Antarctica from the given statements.
