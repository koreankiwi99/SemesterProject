==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Facts:
  - If someone is a student and wants a long vacation, then their favorite season is summer.
  - Emma’s favorite season is summer.
  - Mia’s favorite season is not the same as Emma’s ⇒ Mia’s favorite ≠ summer.
  - James wants to have a long vacation.
  - Seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter.

Question 1:
- The rule only applies to students who want a long vacation. We know James wants a long vacation, but we don’t know if James is a student. Therefore we cannot conclude his favorite season is summer.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- We know Mia’s favorite is not summer. That leaves Spring, Fall, or Winter. We have no further information to single out Spring.
- Conclusion: Unknown.
