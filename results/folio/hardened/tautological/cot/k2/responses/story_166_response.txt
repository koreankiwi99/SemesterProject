Story ID: 166
Premises: True or true is true. False or not false is true. Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- The Olive Garden is a managed building with monthly rent $2000.
- The security deposit at a managed building can be equal to the monthly rent or more, so at the Olive Garden it is at least $2000 (> $1500).
- Tom will rent if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy and the deposit is no more than $1500. Here the deposit condition fails (≥ $2000), and we also don’t know if he’s allowed with Fluffy at the Olive Garden.
- The given “if” is only a sufficient condition; absence does not imply he won’t rent. Therefore we cannot conclude he will rent.

Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Fluffy is a pet. People are allowed to move in with a pet if a managed building allows pets.
- We only know that some managed buildings allow pets; nothing says the Olive Garden specifically allows pets.
- Therefore we can’t conclude Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy at the Olive Garden.

Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- For managed buildings, the security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent or more.
- The Olive Garden is managed, and its monthly rent is $2000.
- Therefore the security deposit at the Olive Garden is $2000 or more.

Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
