Story ID: 183
Premises: True or true is true. Not false and false is false. If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z
Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Michael is taller than everyone else in his class.
- Peter is taller than Michael.
- By transitivity, Peter is taller than every other person in Michael’s class.
- Therefore, Peter is not shorter than any man in Michael’s class. The existential claim that he is shorter than a man in that class is false.

Question 2:
- If a person does not jump when shooting, Michael can block their shooting.
- Michael cannot block Windy’s shooting, so Windy must jump when shooting.
- A shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter. Since Windy jumps when shooting, Windy can jump when shooting, and thus is a great shooter.

Question 3:
- The general blocking rule: if a man is taller than another man, the taller can block the other’s shooting.
- We do not know Windy’s gender or relative height to Peter.
- Michael’s special blocking rule does not apply to Peter.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether Peter can block Windy’s shooting.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: Unknown
