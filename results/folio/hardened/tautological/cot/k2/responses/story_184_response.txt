==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- "Stranger Things" is a popular Netflix show.
- If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it, so Karen binge-watches "Stranger Things."
- If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa, so she shares "Stranger Things" with Lisa.
Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show and Karen does not download it.
- For Netflix shows, Karen downloads a show if and only if she binge-watches it. So not downloading "Black Mirror" implies she does not binge-watch it.
- If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it. Contrapositively, for a Netflix show, if Karen does not binge-watch it, then it is not popular. Thus "Black Mirror" is not popular.
Conclusion: False.

Question 3:
- From above, Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror."
- The only given sharing rule is: if she binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it. The converse is not given.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude whether she shares "Black Mirror."
Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
