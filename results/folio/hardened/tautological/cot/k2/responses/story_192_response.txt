Story ID: 192
Premises: False and true is not true. Not false or true is not false. International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
Mike is an international student.
Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Given: International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
- Given: Mike is an international student. It is not stated that he is in the US.
- Given: If an international student in the US has an F1 visa and wants to work in the US, then they need to apply for CPT or OPT. This is a one-way implication; it does not say that only F1 students need CPT/OPT.
- Given: For Mike specifically, if he wants to work in the US, he needs to apply for CPT. This does not logically imply he has an F1 visa under the provided rules.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude Mike has an F1 visa.

Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- From the same facts, we also cannot conclude that Mike has a J1 visa. We lack information that he is in the US, and even if he were, “either F1 or J1” does not tell us which one.
- No rule links Mike’s CPT requirement uniquely to J1 either.

Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
