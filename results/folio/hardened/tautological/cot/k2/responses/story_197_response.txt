Story ID: 197
Premises: False and true is not true. Not true or true is true. It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
Tom lives in a single-parent family.
Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them. 
Tom is applying to take the GRE test.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Q1: ETS gives aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship. People in single-parent families or with few resources can prove hardship. Tom meets those conditions and is a GRE applicant, so he can prove hardship. But the rule requires that he actually proves hardship; “can prove” does not entail he has proved. So whether ETS provides aid to Tom is not entailed.
- Q2: The GRE costs $205, which is stated to be cheaper than $300. Therefore it costs below $300.
- Q3: The statement claims no one taking the GRE has financial aid from anything. While ETS provides aid to applicants who prove hardship, we are not told that any test-taker actually has such aid. We also lack any confirmed counterexample (e.g., Tom receiving aid while taking the test). Hence we cannot determine the truth of the universal claim.
