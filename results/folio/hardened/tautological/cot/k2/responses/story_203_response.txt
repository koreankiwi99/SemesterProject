==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Q1: We’re told “Vacuums suck” and “Space is a vacuum,” so by substitution, space sucks. Therefore true.
- Q2: “Vampires suck” does not imply that everything that sucks is a vampire. We can’t conclude space is a vampire. Therefore unknown.
- Q3: We’re told “A duster is a household appliance that doesn’t suck,” which is a counterexample to “If something is a household appliance, it sucks.” Therefore false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
