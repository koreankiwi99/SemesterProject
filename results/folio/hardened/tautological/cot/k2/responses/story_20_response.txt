Story ID: 20
Premises: False and true is not true. True or not true is true. A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.
All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Q1: We’re told that any game that sells more than one million copies will be included in the Top 10 list, and that The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies. By modus ponens, The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list. So the statement is true.
- Q2: We only know that all games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese companies. We have no information about whether FIFA 22 is on the Top 10 list or about its sales. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese company. Unknown.
- Q3: This is the negation of Q1. Since Q1 is true, this statement is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
