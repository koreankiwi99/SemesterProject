==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Romance languages form a language family that includes at least French and Spanish.
- All languages within a language family are related to each other.
- Basque is not related to any other language.
- If Basque were a Romance language, it would be related to French and Spanish, which contradicts that Basque is not related to any other language.
- Therefore, Basque is not a Romance language. Answer: False.

Question 2:
- Spanish is a Romance language.
- German is related to Spanish.
- The text states “All languages within a language family are related to each other,” but does not state the converse (“If two languages are related, they are in the same family”).
- Therefore, from “German is related to Spanish,” we cannot conclude German is a Romance language, nor can we rule it out based on the given statements. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- French is a Romance language.
- All Romance languages are Indo-European languages.
- Therefore, French is an Indo-European language. Answer: True.
