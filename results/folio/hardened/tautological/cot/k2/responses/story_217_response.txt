Story ID: 217
Premises: Not false and true is true. Not false or false is true. If George likes music, he wants to compose.
If George has access to a program, he can compose.
If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Let:
- L = George likes music
- W = George wants to compose
- A = George has access to a program
- C = George can compose
- P = George will compose

Given:
1) L -> W
2) A -> C
3) (C ∧ W) -> P

Question 1:
- Assume L ∧ A.
- From L -> W, get W.
- From A -> C, get C.
- Then C ∧ W holds; from (C ∧ W) -> P, conclude P.
- Therefore (L ∧ A) -> P is entailed. True.

Question 2:
- From (C ∧ W) -> P we can only infer the contrapositive: ¬P -> (¬C ∨ ¬W).
- This does not entail ¬P -> ¬C.
- It is possible (consistent with the premises) that C is true, W is false, and P is false; then ¬P holds but ¬C does not, so the implication fails. Since the premises do not rule this out or enforce it, the statement is not determined. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
