Story ID: 256
Premises: False and true is not true. False and not false is false. All cats are mammals.
Some pets are not mammals.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- All cats are mammals. So if something is a cat, it must be a mammal.
- Some pets are not mammals. So there exists at least one pet that is not a mammal.
- The existence of a non-mammal pet does not rule out the possibility that some other pets are mammals, including possibly cats.
- We have no information that any pet is a cat, nor that no pet is a cat.

Therefore, the statement "No pets are cats" cannot be determined from the given information.
