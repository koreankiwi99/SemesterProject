Story ID: 26
Premises: True and true is not false. True or true is true. Some mammals have teeth.
Platypuses have no teeth.
Platypuses are mammals. 
Humans have teeth.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. We are told platypuses are mammals and that platypuses have no teeth. Therefore, the statement “Platypuses are mammals with no teeth” follows directly.
2. We only know platypuses are mammals; nothing in the given information states that mammals are not reptiles. So we cannot conclude they are reptiles or not; insufficient information.
3. We know humans have teeth and that some mammals have teeth, but that does not imply that all with teeth are mammals. We are not told humans are mammals, so this cannot be concluded.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
