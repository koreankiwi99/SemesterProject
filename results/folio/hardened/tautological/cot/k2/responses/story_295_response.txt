Story ID: 295
Premises: True is not false. Not false or false is true. Some affection is love.
Some love is positive.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- "Some affection is love" means there exists at least one entity that is both affection and love.
- "Some love is positive" means there exists at least one (possibly different) entity that is both love and positive.
- From these two existential statements, we cannot conclude that there is an entity that is both affection and positive, because the two "some" instances may refer to different members of the set of love.
- The statement "Some affection is positive" could be true or false depending on whether the two instances coincide, so it is not entailed nor contradicted.
