Story ID: 306
Premises: Not true and true is false. Not true or true is true. If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews.
All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

From “The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents” and “All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four,” we conclude the store has a rating greater than four (R(H)) in either case.

From “All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations,” we get L(H).

From “If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews,” we get ¬N(H).

Question 1:
Statement: (T(H) ∧ N(H)) → (R(H) ∧ ¬T(H)).
We have ¬N(H), so the antecedent T(H) ∧ N(H) is false. A false antecedent makes the implication true. Therefore True.

Question 2:
Statement: T(H) ∨ ¬N(H).
Since ¬N(H) is true, the disjunction is true. Therefore True.

Question 3:
Statement: “The Hamden Plaza store does not provide take-out service.”
We have no information about the take-out status of the Hamden Plaza Subway store, and “The Hamden Plaza store” may not even refer to the same entity. In any case, we cannot conclude ¬T. Therefore Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
