Story ID: 315
Premises: False or not true is false. Not true or true is true. If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. 
If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the rules: Tesla Model 3 ⇒ can transport multiple passengers ⇒ not a one-seater. Solo EV ⇒ single-seat electric car ⇒ one-seater. Thus, a car cannot be both a Tesla Model 3 and a Solo EV (one-seater vs. not one-seater), but this does not tell us which John’s car is.
- The only statement about John is: If John’s car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is either not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. This is a tautology (P ⇒ P ∨ Q) and yields no information about whether John’s car is a Tesla Model 3 or a Solo EV.

Question 1:
- No information establishes that John’s car is a Tesla Model 3.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- No information establishes that John’s car is a Solo EV.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- Since we cannot determine whether John’s car is a Solo EV, we also cannot conclude it is not a Solo EV.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
