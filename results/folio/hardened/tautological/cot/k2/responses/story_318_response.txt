If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.

Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Core deductions from the context:
- If a show gives out roses on TV, then it is an episode of The Bachelor.
- The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people, and all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.
- Therefore, any show that gives out roses on TV is a reality TV show.
- Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, so Breaking Bad does not give out roses on TV.

Question 1:
- We only know that some show airing Monday at 8 pm gives out roses; Breaking Bad cannot be that show (since it doesn’t give out roses), but this does not rule out Breaking Bad also airing Monday at 8 pm without giving out roses. No information fixes its timeslot.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- This asserts that Breaking Bad is a show where roses are given out (at Monday 8 pm). But we deduced Breaking Bad does not give out roses.
- Conclusion: False.

Question 3:
- The antecedent “roses are given out during Breaking Bad” is false (from the deductions). A conditional with a false antecedent is true (vacuously).
- Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
