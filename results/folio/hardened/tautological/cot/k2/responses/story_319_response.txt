Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let B(x): baked sweet; S(x): spicy; C(x): cupcake; M(x): mala hotpot; P(x): product of Baked by Melissa; D: Dried Thai chilies.
- Given: B→¬S; C→B; M→S; P→C→B.
- Contrapositives: S→¬B (from B→¬S). Also ¬B→¬P (from P→B).
- D satisfies S(D) ∨ M(D) ∨ ¬B(D). Each disjunct implies ¬B(D): S→¬B; M→S→¬B; ¬B→¬B. Hence ¬B(D) is certain.
- From ¬B(D) and ¬B→¬P, conclude ¬P(D).
- Whether M(D) holds is not determined.

Question 1: D is a product of Baked by Melissa.
- We derived ¬P(D). So this is false.

Question 2: D is not a product of Baked by Melissa.
- True, as above.

Question 3: D is a mala hotpot.
- Undetermined; could be, but not entailed.

Question 4: D is neither a product of Baked by Melissa nor a baked sweet.
- We have ¬P(D) and ¬B(D). True.

Question 5: D is a cupcake and a product of Baked by Melissa.
- If it were a cupcake, then it would be a baked sweet, but we have ¬B(D). Also ¬P(D). So false.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: Unknown
4: True
5: False
