Story ID: 322
Premises: True or true is true. Not false or true is not false. All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
Some stocks are growth stocks.
All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
KO is a mature stock.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- All growth stocks → bought for rapid price appreciation → not suitable for a retirement fund.
- All mature stocks → suitable for a retirement fund.
- KO is a mature stock ⇒ KO is a stock and KO is suitable.

Question 1:
- KO is stated to be a mature stock, which implies it is a stock.
- Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- Suppose KO were a growth stock. Then KO would not be suitable. But KO is suitable (since KO is a mature stock). Therefore KO is not a growth stock.
- Thus “KO is a stock and a growth stock” is false (the second conjunct is false).
- Conclusion: False.

Question 3:
- From suitability of KO and “bought for rapid appreciation → not suitable,” we infer KO is not bought for rapid appreciation.
- From that and “growth → bought for rapid appreciation,” we infer KO is not a growth stock.
- Therefore, the antecedent “KO is a growth stock or bought for rapid price appreciation” is false, making the conditional true regardless of the consequent.
- Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: True
