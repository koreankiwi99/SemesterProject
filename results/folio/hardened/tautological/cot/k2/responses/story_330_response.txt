Story ID: 330
Premises: Not true and false is false. False or not false is true. All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Logical tautologies given do not affect facts about John.
- Rules:
  - Invite others -> Make wedding plans -> Engaged.
  - Well-attended -> Invite others.
  - Some people (unspecified) with well-attended weddings have larger families (does not specify John).
  - If John is engaged, then (interpretation does not matter for triggering, as it’s a conditional; it does not assert he is engaged).
  - If John has a larger family, then (Well-attended or invites friends). Note: “invites friends” is distinct from “invites others,” and no rule links them.

Question 1: No premise implies John has a larger family. Unknown.
Question 2: No premise implies John does not have a larger family. Unknown.
Question 3: We only have conditionals that would imply engagement if certain antecedents held; none are established for John. Unknown.
Question 4: We have no basis to assert John lacks a larger family, nor that he does not invite others; both components are undetermined. Unknown.
