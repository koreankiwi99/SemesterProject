Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player.
All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities.
All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor” and “Djokovic is at the mixer,” we get: Djokovic is either a Grand Slam champion (GSC) or an Oscar-nominated actor (ONA).

Question 1:
- We only know Djokovic is GSC or ONA; we cannot conclude he is specifically a GSC.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Case 1: If Djokovic is ONA, then ONA -> Celebrity -> WellPaid -> LivesInTaxHaven.
- Case 2: If Djokovic is GSC, then GSC -> ProTennis -> Athlete -> Famous. Given “If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid,” he is WellPaid; then WellPaid -> LivesInTaxHaven.
- In either case, Djokovic lives in a tax haven.
- Conclusion: True.

Question 3:
- This is the negation of Question 2. Since Q2 is True, Q3 is False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
