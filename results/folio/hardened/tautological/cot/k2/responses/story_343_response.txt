Story ID: 343
Premises: False and not false is false. Not false is true. No digital media are analog.
Every printed text is analog media.
All streaming services are digital media.
If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.
If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Given:
  - No digital media are analog: Digital(x) -> not Analog(x).
  - Every printed text is analog media: Printed(x) -> Analog(x).
  - All streaming services are digital media: Streaming(x) -> Digital(x).
  - Hardcover(x) -> Printed(x).
  - For 1984: Streaming(1984) -> Hardcover(1984).

Question 1: 1984 is printed text.
- The only provided route to Printed(1984) is Streaming(1984) -> Hardcover(1984) -> Printed(1984).
- As shown below, 1984 is not a streaming service, but that does not imply it is not printed (denying the antecedent). No other premise establishes Printed(1984).
- Therefore, we cannot determine if 1984 is printed text. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: 1984 is a streaming service.
- Assume Streaming(1984).
- Then Digital(1984) (by streaming -> digital) and not Analog(1984) (by no digital are analog).
- Also Hardcover(1984) (given) and thus Printed(1984), hence Analog(1984) (by printed -> analog).
- Contradiction: Analog(1984) and not Analog(1984).
- Therefore, the assumption is false; 1984 is not a streaming service. Answer: False.

Question 3: 1984 is not a streaming service.
- From the contradiction above, not Streaming(1984) follows. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
