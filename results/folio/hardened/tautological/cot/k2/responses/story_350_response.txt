Story ID: 350
Premises: False or not false is true. True or not true is true. All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- The statements concern properties of design styles or buildings that Max adores. They do not assert that any particular design by Max exists, nor do they link “designs by Max” to the styles he adores.
- From “If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative” and “No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries,” we can infer that there are no designs by Max that he adores which have interesting geometries. This does not establish that any design by Max is brutalist, evocative, or dreamy, nor that any design by Max exists.
- The facts about Kelly Wearstler’s styles (evocative and dreamy) apply to styles Max adores, not to designs by Max in general.

Question 1:
- Nothing entails that a design by Max is a brutalist building, and no existence is guaranteed. Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Evocative and dreamy are guaranteed only for Kelly Wearstler’s styles that Max adores; no link to designs by Max is given. Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- Similarly, we cannot conclude that a design by Max is either evocative or dreamy without additional links or existence assumptions. Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
