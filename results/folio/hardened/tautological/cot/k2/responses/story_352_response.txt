Story ID: 352
Premises: Not false is true. False and not true is false. All business organizations are legal entities.
All companies are business organizations.
All private companies are companies.
All legal entities are created under law. 
All legal entities have legal obligations.
If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the chains: PrivateCompany → Company → BusinessOrganization → LegalEntity. And LegalEntity → CreatedUnderLaw and LegalEntity → HasLegalObligations.
- For H (Harvard Weekly Book Club), the special rule says: CreatedUnderLaw(H) → ¬PrivateCompany(H).
- Combining: PrivateCompany(H) → CreatedUnderLaw(H) and CreatedUnderLaw(H) → ¬PrivateCompany(H), so PrivateCompany(H) → ¬PrivateCompany(H), which entails ¬PrivateCompany(H).

Question 1:
- We can’t establish that H is a legal entity or is created under law. CreatedUnderLaw does not imply LegalEntity (only the converse is given). Knowing ¬PrivateCompany(H) doesn’t help.
- Therefore, whether H has legal obligations is not determined.

Question 2:
- Since ¬PrivateCompany(H) is entailed, the conjunction “has legal obligations and is a private company” is false (one conjunct is false).

Question 3:
- If H were a private company, then by the chains H would be a legal entity, hence would have legal obligations and be created under law. So the disjunction holds. Also vacuously true because ¬PrivateCompany(H) is entailed.
