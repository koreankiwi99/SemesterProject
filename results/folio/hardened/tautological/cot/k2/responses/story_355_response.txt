Story ID: 355
Premises: False or not false is true. True and not false is true. All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.
All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.
All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the rules: GrewUpHC -> EatSalad -> VeryConscious; Disregard -> not VeryConscious; VisitGymDaily -> FulfillIntake -> GrewUpHC.
- Taylor: either (GrewUpHC and Disregard) or (not GrewUpHC and not Disregard).
- If GrewUpHC and Disregard held, we’d get VeryConscious and not VeryConscious, a contradiction. So the only consistent option is: not GrewUpHC and not Disregard.

Question 1:
- From not GrewUpHC we cannot infer whether Taylor eats salads (only GrewUpHC -> EatSalad; no converse). So this is not determined.

Question 2:
- VisitGymDaily -> GrewUpHC. Since Taylor is not GrewUpHC, she cannot be VisitGymDaily. So the statement “Taylor visits the gym at least once a day” is false.

Question 3:
- We have established not GrewUpHC and, from Q2, not VisitGymDaily. So the conjunctive statement is true.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
