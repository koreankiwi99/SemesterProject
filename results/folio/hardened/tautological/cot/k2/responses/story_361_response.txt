Story ID: 361
Premises: Not false is true. Not true is false. If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly

Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1 reasoning:
- Let S = “spills a lot,” C = “cleanly,” T = “notably tidy,” CF = “clumsy foodie who goes out frequently,” FAM = “family prioritizes order and spotlessness,” V = “values order and spotlessness.”
- Given: S -> ¬T; CF -> S; C -> T; V -> C; FAM -> V; and (S ∧ C) ∨ (¬S ∧ ¬C) for Peter (i.e., S ↔ C for Peter).
- Case 1: S and C. Then T (from C -> T) and ¬T (from S -> ¬T), a contradiction; T is derivable in this case.
- Case 2: ¬S and ¬C. Then neither T nor ¬T is derivable.
- Since T does not follow in all cases and ¬T does not either, the truth of “Peter is notably tidy” is undetermined.

Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2 reasoning:
- We need CF ∨ FAM.
- From the premises, CF implies S, and FAM implies V implies C; but nothing establishes CF or FAM outright, nor their negations.
- The disjunction (S ∧ C) ∨ (¬S ∧ ¬C) ties S and C for Peter but does not force CF or FAM (only one-way implications exist).
- Therefore, neither CF nor FAM is entailed, and their disjunction is not established; nor is its negation.

Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3 reasoning:
- The statement is (CF ∧ FAM) ∨ (¬CF ∧ ¬FAM), i.e., CF ↔ FAM.
- The premises provide CF -> S and FAM -> V -> C, plus S ↔ C for Peter, but no links from S/C back to CF or from C to FAM (converses are not given).
- Hence neither CF -> FAM nor FAM -> CF is derivable, and we also cannot derive a counterexample (one true, the other false).
- So the biconditional is not established nor refuted.

Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
