Story ID: 363
Premises: Not true or true is true. Not false is true. All hydrocarbons are organic compounds .
All alkanes are hydrocarbons
All organic compounds are chemical compounds.
All organic compounds contain carbon.
No chemical compounds contain only one element.
The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Let P = “the mixture is a chemical compound,” Q = “the mixture contains only one element,” A = “the mixture is an alkane,” and C = “the mixture contains carbon.”

Given:
- All alkanes → hydrocarbons → organic compounds → chemical compounds, and all organic compounds contain carbon.
- No chemical compounds contain only one element: P → ¬Q.
- The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither: (P ∧ Q) ∨ (¬P ∧ ¬Q), i.e., P ↔ Q.

From P → ¬Q and P ↔ Q, P cannot be true (it would force Q to be both true and false). Hence ¬P and, by equivalence, ¬Q. From A → P and ¬P, we get ¬A.

Question 1:
We know ¬P and ¬Q, but there is no rule connecting “not a chemical compound” to (not) containing carbon. The carbon fact is only guaranteed for organic compounds, and ¬P implies ¬organic (contrapositive), but non-organic things might still contain carbon. Therefore, whether the mixture contains carbon is undetermined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
An alkane would imply P, but ¬P holds, so ¬A. Thus “the mixture is an alkane and contains carbon” is false due to the first conjunct. Answer: False.

Question 3:
We have already established ¬P and ¬A; thus the consequent “the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane” is true regardless of the antecedent (“contains only one element or contains carbon”). A conditional with a true consequent is true. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
