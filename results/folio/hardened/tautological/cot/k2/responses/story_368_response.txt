Story ID: 368
Premises: Not true and true is false. False and not true is false. If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition.
If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus.
People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.
If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters.
If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.
Hannah is at Mary's school.
Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From “Hannah is at Mary's school” and the universal rules for people at Mary's school, we can apply:
  - Work -> Needs. Given “Hannah works in student jobs on campus,” we get Needs(Hannah).
  - From “If she needs money then she is neither picky nor needs money,” and Needs(Hannah), we infer NotPicky(Hannah) and NotNeeds(Hannah). So we have both Needs(Hannah) and NotNeeds(Hannah).
  - From “Order takeout or enjoy dining hall,” we cannot determine Enjoy(Hannah). Thus we cannot conclude she spends a lot of time in dining halls (which requires Enjoy).

Question 1:
- Needs(Hannah) is directly entailed (from Work and Work->Needs), so the statement is true (even though NotNeeds is also derivable).

Question 2:
- AtSchool(Hannah) is true; NotPicky(Hannah) is true; but SpendDining(Hannah) is not entailed (depends on Enjoy, which is not established). So the full conjunction is not established and not refuted. Unknown.

Question 3:
- AtSchool(Hannah) is true. The disjunction “NotPicky(Hannah) or (if she is picky then she spends time in dining halls)” is true because NotPicky(Hannah) is entailed. Hence the whole conjunction is true.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: True
