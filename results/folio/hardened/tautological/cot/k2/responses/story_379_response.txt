==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- If someone is born in a multiple birth (with siblings), then they spend a lot of time with their siblings, which implies they live at home, which implies they do not live with strangers.
- Luke is either: (a) born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, or (b) not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.
- Option (a) leads to a contradiction: born in a multiple birth implies not living with strangers, but (a) says he lives with strangers. So (a) is impossible.
- Therefore, (b) holds: Luke is not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.

Question 1:
- The only given sufficient condition for spending a lot of time with siblings is being born in a multiple birth. We know Luke is not born in a multiple birth, and we have no other rule implying he spends a lot of time with siblings. We also have no rule implying he does not. So this is unknown.

Question 2:
- If Luke complained often about annoying siblings, then he would have siblings born together and hence would have been born in a multiple birth. But we know he was not born in a multiple birth. Therefore, he does not complain often about annoying siblings.

Question 3:
- From above, Luke is not born in a multiple birth, and he does not complain often about annoying siblings. So the statement is true.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
