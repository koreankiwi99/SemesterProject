Story ID: 380
Premises: Not false or false is true. Not true is false. People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. 
Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let P = performs in talent shows often; E = attends and is very engaged with school events; S = student at the school; I = inactive/disinterested; C = chaperones dances; H = (young child or teenager) and (wishes to further academics).
- Given:
  - P -> E.
  - For all club members: P ∨ I.
  - C -> ¬S.
  - I -> C, hence I -> ¬S, and contrapositive gives S -> ¬I.
  - H -> S.
  - For Bonnie: (E ∧ S) ∨ (¬E ∧ ¬S), i.e., E ↔ S.
- From S -> ¬I and P ∨ I, we get S -> P. From P -> E and E ↔ S, we get P -> S. Thus for Bonnie, P ↔ S and only two consistent cases exist:
  1) S, E, P true; I, C false.
  2) S, E, P false; I, C true.

Question 1:
- In case 1, P true; in case 2, P false. Cannot determine. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Antecedent is (H ∧ C) ∨ ¬H, which simplifies to (¬H ∨ C).
- For Bonnie, in both cases above, S ∨ I is true (case 1: S true; case 2: I true). Hence the implication holds. Answer: True.

Question 3:
- Antecedent “C or (if not C then P)” simplifies to C ∨ P, which is true in both cases (case 1: P true; case 2: C true).
- Conclusion requires H ∧ I. In case 1, I is false; in case 2, H is false (since H -> S but S is false). So H ∧ I is false in all cases. Therefore the implication is false. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
