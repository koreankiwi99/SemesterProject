Story ID: 385
Premises: True and false is not true. True is not false. If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. 
Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From "All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal" and "(If R(Coco) or lost to Nadal) -> not male at RG," we get: MaleRG(Coco) -> LostNadal(Coco) -> not MaleRG(Coco). Hence not MaleRG(Coco).
- Given "All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male" and AtRG(Coco), with not MaleRG(Coco), we infer FemaleRG(Coco).
- From "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek," we get LostIga(Coco).
- From "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the WTA," we get R(Coco).
- From "If someone is ranked highly by the WTA, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis," we get A(Coco).

Question 1: A(Coco) holds, so the statement is true.

Question 2: We only know MaleRG -> LostNadal, but Coco is not male. There is no rule that females cannot have lost to Nadal, so this remains undetermined. Hence unknown.

Question 3: We have both LostIga(Coco) and A(Coco), so the claim that Coco is not both is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
