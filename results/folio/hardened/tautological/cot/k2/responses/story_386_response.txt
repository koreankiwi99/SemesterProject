Story ID: 386
Premises: Not true or false is not true. True and not false is true. If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Rules:
  - Deadly disease → low survival.
  - Severe cancer → deadly disease.
  - Bile duct cancer → severe cancer → deadly disease → low survival.
  - Cholangiocarcinoma → bile duct cancer.
  - Mild flu → low survival.
  - Not(bile duct cancer(colorectal) ∧ low survival(colorectal)).

- From bile duct cancer → low survival and Not(B ∧ L) for colorectal cancer, we deduce Not(bile duct cancer(colorectal)). Hence Not(Cholangiocarcinoma(colorectal)) as well.

Question 1:
- Nothing implies colorectal cancer is severe unless it is bile duct cancer; but we have Not(bile duct cancer(colorectal)). So we cannot conclude it is severe. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Antecedent is (bile duct cancer(colorectal) OR Cholangiocarcinoma(colorectal)), which is false. A material implication with false antecedent is true. Answer: True.

Question 3:
- The statement is effectively (Cholangiocarcinoma(colorectal) AND (mild flu(colorectal) OR bile duct cancer(colorectal))) (the “or all of the above” is redundant). Since Cholangiocarcinoma(colorectal) is false, the whole statement is false. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False

==================================================
Questions and Results:
==================================================
Q1: Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu.
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes

Q3: Colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above.
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
