Story ID: 426
Premises: Not true and false is false. Not false and false is false. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. 
Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. 
Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. 
No managers work remotely from home. 
James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Employees eat either in the company building or at home.
- Lunch at home -> remote. No managers work remotely, so Manager -> not remote -> not lunch at home -> lunch in company building.
- James is a manager iff he appears in the company today. We have no information whether he appears (or is a manager).
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether James has lunch in the company.

Question 2:
- This is the negation of Question 1’s statement. Since Question 1 is undetermined, we also cannot determine that James does not have lunch in the company.

Question 3:
- First implication: (Manager or In other countries) -> not (Lunch at home or Remote).
  - If Manager, then not remote and not lunch at home, so this part would hold.
  - If In other countries, then remote is true, making “not (Lunch at home or Remote)” false. Since it’s possible James is in other countries, this implication is not entailed.
- Second implication: (Lunch at home or Remote) -> (not Manager and not In other countries).
  - From Remote we can conclude not Manager (contrapositive of “No managers work remotely”), and Lunch at home -> Remote -> not Manager.
  - But Remote does not imply not In other countries (indeed, In other countries -> Remote). So this implication is not entailed.
- Overall, the combined statement is not determined by the premises.
