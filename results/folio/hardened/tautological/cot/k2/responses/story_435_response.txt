Story ID: 435
Premises: True is not false. Not true or false is not true. None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department. 
All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. 
All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department. 
All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. 
All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.
James is a student working in the lab. 
James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David" and "All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course," James working in the lab implies James takes the database course.
- From "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university," we infer James does not have a part-time job offered by the university (the sentence reads as “neither … nor …”).
- Although there is a conflict about whether James works in the lab, there is no statement denying that he takes the database course, and the implication chain from working in the lab supports that he does.

Question 1: From the statement about James not having a university part-time job, the claim that he has one is false.

Question 2: Directly supported by the same statement; true.

Question 3: Since James takes the database course (from the implication chain), the disjunction “takes DB or has a university part-time job” is true.

Question 4: As derived from the lab → David → database chain, James takes the database course; true.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
4: True
