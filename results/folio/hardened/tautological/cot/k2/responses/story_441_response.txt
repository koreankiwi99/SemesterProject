Story ID: 441
Premises: True and true is not false. True and not false is true. No one nice to animals is also mean to animals.
Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
All animal lovers are nice to animals.
All pet owners love animals.
Tom is a pet owner.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “All pet owners love animals” and “Tom is a pet owner,” we get: Tom loves animals.
- From “All animal lovers are nice to animals,” we get: Tom is nice to animals.
- From “No one nice to animals is also mean to animals,” we get: Tom is not mean to animals.
- “Some grumpy people are mean to animals” does not imply all grumpy people are mean; it doesn’t determine whether Tom is grumpy.

Question 1:
- We have no information that links Tom to being grumpy. So whether Tom is grumpy is not determined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- We established Tom is not mean to animals. Therefore, he cannot be both grumpy and mean.
- Answer: True.

Question 3:
- Antecedent: “Tom is not both grumpy and mean” is true (since Tom is not mean).
- Consequent: “Tom is neither grumpy nor an animal lover” is false, because Tom is an animal lover (as a pet owner).
- A true antecedent implying a false consequent makes the implication false.
- Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
