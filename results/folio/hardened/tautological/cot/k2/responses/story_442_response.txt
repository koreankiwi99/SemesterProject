Story ID: 442
Premises: False is not true. False and not false is false. All Brown Swiss cattle are cows.
Some pets are Brown Swiss Cattle.
All cows are domesticated animals.
Alligators are not domesticated animals.
Ted is an alligator.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “Ted is an alligator” and “Alligators are not domesticated animals,” Ted is not domesticated.
- All Brown Swiss cattle are cows, and all cows are domesticated. Therefore any Brown Swiss animal is domesticated.
- Since Ted is not domesticated, Ted cannot be a cow, hence cannot be Brown Swiss cattle.

Question 1:
- There is no premise linking being a pet to being domesticated or to being an alligator. So we cannot conclude whether Ted is a pet.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement requires Ted to be both a pet and Brown Swiss cattle.
- We have deduced Ted is not Brown Swiss cattle. Therefore the conjunction is false regardless of pet status.
- Conclusion: False.

Question 3:
- If Ted were Brown Swiss cattle, he would be a cow and thus domesticated. But Ted (as an alligator) is not domesticated. So the antecedent cannot hold; the conditional is vacuously true.
- Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
