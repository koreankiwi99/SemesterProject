Story ID: 452
Premises: Not false or true is not false. True is not false. All aliens are extraterrestrials.
If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.
No extraterrestrials are human.
All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.
Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither,” we have (FromEarth ↔ FromMars).
- If Marvin were from both Earth and Mars, then FromMars → Alien → Extraterrestrial and Extraterrestrial → not Human, but also (HighlyIntelligent ∧ FromEarth) → Human. This yields Human ∧ not Human, a contradiction. So the “both” case is impossible.
- Therefore, Marvin is from neither: not FromEarth and not FromMars.
- From not FromEarth and “If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial,” Marvin is Extraterrestrial.
- From “No extraterrestrials are human,” Marvin is not Human.

Question 1: Alien?
- We know not FromMars, so we cannot use FromMars → Alien. We only have Alien → Extraterrestrial, not the converse. Since Marvin is Extraterrestrial but that does not imply Alien, whether he’s an Alien is undetermined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Neither a human nor from Mars?
- We established not FromMars and not Human. So the statement is entailed.
- Answer: True.

Question 3: If not from Mars, then human?
- We established not FromMars is true and Human is false. So the conditional “not FromMars → Human” is false.
- Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
