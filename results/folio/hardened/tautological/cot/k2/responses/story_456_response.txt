Story ID: 456
Premises: False or not false is true. False and true is not true. Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. 
Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the rules: PB(x) -> JS(x); JS(x) -> Leap(x); Leap(x) -> ActLeg(x).
- Given ¬ActLeg(Yuri). By Modus Tollens on Leap -> ActLeg, we get ¬Leap(Yuri).
- By Modus Tollens on JS -> Leap, we get ¬JS(Yuri).
- By Modus Tollens on PB -> JS, we get ¬PB(Yuri). So Yuri is not a professional basketball player.
- The statement “Some professional basketball players are not American nationals” gives no information about Yuri’s nationality.

Question 1: No information determines Yuri’s nationality. Unknown.
Question 2: Since ¬PB(Yuri), he is not an American professional basketball player. True.
Question 3: Since ¬PB(Yuri), he cannot be an American professional basketball player. False.
Question 4: Antecedent ¬Leap(Yuri) is true; consequent “Yuri is an American professional basketball player” is false. The implication is false. False.
Question 5: Antecedent “Yuri is not an American professional basketball player” is true (because ¬PB(Yuri)); consequent PB(Yuri) is false. The implication is false. False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
4: False
