Story ID: 459
Premises: Not true or true is true. True or true is true. Jane does not like any animals that bark.
All dogs are animals that bark.
Jane likes all animals that jump.
If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. 
KiKi is an animal.
If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From (¬J(KiKi) ∧ ¬L(KiKi)) -> (T(KiKi) ∨ L(KiKi)) and T -> L (for animals), we get that if ¬J ∧ ¬L then L, contradicting ¬L; hence ¬(¬J ∧ ¬L), i.e., J(KiKi) ∨ L(KiKi).
- Given KiKi is an animal and (animal ∧ legs) -> jumps, L -> J. Combined with J ∨ L, we conclude J(KiKi).
- From (animal ∧ jumps) -> Jane likes the animal, we get Likes(Jane, KiKi).
- From (animal ∧ barks) -> ¬Likes(Jane, x), by contrapositive with A(KiKi) we infer ¬B(KiKi). Thus KiKi does not bark.
- From D -> B, by contrapositive ¬B -> ¬D, so ¬D(KiKi).

Question 1: Nothing implies T(KiKi); T -> L -> J but J does not imply T. So Unknown.

Question 2: "Barking dog" requires barking; we have ¬B(KiKi). So False.

Question 3: We have ¬B(KiKi) and ¬D(KiKi). So True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
