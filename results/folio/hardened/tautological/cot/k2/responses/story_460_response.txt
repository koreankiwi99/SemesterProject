Story ID: 460
Premises: Not true or false is not true. Not true is false. If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.
If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.
All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.
“Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is a film.
“Hachi: A dog’s Tale”  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From “Hachi is either a family-friendly animated film (FFA) or appropriate for all ages (AAA)” and the rules “All FFA are GA” and “GA implies AAA,” we conclude that, in either case, Hachi is AAA.
- Since Hachi is a film and AAA implies children can watch without guidance (Cw), Hachi is Cw.
- From “If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content (EV), children cannot watch without guidance,” by contrapositive, Cw implies not EV. Therefore, Hachi is not EV.
- We do not know whether Hachi is in the Frozen series.

Question 1:
- We only know Hachi is AAA; AAA does not imply GA. We cannot conclude GA. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement is EV or Frozen. We have not EV, and we do not know Frozen. So the disjunction is undetermined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The statement is (EV and Frozen) or (not EV and not Frozen), i.e., an equivalence between EV and Frozen. Since not EV holds, this reduces to not Frozen, which we do not know. Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
