All monkeys are mammals. 
Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Facts:
  - Rock is Peter's pet.
  - Every Peter’s pet is either a monkey or a bird.
  - All monkeys are mammals; Peter’s mammal-pets are animals; Peter’s animal-pets can breathe.
  - Peter’s birds can fly.
  - If a Peter’s pet can fly, then it has wings.
  - Rock satisfies: Fly(Rock) or Bird(Rock) or not Breathe(Rock).

Question 1 (Rock is a monkey):
- From “every pet is either a monkey or a bird,” Rock is monkey or bird. Both options are consistent with the other facts, so we cannot determine that Rock is a monkey.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2 (Rock has wings):
- Consider two cases.
  - If Rock is a bird, then Rock can fly; as a pet that can fly, Rock has wings.
  - If Rock is not a bird, then Rock must be a monkey, hence a mammal, hence an animal; as a pet that is an animal, Rock can breathe. Then the disjunction “Fly or Bird or not Breathe” collapses (Bird false, not Breathe false) to Fly, so Rock can fly; as a pet that can fly, Rock has wings.
- In all cases, Rock has wings.
- Conclusion: True.

Question 3 (Rock does not have wings):
- From Question 2, Rock does have wings.
- Conclusion: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
