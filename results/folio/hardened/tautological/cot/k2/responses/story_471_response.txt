Story ID: 471

Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. 
The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Only spotted animals are rabbits or squirrels: if something is spotted near campus, then it is a rabbit or a squirrel.
- All spotted squirrels are skittish; skittish implies not calm; contrapositive: calm implies not skittish.
- Rockie is spotted and calm, so Rockie is not skittish.
- If Rockie were a squirrel (and spotted), Rockie would be skittish, contradicting not skittish. So Rockie is not a squirrel.
- Since Rockie is spotted and must be a rabbit or a squirrel, Rockie is a rabbit.
- All spotted rabbits are cute. Hence Rockie is cute.

Question 1: We have no information forcing Rockie to be a turtle or not; could be a rabbit only, or rabbit+turtle. Unknown.

Question 2: As above, we cannot deduce that Rockie is not a turtle. Unknown.

Question 3: Rockie is cute; thus “turtle or cute” is true. True.

Question 4: Rockie is not a squirrel, so “not both turtle and squirrel” holds. Consequent “cute or skittish” holds since Rockie is cute. Implication is True.

Question 5: Antecedent “Rockie is cute and calm” is true. Consequent “skittish turtle” is false because Rockie is not skittish. Implication is False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
