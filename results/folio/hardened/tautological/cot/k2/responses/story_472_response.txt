Story ID: 472
Premises: Not true is false. False is not true. Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. 
All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
All queen bees are bees.
Harry is a bee.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating” and “Harry is a bee,” Harry does not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
- Animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. Since bees are animals, Harry (an animal) cannot have a backbone; otherwise he would reproduce by male-and-female mating. So Harry does not have a backbone.
- All vertebrates have a backbone, so Harry is not a vertebrate.
- Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates; since Harry is an animal and not a vertebrate, he is an invertebrate.
- All queen bees are bees, but not all bees are queen bees; from “Harry is a bee” we cannot conclude he is a queen bee.

Question 1: We know Harry is a bee, but nothing implies he is a queen bee; nor is there a contradiction if he were. So Unknown.

Question 2: Harry is an invertebrate (as shown above). Therefore “Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee” is True.

Question 3: Antecedent: “Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone.” We established Harry has no backbone and is not a vertebrate, so the antecedent is true. Consequent: “Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.” But Harry is an invertebrate, so the consequent is false. A true antecedent and false consequent makes the conditional False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False

Questions and Results:
==================================================
Q1: Harry is a queen bee.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee.
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes

Q3: If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
