When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge. 
If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.
Harry read the book “Walden” by Henry Thoreau.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. Walden is explicitly called a book. Given “Books contain tons of knowledge,” all books contain knowledge. Therefore Walden contains knowledge. True.
2. Harry read a book. “When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.” “If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.” Thus Harry became smarter than before. True.
3. We are given only “If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter” (knowledge -> smarter). The converse (smarter -> gained knowledge) is not given and cannot be inferred. Unknown.
