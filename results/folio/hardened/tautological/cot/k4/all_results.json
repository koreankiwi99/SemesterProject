But no adored brutalist building has interesting geometries. Therefore, there cannot be any design by Max that he adores with interesting geometries. This still does not establish the existence of any design by Max, brutalist or otherwise.\n- The statements about Kelly Wearstler\u2019s styles being evocative and dreamy concern styles Max adores, not designs by Max; no link is given that any design by Max is such a style, nor that any relevant objects exist.\n\nQuestion 1:\n- We are not told that any design by Max exists, nor that any design by Max is brutalist. The conditional about interesting geometries does not create existence. Therefore, we cannot conclude existence of a brutalist design by Max.\n- Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- Similarly, nothing asserts existence of a design by Max that is evocative and dreamy. The only route to evocative for a design by Max goes through the interesting-geometries conditional, but such adored designs cannot exist due to the contradiction with the \u201cno adored brutalist building has interesting geometries\u201d rule. No existence can be concluded.\n- Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- The disjunction still requires existence of some design by Max that is evocative or dreamy. No such existence is entailed by the premises for the same reasons as above.\n- Answer: Unknown.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: Unknown\n3: Unknown",

However, we only get \u201cspends a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls\u201d from \u201cenjoy the dining hall meals,\u201d and we do not know whether Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals (we only know \u201corder takeout or enjoy dining hall\u201d), so we cannot conclude the spending-time claim; nor can we conclude its negation.

So: if private company, then not a private company. This implies HWBC is not a private company.\n\nQuestion 1:\n- We only know HWBC is not a private company. We have no information that HWBC is a legal entity (which would guarantee legal obligations) or that it is created under law.
