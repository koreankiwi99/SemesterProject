Fluminense is a football club.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) Ailton Silva is a Brazilian who plays for Náutico; thus at least one Náutico player is Brazilian. So "No one playing for Náutico is Brazilian" is contradicted.
2) He plays for Náutico, and Náutico is a football club; thus he does play for a football club.
3) He was loaned out to Braga, and Braga is a football club; thus the claim that he was not loaned to a football club is contradicted.
4) There is no information that he played for Fluminense; only that Fluminense is a football club. Cannot conclude either way.
5) As above, he was loaned out to Braga, a football club.
