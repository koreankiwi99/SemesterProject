Story ID: 166
Premises: True or true is true. False or not false is true. False and not false is false. False or not true is false. Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Olive Garden is a managed building with monthly rent $2000.
- The security deposit for a managed building can be equal to the monthly rent or more, so deposit ≥ $2000.
- $2000 > $1500, so the deposit is not “no more than $1500.”
- Tom will rent if (allowed to move in with Fluffy) AND (deposit ≤ $1500). The second condition fails, so the sufficient condition for renting is not met. This does not allow us to conclude he will or won’t rent.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Fluffy is a cat; cats are pets.
- If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.
- We only know that some managed buildings allow pets; we do not know that the Olive Garden does.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy at the Olive Garden.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- For managed buildings, the security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent or more.
- At the Olive Garden, monthly rent is $2000, so the deposit is at least $2000.
- Therefore, “The security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more” is supported.
- Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
