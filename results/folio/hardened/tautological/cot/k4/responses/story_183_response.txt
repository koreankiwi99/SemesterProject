Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Facts:
  - If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
  - Michael is taller than everyone else in his class.
  - Height is transitive.
  - Peter is taller than Michael.
  - Michael can block any person’s shooting if the person does not jump when shooting.
  - Michael cannot block Windy’s shooting.
  - Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.

Question 1:
- Michael is tallest in his class; thus every man in Michael’s class is shorter than Michael.
- Peter is taller than Michael; therefore Peter is taller than every man in Michael’s class.
- Hence there is no man in Michael’s class taller than Peter. The statement is false.

Question 2:
- From “if a person does not jump when shooting, Michael can block their shooting” and “Michael cannot block Windy’s shooting,” by contrapositive, Windy jumps when shooting.
- Anyone who jumps when shooting can jump when shooting; thus by the given rule, Windy is a great shooter. The statement is true.

Question 3:
- We do not know Windy’s gender or her height relative to Peter.
- The general blocking rule only guarantees blocking when a man is taller than another man.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude Peter can block Windy’s shooting. The statement is unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: Unknown
