==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- "Stranger Things" is a popular Netflix show.
- If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it. So Karen binge-watches "Stranger Things."
- If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa. Therefore, Karen will share "Stranger Things" with Lisa.
Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- Karen does not download "Black Mirror."
- If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it (Download ⇔ Binge-watch). From not download, infer not binge-watch.
- "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show. Rule: If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it. Contrapositive: If she does not binge-watch a Netflix show, then it is not the case that it is both a Netflix show and popular; given it is a Netflix show, it must not be popular.
Conclusion: False.

Question 3:
- From not download and the biconditional, Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror."
- Sharing is only guaranteed when she binge-watches (Binge-watch → Share). Lack of binge-watching does not imply lack of sharing, and no other rule implies sharing.
Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: Unknown
