==================================================
Reasoning for Question 1:
- Given: If the output of an NLP task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.
- Machine translation (MT) is an NLP task, and its output is a text sequence.
- Therefore, by modus ponens, MT is a language generation task.
- Conclusion: The statement is true.
