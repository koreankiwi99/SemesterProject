Story ID: 192
Premises: False and true is not true. Not false or true is not false. Not true or true is true. True and not false is true. International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
Mike is an international student.
Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa” and “Mike is an international student,” we can only conclude Mike has F1 or J1, but not which one.
- The rule given: If an international student has an F1 visa and wants to work in the US, then they need to apply for CPT or OPT.
- The statement “Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US” is a conditional specific to Mike, but it does not state his visa type. The F1 rule is one-directional (if F1 then CPT or OPT), not a biconditional; thus, needing CPT (if he wants to work) does not imply he must have F1, and there is no rule excluding J1 from potentially requiring CPT in the provided information.

Question 1: We cannot deduce that Mike has an F1 visa. Unknown.
Question 2: We also cannot deduce that Mike has a J1 visa. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
