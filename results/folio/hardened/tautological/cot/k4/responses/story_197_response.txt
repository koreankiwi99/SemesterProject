==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- ETS provides financial aid to GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
- Those in single-parent families or with few resources can prove economic hardship.
- Tom is a GRE applicant, lives in a single-parent family, and has few resources, so he can prove economic hardship.
- However, “can prove” does not entail that he actually did prove it. Therefore, we cannot conclude he is provided aid.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
- Therefore, the cost is below US $300.
Answer: True.

Question 3:
- The statement claims no one taking the GRE has financial aid from anything.
- ETS provides aid to GRE applicants who prove hardship, so it is possible that some takers receive aid.
- But we are not told that anyone actually does receive aid. Thus we cannot determine the universal claim’s truth from the given information.
Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
