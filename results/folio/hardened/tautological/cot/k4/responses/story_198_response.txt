Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals.
Humans are mammals.
Mammals are animals.
Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness. 
People feel tired when they get the flu.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

1) The statement "Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals" implies that there exist some animals. Therefore, "There is an animal" is supported as true.

2) The only information about flu is "People feel tired when they get the flu," which is a conditional and does not assert that anyone actually gets the flu. Thus, we cannot determine whether anyone gets the flu. The claim "No one gets the flu" is not supported or contradicted by the text, so it is unknown.

3) The symptoms listed for Monkeypox "include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness." The word "include" suggests a non-exhaustive list. Coughing is not mentioned, and we cannot infer whether it is included or not. Thus, this is unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
