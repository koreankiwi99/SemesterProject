Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Q1: Given “If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list” and “The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies,” by modus ponens The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list. So True.
- Q2: We only know that all games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese companies. We have no information about FIFA 22 being on the Top 10 list or its sales. Therefore we cannot conclude it’s made by a Japanese company. Unknown.
- Q3: This is the negation of Q1’s conclusion. Since Q1 is True, “The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list” is False.
