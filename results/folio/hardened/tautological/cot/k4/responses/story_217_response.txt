Story ID: 217
Premises: Not false and true is true. Not false or false is true. True or true is true. Not false and false is false. If George likes music, he wants to compose.
If George has access to a program, he can compose.
If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- From "If George likes music, he wants to compose" we have: Likes -> Wants.
- From "If George has access to a program, he can compose" we have: Access -> Can.
- From "If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose" we have: (Can ∧ Wants) -> Will.
- Therefore, if Likes ∧ Access, then Wants ∧ Can, hence Will. The implication holds.

Question 2:
- From (Can ∧ Wants) -> Will, the contrapositive is ¬Will -> (¬Can ∨ ¬Wants).
- This does not entail ¬Will -> ¬Can; it could be that ¬Will and ¬Wants are true while Can is true, consistent with the premises.
- Thus the statement does not follow from the information and is not contradicted either.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
