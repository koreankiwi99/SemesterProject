Some pets are not mammals.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- The propositional statements given (about false/true) are standard and do not affect the domain facts about cats, mammals, and pets.
- From “All cats are mammals” and “Some pets are not mammals,” we infer that there exists at least one pet that is not a mammal, hence that pet is not a cat.
- This does not rule out the existence of other pets that could be cats (which would be mammals). Therefore, “No pets are cats” is not entailed. It is consistent with the information but not required by it.
