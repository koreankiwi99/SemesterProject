Premises: Not false and true is true. Not false or false is true. False and true is not true. False and not false is false. All fir trees are evergreens.
Some objects of worship are fir trees.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "All fir trees are evergreens" (F ⊆ E) and "Some objects of worship are fir trees" (∃x: W(x) ∧ F(x)), we can infer ∃x: W(x) ∧ E(x). So at least one evergreen is an object of worship.
- The statement to evaluate is ∃x: E(x) ∧ ¬W(x).
- This is not entailed: it could be false if all evergreens are objects of worship (e.g., only one evergreen that is worshiped), or true if there exists any evergreen that is not worshiped. Both scenarios are consistent with the given information.
