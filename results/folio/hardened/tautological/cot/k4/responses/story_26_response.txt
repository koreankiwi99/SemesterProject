Story ID: 26
Premises: True and true is not false. True or true is true. Not false or true is not false. False or not false is true. Some mammals have teeth.
Platypuses have no teeth.
Platypuses are mammals. 
Humans have teeth.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. The text states "Platypuses have no teeth" and "Platypuses are mammals." Combining these, platypuses are mammals with no teeth. So the statement is supported.
2. The text only tells us platypuses are mammals; it gives no information about reptiles or whether being a mammal excludes being a reptile. So we cannot determine this from the given information.
3. The text says "Humans have teeth" and "Some mammals have teeth." From this, we cannot conclude that humans are mammals (having teeth does not imply being a mammal). No direct statement links humans to mammals.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
