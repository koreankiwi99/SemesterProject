Story ID: 295
Premises: True is not false. Not false or false is true. False and not false is false. False or not false is true. Some affection is love.
Some love is positive.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We translate the statements:
- Some affection is love: ∃x (Affection(x) ∧ Love(x)).
- Some love is positive: ∃y (Love(y) ∧ Positive(y)).

From these, it does not follow that ∃z (Affection(z) ∧ Positive(z)). The existential witnesses for the two premises may be different. Counterexample: one love-instance is affection but not positive; another love-instance is positive but not affection. Then both premises hold, but no affection is positive.

Therefore, the statement "Some affection is positive" is not entailed by the given information.
