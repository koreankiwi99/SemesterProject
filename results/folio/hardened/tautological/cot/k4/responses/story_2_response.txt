Premises: Not false and true is true. False and not false is false. Not true or true is true. False and not true is false. Billings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.
The state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.
White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.
The city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.
Any city in Butte is not in St Pierre.
A city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. The state of Montana includes the city of Butte. The city of St Pierre is not in Montana. A city (other than listed exceptions) can only be in one state; Butte is not an exception. Therefore, they cannot be in the same state. False.
2. The text gives no information about which state Bismarck is in, and only states that St Pierre is not in Montana. There is insufficient information to determine whether they share a state. Unknown.
3. The text explicitly states that the state of Montana includes Missoula. Therefore, Montana is home to Missoula. True.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: Unknown
3: True
