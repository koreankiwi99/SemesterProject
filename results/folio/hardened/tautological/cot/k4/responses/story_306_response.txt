==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
First, derive facts about the Hamden Plaza Subway store (h):
- From (5) R(h) ∨ P(h) and (4) P → R, we conclude R(h).
- From (2) R → Y, we get Y(h).
- From (1) Y → ¬N, we get ¬N(h).
- We have no information determining T(h).

Question 1:
- Antecedent: T(h) ∧ N(h) is false because N(h) is false.
- A conditional with a false antecedent is true. Therefore the statement is True.

Question 2:
- T(h) ∨ ¬N(h): since ¬N(h) is true, the disjunction is true. Therefore True.

Question 3:
- ¬T(h) cannot be derived from the premises; T(h) remains undetermined. Therefore Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
