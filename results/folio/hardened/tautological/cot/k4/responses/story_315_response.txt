Story ID: 315
Premises: False or not true is false. Not true or true is true. True or not true is true. Not true or false is not true. If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. 
If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Facts: Tesla Model 3 -> can transport multiple passengers -> not a one-seater.
- The only statement about John: If not Tesla Model 3, then (not Tesla Model 3 or single-seat electric car). This is a tautology and provides no information about whether John’s car is a Tesla Model 3.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether John’s car is a Tesla Model 3.

Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Solo EV -> single-seat electric car -> one-seater.
- No premise links John’s car to being a Solo EV or to being a single-seat electric car.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether John’s car is a Solo EV.

Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- If John’s car were a Tesla Model 3, then it would not be a one-seater, and since Solo EVs are one-seaters, that would imply not a Solo EV. But we do not know if John’s car is a Tesla Model 3.
- No other information rules out John’s car being a Solo EV.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether John’s car is not a Solo EV.

Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
