==================================================
Reasoning:

- From: If a show gives out roses on TV, then it is an episode of The Bachelor; The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people; and all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. Therefore, any show that gives out roses is a reality TV show.
- Given: Breaking Bad is a show and is not a reality TV show. Hence, Breaking Bad does not give out roses on TV.
- The existence of some show airing at 8 pm on Monday that gives out roses does not imply anything about Breaking Bad’s schedule.
