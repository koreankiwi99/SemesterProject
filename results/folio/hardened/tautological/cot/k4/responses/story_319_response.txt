==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “No baked sweets are spicy,” we have: BakedSweet -> not Spicy and thus Spicy -> not BakedSweet.
- All cupcakes are baked sweets: Cupcake -> BakedSweet.
- All Baked by Melissa products are cupcakes: BBMProduct -> Cupcake -> BakedSweet.
- All mala hotpots are spicy: MalaHotpot -> Spicy -> not BakedSweet.
- Given for Dried Thai chilies (DTC): Spicy(DTC) or MalaHotpot(DTC) or not BakedSweet(DTC).
  - In any case, not BakedSweet(DTC) must be true (since Spicy or MalaHotpot each imply not BakedSweet, and if neither holds, the third disjunct is not BakedSweet).
- Therefore: not BakedSweet(DTC). Hence not Cupcake(DTC) (contrapositive of Cupcake -> BakedSweet) and not BBMProduct(DTC) (contrapositive of BBMProduct -> Cupcake).

Question 1: DTC are products of Baked by Melissa.
- We have not BBMProduct(DTC). So False.

Question 2: DTC are not products of Baked by Melissa.
- True (as just derived).

Question 3: DTC are a mala hotpot.
- Not entailed; could be, but not necessary. Unknown.

Question 4: DTC are neither products of Baked by Melissa nor baked sweets.
- We have both not BBMProduct(DTC) and not BakedSweet(DTC). True.

Question 5: DTC are cupcakes and products of Baked by Melissa.
- We have not Cupcake(DTC) and not BBMProduct(DTC). False.
