==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let Growth(x) = x is a growth stock; Rapid(x) = x is bought for rapid price appreciation; Suitable(x) = x is suitable for a retirement fund; Stock(x) = x is a stock; Mature(x) = x is a mature stock.
- Premises:
  - All growth stocks are bought for rapid appreciation: Growth(x) -> Rapid(x).
  - If bought for rapid appreciation then not suitable: Rapid(x) -> ¬Suitable(x).
  - All mature stocks are suitable: Mature(x) -> Suitable(x).
  - KO is a mature stock: Mature(KO). Also, “mature stock” implies KO is a stock: Stock(KO).
- From Mature(KO) and Mature -> Suitable, we get Suitable(KO).
- From Rapid -> ¬Suitable and Suitable(KO), by modus tollens, ¬Rapid(KO).
- From Growth -> Rapid and ¬Rapid(KO), by contrapositive, ¬Growth(KO).

Question 1: KO is a stock.
- From “KO is a mature stock,” KO is a stock. True.

Question 2: KO is a stock and a growth stock.
- Stock(KO) is true; Growth(KO) is false. Conjunction is false. False.

Question 3: If KO is a growth stock or bought for rapid appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.
- Antecedent is Growth(KO) or Rapid(KO), both false; thus antecedent is false. A material implication with false antecedent is true regardless of the consequent. True.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: True
