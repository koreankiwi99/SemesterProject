Story ID: 330
Premises: Not true and false is false. False or not false is true. Not true or true is true. False and not true is false. All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the general rules: inviting others ⇒ making plans ⇒ engaged; well-attended wedding ⇒ inviting others ⇒ making plans ⇒ engaged.
- Existential: there exists at least one person with a well-attended wedding and a larger family (not necessarily John).
- For John specifically:
  - If John is engaged, then he makes wedding plans and does not invite friends.
  - If John has a larger family, then John either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends.

Question 1: Whether John has a larger family (L(j)):
- No premise asserts L(j), and the only rule about L(j) is conditional (if L(j) then ...). So it cannot be concluded.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2: Whether John does not have a larger family (¬L(j)):
- No premise entails ¬L(j). The data are consistent with either L(j) or ¬L(j).
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3: Whether John is engaged (E(j)):
- E(j) would follow if we knew John invites others, makes plans, or has a well-attended wedding, but none is given.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 4: Whether John neither has a larger family nor invites others (¬L(j) ∧ ¬I(j)):
- We cannot establish ¬L(j) or ¬I(j) from the premises. Even if John were engaged, we only get that he does not invite friends, not that he does not invite others.
- Conclusion: Unknown.
