Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “Djokovic is at the mixer” and “Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor,” we have: Djokovic is either a Grand Slam champion (GSC) or an Oscar-nominated actor (ONA), but we cannot determine which.

Question 1:
- We only know Djokovic is GSC or ONA. Nothing forces GSC specifically. So this is not determined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Case 1: If Djokovic is GSC, then he is a professional tennis player → athlete. Athletes at the mixer are famous. The given conditional for Djokovic says: if he is a famous athlete, then he is well-paid. Then, all well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens. So he lives in a tax haven.
- Case 2: If Djokovic is ONA, then he is a celebrity → well-paid → lives in a tax haven.
- In either case, Djokovic lives in a tax haven.
- Answer: True.

Question 3:
- This is the negation of Question 2’s conclusion. Since Q2 is True, this is False.
- Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
