Story ID: 343
Premises: False and not false is false. Not false is true. True or true is true. Not false or true is not false. No digital media are analog.
Every printed text is analog media.
All streaming services are digital media.
If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.
If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Rules:
  - All streaming services are digital media.
  - No digital media are analog. So Digital(x) -> not Analog(x).
  - Every printed text is analog media. So Printed(x) -> Analog(x).
  - If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text. So Hardcover(x) -> Printed(x).
  - If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book. So Streaming(1984) -> Hardcover(1984).

- Consequences if 1984 were a streaming service:
  - Streaming(1984) -> Digital(1984).
  - Streaming(1984) -> Hardcover(1984) -> Printed(1984) -> Analog(1984).
  - But Digital(1984) -> not Analog(1984).
  - Hence Analog(1984) and not Analog(1984), a contradiction. Therefore, 1984 is not a streaming service.

Question 1: Whether 1984 is printed text cannot be concluded. We only know if it were streaming then it would be hardcover and hence printed, but we established it is not streaming; no rule gives Printed(1984) otherwise. So Unknown.

Question 2: From the contradiction argument, 1984 is not a streaming service. So the claim that it is a streaming service is False.

Question 3: As above, 1984 is not a streaming service. So True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
