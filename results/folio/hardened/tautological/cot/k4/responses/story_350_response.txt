Story ID: 350
Premises: False or not false is true. True or not true is true. True and true is not false. False or not true is false. All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- The domain facts are universally quantified conditionals about styles, buildings, and designs; none assert that any particular design by Max exists.
- If a design by Max that he adores had interesting geometries, it would be a brutalist building and evocative. But no adored brutalist building has interesting geometries. Therefore, there cannot be any design by Max that he adores with interesting geometries. This still does not establish the existence of any design by Max, brutalist or otherwise.
- The statements about Kelly Wearstler’s styles being evocative and dreamy concern styles Max adores, not designs by Max; no link is given that any design by Max is such a style, nor that any relevant objects exist.

Question 1:
- We are not told that any design by Max exists, nor that any design by Max is brutalist. The conditional about interesting geometries does not create existence. Therefore, we cannot conclude existence of a brutalist design by Max.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Similarly, nothing asserts existence of a design by Max that is evocative and dreamy. The only route to evocative for a design by Max goes through the interesting-geometries conditional, but such adored designs cannot exist due to the contradiction with the “no adored brutalist building has interesting geometries” rule. No existence can be concluded.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The disjunction still requires existence of some design by Max that is evocative or dreamy. No such existence is entailed by the premises for the same reasons as above.
- Answer: Unknown.
