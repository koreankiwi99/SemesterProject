Story ID: 352
Premises: Not false is true. False and not true is false. Not false and false is false. True and true is not false. All business organizations are legal entities.
All companies are business organizations.
All private companies are companies.
All legal entities are created under law. 
All legal entities have legal obligations.
If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the taxonomy:
  - All private companies are companies.
  - All companies are business organizations.
  - All business organizations are legal entities.
  - All legal entities are created under law and have legal obligations.
  - Therefore, if something is a private company, it is a legal entity, created under law, and has legal obligations.

- Special conditional:
  - If the Harvard Weekly Book Club (HWBC) is created under law, then it is not a private company.

- Combining:
  - If HWBC were a private company, then it would be created under law, and hence (by the special conditional) not a private company. So: if private company, then not a private company. This implies HWBC is not a private company.

Question 1:
- We only know HWBC is not a private company. We have no information that HWBC is a legal entity (which would guarantee legal obligations) or that it is created under law. Thus we cannot conclude it has legal obligations.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement requires both “has legal obligations” and “is a private company.” We have deduced that HWBC is not a private company. Therefore the conjunction is false.
- Answer: False.

Question 3:
- If HWBC is a private company, then it is a legal entity and thus created under law. Hence, under that assumption, it certainly satisfies “has legal obligations or is created under law” (the second disjunct is true).
- Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
