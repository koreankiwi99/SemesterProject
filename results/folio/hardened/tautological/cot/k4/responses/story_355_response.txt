Story ID: 355
Premises: False or not false is true. True and not false is true. Not false and false is false. True and false is not true. All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.
All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.
All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Build the implication chain:
  - G(x) -> N(x) -> H(x) -> E(x) -> C(x)
  - D(x) -> not C(x)

- Taylor’s given disjunction: (H ∧ D) or (not H ∧ not D).
  - If H ∧ D held, then from H we get C, and from D we get not C, yielding C ∧ not C, which is impossible (true and false is not true). So H ∧ D cannot be true.
  - Therefore, Taylor must satisfy not H ∧ not D.

Question 1:
- From not H we cannot infer anything about E (no contrapositive from H -> E). So whether Taylor eats salads regularly is undetermined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- From G -> H and not H, modus tollens gives not G. So Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day.
- Answer: False.

Question 3:
- We have not H from above, and not G from G -> H plus not H. Thus Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day.
- Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
