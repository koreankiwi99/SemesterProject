Story ID: 361
Premises: Not false is true. Not true is false. Not true and false is false. Not false and true is true. If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the rules: spill -> not tidy, cleanly -> tidy. Therefore, spill and cleanly together would imply tidy and not tidy, which is impossible. So (spill ∧ cleanly) is false.
- Given: Peter is either (spill ∧ cleanly) or (¬spill ∧ ¬cleanly). Since the first disjunct is impossible, Peter must satisfy (¬spill ∧ ¬cleanly).

Question 1:
- From ¬spill and ¬cleanly, no rule determines whether Peter is tidy: spill -> not tidy (doesn’t apply), cleanly -> tidy (doesn’t apply). So this is Unknown.

Question 2:
- Clumsy foodie (CF) -> spill. Since ¬spill, we get ¬CF.
- Family prioritizes order (Fam) -> value -> cleanly. Since ¬cleanly, we get ¬Fam.
- Thus CF ∨ Fam is False.

Question 3:
- We have ¬CF and ¬Fam, so the “either both CF and Fam or neither CF nor Fam” statement is true via the neither case. True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
