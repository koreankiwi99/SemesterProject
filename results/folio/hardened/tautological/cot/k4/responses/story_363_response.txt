Story ID: 363
Premises: Not true or true is true. Not false is true. Not true or false is not true. False and true is not true. All hydrocarbons are organic compounds .
All alkanes are hydrocarbons
All organic compounds are chemical compounds.
All organic compounds contain carbon.
No chemical compounds contain only one element.
The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “No chemical compounds contain only one element,” we have: if the mixture is a chemical compound (C), then it does not contain only one element (¬E).
- From “The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither,” we have (C ∧ E) ∨ (¬C ∧ ¬E). Since C → ¬E, (C ∧ E) is impossible, so the mixture must satisfy ¬C ∧ ¬E. Thus the mixture is not a chemical compound and does not contain only one element.
- Alkanes ⊆ hydrocarbons ⊆ organic compounds ⊆ chemical compounds. Hence if something is an alkane (A), it is a chemical compound. Since the mixture is not a chemical compound, it is not an alkane (¬A).
- We have no information that forces the mixture to contain carbon (K); being not an organic compound does not imply anything about carbon content.

Question 1: Whether the mixture contains carbon is not determined by the given information. Unknown.

Question 2: The mixture is not an alkane (as it is not a chemical compound), so “alkane and contains carbon” is false. False.

Question 3: The consequent “neither a chemical compound nor an alkane” (¬C ∧ ¬A) is true, so the implication holds regardless of the antecedent. True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
