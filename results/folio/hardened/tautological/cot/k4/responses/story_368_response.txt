Story ID: 368
Premises: Not true and true is false. False and not true is false. False and not false is false. Not false and true is true. If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition.
If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus.
People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.
If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters.
If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.
Hannah is at Mary's school.
Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “If people at Mary’s school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money…” and “Hannah works in student jobs on campus,” we get that Hannah needs to earn money.
- From “if she needs to earn money … then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money,” together with the above, we also derive that Hannah does not need to earn money and that she is not a picky eater.
- Thus, for Q1 we derive both “needs” and “does not need,” creating a contradiction; we cannot definitively label the claim as simply true or false based on the information.
- For Q2, we know Hannah is at Mary’s school and that she is not a picky eater. However, we only get “spends a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls” from “enjoy the dining hall meals,” and we do not know whether Hannah enjoys the dining hall meals (we only know “order takeout or enjoy dining hall”), so we cannot conclude the spending-time claim; nor can we conclude its negation. Hence uncertain.
- For Q3, the second part is a disjunction: “not a picky eater” or “if she is picky then she spends a lot of time…”. Since we have already derived that Hannah is not a picky eater, the disjunction is true; combined with “Hannah is at Mary’s school,” the whole statement is true.
