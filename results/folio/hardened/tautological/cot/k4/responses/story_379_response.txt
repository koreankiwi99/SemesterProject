Story ID: 379
Premises: False and not true is false. True is not false. False is not true. Not true and true is false. People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.
If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.
If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. 
Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the rules: M(x) -> S(x) -> H(x) -> not Ls(x). Also, C(x) -> T(x) -> M(x), so C(x) -> M(x).
- Luke: (M and Ls) or (not M and not Ls).
- If (M and Ls) held, then from M we’d get not Ls, contradicting Ls. So that disjunct is impossible. Therefore Luke satisfies not M and not Ls.
- Q1 (S?): From not M and not Ls we cannot infer S or not S; only M -> S is given. So S is undetermined.
- Q2 (C?): Since C -> M and Luke has not M, by contrapositive not C.
- Q3: We have not M and not C, so the statement is true.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
