Story ID: 380
Premises: Not false or false is true. Not true is false. False is not true. Not true and false is false. People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. 
Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Set predicates for Bonnie: 
- P: performs often; A: attends/very engaged; I: inactive/disinterested; C: chaperones; S: student; Y: young child/teen who wishes to further academics.

Given for club members:
- P → A.
- I → C and C → ¬S, hence I → ¬S.
- Y → S.
- P ∨ I.
For Bonnie: (A ∧ S) ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬S), i.e., A ↔ S.

Case analysis from P ∨ I with A ↔ S:
- If I: then C, ¬S, hence ¬A; thus P is false (since P → A). Also Y is false (from ¬S and Y → S).
- If ¬I: then P true; hence A and S are true; thus C is false (from C → ¬S contrapositive). Y is undetermined.

Thus:
- P is not determined (true if ¬I, false if I).
- C ∨ P is always true (either I gives C, or ¬I gives P).
- Y ∧ I is impossible (since Y → S and I → ¬S).

Question 1: P is true in one case and false in the other. Therefore Unknown.

Question 2: Antecedent is (Y ∧ C) ∨ ¬Y, but Y ∧ C is impossible (Y → S, C → ¬S). So effectively antecedent is ¬Y. In either main case, S ∨ I holds (I in the first case; S in the second). Therefore the implication is always true. True.

Question 3: Antecedent simplifies to C ∨ (¬C → P) = C ∨ (C ∨ P) = C ∨ P, which is always true as noted. Consequent Y ∧ I is impossible. A conditional with always-true antecedent and always-false consequent is false. False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
