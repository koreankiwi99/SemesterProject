Story ID: 385
Premises: True and false is not true. True is not false. True or true is true. False is not true. If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. 
Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male” and “Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022,” Coco is either female or male at RG 2022.
- Assume Coco is male. Then by “All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal,” Coco lost to Nadal. Then the condition “If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022” makes her not male, contradicting the assumption. Hence, Coco is not male. Therefore, by disjunctive syllogism, Coco is female.
- From “All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek,” Coco lost to Świątek.
- From “Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the WTA,” Coco is ranked highly by the WTA.
- From “If someone is ranked highly by the WTA, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis,” Coco is among the most active Grand-Slam (major) players.

Question 1:
- As shown, Coco is ranked highly by WTA ⇒ she is among the most active major (Grand-Slam) players.
- Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- The only rule about losing to Nadal applies to male players; Coco is not male. No rule otherwise asserts or denies that she lost to Nadal.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- We derived that Coco both lost to Iga Świątek at RG 2022 and is one of the most active players in major tennis.
- The statement says she is not both; that contradicts the derivation.
- Conclusion: False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
