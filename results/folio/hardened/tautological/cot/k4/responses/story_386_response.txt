Story ID: 386
Premises: Not true or false is not true. True and not false is true. Not true and true is false. False is not true. If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- Severe(x) -> Deadly(x); Deadly(x) -> LowSurvival(x). Hence Severe(x) -> LowSurvival(x).
- BileDuct(x) -> Severe(x) -> LowSurvival(x).
- Cholangiocarcinoma(x) -> BileDuct(x).
- Not(BileDuct(Colorectal) and LowSurvival(Colorectal)).

From BileDuct(x) -> LowSurvival(x) and Not(BileDuct(Colorectal) and LowSurvival(Colorectal)), we deduce Not BileDuct(Colorectal). From Chol(x) -> BileDuct(x) and Not BileDuct(Colorectal), we deduce Not Chol(Colorectal).

Question 1:
- Does Severe(Colorectal) hold? We only know BileDuct -> Severe, but Not BileDuct(Colorectal). Nothing else implies Severe(Colorectal), and Not(BileDuct ∧ Low) does not rule out Low alone. So we cannot determine Severe(Colorectal).
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Statement: (BileDuct(Colorectal) or Chol(Colorectal)) -> (BileDuct(Colorectal) and MildFlu(Colorectal)).
- Since Chol -> BileDuct, the antecedent is equivalent to BileDuct(Colorectal), which we know is false. A conditional with a false antecedent is true.
Answer: True.

Question 3:
- Statement is effectively: Chol(Colorectal) and (MildFlu(Colorectal) or BileDuct(Colorectal)) (the “or all of the above” adds only a stronger case already included).
- We have Not Chol(Colorectal), so the conjunction is false.
Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
