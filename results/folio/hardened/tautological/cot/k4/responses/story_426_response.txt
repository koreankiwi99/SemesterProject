Story ID: 426
Premises: Not true and false is false. Not false and false is false. True or true is true. Not false is true. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. 
Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. 
Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. 
No managers work remotely from home. 
James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Let:
- Lc = has lunch in the company building
- Lh = has lunch at home
- G = goes/appears in the company building today
- S = schedules meetings with customers
- R = works remotely from home
- O = in other countries
- M = manager

Given:
- If Lc then S; if S then G, so Lc -> G.
- Everyone has lunch either in the company or at home: Lc or Lh (exhaustive).
- If Lh then R; contrapositive: if not R then not Lh.
- If O then R; contrapositive: if not R then not O.
- No managers work remotely: M -> not R.
- James: G iff M.

From these:
- Lc -> G and G -> M (by the iff), so Lc -> M (for James).
- M -> not R (managers not remote) -> not Lh (by contrapositive of Lh -> R); with Lc or Lh, this forces Lc. Hence M -> Lc.
- Therefore for James, Lc iff M.

Two consistent cases exist:
- If M, then Lc (and G, not R, not Lh).
- If not M, then not G; since Lc -> G, not G implies not Lc; with Lc or Lh, this forces Lh; then Lh -> R. So not M implies Lh and R and not Lc.

Question 1: “James has lunch in the company.”
- Since Lc iff M but we don’t know whether James is a manager, this is not determined.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: “James does not have lunch in the company.”
- This is the negation of Q1; since Q1 is Unknown, this is also not determined.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 3: “If James is either a manager or in other countries, then he neither has lunch at home nor works remotely. If James either has lunch at home or works remotely, then he is neither a manager nor in other countries.”
- This asserts (M or O) -> not(Lh or R) and its contrapositive.
- Countermodel consistent with the premises: not M, O true. Then from not M we get R true and Lh true (as above). With O -> R satisfied. Here (M or O) is true (because O), but not(Lh or R) is false (since R true). So the implication fails. Hence the whole statement is false.
Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: False

Q1: James has lunch in the company.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: James does not have lunch in the company.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q3: If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home. If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries. [contrapositive is more natural]
