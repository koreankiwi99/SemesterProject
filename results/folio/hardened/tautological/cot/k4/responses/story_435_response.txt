Story ID: 435
Premises: True is not false. Not true or false is not true. True or true is true. Not true is false. None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department. 
All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. 
All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department. 
All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. 
All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.
James is a student working in the lab. 
James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David” and “All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course,” James works in the lab ⇒ takes David’s class ⇒ takes the database course. Also, “All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department,” so James is CS.
- “James doesn’t work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university” parses as (not work-in-lab) OR (has a part-time job). Since James does work in the lab, the disjunction forces that James has a part-time job.
- From “All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library” and “None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department,” James has a part-time job ⇒ works in the library ⇒ not CS. This conflicts with the earlier conclusion that James is CS, but it does not undermine the specific conclusions that he both takes the database course and has a part-time job.

Question 1:
- As above, the disjunction implies James has a part-time job. True.

Question 2:
- Negation of Q1; since Q1 is true, this is false. False.

Question 3:
- We have both that James takes the database course and has a part-time job, so the disjunction is true. True.

Question 4:
- From working in the lab ⇒ takes David’s class ⇒ takes the database course. True.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: True
4: True
