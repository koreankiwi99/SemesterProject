Story ID: 441
Premises: True and true is not false. True and not false is true. True or not true is true. False and not false is false. No one nice to animals is also mean to animals.
Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
All animal lovers are nice to animals.
All pet owners love animals.
Tom is a pet owner.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "All pet owners love animals" and "All animal lovers are nice to animals," Tom (a pet owner) loves animals and is nice to animals.
- From "No one nice to animals is also mean to animals," Tom is not mean to animals.

Question 1:
- We have no information linking being a pet owner or being nice to being grumpy. "Some grumpy people are mean" does not imply Tom is grumpy. So this is not determined.

Question 2:
- Since Tom is not mean, he cannot be both grumpy and mean. Therefore, "Tom is not both grumpy and mean" is true.

Question 3:
- Antecedent: "Tom is not both grumpy and mean" is true (from above).
- Consequent: "Tom is neither grumpy nor an animal lover" is false because Tom is an animal lover (as a pet owner).
- A true antecedent with a false consequent makes the conditional false.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
