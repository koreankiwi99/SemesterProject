Story ID: 442
Premises: False is not true. False and not false is false. Not true and true is false. Not false and true is true. All Brown Swiss cattle are cows.
Some pets are Brown Swiss Cattle.
All cows are domesticated animals.
Alligators are not domesticated animals.
Ted is an alligator.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- We know Ted is an alligator and alligators are not domesticated animals, so Ted is not domesticated.
- There is no rule connecting being a pet to being domesticated (we only know some pets are Brown Swiss cattle).
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether Ted is a pet. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- From Ted being an alligator, Ted is not domesticated.
- All cows are domesticated; by contraposition, anything not domesticated is not a cow. So Ted is not a cow.
- All Brown Swiss cattle are cows; by contraposition, anything not a cow is not Brown Swiss cattle. So Ted is not Brown Swiss cattle.
- Therefore, “Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle” is false because the Brown Swiss cattle part is false. Answer: False.

Question 3:
- From the above, Ted is not Brown Swiss cattle. So the antecedent “Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle” is false in all models of the premises.
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
