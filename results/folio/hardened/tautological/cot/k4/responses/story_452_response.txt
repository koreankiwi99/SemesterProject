Story ID: 452
Premises: Not false or true is not false. True is not false. Not true is false. False and not true is false. All aliens are extraterrestrials.
If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.
No extraterrestrials are human.
All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.
Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien,” “All aliens are extraterrestrials,” and “No extraterrestrials are human”: Mars -> Alien -> Extraterrestrial -> Not Human.
- From “All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans” and “Marvin is a highly intelligent being”: If Earth then Human.
- If we take the first disjunct of “Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither” (Earth and Mars), we get Human (from Earth and HI) and Not Human (from Mars -> Alien -> ET -> Not Human), a contradiction. Hence not (Earth and Mars), so by the given disjunction it must be the second disjunct: not Earth and not Mars.
- From “If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial”: Not Earth implies Extraterrestrial, and thus Not Human.

Question 1:
- We have Not Mars, so we cannot use the Mars -> Alien rule. We do have Extraterrestrial, but only Alien -> Extraterrestrial is given, not the converse. So we cannot conclude Alien nor Not Alien. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- We derived Not Human and Not Mars. Answer: True.

Question 3:
- We derived Not Mars (true) and Not Human (so Human is false). Thus the conditional “If Not Mars then Human” has a true antecedent and false consequent, making it false. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
