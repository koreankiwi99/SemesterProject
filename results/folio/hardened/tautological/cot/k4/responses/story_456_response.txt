Story ID: 456
Premises: False or not false is true. False and true is not true. Not true and true is false. False or not true is false. Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. 
Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Key derived facts:
- From the chain: Professional basketball player -> can do jump shots -> leaps straight into the air -> activates leg muscles. So P(x) -> M(x).
- Yuri does not activate his leg muscles (¬M(Yuri)). By contrapositive, Yuri does not leap straight (¬L(Yuri)), cannot do jump shots (¬J(Yuri)), and is not a professional basketball player (¬P(Yuri)).
- No information determines Yuri’s nationality.

Reasoning per question:
1. We have no information about Yuri’s nationality. Unknown.
2. “Not an American professional basketball player” means not(A ∧ P). Since ¬P(Yuri), this is True.
3. “An American professional basketball player” means A ∧ P. Since ¬P(Yuri), this is False.
4. Antecedent “Yuri does not leap straight” is true (from ¬M -> ¬L). Consequent “Yuri is an American professional basketball player” (A ∧ P) is false (since ¬P). True -> False makes the implication False.
5. Antecedent “Yuri is not an American professional basketball player” i.e., ¬(A ∧ P) is True (since ¬P). Consequent “Yuri is a professional basketball player” (P) is False. True -> False makes the implication False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
4: False
5: False
