Story ID: 459
Premises: Not true or true is true. True or true is true. False and not true is false. Not true and true is false. Jane does not like any animals that bark.
All dogs are animals that bark.
Jane likes all animals that jump.
If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. 
KiKi is an animal.
If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From (If terricolous then legs) and (If legs then jumps), and the KiKi-specific rule (If neither jumps nor has legs then terricolous or has legs), we get that KiKi cannot have both not-jumps and not-legs. Hence Jumps(KiKi) or Has-legs(KiKi). Together with (legs -> jumps), this yields Jumps(KiKi).
- Jane likes all animals that jump, and KiKi is an animal that jumps, so Jane likes KiKi.
- Jane does not like any animals that bark. Since KiKi is an animal and Jane likes KiKi, by contrapositive KiKi does not bark.
- All dogs are animals that bark, so by contrapositive from not-bark we get that KiKi is not a dog.

Question 1: We have no rule implying terricolous from jumping; only terricolous -> legs -> jumps. So we cannot conclude KiKi is terricolous. Unknown.

Question 2: “Barking dog” requires both dog and barks. We derived not-bark and not-dog. So the statement is false. False.

Question 3: We derived both not-bark and not-dog. So the conjunction is true. True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
