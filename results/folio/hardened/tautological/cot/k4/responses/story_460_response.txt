Premises: Not true or false is not true. Not true is false. True is not false. True and true is not false. If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.

“Hachi: A dog’s Tale”  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Rules:
  - GA -> Appropriate for all ages (A).
  - A -> Children can watch without guidance (CW).
  - Contains excessive erotic/violent content (EVC) -> not CW.
  - All family-friendly animated films (FFAF) -> GA.
  - All Frozen-series films -> FFAF.
  - Hachi is a film.
  - Hachi is FFAF or A (inclusive or).

- From the disjunction: if Hachi is FFAF, then GA -> A; if not FFAF, then A directly. Hence, in all cases, Hachi is A, so CW.
- Using contraposition on EVC -> not CW, CW implies not EVC. Thus Hachi does not contain EVC.
- We have no rule that A implies GA, so GA status remains undetermined.
- We have no information about Hachi being in the Frozen series.

Question 1:
- GA cannot be concluded (A does not imply GA). Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Statement is EVC or Frozen. We know not EVC; Frozen status is unknown. Thus the disjunction’s truth is unknown. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- Statement is (EVC and Frozen) or (not EVC and not Frozen).
- We know not EVC; reduces to not Frozen, which is unknown. Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
