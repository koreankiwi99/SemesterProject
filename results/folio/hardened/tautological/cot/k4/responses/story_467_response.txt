==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “Peter’s pets are all either monkeys or birds” and “Rock is Peter’s pet,” Rock is a monkey or a bird (possibly both).
- All monkeys are mammals. Any of Peter’s pets that are mammals are animals. All animals that are Peter’s pets can breathe.
- Peter’s birds can fly. If a Peter’s pet can fly, then it has wings.
- Given: Fly(Rock) or Bird(Rock) or ¬Breathe(Rock).

Question 1:
- Rock could be a bird instead of a monkey; the premises do not force monkey over bird.
- Therefore, “Rock is a monkey” is not entailed.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Case 1: If Rock is a bird, then (as Peter’s bird) Rock can fly, hence Rock has wings.
- Case 2: If Rock is not a bird, then (since he’s a pet) he must be a monkey, hence a mammal, hence an animal, hence he can breathe. With ¬Breathe(Rock) false and Bird(Rock) false, the disjunction forces Fly(Rock) true; as a flying pet, Rock has wings.
- In all cases, Rock has wings.
- Conclusion: True.

Question 3:
- Since Rock has wings (from Q2), “Rock does not have wings” is false.
- Conclusion: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
