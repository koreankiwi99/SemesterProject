Story ID: 471
Premises: Not true or false is not true. False and not false is false. Not false or false is true. True is not false. All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. 
Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. 
The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “Rockie can be spotted near the campus” and “The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels,” Rockie is a rabbit or a squirrel.
- From “All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish” and “If something is skittish, then it is not calm,” any spotted squirrel is not calm.
- Rockie is calm; therefore Rockie is not skittish. Hence Rockie cannot be a squirrel, so Rockie is a rabbit.
- From “All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute,” Rockie is cute.
- Nothing links being a rabbit with being (not) a turtle. “Some turtles can be spotted near the campus” does not identify Rockie as one of them, nor rule it out.

Question 1: We cannot determine whether Rockie is a turtle. Unknown.

Question 2: We cannot determine that Rockie is not a turtle. Unknown.

Question 3: Rockie is cute; therefore “Rockie is a turtle or cute” is true. True.

Question 4: Rockie is not a squirrel, so he is not both a turtle and a squirrel (antecedent true). He is cute, so the consequent “either cute or skittish” holds. True.

Question 5: Rockie is cute and calm (true antecedent), but he is not skittish, so he cannot be a skittish turtle (false consequent). The implication is false. False.
