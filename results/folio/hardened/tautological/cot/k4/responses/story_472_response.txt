Story ID: 472
Premises: Not true is false. False is not true. Not true and false is false. False or not true is false. Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. 
All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
All queen bees are bees.
Harry is a bee.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- All animals with backbones (AnB) reproduce by male-and-female mating (R): AnB(x) -> R(x).
- All vertebrate animals have a backbone: Animal(x) ∧ Vertebrate(x) -> Backbone(x). Thus Animal(x) ∧ Vertebrate(x) -> AnB(x) -> R(x).
- All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating: Bee(x) -> ¬R(x).
- All queen bees are bees: QueenBee(x) -> Bee(x).
- Harry is a bee: Bee(Harry).

From Bee(Harry) -> ¬R(Harry). Using AnB -> R, by contrapositive ¬R -> ¬AnB, so ¬AnB(Harry). Also ¬R(Harry) implies ¬(Animal(Harry) ∧ Vertebrate(Harry)). We are not given that bees are animals, so Animal(Harry), Vertebrate(Harry), and Invertebrate(Harry) remain undetermined.

Question 1:
- We know QueenBee -> Bee, but not Bee -> QueenBee. From Bee(Harry) alone we cannot conclude Harry is a queen bee.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Disjunction: Invertebrate(Harry) ∨ QueenBee(Harry). Neither disjunct is entailed by the premises. There is a consistent model where Bee(Harry) is true, but both Invertebrate(Harry) and QueenBee(Harry) are false.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- Antecedent: (Vertebrate ∧ AnB) ∨ (¬Vertebrate ∧ ¬AnB). Since ¬AnB(Harry), this reduces to ¬Vertebrate(Harry).
- Consequent: ¬Invertebrate(Harry) ∧ ¬QueenBee(Harry).
- We cannot determine ¬Vertebrate(Harry) from the premises. Moreover, even if ¬Vertebrate(Harry) holds, the consequent need not: e.g., it is consistent that Harry is a queen bee. So the implication is not determined by the given information.
- Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown

Questions and Results:
==================================================
Q1: Harry is a queen bee.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee.
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: No

Q3: If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.
