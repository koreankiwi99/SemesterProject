Story ID: 58
Premises: Not true or false is not true. False or not false is true. Not true and false is false. True is not false. Books contain tons of knowledge.
When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge. 
If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.
Harry read the book “Walden” by Henry Thoreau.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) Walden is explicitly called a book. The context states that books contain tons of knowledge. Therefore, Walden contains knowledge.

2) Harry read Walden, which is a book. The context states that when a person reads a book, they gain knowledge, and if a person gains knowledge, they become smarter. Becoming smarter implies being smarter than before. Therefore, Harry is smarter than before.

3) The context gives: if a person gains knowledge, they become smarter (knowledge → smarter). The statement asks for the converse (smarter → gained knowledge), which is not implied by the given information. There could be other reasons someone becomes smarter. Thus, we cannot conclude it as true or false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
