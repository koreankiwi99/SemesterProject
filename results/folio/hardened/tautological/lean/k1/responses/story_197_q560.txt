Premises: False and true is not true. It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
Tom lives in a single-parent family.
