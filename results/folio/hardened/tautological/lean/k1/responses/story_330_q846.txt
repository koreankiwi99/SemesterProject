Story ID: 330
Example ID: 846
Premises: Not true and false is false. All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. 
Conclusion: John has a larger family.
