Story ID: 350
Example ID: 927
Premises: False or not false is true. All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.
Conclusion: A design by Max is a brutalist building.
