Premises: Not false or false is true. All hydrocarbons are organic compounds .
All alkanes are hydrocarbons
All organic compounds are chemical compounds.
All organic compounds contain carbon.
No chemical compounds contain only one element.
The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. 
Conclusion: If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane.
