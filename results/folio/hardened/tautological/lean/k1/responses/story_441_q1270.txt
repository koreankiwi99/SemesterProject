Premises: Not true and true is false. No one nice to animals is also mean to animals.
Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
All animal lovers are nice to animals.
All pet owners love animals.
Tom is a pet owner.
Conclusion: If Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an animal lover.
