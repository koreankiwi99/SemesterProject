Story ID: 183
Example ID: 529
Premises: Not false or true is not false. Not true and true is false. If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z
Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.
Conclusion: Peter can block Windy's shooting.
