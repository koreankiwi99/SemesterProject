Premises: True and true is not false. Not true and false is false. Events are either happy or sad.
At least one event is happy. 
Conclusion: All events are sad.

/- Parsing the textual context into Lean:

  - "Events are either happy or sad." → ∀ e, Happy e ∨ Sad e
  - "At least one event is happy." → ∃ e, Happy e
  - Target claim to check: "All events are sad." → ∀ e, Sad e

  The two propositional lines are tautological and not directly used, but we include simple corresponding lemmas.
