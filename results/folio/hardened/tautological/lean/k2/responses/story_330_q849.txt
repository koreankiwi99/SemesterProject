Premises: True and not false is true. False and not false is false. All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony. 
Conclusion: John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding.
