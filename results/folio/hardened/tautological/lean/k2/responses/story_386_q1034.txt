Story ID: 386
Example ID: 1034
Premises: False and true is not true. Not false and false is false. If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.
Conclusion: Colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above.
