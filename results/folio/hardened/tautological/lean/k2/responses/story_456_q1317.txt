Story ID: 456
Example ID: 1317
Premises: Not false or true is not false. Not false or false is true. Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
All professional basketball players can do jump shots.

Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.
Conclusion: If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player.
