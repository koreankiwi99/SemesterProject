Story ID: 459
Example ID: 1326
Premises: Not true is false. False and not false is false. Jane does not like any animals that bark.
All dogs are animals that bark.
Jane likes all animals that jump.
If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. 
KiKi is an animal.
If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
Conclusion: KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog.
