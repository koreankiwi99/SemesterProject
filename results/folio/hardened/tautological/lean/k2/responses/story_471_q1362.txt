Story ID: 471
Example ID: 1362
Premises: Not true and true is false. Not false is true. All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. 
Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. 
The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
Conclusion: Rockie is not a turtle.

Note: From the given premises, we cannot derive ¬ Turtle Rockie nor Turtle Rockie.
The premises allow that some turtles are spotted; combined with "only spotted are rabbits or squirrels"
this only forces any spotted turtle to also be a rabbit or a squirrel (or both). Since we showed Rockie
is not a squirrel and is a rabbit, nothing prevents Rockie from also being a turtle under these premises.
Thus "Rockie is not a turtle" is not derivable from the given information.
