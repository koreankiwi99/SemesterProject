Story ID: 472
Example ID: 1366
Premises: Not true is false. False is not true. Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. 
All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
All queen bees are bees.
Harry is a bee.
Conclusion: Harry is a queen bee.
