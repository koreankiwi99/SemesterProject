Story ID: 124
Example ID: 370
Premises: True or true is true. Not false is true. True is not false. Not true and false is false. The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas.
Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.
The Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated.
There are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated.
Conclusion: Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico.
