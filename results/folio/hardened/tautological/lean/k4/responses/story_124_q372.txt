Premises: Not true or false is not true. False or not false is true. False or not true is false. True and false is not true. The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas.
Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.
The Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated.
There are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated.
Conclusion: The Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico.
