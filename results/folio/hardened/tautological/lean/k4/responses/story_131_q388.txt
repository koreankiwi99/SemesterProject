Premises: False and not false is false. Not true is false. Not false is true. True is not false. Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms.
Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.
The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.
Conclusion: Supervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.
