Story ID: 197
Example ID: 561
Premises: Not true or true is true. Not false or false is true. False and true is not true. Not false and true is true. It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
Tom lives in a single-parent family.
Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them. 
Tom is applying to take the GRE test.
Conclusion: It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test.

numerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `205` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is
  USD
due to the absence of the instance above

Hint: Additional diagnostic information may be available using the `set_option diagnostics true` command.
