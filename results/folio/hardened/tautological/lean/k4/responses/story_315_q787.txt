Story ID: 315
Example ID: 787
Premises: Not true is false. True and false is not true. Not true and false is false. True or not true is true. If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. 
If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. 
Conclusion: John's car is a Solo EV.
