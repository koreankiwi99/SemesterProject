Story ID: 315
Example ID: 788
Premises: False is not true. True is not false. Not false and false is false. Not false is true. If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. 
If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. 
Conclusion: John's car is not a Solo EV.
