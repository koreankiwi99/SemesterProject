Story ID: 471
Example ID: 1362
Premises: Not true and true is false. Not false is true. Not false or false is true. True or not true is true. All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. 
Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. 
The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
Conclusion: Rockie is not a turtle.
