Premises: Not true or false is not true. False and not true is false. Not false is true. Not true and true is false. All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute. 
Some turtles can be spotted near the campus. 
The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
Conclusion: If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle.
