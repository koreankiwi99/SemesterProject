Story ID: 472
Example ID: 1366
Premises: Not true is false. False is not true. Not true and false is false. False or not true is false. Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. 
All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
All queen bees are bees.
Harry is a bee.
Conclusion: Harry is a queen bee.
