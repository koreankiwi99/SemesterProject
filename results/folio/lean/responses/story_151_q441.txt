Premises: Barutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.
Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island.
Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands.
Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands. 
If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.
Conclusion: Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica.
