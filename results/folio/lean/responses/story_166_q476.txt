Example ID: 476
Premises: Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. 
Conclusion: Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden.
