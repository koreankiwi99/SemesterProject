Example ID: 548
Premises: International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
Mike is an international student.
Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.
Conclusion: Mike has an F1 visa.

-- From the given premises (1)-(4), this does not follow: (1) only yields HasF1 Mike ∨ HasJ1 Mike,
-- and nothing rules out the J1 case or forces the F1 case. Therefore, we cannot derive HasF1 Mike here.
-- We do not assert a theorem `HasF1 Mike` because it is not provable from the provided premises.
