Example ID: 562
Premises: It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
Tom lives in a single-parent family.
Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them. 
Tom is applying to take the GRE test.
Conclusion: No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something.
