-- 1. All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
axiom all_growth_bought_rapid : ∀ x : Entity, Growth x → BoughtForRapid x

-- 2. If a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.

-- 3. Some stocks are growth stocks.
axiom some_stock_growth : ∃ x : Entity, Stock x ∧ Growth x

-- 4. All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom mature_suitable : ∀ x : Entity, Mature x → SuitableForRetirement x

-- 5. KO is a mature stock (encode as both Mature KO and Stock KO).
axiom KO_mature : Mature KO
axiom KO_stock : Stock KO

-- From the premises, KO cannot be a growth stock.
