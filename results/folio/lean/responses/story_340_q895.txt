Premises: Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.
Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player.
All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities.
All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes.
If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid.
If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous.
All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens.
Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.
Conclusion: Djokovic does not live in a tax haven.
