Story ID: 343
Example ID: 904
Premises: No digital media are analog.
Every printed text is analog media.
All streaming services are digital media.
If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.
If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.
Conclusion: 1984 is printed text.
