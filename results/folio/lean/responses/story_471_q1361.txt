-- Premises:

-- 2. Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
axiom some_turtle_spotted : ∃ x : Animal, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x

-- 3. The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
axiom only_rabbits_and_squirrels_spotted : ∀ x : Animal, Spotted x → Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x

-- 4. If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
axiom skittish_not_calm : ∀ x : Animal, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x

-- 5. All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
axiom squirrels_spotted_skittish : ∀ x : Animal, Squirrel x ∧ Spotted x → Skittish x

-- 6. Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
axiom Rockie_spotted_and_calm : Spotted Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

-- Target claim: Rockie is a turtle.
-- This does not follow from the premises, and neither does its negation.
-- Therefore, we do not prove either "Turtle Rockie" or "¬ Turtle Rockie" here.
