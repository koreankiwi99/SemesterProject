=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the given premises and the conclusion.
 The conclusion is: "It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test."

 Note: The premises state that it costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
 So we can directly use the fact that 205 < 300.

 However, note that the conclusion is about the cost being below $300. We have a premise that says:
 "It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300." This implies that the cost is below $300.

 Steps:
 1. We need a type for entities (like Tom) and perhaps for the GRE test? But note: the cost is a fixed amount for the test.
 2. We are told about the cost of the GRE test: $205 and that it is cheaper than $300.

 Let's break down:

 We can have:
   - `obj` as the type of objects (people, etc.)
   - We have Tom as an object.
   - We have the GRE test? Actually, the cost is a property of the test. But the test is a fixed entity? Or we can think of the cost as a fixed number.

 Alternatively, we can model the cost as a fixed number? But note: the conclusion is about the cost being below $300.

 However, the problem does not require reasoning about numbers? We are told explicitly that the GRE test costs $205 and that $205 is cheaper than $300.

 So we can have:
   axiom GRE_cost : Nat   -- but we don't need to reason about numbers? We can have a proposition that the cost is below 300.

 Since we are only concerned with the fact that the cost is below $300, we can define:

   axiom CostBelow300 : Prop   -- but wait, we need to relate it to the GRE test? Actually, the cost of the GRE test is fixed.

 Alternatively, we can have:

   axiom GRE : obj   -- we introduce an object for the GRE test? But the premises don't talk about multiple tests.

 However, note the premises also talk about "those GRE applicants", so we have applicants (people) and the test.

 But the conclusion is solely about the cost of the test, not about Tom.

 So let's focus:

   Premise: "It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300."
   This can be broken into:
      - The cost of taking the GRE test is $205.
      - $205 is cheaper than $300.

   Therefore, we can conclude that the cost of taking the GRE test is below $300.

   We don't need to model numbers. We can have:

      axiom GRE_cost_below_300 : Prop

   But wait, we are supposed to formalize the logical structure. We have a premise that directly states that the cost is below 300? Actually, the premise says it is cheaper than 300, meaning below 300.

   So we can have:

      axiom P1 : GRE_cost_below_300

   And the conclusion is exactly GRE_cost_below_300.

 However, note that the problem also includes other premises about Tom and financial aid. But the conclusion does not depend on Tom. It is a standalone fact about the GRE cost.

 Therefore, we can ignore the other premises for the purpose of the conclusion? But wait, the problem says "Premises" and then lists several, including the one about the cost.

 But the conclusion is only about the cost being below $300. So we only need the premise that states that the cost is $205 and that $205 is cheaper than $300.

 However, the problem says: "Conclusion to formalize: It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test."

 So we can have:

   axiom obj : Type
   axiom GRE : obj   -- representing the GRE test? Or we can have a proposition without an object?

 Alternatively, we can model the cost as a property of the test? But the test is fixed.

 Let's define:

   axiom GRE_test : obj   -- we introduce an object for the GRE test.

   -- Now, we need a way to talk about the cost. We can have:
   axiom cost : obj → Nat   -- but we don't want to use numbers? We are not proving arithmetic.

   Then we have:
      axiom P1 : cost GRE_test = 205
      axiom P2 : 205 < 300

   Then the conclusion is: cost GRE_test < 300

   But note: the conclusion is "below US $300", so we can write:

      theorem goal : cost GRE_test < 300 := by sorry

   However, we have to note that the premise says "cheaper than $300", which is the same as below $300.

   But wait: the premise says "which is cheaper than $300". So we have:

      axiom P1 : cost GRE_test = 205
      axiom P2 : cost GRE_test < 300   -- because 205 is less than 300? Actually, we don't need P2 as an axiom? We can derive it.

   However, the problem says: formalize the premises. So we have:

      Premise 1: cost GRE_test = 205
      Premise 2: 205 < 300   -- but this is a fact of arithmetic? We don't need to state it? Or we can state it as an axiom? But arithmetic is built-in.

   In Lean, we can use the fact that 205 < 300 is true by `linarith` or `decide`. But note: we are not proving, we are just formalizing.

   Alternatively, we can avoid numbers and just have:

      axiom GRE_cost_below_300 : Prop
      axiom P1 : GRE_cost_below_300   -- because the premise says it is cheaper than $300.

   But then why do we have other premises? They are about Tom and financial aid, which are irrelevant to the conclusion.

   So we can ignore the other premises? The problem says "Premises" and lists several, but the conclusion only depends on the first one.

   However, the problem says: "Generate Lean 4 code with axiom definitions and a theorem declaration".

   We must include all premises? But note: the conclusion does not depend on Tom. So we can skip the axioms about Tom? But the problem says "Premises".

   But the problem says: formalize the logical structure. The conclusion is independent of the other premises? Then we can have:

      axiom GRE_cost_below_300 : Prop
      axiom P1 : GRE_cost_below_300   -- from the first premise

   and then the theorem is:

      theorem goal : GRE_cost_below_300 := sorry

   But that seems too trivial.

   Alternatively, we can model the entire set of premises for completeness, even if they are not used in the conclusion.

   However, the problem says: "formalize the logical structure WITHOUT proving anything". So we can include all premises and then state the conclusion.

   But the conclusion is independent. So we can do:

      We'll have:
        obj : Type
        Tom : obj
        GRE : obj   -- the test? or perhaps we don't need GRE as an object? The cost is a fixed property.

      Alternatively, we can have:

        We are told about the cost of the GRE test. Let's have a constant for the cost of GRE.

        axiom GRE_cost : Nat
        axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205
        axiom P2 : GRE_cost < 300   -- because it's cheaper than 300? Actually, the premise says "which is cheaper than $300", so we can interpret that as GRE_cost < 300.

      Then the conclusion is: GRE_cost < 300, which is exactly P2.

      So the theorem would be:

        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry

      But note: we have P2 as an axiom, so we are just restating it.

   However, the premise says "It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300." So we can break it into two:

        P1 : GRE_cost = 205
        P2 : 205 < 300   -- but 205<300 is a fact that we can compute? In Lean, we can prove it by `decide`. But we are not proving, we are formalizing the premises.

   We can avoid P2 and instead state:

        P1 : GRE_cost = 205
        -- and then the conclusion is GRE_cost < 300, which would be proven by rewriting with P1 and then using `decide`.

   But again, we are not proving. We are only setting up the axioms and the theorem.

   Since the problem says "formalize", we can do:

        axiom GRE_cost : Nat
        axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205
        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry

   Then the user would prove it by `rw [P1]` and then `decide`.

   However, the problem says we are not proving. So we leave it as `sorry`.

   Now, what about the other premises? They are:

        ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
        Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
        Tom lives in a single-parent family.
        Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.
        Tom is applying to take the GRE test.

   The conclusion does not depend on these. But the problem says "Premises", so we must include them.

   We'll model:

        obj : Type
        Tom : obj
        GRE : obj   -- but wait, the GRE test is not an applicant? We have applicants as people.

   Actually, we have:

        - Applicants: people who apply for the GRE test.
        - We have Tom, who is an applicant.

        Predicates:
          Applicant : obj → Prop
          CanProveEconomicHardship : obj → Prop   -- for applicants?
          GetsFinancialAid : obj → Prop

        We are told: ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.

          axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Applicant x → CanProveEconomicHardship x → GetsFinancialAid x

        Then: "Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship."

          axiom LiveInSingleParentFamily : obj → Prop
          axiom HasFewResources : obj → Prop

          axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, LiveInSingleParentFamily x ∨ HasFewResources x → CanProveEconomicHardship x

        Then: Tom lives in a single-parent family.

          axiom T1 : LiveInSingleParentFamily Tom

        Then: Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.

          This implies: Tom has few resources.

          axiom T2 : HasFewResources Tom

        Then: Tom is applying to take the GRE test.

          axiom T3 : Applicant Tom

   But note: the conclusion is about the cost of the test, not about Tom. So we have two separate parts.

   We must combine both? But the conclusion is independent.

   So we can have:

        axiom GRE_cost : Nat
        axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205

        -- Then the conclusion theorem is about GRE_cost < 300.

        -- And we also have the other axioms about Tom? But they are not used in the conclusion.

   Therefore, we can include all premises as axioms and then state the conclusion theorem.

   However, note: the problem says "Conclusion to formalize: It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test."

   So we focus on that.

   Let's decide:

        We'll have:
          axiom GRE_cost : Nat
          axiom cost_205 : GRE_cost = 205

        Then the theorem is: GRE_cost < 300.

        But we also have the other premises? They are not used. We can include them as additional axioms? The problem says "Premises", so we list them all.

   Therefore, we do:

        axiom obj : Type
        axiom Tom : obj
        axiom GRE_cost : Nat   -- the cost of taking the GRE test (in dollars)

        -- Premise 1: It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
        axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205
        -- We don't need to state the cheaper part as an axiom? Because we can derive it? But we are formalizing the premises as given.
        -- The premise says two things: cost is 205 and 205 is cheaper than 300. We can break it?
        -- Actually, the second part is redundant because 205<300 is a fact. But we are told that it is cheaper, so we can also state:
        axiom P1b : GRE_cost < 300   -- but we don't need both? We can have one.

        Alternatively, we can interpret the premise as:

          P1: GRE_cost = 205 ∧ 205 < 300

        But then we can split it.

        However, to be safe, we can state:

          axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205 ∧ GRE_cost < 300

        But note: the conclusion is GRE_cost < 300, which is the second part of P1.

        Then the theorem becomes:

          theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry

        And we have P1 as an axiom that we could use to prove it.

        But the problem says we are not proving, so we leave it as sorry.

        Now, the other premises:

          axiom Applicant : obj → Prop
          axiom CanProveEconomicHardship : obj → Prop
          axiom GetsFinancialAid : obj → Prop
          axiom LiveInSingleParentFamily : obj → Prop
          axiom HasFewResources : obj → Prop

          -- ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
          axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Applicant x → CanProveEconomicHardship x → GetsFinancialAid x

          -- Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
          axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, LiveInSingleParentFamily x ∨ HasFewResources x → CanProveEconomicHardship x

          -- Tom lives in a single-parent family.
          axiom T1 : LiveInSingleParentFamily Tom

          -- Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.
          axiom T2 : HasFewResources Tom

          -- Tom is applying to take the GRE test.
          axiom T3 : Applicant Tom

        Note: We don't use these in the conclusion theorem.

   Therefore, we write:

        <lean>
        axiom obj : Type
        axiom Tom : obj
        axiom GRE_cost : Nat

        -- Premise 1: It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
        axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205 ∧ GRE_cost < 300

        -- Other premises:
        axiom Applicant : obj → Prop
        axiom CanProveEconomicHardship : obj → Prop
        axiom GetsFinancialAid : obj → Prop
        axiom LiveInSingleParentFamily : obj → Prop
        axiom HasFewResources : obj → Prop

        axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Applicant x → CanProveEconomicHardship x → GetsFinancialAid x
        axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, LiveInSingleParentFamily x ∨ HasFewResources x → CanProveEconomicHardship x
        axiom T1 : LiveInSingleParentFamily Tom
        axiom T2 : HasFewResources Tom
        axiom T3 : Applicant Tom

        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry
        </lean>

   However, note: the premise says "which is cheaper than $300" and we have captured that in P1. The conclusion is exactly the second part of P1.

   Alternatively, we could have split P1 into two axioms:

        axiom P1a : GRE_cost = 205
        axiom P1b : GRE_cost < 300

   Then the theorem is still `GRE_cost < 300`, which is P1b. Then we don't need to use P1a? But the theorem is exactly P1b.

   So we could do:

        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := P1b

   But wait, we are not allowed to prove? We are to use `sorry`. So we write:

        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry

   And we have P1b as an axiom.

   But note: the problem says "formalize the logical structure". We are free to split the premise.

   However, the premise is one sentence. It is acceptable to split it.

   Let me re-read: "It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300."

   This implies two things: the cost is 205 and the cost is cheaper than 300 (i.e., less than 300).

   So we can have two axioms.

   We choose to split:

        axiom P1a : GRE_cost = 205
        axiom P1b : GRE_cost < 300

   Then the theorem is:

        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry   -- but note: we have P1b, so we could write `exact P1b` but we are not proving.

   So we stick with `sorry`.

   Now, what about the other premises? They are included as axioms.

   But note: we have not connected the cost to the test? The cost is just a number? The premise says "to take the GRE test", so we have a constant GRE_cost that represents that cost.

   This is acceptable.

   Alternatively, we could have:

        axiom GRE_test : obj   -- if we want to model the test as an object?
        axiom cost : obj → Nat   -- then the cost of the GRE test would be `cost GRE_test`

        Then:
          axiom P1a : cost GRE_test = 205
          axiom P1b : cost GRE_test < 300

        And the theorem: cost GRE_test < 300

   This might be more general? But the problem doesn't mention multiple tests. It's up to us.

   Since the problem says "take the GRE test", we can model it as a specific object.

   However, the problem also talks about "GRE applicants". We have Tom as an applicant. We don't have a connection between the test and the applicant? Except that Tom is applying to take the test.

   But the cost is the same for everyone.

   So we can do:

        axiom obj : Type
        axiom GRE_test : obj   -- the GRE test
        axiom Tom : obj

        -- Cost function
        axiom cost : obj → Nat   -- but wait, the cost of what? The cost to take the test? Then we can have:

        -- However, note: the premise says "It costs $205 to take the GRE test". So we can interpret that the cost of taking the GRE test is 205. So:

          axiom P1a : cost GRE_test = 205
          axiom P1b : cost GRE_test < 300

        But then what does it mean for Tom? We don't have a direct relation. The premise about Tom does not mention the cost? It only talks about financial aid.

        And the financial aid might reduce the cost? But the problem doesn't say.

        Therefore, we can keep the cost as a fixed property of the test.

        Alternatively, we can have the cost as a fixed constant without attaching it to an object? Because it's the same for everyone.

        Since the conclusion is about the cost of the test (not about Tom's cost), we can stick with a constant.

   We'll choose the simpler way: a constant for the cost.

   Final code:

        <lean>
        axiom obj : Type
        axiom Tom : obj
        axiom GRE_cost : Nat   -- the cost in dollars for taking the GRE test

        -- Premise 1: It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
        axiom P1a : GRE_cost = 205
        axiom P1b : GRE_cost < 300

        -- Other premises:
        axiom Applicant : obj → Prop
        axiom CanProveEconomicHardship : obj → Prop
        axiom GetsFinancialAid : obj → Prop
        axiom LiveInSingleParentFamily : obj → Prop
        axiom HasFewResources : obj → Prop

        -- ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
        axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Applicant x → CanProveEconomicHardship x → GetsFinancialAid x

        -- Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
        axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, LiveInSingleParentFamily x ∨ HasFewResources x → CanProveEconomicHardship x

        -- Tom lives in a single-parent family.
        axiom T1 : LiveInSingleParentFamily Tom

        -- Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.
        axiom T2 : HasFewResources Tom

        -- Tom is applying to take the GRE test.
        axiom T3 : Applicant Tom

        -- Conclusion: It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test.
        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry
        </lean>

   But note: the conclusion is exactly `GRE_cost < 300`, which is an axiom (P1b). So we are restating an axiom as the theorem? That's acceptable because the problem says to formalize the conclusion.

   Alternatively, we could have omitted P1b and then the theorem would be:

        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := by
          rw [P1a]
          decide   -- but we are not proving, so we use sorry.

   But the problem says we are not proving. So we leave it as `sorry`.

   We choose to include P1b because the premise explicitly states that it is cheaper than $300.

   However, note: the premise says "which is cheaper than $300", meaning that the cost (which is 205) is cheaper than 300. So we can derive it. But we are formalizing the premises as axioms.

   We decide to include both P1a and P1b to capture both parts of the premise.

   This is acceptable.

   Let's write the code accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion provided, here's the Lean 4 formalization:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom GRE_cost : Nat  -- Cost of taking GRE test in dollars

-- Premise: GRE costs $205 (which is cheaper than $300)
axiom cost_205 : GRE_cost = 205
axiom cheaper_than_300 : GRE_cost < 300

-- Other premises (about applicants and financial aid)
axiom Applicant : obj → Prop
axiom CanProveEconomicHardship : obj → Prop
axiom GetsFinancialAid : obj → Prop
axiom LiveInSingleParentFamily : obj → Prop
axiom HasFewResources : obj → Prop

axiom Tom : obj
axiom tom_applicant : Applicant Tom
axiom tom_single_parent : LiveInSingleParentFamily Tom
axiom tom_few_resources : HasFewResources Tom

axiom financial_aid_rule : ∀ x : obj, 
  Applicant x → CanProveEconomicHardship x → GetsFinancialAid x

axiom hardship_criteria : ∀ x : obj, 
  LiveInSingleParentFamily x ∨ HasFewResources x → CanProveEconomicHardship x

-- Conclusion: GRE costs below $300
theorem gre_below_300 : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry
</lean>

Key aspects:
1. `GRE_cost` is modeled as a natural number representing dollars
2. The cost premise is split into two axioms: exact cost ($205) and comparison (<$300)
3. Tom's properties and financial aid rules are fully formalized
4. Conclusion directly states `GRE_cost < 300` using `sorry` placeholder
5. All premises are translated while maintaining logical structure
6. Uses required Lean 4 syntax (`fun` instead of `λ`, `by` without `begin..end`)
