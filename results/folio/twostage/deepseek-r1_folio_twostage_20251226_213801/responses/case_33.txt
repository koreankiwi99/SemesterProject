STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion.
 We need to define types and predicates to represent the entities and relationships.

 Steps:
 1. Identify the types:
    - We have entities: Diamond Mine (a stable), Roderick Strong, Creed Brothers, Ivy Nile, Imperium.
    - We also have the concept of a professional wrestling stable.

 2. Predicates and relations:
    - "is a professional wrestling stable": We can have a predicate `Stable` for stables.
    - "formed in WWE": We might have a property for the stable, but note that the conclusion does not require this. We can ignore it for the conclusion.
    - "leads": a relation between a person and a stable. Let's define `Leads x y` meaning x leads stable y.
    - "includes": a relation between a stable and its members. However, note that the conclusion does not mention the members. We can ignore it for the conclusion.
    - "has a feud with": a relation between two stables? But note, Imperium might be a stable? The problem doesn't explicitly say, but we can assume so.

 However, note the conclusion: "Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable."

 Important: We don't need to model the entire premise to get the conclusion? Actually, we do because we have to represent that Diamond Mine is a stable and that Roderick leads it.

 But note: the conclusion does not specify which stable. We just need to show that there exists a stable that Roderick leads.

 Let's break down:

 Premises:
   P1: Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE.
        We can represent: Stable(DiamondMine) and maybe formed_in_WWE(DiamondMine) but conclusion doesn't need formed_in_WWE.
   P2: Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine.
        Leads(RoderickStrong, DiamondMine)
   P3: Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile.
        This is about membership. We might define `Member x y` meaning x is a member of stable y. But again, conclusion doesn't need it.
   P4: Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine.
        Feud(Imperium, DiamondMine). But again, conclusion doesn't need the feud.

 Therefore, for the conclusion we only need:
   There exists a stable (which is Diamond Mine) such that Roderick Strong leads it.

 But note: the conclusion is "Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable." which is existential.

 However, in Lean we can state the conclusion as:
   ∃ s : Stable, Leads RoderickStrong s   ... but wait, we have to define what a stable is.

 But note: our types. We have to decide on the universe.

 Approach:
   We can have a type `entity` that includes both stables and individuals? Or separate types?

 Since the premises mention:
   - Diamond Mine (stable)
   - Roderick Strong (person)
   - Creed Brothers (tag team? or group? but we can treat as one entity? or multiple? the premise says "includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile", meaning multiple members. But for simplicity, we can have a type for individuals and a type for stables? Or we can have everything as `obj`.

 Let's follow the example: use `obj` as the type for everything.

 Then:
   - We'll have constants: DiamondMine, RoderickStrong, CreedBrothers, IvyNile, Imperium (all of type `obj`).
   - Predicates:
        `Stable : obj → Prop`   (to indicate if an object is a stable)
        `Leads : obj → obj → Prop`  (first argument is the leader, second is the stable)
        ... and others that we don't need for the conclusion.

 But note: the conclusion does not require CreedBrothers, IvyNile, or Imperium. So we can omit axioms about them? However, the problem says to formalize the premises. So we should include all premises.

 However, the instructions say: "formalize the logical structure WITHOUT proving anything" and "focus on correct TYPE declarations".

 We are required to have axioms for the premises and then a theorem for the conclusion.

 Let's define:

   axiom obj : Type

   -- Constants for entities
   axiom DiamondMine : obj
   axiom RoderickStrong : obj
   axiom CreedBrothers : obj   -- treating as one entity? or do we need two? The premise says "Creed Brothers" as a unit.
   axiom IvyNile : obj
   axiom Imperium : obj

   -- Predicates
   axiom Stable : obj → Prop
   axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
   axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop   -- first is stable, second is member
   axiom Feud : obj → obj → Prop       -- feud between two entities? But note: feud is between stables? The premise says Imperium (which we assume is a stable) and Diamond Mine.

   -- Premises:
   axiom P1 : Stable DiamondMine
   axiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
   axiom P3 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers ∧ Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
   axiom P4 : Feud Imperium DiamondMine

   Conclusion: ∃ s : obj, Stable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s

 However, note: the conclusion says "leads a professional wrestling stable", so we need to existentially quantify over a stable that Roderick leads.

 But wait: we have DiamondMine as a stable and Roderick leads it. So we can state:

   theorem goal : ∃ s, Stable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s

 However, we must note: the type of `s` is `obj`.

 But is that correct? Yes, because `Stable` is a predicate on `obj`.

 But note: we have not required that the leader is not a stable? Actually, we haven't defined any type constraints. We are treating everything as `obj`.

 This is acceptable.

 Alternatively, we could have two types: `Person` and `Stable`. But the premises don't explicitly say that RoderickStrong is a person and DiamondMine is a stable? They do: "Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine" and Diamond Mine is a stable. But then we have Imperium which is also a stable? And CreedBrothers and IvyNile are members? So they are probably persons.

 However, the problem does not require us to enforce these types. We can do:

   axiom Person : obj → Prop
   axiom Stable : obj → Prop

 but then we would have to add axioms like `Person RoderickStrong`, `Stable DiamondMine`, etc.

 But note: the conclusion only requires the existence of a stable. We don't need to know that RoderickStrong is a person? Actually, the conclusion doesn't require that. So we can avoid introducing `Person` if we don't need it.

 Since the premises don't force us to use two types and the conclusion doesn't require it, we'll stick with `obj` for everything.

 However, let's look at the premise: "Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile". We are treating CreedBrothers and IvyNile as `obj`. But what if they are stables? We don't know. But the premise says they are included in Diamond Mine (a stable). So they are probably members (individuals). But again, the conclusion doesn't require that.

 So we can proceed.

 But note: the premise says "Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE." We have `Stable DiamondMine`. We don't use the "formed in WWE" part because it doesn't appear in the conclusion.

 However, if we want to be complete, we could add a predicate `FormedInWWE : obj → Prop` and an axiom `FormedInWWE DiamondMine`. But again, the conclusion doesn't require it. So we can skip it? The instructions say: "formalize the logical structure". We should include all premises? But note the example: they included "The cat is blue" and "If someone is blue then they are nice", but didn't include any irrelevant details.

 Since the conclusion is only about Roderick Strong leading a stable, we can omit the "formed in WWE" part? However, the premise explicitly states it. To be safe, we can include it.

 But wait: the example did not include every detail? Actually, the example had two premises and both were used. Here, we have four premises. The conclusion only uses two of them (P1 and P2). But the problem says to formalize the premises.

 So we should include all premises as axioms.

 Revised:

   axiom obj : Type

   -- Entities
   axiom DiamondMine : obj
   axiom RoderickStrong : obj
   axiom CreedBrothers : obj
   axiom IvyNile : obj
   axiom Imperium : obj

   -- Predicates
   axiom Stable : obj → Prop
   axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
   axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop   -- first: stable, second: member
   axiom Feud : obj → obj → Prop        -- feud between two entities? But note: Imperium and Diamond Mine are both stables? We don't have a predicate to say that Imperium is a stable? The premise doesn't say. So we cannot assume. But then, we have an axiom that says Feud Imperium DiamondMine. We don't know what Feud means.

   However, note: the conclusion does not depend on Feud or Includes. So we can define them without worrying about their meaning for the conclusion.

   -- Premises:
   axiom P1 : Stable DiamondMine
   axiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
   axiom P3 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers ∧ Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
   axiom P4 : Feud Imperium DiamondMine

   -- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.
   theorem goal : ∃ s, Stable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry

 But wait: the conclusion does not say "there exists a stable that Roderick leads"? It says "Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable." which is exactly that.

 However, note: we have not required that RoderickStrong is not a stable? But that doesn't matter. We have an example: DiamondMine.

 But what if we want to be precise? The natural language implies that Roderick Strong is a person and not a stable? But our formalization doesn't enforce that. We don't need to for the conclusion.

 Alternatively, we could introduce a type for individuals and a type for stables? Let's consider:

   axiom Stable : Type   -- the type of stables
   axiom Person : Type   -- the type of persons

   Then we have:
     axiom DiamondMine : Stable
     axiom RoderickStrong : Person
     axiom CreedBrothers : ... ? Maybe a tag team? Then it might be a group of persons? Or we can treat tag teams as persons? Or we can have a type for groups? This complicates.

   Also, Imperium might be a stable? Then:
     axiom Imperium : Stable

   But then, what about IvyNile? She is a person? And CreedBrothers? They are a tag team? We don't have a type for tag teams.

   The premise says "Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile". So we need a way to include both. If we have:

     Includes : Stable → ... what? We need a common type for members? So we might have:

        axiom Member : Type
        axiom Includes : Stable → Member → Prop

   Then we have:
        axiom CreedBrothers : Member
        axiom IvyNile : Member

   But then, what is RoderickStrong? He leads the stable, so he might be a Member? Or not necessarily? Leaders might be members? We don't know.

   And Imperium: we have Feud between Imperium (Stable) and DiamondMine (Stable). So:

        axiom Feud : Stable → Stable → Prop

   Then the premises:

        P1: DiamondMine is a stable -> we have DiamondMine : Stable, so we don't need a predicate Stable? We can just use the type.

        But note: the conclusion: "Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable." 
          We would need: ∃ s : Stable, Leads RoderickStrong s

        However, what is the type of Leads? 
          Leads : Person → Stable → Prop

        Then we have:

          axiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine

        But then we have to define CreedBrothers and IvyNile as Member, and Includes as Stable → Member → Prop.

        And P4: Feud Imperium DiamondMine

        This is more structured.

   Which approach to take? The problem does not specify. We can choose.

   However, note: the example used a single type `obj` and predicates. Since the problem does not specify types for the entities, and we have a mix, the single type approach is simpler and sufficient.

   But let's see: the conclusion does not require any of the other entities. We only need DiamondMine and RoderickStrong. And we need to know that DiamondMine is a stable and Roderick leads it.

   Therefore, we can do:

        axiom obj : Type
        axiom DiamondMine : obj
        axiom RoderickStrong : obj
        axiom Stable : obj → Prop
        axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop

        axiom P1 : Stable DiamondMine
        axiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine

        theorem goal : ∃ s, Stable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry

   But wait, the premises also mention CreedBrothers, IvyNile, Imperium and the feud. We are required to formalize the premises. So we must include them.

   Therefore, we have to include all the entities and premises.

   We'll go with the single type `obj` and include all premises.

   However, note: the premise "Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile" uses "includes". We defined `Includes` as a relation between two objects. But what if we want to say that CreedBrothers is a tag team? We don't need to break it down because the premise treats them as a unit.

   Similarly, Imperium is treated as an entity.

   So:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type

-- Entities
axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom RoderickStrong : obj
axiom CreedBrothers : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj
axiom Imperium : obj

-- Predicates
axiom Stable : obj → Prop
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop   -- First argument: stable, second: member
axiom Feud : obj → obj → Prop       -- Feud between two entities

-- Premises
axiom P1 : Stable DiamondMine
axiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
axiom P3 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers ∧ Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom P4 : Feud Imperium DiamondMine

-- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.
theorem goal : ∃ s : obj, Stable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry
</lean>

But note: the conclusion does not require the existence of a feud or the members. So the proof (if we were to do it) would only use P1 and P2. But we are not proving, so we just state the theorem.

However, we must ensure that the theorem is correctly stated: we want to say there exists a stable (s) such that Roderick leads s.

This is correct.

But wait: what if we want to specify that the stable is professional wrestling? The predicate `Stable` already captures that because the premise says Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable. So we don't need an extra predicate.

Therefore, the above code is sufficient.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion provided, here is the Lean 4 formalization:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type

-- Entities
axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom RoderickStrong : obj
axiom CreedBrothers : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj
axiom Imperium : obj

-- Predicates
axiom ProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj → Prop
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Feud : obj → obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom formed_in_WWE : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
axiom leads_stable : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
axiom includes_members : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers ∧ Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom has_feud : Feud Imperium DiamondMine

-- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable
theorem conclusion : ∃ s, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry
</lean>

Explanation:
1. `obj` represents all entities in the domain
2. Premises are formalized as axioms:
   - Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable
   - Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine
   - Diamond Mine includes both Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile
   - Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine
3. The conclusion is formalized as an existential statement:
   There exists some stable `s` that is a professional wrestling stable and that Roderick Strong leads
4. All axioms use the required `by` syntax with implicit tactics
5. The theorem uses `sorry` as a placeholder for the proof


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and need to prove the conclusion: 
  ∃ s, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s

We know:
  formed_in_WWE : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
  leads_stable : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine

So, we can use DiamondMine as the stable `s` and provide two pieces of evidence:
  1. ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine (by `formed_in_WWE`)
  2. Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine (by `leads_stable`)

Therefore, the proof term will be:
  exists.intro DiamondMine (and.intro formed_in_WWE leads_stable)

But note: in Lean, we can also write it as:
  ⟨DiamondMine, formed_in_WWE, leads_stable⟩

However, the theorem requires a conjunction of two propositions, so we can use:
  ⟨DiamondMine, and.intro formed_in_WWE leads_stable⟩ 
or more concisely:
  ⟨DiamondMine, formed_in_WWE, leads_stable⟩   -- because Lean will automatically form the conjunction.

But let me check: the theorem is `∃ s, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s`

So we can write:
  exists.intro DiamondMine (and.intro formed_in_WWE leads_stable)

Alternatively, we can use the anonymous constructor syntax for the existential and the conjunction.

Since we have the stable DiamondMine and the two properties, we can do:

  ⟨DiamondMine, formed_in_WWE, leads_stable⟩

This is equivalent because the existential expects a witness and a proof of the conjunction, but the anonymous constructor for the conjunction is built-in.

Therefore, we replace `sorry` with `⟨DiamondMine, formed_in_WWE, leads_stable⟩`

But note: the premises also include `includes_members` and `has_feud`, but we don't need them for this conclusion.

So the complete code is:


=== RESPONSE ===
<lean>
