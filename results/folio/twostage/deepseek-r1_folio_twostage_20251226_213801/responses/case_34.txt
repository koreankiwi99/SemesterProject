=== REASONING ===
We are given premises and a conclusion. We need to formalize the logical structure.

 Premises:
 1. Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE.
    - We can treat "Diamond Mine" as an object of type `Stable` (or perhaps just `obj`). However, note that the conclusion involves individuals (Roderick Strong, Creed Brothers). So we need to model stables and wrestlers.

 2. Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine.
    - We have a relation: `Leads (wrestler, stable)`

 3. Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile.
    - We can have a relation: `Member (wrestler, stable)` OR note that Creed Brothers might be a tag team (so a group) and Ivy Nile an individual? But the problem says "includes", so we can model both as members.

 4. Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine.
    - We have a relation: `Feuds (stable1, stable2)`

 Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads the Creed Brothers.

 However, note: the conclusion is about Roderick Strong leading the Creed Brothers. But the premises say that Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine, and Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers. So we might need an axiom that if a stable includes a wrestler/group and a person leads the stable, then that person leads the wrestler/group? But wait, the problem does not explicitly state that.

 IMPORTANT: We are not to prove anything, just formalize the given premises and the conclusion.

 But note: The conclusion is not directly stated. We are to formalize the conclusion as a theorem. However, we must also formalize the premises as axioms.

 How to model?

 Let's define:
   `obj : Type` for all objects (stables, wrestlers, groups)
   We can have predicates:
     - `Stable : obj → Prop`   (to indicate that an object is a stable)
     - `Wrestler : obj → Prop` (to indicate that an object is a wrestler)
     - `Group : obj → Prop`    (for groups like the Creed Brothers)

 However, note that the Creed Brothers might be considered as a group (which is a type of wrestler? or a separate entity?) and we have a relation "leads" that might apply to both stables and groups? Or perhaps we have:

   We have:
     - `diamond_mine : obj` (and we know it's a stable)
     - `roderick_strong : obj` (wrestler)
     - `creed_brothers : obj` (group? or wrestler? but note: the conclusion says "leads the Creed Brothers", so we might treat Creed Brothers as an entity that can be led)
     - `ivy_nile : obj` (wrestler)
     - `imperium : obj` (stable)

 Relations:
   - `Leads : obj → obj → Prop`   (first argument is the leader, second is the entity being led)
   - `Includes : obj → obj → Prop` (first argument is the stable, second is the member)

 But note: the premise says "Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile". So we can write:
   `Includes diamond_mine creed_brothers`
   `Includes diamond_mine ivy_nile`

 However, the conclusion is that Roderick Strong leads the Creed Brothers. We have that Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine. So we might need an axiom that if a stable includes a member and a leader leads the stable, then the leader leads the member? But again, we are not to add axioms that are not stated. However, the problem does not state such a rule.

 But wait: the problem asks to formalize the premises and the conclusion. We are not required to prove the conclusion, just state it as a theorem. So we can have:

   axiom diamond_mine : obj
   axiom roderick_strong : obj
   axiom creed_brothers : obj
   axiom ivy_nile : obj
   axiom imperium : obj

   axiom Stable : obj → Prop
   axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
   axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
   axiom Feuds : obj → obj → Prop

   -- Premises:
   axiom P1 : Stable diamond_mine
   axiom P2 : Leads roderick_strong diamond_mine
   axiom P3 : Includes diamond_mine creed_brothers ∧ Includes diamond_mine ivy_nile
   axiom P4 : Feuds imperium diamond_mine

   -- Conclusion:
   theorem goal : Leads roderick_strong creed_brothers := sorry

 However, note that the conclusion does not follow from the premises without an additional rule. But the problem does not state that rule. We are only formalizing the given premises and the conclusion.

 Alternatively, we might interpret "leads the Creed Brothers" as a direct consequence of leading the stable that includes them? But the problem does not say that leading a stable implies leading every member. So we cannot assume that.

 But note: the problem says "formalize the logical structure". We are to represent exactly what is said.

 However, the conclusion is not a premise. We are to state it as a theorem that we would like to prove (but we are not proving it, just stating it with `sorry`).

 Therefore, we write the above.

 But wait: the first premise says "Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE." We have captured that by `Stable diamond_mine`. The second premise: "Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine" -> `Leads roderick_strong diamond_mine`. The third: "Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile" -> two `Includes` statements. The fourth: "Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine" -> `Feuds imperium diamond_mine`.

 And the conclusion: "Roderick Strong leads the Creed Brothers" -> `Leads roderick_strong creed_brothers`.

 However, note that the Creed Brothers might be a group and not a stable? But the `Leads` relation in the premise is between a wrestler and a stable. In the conclusion, it is between a wrestler and a group. So we might need to consider if `Leads` can take different types? Alternatively, we can have a more general notion: `Leads` can relate any two objects? Then it's fine.

 Alternatively, we might want to have types for different kinds of entities? But the problem does not specify. We can keep everything as `obj`.

 Let's stick to:

   `obj : Type`

   and then define constants and predicates as above.

 But note: the problem says "Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable", so we have an axiom that it is a stable. Similarly, we don't have axioms saying that Roderick Strong is a wrestler, or Creed Brothers is a group, etc. because the conclusion doesn't require that? But the relations `Leads` and `Includes` are defined on `obj` without constraints.

 However, for the sake of clarity, we might add:

   `Wrestler : obj → Prop`
   `Group : obj → Prop`

 and then assert:

   axiom Wrestler_roderick : Wrestler roderick_strong
   axiom Group_creed : Group creed_brothers
   axiom Wrestler_ivy : Wrestler ivy_nile

 But the premises don't explicitly say that Roderick Strong is a wrestler, Creed Brothers is a group, etc. They are implied by the context. However, since the problem does not state them, we might skip. But note: the conclusion is about leading the Creed Brothers. If we don't specify that Creed Brothers is a group (or a stable?) then how do we know that `Leads` applies? 

 However, the problem does not restrict the domain of `Leads`. We can assume that `Leads` is defined for any two objects. So we don't need extra axioms about the types of the objects.

 Therefore, we can proceed without `Wrestler` and `Group` predicates.

 But note: the premise says "Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine". Diamond Mine is a stable. So we have `Leads roderick_strong diamond_mine`. Similarly, the conclusion is `Leads roderick_strong creed_brothers`. So we are using the same `Leads` relation for both a stable and a group? That's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we might consider that the Creed Brothers are a tag team (a subgroup) within Diamond Mine? But again, we don't have that detail.

 So, we formalize as:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type

-- Constants
axiom diamond_mine : obj
axiom roderick_strong : obj
axiom creed_brothers : obj
axiom ivy_nile : obj
axiom imperium : obj

-- Predicates
axiom Stable : obj → Prop
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Feuds : obj → obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : Stable diamond_mine
axiom P2 : Leads roderick_strong diamond_mine
axiom P3 : Includes diamond_mine creed_brothers ∧ Includes diamond_mine ivy_nile
axiom P4 : Feuds imperium diamond_mine

-- Conclusion
theorem goal : Leads roderick_strong creed_brothers := sorry
</lean>

But wait: the third premise says "Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile", so we have a conjunction. We split it into two.

Alternatively, we could have two separate axioms:

  axiom P3a : Includes diamond_mine creed_brothers
  axiom P3b : Includes diamond_mine ivy_nile

But the premise is one statement. Either way is acceptable. We'll do conjunction for now.

However, note: the problem says "Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile", which is two facts. We can break it if we prefer. But the conjunction is also fine.

But in Lean, when we have `P3` as a conjunction, we can extract the parts by `P3.left` and `P3.right`. So it's okay.

Alternatively, we can split for clarity:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type

axiom diamond_mine : obj
axiom roderick_strong : obj
axiom creed_brothers : obj
axiom ivy_nile : obj
axiom imperium : obj

axiom Stable : obj → Prop
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Feuds : obj → obj → Prop

axiom P1 : Stable diamond_mine
axiom P2 : Leads roderick_strong diamond_mine
axiom P3a : Includes diamond_mine creed_brothers
axiom P3b : Includes diamond_mine ivy_nile
axiom P4 : Feuds imperium diamond_mine

theorem goal : Leads roderick_strong creed_brothers := sorry
</lean>

This might be clearer.

But note: the problem says "Premises" and lists four premises. The third premise is one sentence that includes two facts. We are representing it as two axioms. That is acceptable.

Alternatively, we could have:

  axiom P3 : ∀ (s : obj), s = diamond_mine → Includes s creed_brothers ∧ Includes s ivy_nile

But that is unnecessarily complicated. We know diamond_mine is the stable in question.

So I choose the split version.

Let me write the code accordingly.
