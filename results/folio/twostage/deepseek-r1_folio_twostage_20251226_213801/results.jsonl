The conclusion is formalized as an existential statement:\n   There exists some stable `s` that is a professional wrestling stable and that Roderick Strong leads\n4. All axioms use the required `by` syntax with implicit tactics\n5. The theorem uses `sorry` as a placeholder for the proof", "reasoning_content": "We are given several premises and a conclusion.\n We need to define types and predicates to represent the entities and relationships.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Identify the types:\n    - We have entities: Diamond Mine (a stable), Roderick Strong, Creed Brothers, Ivy Nile, Imperium.\n    - We also have the concept of a professional wrestling stable.\n\n 2. Predicates and relations:\n    - \"is a professional wrestling stable\": We can have a predicate `Stable` for stables.\n    - \"formed in WWE\": We might have a property for the stable, but note that the conclusion does not require this. We can ignore it for the conclusion.\n    - \"leads\": a relation between a person and a stable. Let's define `Leads x y` meaning x leads stable y.\n    - \"includes\": a relation between a stable and its members. However, note that the conclusion does not mention the members. We can ignore it for the conclusion.\n    - \"has a feud with\": a relation between two stables? But note, Imperium might be a stable? The problem doesn't explicitly say, but we can assume so.\n\n However, note the conclusion: \"Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.\"\n\n Important: We don't need to model the entire premise to get the conclusion? Actually, we do because we have to represent that Diamond Mine is a stable and that Roderick leads it.\n\n But note: the conclusion does not specify which stable. We just need to show that there exists a stable that Roderick leads.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Premises:\n   P1: Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE.\n        We can represent: Stable(DiamondMine) and maybe formed_in_WWE(DiamondMine) but conclusion doesn't need formed_in_WWE.\n   P2: Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine.\n        Leads(RoderickStrong, DiamondMine)\n   P3: Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile.\n        This is about membership. We might define `Member x y` meaning x is a member of stable y. But again, conclusion doesn't need it.\n   P4: Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine.\n        Feud(Imperium, DiamondMine). But again, conclusion doesn't need the feud.\n\n Therefore, for the conclusion we only need:\n   There exists a stable (which is Diamond Mine) such that Roderick Strong leads it.\n\n But note: the conclusion is \"Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.\" which is existential.\n\n However, in Lean we can state the conclusion as:\n   \u2203 s : Stable, Leads RoderickStrong s   ... but wait, we have to define what a stable is.\n\n But note: our types. We have to decide on the universe.\n\n Approach:\n   We can have a type `entity` that includes both stables and individuals? Or separate types?\n\n Since the premises mention:\n   - Diamond Mine (stable)\n   - Roderick Strong (person)\n   - Creed Brothers (tag team? or group? but we can treat as one entity? or multiple? the premise says \"includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile\", meaning multiple members. But for simplicity, we can have a type for individuals and a type for stables? Or we can have everything as `obj`.\n\n Let's follow the example: use `obj` as the type for everything.\n\n Then:\n   - We'll have constants: DiamondMine, RoderickStrong, CreedBrothers, IvyNile, Imperium (all of type `obj`).\n   - Predicates:\n        `Stable : obj \u2192 Prop`   (to indicate if an object is a stable)\n        `Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop`  (first argument is the leader, second is the stable)\n        ... and others that we don't need for the conclusion.\n\n But note: the conclusion does not require CreedBrothers, IvyNile, or Imperium. So we can omit axioms about them? However, the problem says to formalize the premises. So we should include all premises.\n\n However, the instructions say: \"formalize the logical structure WITHOUT proving anything\" and \"focus on correct TYPE declarations\".\n\n We are required to have axioms for the premises and then a theorem for the conclusion.\n\n Let's define:\n\n   axiom obj : Type\n\n   -- Constants for entities\n   axiom DiamondMine : obj\n   axiom RoderickStrong : obj\n   axiom CreedBrothers : obj   -- treating as one entity? or do we need two? The premise says \"Creed Brothers\" as a unit.\n   axiom IvyNile : obj\n   axiom Imperium : obj\n\n   -- Predicates\n   axiom Stable : obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop   -- first is stable, second is member\n   axiom Feud : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop       -- feud between two entities? But note: feud is between stables? The premise says Imperium (which we assume is a stable) and Diamond Mine.\n\n   -- Premises:\n   axiom P1 : Stable DiamondMine\n   axiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\n   axiom P3 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers \u2227 Includes DiamondMine IvyNile\n   axiom P4 : Feud Imperium DiamondMine\n\n   Conclusion: \u2203 s : obj, Stable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s\n\n However, note: the conclusion says \"leads a professional wrestling stable\", so we need to existentially quantify over a stable that Roderick leads.\n\n But wait: we have DiamondMine as a stable and Roderick leads it. So we can state:\n\n   theorem goal : \u2203 s, Stable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s\n\n However, we must note: the type of `s` is `obj`.\n\n But is that correct? Yes, because `Stable` is a predicate on `obj`.\n\n But note: we have not required that the leader is not a stable? Actually, we haven't defined any type constraints. We are treating everything as `obj`.\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we could have two types: `Person` and `Stable`. But the premises don't explicitly say that RoderickStrong is a person and DiamondMine is a stable? They do: \"Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine\" and Diamond Mine is a stable. But then we have Imperium which is also a stable? And CreedBrothers and IvyNile are members? So they are probably persons.\n\n However, the problem does not require us to enforce these types. We can do:\n\n   axiom Person : obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom Stable : obj \u2192 Prop\n\n but then we would have to add axioms like `Person RoderickStrong`, `Stable DiamondMine`, etc.\n\n But note: the conclusion only requires the existence of a stable. We don't need to know that RoderickStrong is a person? Actually, the conclusion doesn't require that. So we can avoid introducing `Person` if we don't need it.\n\n Since the premises don't force us to use two types and the conclusion doesn't require it, we'll stick with `obj` for everything.\n\n However, let's look at the premise: \"Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile\". We are treating CreedBrothers and IvyNile as `obj`. But what if they are stables? We don't know. But the premise says they are included in Diamond Mine (a stable). So they are probably members (individuals). But again, the conclusion doesn't require that.\n\n So we can proceed.\n\n But note: the premise says \"Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE.\" We have `Stable DiamondMine`. We don't use the \"formed in WWE\" part because it doesn't appear in the conclusion.\n\n However, if we want to be complete, we could add a predicate `FormedInWWE : obj \u2192 Prop` and an axiom `FormedInWWE DiamondMine`. But again, the conclusion doesn't require it. So we can skip it? The instructions say: \"formalize the logical structure\". We should include all premises? But note the example: they included \"The cat is blue\" and \"If someone is blue then they are nice\", but didn't include any irrelevant details.\n\n Since the conclusion is only about Roderick Strong leading a stable, we can omit the \"formed in WWE\" part? However, the premise explicitly states it. To be safe, we can include it.\n\n But wait: the example did not include every detail? Actually, the example had two premises and both were used. Here, we have four premises. The conclusion only uses two of them (P1 and P2). But the problem says to formalize the premises.\n\n So we should include all premises as axioms.\n\n Revised:\n\n   axiom obj : Type\n\n   -- Entities\n   axiom DiamondMine : obj\n   axiom RoderickStrong : obj\n   axiom CreedBrothers : obj\n   axiom IvyNile : obj\n   axiom Imperium : obj\n\n   -- Predicates\n   axiom Stable : obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop   -- first: stable, second: member\n   axiom Feud : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop        -- feud between two entities? But note: Imperium and Diamond Mine are both stables? We don't have a predicate to say that Imperium is a stable? The premise doesn't say. So we cannot assume. But then, we have an axiom that says Feud Imperium DiamondMine. We don't know what Feud means.\n\n   However, note: the conclusion does not depend on Feud or Includes. So we can define them without worrying about their meaning for the conclusion.\n\n   -- Premises:\n   axiom P1 : Stable DiamondMine\n   axiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\n   axiom P3 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers \u2227 Includes DiamondMine IvyNile\n   axiom P4 : Feud Imperium DiamondMine\n\n   -- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.\n   theorem goal : \u2203 s, Stable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry\n\n But wait: the conclusion does not say \"there exists a stable that Roderick leads\"? It says \"Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.\" which is exactly that.\n\n However, note: we have not required that RoderickStrong is not a stable? But that doesn't matter. We have an example: DiamondMine.\n\n But what if we want to be precise? The natural language implies that Roderick Strong is a person and not a stable? But our formalization doesn't enforce that. We don't need to for the conclusion.\n\n Alternatively, we could introduce a type for individuals and a type for stables? Let's consider:\n\n   axiom Stable : Type   -- the type of stables\n   axiom Person : Type   -- the type of persons\n\n   Then we have:\n     axiom DiamondMine : Stable\n     axiom RoderickStrong : Person\n     axiom CreedBrothers : ... ? Maybe a tag team? Then it might be a group of persons? Or we can treat tag teams as persons? Or we can have a type for groups? This complicates.\n\n   Also, Imperium might be a stable? Then:\n     axiom Imperium : Stable\n\n   But then, what about IvyNile? She is a person? And CreedBrothers? They are a tag team? We don't have a type for tag teams.\n\n   The premise says \"Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile\". So we need a way to include both. If we have:\n\n     Includes : Stable \u2192 ... what? We need a common type for members? So we might have:\n\n        axiom Member : Type\n        axiom Includes : Stable \u2192 Member \u2192 Prop\n\n   Then we have:\n        axiom CreedBrothers : Member\n        axiom IvyNile : Member\n\n   But then, what is RoderickStrong? He leads the stable, so he might be a Member? Or not necessarily? Leaders might be members? We don't know.\n\n   And Imperium: we have Feud between Imperium (Stable) and DiamondMine (Stable). So:\n\n        axiom Feud : Stable \u2192 Stable \u2192 Prop\n\n   Then the premises:\n\n        P1: DiamondMine is a stable -> we have DiamondMine : Stable, so we don't need a predicate Stable? We can just use the type.\n\n        But note: the conclusion: \"Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.\" \n          We would need: \u2203 s : Stable, Leads RoderickStrong s\n\n        However, what is the type of Leads? \n          Leads : Person \u2192 Stable \u2192 Prop\n\n        Then we have:\n\n          axiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\n\n        But then we have to define CreedBrothers and IvyNile as Member, and Includes as Stable \u2192 Member \u2192 Prop.\n\n        And P4: Feud Imperium DiamondMine\n\n        This is more structured.\n\n   Which approach to take? The problem does not specify. We can choose.\n\n   However, note: the example used a single type `obj` and predicates. Since the problem does not specify types for the entities, and we have a mix, the single type approach is simpler and sufficient.\n\n   But let's see: the conclusion does not require any of the other entities. We only need DiamondMine and RoderickStrong. And we need to know that DiamondMine is a stable and Roderick leads it.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        axiom obj : Type\n        axiom DiamondMine : obj\n        axiom RoderickStrong : obj\n        axiom Stable : obj \u2192 Prop\n        axiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n\n        axiom P1 : Stable DiamondMine\n        axiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\n\n        theorem goal : \u2203 s, Stable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry\n\n   But wait, the premises also mention CreedBrothers, IvyNile, Imperium and the feud. We are required to formalize the premises. So we must include them.\n\n   Therefore, we have to include all the entities and premises.\n\n   We'll go with the single type `obj` and include all premises.\n\n   However, note: the premise \"Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile\" uses \"includes\". We defined `Includes` as a relation between two objects. But what if we want to say that CreedBrothers is a tag team? We don't need to break it down because the premise treats them as a unit.\n\n   Similarly, Imperium is treated as an entity.\n\n   So:\n\n<lean>\naxiom obj : Type\n\n-- Entities\naxiom DiamondMine : obj\naxiom RoderickStrong : obj\naxiom CreedBrothers : obj\naxiom IvyNile : obj\naxiom Imperium : obj\n\n-- Predicates\naxiom Stable : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop   -- First argument: stable, second: member\naxiom Feud : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop       -- Feud between two entities\n\n-- Premises\naxiom P1 : Stable DiamondMine\naxiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\naxiom P3 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers \u2227 Includes DiamondMine IvyNile\naxiom P4 : Feud Imperium DiamondMine\n\n-- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.\ntheorem goal : \u2203 s : obj, Stable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry\n</lean>\n\nBut note: the conclusion does not require the existence of a feud or the members. So the proof (if we were to do it) would only use P1 and P2. But we are not proving, so we just state the theorem.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that the theorem is correctly stated: we want to say there exists a stable (s) such that Roderick leads s.\n\nThis is correct.\n\nBut wait: what if we want to specify that the stable is professional wrestling? The predicate `Stable` already captures that because the premise says Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable. So we don't need an extra predicate.\n\nTherefore, the above code is sufficient.\n", "prediction": null, "parse_status": "PARSE_FAILED", "lean_code": "axiom obj : Type\n\n-- Entities\naxiom DiamondMine : obj\naxiom RoderickStrong : obj\naxiom CreedBrothers : obj\naxiom IvyNile : obj\naxiom Imperium : obj\n\n-- Predicates\naxiom ProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Feud : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom formed_in_WWE : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine\naxiom leads_stable : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\naxiom includes_members : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers \u2227 Includes DiamondMine IvyNile\naxiom has_feud : Feud Imperium DiamondMine\n\n-- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable\ntheorem conclusion : \u2203 s, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry", "lean_error": null, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 314, "completion_tokens": 3807, "total_tokens": 4121}, "lean_verification": {"success": true, "env": 1, "errors": [], "warnings": ["declaration uses 'sorry'"], "all_messages": [{"severity": "warning", "data": "declaration uses 'sorry'"}]}}], "stage2_iterations": [{"iteration": 1, "llm_response": "<lean>\naxiom obj : Type\n\n-- Entities\naxiom DiamondMine : obj\naxiom RoderickStrong : obj\naxiom CreedBrothers : obj\naxiom IvyNile : obj\naxiom Imperium : obj\n\n-- Predicates\naxiom ProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Feud : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom formed_in_WWE : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine\naxiom leads_stable : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\naxiom includes_members : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers \u2227 Includes DiamondMine IvyNile\naxiom has_feud : Feud Imperium DiamondMine\n\n-- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable\ntheorem conclusion : \u2203 s, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s := \n  \u27e8DiamondMine, formed_in_WWE, leads_stable\u27e9\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: True", "reasoning_content": "We are given several axioms and need to prove the conclusion: \n  \u2203 s, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s\n\nWe know:\n  formed_in_WWE : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine\n  leads_stable : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\n\nSo, we can use DiamondMine as the stable `s` and provide two pieces of evidence:\n  1.
