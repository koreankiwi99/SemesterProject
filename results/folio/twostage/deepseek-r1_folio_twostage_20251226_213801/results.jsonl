The conclusion is formalized as an existential statement:\n   There exists some stable `s` that is a professional wrestling stable and that Roderick Strong leads\n4. All axioms use the required `by` syntax with implicit tactics\n5. The theorem uses `sorry` as a placeholder for the proof", "reasoning_content": "We are given several premises and a conclusion.\n We need to define types and predicates to represent the entities and relationships.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Identify the types:\n    - We have entities: Diamond Mine (a stable), Roderick Strong, Creed Brothers, Ivy Nile, Imperium.\n    - We also have the concept of a professional wrestling stable.\n\n 2. Predicates and relations:\n    - \"is a professional wrestling stable\": We can have a predicate `Stable` for stables.\n    - \"formed in WWE\": We might have a property for the stable, but note that the conclusion does not require this. We can ignore it for the conclusion.\n    - \"leads\": a relation between a person and a stable. Let's define `Leads x y` meaning x leads stable y.\n    - \"includes\": a relation between a stable and its members. However, note that the conclusion does not mention the members. We can ignore it for the conclusion.\n    - \"has a feud with\": a relation between two stables? But note, Imperium might be a stable? The problem doesn't explicitly say, but we can assume so.\n\n However, note the conclusion: \"Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.\"\n\n Important: We don't need to model the entire premise to get the conclusion? Actually, we do because we have to represent that Diamond Mine is a stable and that Roderick leads it.\n\n But note: the conclusion does not specify which stable. We just need to show that there exists a stable that Roderick leads.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Premises:\n   P1: Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE.\n        We can represent: Stable(DiamondMine) and maybe formed_in_WWE(DiamondMine) but conclusion doesn't need formed_in_WWE.\n   P2: Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine.\n        Leads(RoderickStrong, DiamondMine)\n   P3: Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile.\n        This is about membership. We might define `Member x y` meaning x is a member of stable y. But again, conclusion doesn't need it.\n   P4: Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine.\n        Feud(Imperium, DiamondMine). But again, conclusion doesn't need the feud.\n\n Therefore, for the conclusion we only need:\n   There exists a stable (which is Diamond Mine) such that Roderick Strong leads it.\n\n But note: the conclusion is \"Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.\" which is existential.\n\n However, in Lean we can state the conclusion as:\n   \u2203 s : Stable, Leads RoderickStrong s   ... but wait, we have to define what a stable is.\n\n But note: our types. We have to decide on the universe.\n\n Approach:\n   We can have a type `entity` that includes both stables and individuals? Or separate types?\n\n Since the premises mention:\n   - Diamond Mine (stable)\n   - Roderick Strong (person)\n   - Creed Brothers (tag team? or group? but we can treat as one entity? or multiple? the premise says \"includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile\", meaning multiple members. But for simplicity, we can have a type for individuals and a type for stables? Or we can have everything as `obj`.\n\n Let's follow the example: use `obj` as the type for everything.\n\n Then:\n   - We'll have constants: DiamondMine, RoderickStrong, CreedBrothers, IvyNile, Imperium (all of type `obj`).\n   - Predicates:\n        `Stable : obj \u2192 Prop`   (to indicate if an object is a stable)\n        `Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop`  (first argument is the leader, second is the stable)\n        ... and others that we don't need for the conclusion.\n\n But note: the conclusion does not require CreedBrothers, IvyNile, or Imperium. So we can omit axioms about them? However, the problem says to formalize the premises. So we should include all premises.\n\n However, the instructions say: \"formalize the logical structure WITHOUT proving anything\" and \"focus on correct TYPE declarations\".\n\n We are required to have axioms for the premises and then a theorem for the conclusion.\n\n Let's define:\n\n   axiom obj : Type\n\n   -- Constants for entities\n   axiom DiamondMine : obj\n   axiom RoderickStrong : obj\n   axiom CreedBrothers : obj   -- treating as one entity? or do we need two? The premise says \"Creed Brothers\" as a unit.\n   axiom IvyNile : obj\n   axiom Imperium : obj\n\n   -- Predicates\n   axiom Stable : obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop   -- first is stable, second is member\n   axiom Feud : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop       -- feud between two entities? But note: feud is between stables? The premise says Imperium (which we assume is a stable) and Diamond Mine.\n\n   -- Premises:\n   axiom P1 : Stable DiamondMine\n   axiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\n   axiom P3 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers \u2227 Includes DiamondMine IvyNile\n   axiom P4 : Feud Imperium DiamondMine\n\n   Conclusion: \u2203 s : obj, Stable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s\n\n However, note: the conclusion says \"leads a professional wrestling stable\", so we need to existentially quantify over a stable that Roderick leads.\n\n But wait: we have DiamondMine as a stable and Roderick leads it. So we can state:\n\n   theorem goal : \u2203 s, Stable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s\n\n However, we must note: the type of `s` is `obj`.\n\n But is that correct? Yes, because `Stable` is a predicate on `obj`.\n\n But note: we have not required that the leader is not a stable? Actually, we haven't defined any type constraints. We are treating everything as `obj`.\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we could have two types: `Person` and `Stable`. But the premises don't explicitly say that RoderickStrong is a person and DiamondMine is a stable? They do: \"Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine\" and Diamond Mine is a stable. But then we have Imperium which is also a stable? And CreedBrothers and IvyNile are members? So they are probably persons.\n\n However, the problem does not require us to enforce these types. We can do:\n\n   axiom Person : obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom Stable : obj \u2192 Prop\n\n but then we would have to add axioms like `Person RoderickStrong`, `Stable DiamondMine`, etc.\n\n But note: the conclusion only requires the existence of a stable. We don't need to know that RoderickStrong is a person? Actually, the conclusion doesn't require that. So we can avoid introducing `Person` if we don't need it.\n\n Since the premises don't force us to use two types and the conclusion doesn't require it, we'll stick with `obj` for everything.\n\n However, let's look at the premise: \"Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile\". We are treating CreedBrothers and IvyNile as `obj`. But what if they are stables? We don't know. But the premise says they are included in Diamond Mine (a stable). So they are probably members (individuals). But again, the conclusion doesn't require that.\n\n So we can proceed.\n\n But note: the premise says \"Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE.\" We have `Stable DiamondMine`. We don't use the \"formed in WWE\" part because it doesn't appear in the conclusion.\n\n However, if we want to be complete, we could add a predicate `FormedInWWE : obj \u2192 Prop` and an axiom `FormedInWWE DiamondMine`. But again, the conclusion doesn't require it. So we can skip it? The instructions say: \"formalize the logical structure\". We should include all premises? But note the example: they included \"The cat is blue\" and \"If someone is blue then they are nice\", but didn't include any irrelevant details.\n\n Since the conclusion is only about Roderick Strong leading a stable, we can omit the \"formed in WWE\" part? However, the premise explicitly states it. To be safe, we can include it.\n\n But wait: the example did not include every detail? Actually, the example had two premises and both were used. Here, we have four premises. The conclusion only uses two of them (P1 and P2). But the problem says to formalize the premises.\n\n So we should include all premises as axioms.\n\n Revised:\n\n   axiom obj : Type\n\n   -- Entities\n   axiom DiamondMine : obj\n   axiom RoderickStrong : obj\n   axiom CreedBrothers : obj\n   axiom IvyNile : obj\n   axiom Imperium : obj\n\n   -- Predicates\n   axiom Stable : obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop   -- first: stable, second: member\n   axiom Feud : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop        -- feud between two entities? But note: Imperium and Diamond Mine are both stables? We don't have a predicate to say that Imperium is a stable? The premise doesn't say. So we cannot assume. But then, we have an axiom that says Feud Imperium DiamondMine. We don't know what Feud means.\n\n   However, note: the conclusion does not depend on Feud or Includes. So we can define them without worrying about their meaning for the conclusion.\n\n   -- Premises:\n   axiom P1 : Stable DiamondMine\n   axiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\n   axiom P3 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers \u2227 Includes DiamondMine IvyNile\n   axiom P4 : Feud Imperium DiamondMine\n\n   -- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.\n   theorem goal : \u2203 s, Stable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry\n\n But wait: the conclusion does not say \"there exists a stable that Roderick leads\"? It says \"Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.\" which is exactly that.\n\n However, note: we have not required that RoderickStrong is not a stable? But that doesn't matter. We have an example: DiamondMine.\n\n But what if we want to be precise? The natural language implies that Roderick Strong is a person and not a stable? But our formalization doesn't enforce that. We don't need to for the conclusion.\n\n Alternatively, we could introduce a type for individuals and a type for stables? Let's consider:\n\n   axiom Stable : Type   -- the type of stables\n   axiom Person : Type   -- the type of persons\n\n   Then we have:\n     axiom DiamondMine : Stable\n     axiom RoderickStrong : Person\n     axiom CreedBrothers : ... ? Maybe a tag team? Then it might be a group of persons? Or we can treat tag teams as persons? Or we can have a type for groups? This complicates.\n\n   Also, Imperium might be a stable? Then:\n     axiom Imperium : Stable\n\n   But then, what about IvyNile? She is a person? And CreedBrothers? They are a tag team? We don't have a type for tag teams.\n\n   The premise says \"Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile\". So we need a way to include both. If we have:\n\n     Includes : Stable \u2192 ... what? We need a common type for members? So we might have:\n\n        axiom Member : Type\n        axiom Includes : Stable \u2192 Member \u2192 Prop\n\n   Then we have:\n        axiom CreedBrothers : Member\n        axiom IvyNile : Member\n\n   But then, what is RoderickStrong? He leads the stable, so he might be a Member? Or not necessarily? Leaders might be members? We don't know.\n\n   And Imperium: we have Feud between Imperium (Stable) and DiamondMine (Stable). So:\n\n        axiom Feud : Stable \u2192 Stable \u2192 Prop\n\n   Then the premises:\n\n        P1: DiamondMine is a stable -> we have DiamondMine : Stable, so we don't need a predicate Stable? We can just use the type.\n\n        But note: the conclusion: \"Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.\" \n          We would need: \u2203 s : Stable, Leads RoderickStrong s\n\n        However, what is the type of Leads? \n          Leads : Person \u2192 Stable \u2192 Prop\n\n        Then we have:\n\n          axiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\n\n        But then we have to define CreedBrothers and IvyNile as Member, and Includes as Stable \u2192 Member \u2192 Prop.\n\n        And P4: Feud Imperium DiamondMine\n\n        This is more structured.\n\n   Which approach to take? The problem does not specify. We can choose.\n\n   However, note: the example used a single type `obj` and predicates. Since the problem does not specify types for the entities, and we have a mix, the single type approach is simpler and sufficient.\n\n   But let's see: the conclusion does not require any of the other entities. We only need DiamondMine and RoderickStrong. And we need to know that DiamondMine is a stable and Roderick leads it.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        axiom obj : Type\n        axiom DiamondMine : obj\n        axiom RoderickStrong : obj\n        axiom Stable : obj \u2192 Prop\n        axiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n\n        axiom P1 : Stable DiamondMine\n        axiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\n\n        theorem goal : \u2203 s, Stable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry\n\n   But wait, the premises also mention CreedBrothers, IvyNile, Imperium and the feud. We are required to formalize the premises. So we must include them.\n\n   Therefore, we have to include all the entities and premises.\n\n   We'll go with the single type `obj` and include all premises.\n\n   However, note: the premise \"Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile\" uses \"includes\". We defined `Includes` as a relation between two objects. But what if we want to say that CreedBrothers is a tag team? We don't need to break it down because the premise treats them as a unit.\n\n   Similarly, Imperium is treated as an entity.\n\n   So:\n\n<lean>\naxiom obj : Type\n\n-- Entities\naxiom DiamondMine : obj\naxiom RoderickStrong : obj\naxiom CreedBrothers : obj\naxiom IvyNile : obj\naxiom Imperium : obj\n\n-- Predicates\naxiom Stable : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop   -- First argument: stable, second: member\naxiom Feud : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop       -- Feud between two entities\n\n-- Premises\naxiom P1 : Stable DiamondMine\naxiom P2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\naxiom P3 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers \u2227 Includes DiamondMine IvyNile\naxiom P4 : Feud Imperium DiamondMine\n\n-- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.\ntheorem goal : \u2203 s : obj, Stable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry\n</lean>\n\nBut note: the conclusion does not require the existence of a feud or the members. So the proof (if we were to do it) would only use P1 and P2. But we are not proving, so we just state the theorem.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that the theorem is correctly stated: we want to say there exists a stable (s) such that Roderick leads s.\n\nThis is correct.\n\nBut wait: what if we want to specify that the stable is professional wrestling? The predicate `Stable` already captures that because the premise says Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable. So we don't need an extra predicate.\n\nTherefore, the above code is sufficient.\n", "prediction": null, "parse_status": "PARSE_FAILED", "lean_code": "axiom obj : Type\n\n-- Entities\naxiom DiamondMine : obj\naxiom RoderickStrong : obj\naxiom CreedBrothers : obj\naxiom IvyNile : obj\naxiom Imperium : obj\n\n-- Predicates\naxiom ProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Feud : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom formed_in_WWE : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine\naxiom leads_stable : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\naxiom includes_members : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers \u2227 Includes DiamondMine IvyNile\naxiom has_feud : Feud Imperium DiamondMine\n\n-- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable\ntheorem conclusion : \u2203 s, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry", "lean_error": null, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 314, "completion_tokens": 3807, "total_tokens": 4121}, "lean_verification": {"success": true, "env": 1, "errors": [], "warnings": ["declaration uses 'sorry'"], "all_messages": [{"severity": "warning", "data": "declaration uses 'sorry'"}]}}], "stage2_iterations": [{"iteration": 1, "llm_response": "<lean>\naxiom obj : Type\n\n-- Entities\naxiom DiamondMine : obj\naxiom RoderickStrong : obj\naxiom CreedBrothers : obj\naxiom IvyNile : obj\naxiom Imperium : obj\n\n-- Predicates\naxiom ProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Feud : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom formed_in_WWE : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine\naxiom leads_stable : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\naxiom includes_members : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers \u2227 Includes DiamondMine IvyNile\naxiom has_feud : Feud Imperium DiamondMine\n\n-- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable\ntheorem conclusion : \u2203 s, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s := \n  \u27e8DiamondMine, formed_in_WWE, leads_stable\u27e9\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: True", "reasoning_content": "We are given several axioms and need to prove the conclusion: \n  \u2203 s, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s \u2227 Leads RoderickStrong s\n\nWe know:\n  formed_in_WWE : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine\n  leads_stable : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine\n\nSo, we can use DiamondMine as the stable `s` and provide two pieces of evidence:\n  1.

But the problem says \"includes\", so we can model both as members.\n\n 4. Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine.\n    - We have a relation: `Feuds (stable1, stable2)`\n\n Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads the Creed Brothers.\n\n However, note: the conclusion is about Roderick Strong leading the Creed Brothers. But the premises say that Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine, and Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers. So we might need an axiom that if a stable includes a wrestler/group and a person leads the stable, then that person leads the wrestler/group? But wait, the problem does not explicitly state that.\n\n IMPORTANT: We are not to prove anything, just formalize the given premises and the conclusion.\n\n But note: The conclusion is not directly stated. We are to formalize the conclusion as a theorem. However, we must also formalize the premises as axioms.\n\n How to model?\n\n Let's define:\n   `obj : Type` for all objects (stables, wrestlers, groups)\n   We can have predicates:\n     - `Stable : obj \u2192 Prop`   (to indicate that an object is a stable)\n     - `Wrestler : obj \u2192 Prop` (to indicate that an object is a wrestler)\n     - `Group : obj \u2192 Prop`    (for groups like the Creed Brothers)\n\n However, note that the Creed Brothers might be considered as a group (which is a type of wrestler? or a separate entity?) and we have a relation \"leads\" that might apply to both stables and groups? Or perhaps we have:\n\n   We have:\n     - `diamond_mine : obj` (and we know it's a stable)\n     - `roderick_strong : obj` (wrestler)\n     - `creed_brothers : obj` (group? or wrestler? but note: the conclusion says \"leads the Creed Brothers\", so we might treat Creed Brothers as an entity that can be led)\n     - `ivy_nile : obj` (wrestler)\n     - `imperium : obj` (stable)\n\n Relations:\n   - `Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop`   (first argument is the leader, second is the entity being led)\n   - `Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop` (first argument is the stable, second is the member)\n\n But note: the premise says \"Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile\". So we can write:\n   `Includes diamond_mine creed_brothers`\n   `Includes diamond_mine ivy_nile`\n\n However, the conclusion is that Roderick Strong leads the Creed Brothers. We have that Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine. So we might need an axiom that if a stable includes a member and a leader leads the stable, then the leader leads the member? But again, we are not to add axioms that are not stated. However, the problem does not state such a rule.\n\n But wait: the problem asks to formalize the premises and the conclusion. We are not required to prove the conclusion, just state it as a theorem. So we can have:\n\n   axiom diamond_mine : obj\n   axiom roderick_strong : obj\n   axiom creed_brothers : obj\n   axiom ivy_nile : obj\n   axiom imperium : obj\n\n   axiom Stable : obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom Feuds : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n\n   -- Premises:\n   axiom P1 : Stable diamond_mine\n   axiom P2 : Leads roderick_strong diamond_mine\n   axiom P3 : Includes diamond_mine creed_brothers \u2227 Includes diamond_mine ivy_nile\n   axiom P4 : Feuds imperium diamond_mine\n\n   -- Conclusion:\n   theorem goal : Leads roderick_strong creed_brothers := sorry\n\n However, note that the conclusion does not follow from the premises without an additional rule. But the problem does not state that rule. We are only formalizing the given premises and the conclusion.\n\n Alternatively, we might interpret \"leads the Creed Brothers\" as a direct consequence of leading the stable that includes them? But the problem does not say that leading a stable implies leading every member. So we cannot assume that.\n\n But note: the problem says \"formalize the logical structure\". We are to represent exactly what is said.\n\n However, the conclusion is not a premise. We are to state it as a theorem that we would like to prove (but we are not proving it, just stating it with `sorry`).\n\n Therefore, we write the above.\n\n But wait: the first premise says \"Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE.\" We have captured that by `Stable diamond_mine`. The second premise: \"Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine\" -> `Leads roderick_strong diamond_mine`. The third: \"Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile\" -> two `Includes` statements. The fourth: \"Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine\" -> `Feuds imperium diamond_mine`.\n\n And the conclusion: \"Roderick Strong leads the Creed Brothers\" -> `Leads roderick_strong creed_brothers`.\n\n However, note that the Creed Brothers might be a group and not a stable? But the `Leads` relation in the premise is between a wrestler and a stable. In the conclusion, it is between a wrestler and a group. So we might need to consider if `Leads` can take different types? Alternatively, we can have a more general notion: `Leads` can relate any two objects? Then it's fine.\n\n Alternatively, we might want to have types for different kinds of entities? But the problem does not specify. We can keep everything as `obj`.\n\n Let's stick to:\n\n   `obj : Type`\n\n   and then define constants and predicates as above.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable\", so we have an axiom that it is a stable. Similarly, we don't have axioms saying that Roderick Strong is a wrestler, or Creed Brothers is a group, etc. because the conclusion doesn't require that? But the relations `Leads` and `Includes` are defined on `obj` without constraints.\n\n However, for the sake of clarity, we might add:\n\n   `Wrestler : obj \u2192 Prop`\n   `Group : obj \u2192 Prop`\n\n and then assert:\n\n   axiom Wrestler_roderick : Wrestler roderick_strong\n   axiom Group_creed : Group creed_brothers\n   axiom Wrestler_ivy : Wrestler ivy_nile\n\n But the premises don't explicitly say that Roderick Strong is a wrestler, Creed Brothers is a group, etc. They are implied by the context. However, since the problem does not state them, we might skip. But note: the conclusion is about leading the Creed Brothers. If we don't specify that Creed Brothers is a group (or a stable?) then how do we know that `Leads` applies? \n\n However, the problem does not restrict the domain of `Leads`. We can assume that `Leads` is defined for any two objects. So we don't need extra axioms about the types of the objects.\n\n Therefore, we can proceed without `Wrestler` and `Group` predicates.\n\n But note: the premise says \"Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine\". Diamond Mine is a stable. So we have `Leads roderick_strong diamond_mine`. Similarly, the conclusion is `Leads roderick_strong creed_brothers`. So we are using the same `Leads` relation for both a stable and a group? That's acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider that the Creed Brothers are a tag team (a subgroup) within Diamond Mine? But again, we don't have that detail.\n\n So, we formalize as:\n\n<lean>\naxiom obj : Type\n\n-- Constants\naxiom diamond_mine : obj\naxiom roderick_strong : obj\naxiom creed_brothers : obj\naxiom ivy_nile : obj\naxiom imperium : obj\n\n-- Predicates\naxiom Stable : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Feuds : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom P1 : Stable diamond_mine\naxiom P2 : Leads roderick_strong diamond_mine\naxiom P3 : Includes diamond_mine creed_brothers \u2227 Includes diamond_mine ivy_nile\naxiom P4 : Feuds imperium diamond_mine\n\n-- Conclusion\ntheorem goal : Leads roderick_strong creed_brothers := sorry\n</lean>\n\nBut wait: the third premise says \"Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile\", so we have a conjunction. We split it into two.\n\nAlternatively, we could have two separate axioms:\n\n  axiom P3a : Includes diamond_mine creed_brothers\n  axiom P3b : Includes diamond_mine ivy_nile\n\nBut the premise is one statement. Either way is acceptable. We'll do conjunction for now.\n\nHowever, note: the problem says \"Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile\", which is two facts. We can break it if we prefer. But the conjunction is also fine.\n\nBut in Lean, when we have `P3` as a conjunction, we can extract the parts by `P3.left` and `P3.right`. So it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, we can split for clarity:\n\n<lean>\naxiom obj : Type\n\naxiom diamond_mine : obj\naxiom roderick_strong : obj\naxiom creed_brothers : obj\naxiom ivy_nile : obj\naxiom imperium : obj\n\naxiom Stable : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Leads : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Includes : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Feuds : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n\naxiom P1 : Stable diamond_mine\naxiom P2 : Leads roderick_strong diamond_mine\naxiom P3a : Includes diamond_mine creed_brothers\naxiom P3b : Includes diamond_mine ivy_nile\naxiom P4 : Feuds imperium diamond_mine\n\ntheorem goal : Leads roderick_strong creed_brothers := sorry\n</lean>\n\nThis might be clearer.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Premises\" and lists four premises. The third premise is one sentence that includes two facts. We are representing it as two axioms. That is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we could have:\n\n  axiom P3 : \u2200 (s : obj), s = diamond_mine \u2192 Includes s creed_brothers \u2227 Includes s ivy_nile\n\nBut that is unnecessarily complicated.

The cost premise is split into two axioms: exact cost ($205) and comparison (<$300)\n3. Tom's properties and financial aid rules are fully formalized\n4. Conclusion directly states `GRE_cost < 300` using `sorry` placeholder\n5. All premises are translated while maintaining logical structure\n6. Uses required Lean 4 syntax (`fun` instead of `\u03bb`, `by` without `begin..end`)", "reasoning_content": "We are formalizing the given premises and the conclusion.\n The conclusion is: \"It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test.\"\n\n Note: The premises state that it costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.\n So we can directly use the fact that 205 < 300.\n\n However, note that the conclusion is about the cost being below $300. We have a premise that says:\n \"It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.\" This implies that the cost is below $300.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We need a type for entities (like Tom) and perhaps for the GRE test? But note: the cost is a fixed amount for the test.\n 2. We are told about the cost of the GRE test: $205 and that it is cheaper than $300.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n We can have:\n   - `obj` as the type of objects (people, etc.)\n   - We have Tom as an object.\n   - We have the GRE test? Actually, the cost is a property of the test. But the test is a fixed entity? Or we can think of the cost as a fixed number.\n\n Alternatively, we can model the cost as a fixed number? But note: the conclusion is about the cost being below $300.\n\n However, the problem does not require reasoning about numbers? We are told explicitly that the GRE test costs $205 and that $205 is cheaper than $300.\n\n So we can have:\n   axiom GRE_cost : Nat   -- but we don't need to reason about numbers? We can have a proposition that the cost is below 300.\n\n Since we are only concerned with the fact that the cost is below $300, we can define:\n\n   axiom CostBelow300 : Prop   -- but wait, we need to relate it to the GRE test? Actually, the cost of the GRE test is fixed.\n\n Alternatively, we can have:\n\n   axiom GRE : obj   -- we introduce an object for the GRE test? But the premises don't talk about multiple tests.\n\n However, note the premises also talk about \"those GRE applicants\", so we have applicants (people) and the test.\n\n But the conclusion is solely about the cost of the test, not about Tom.\n\n So let's focus:\n\n   Premise: \"It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.\"\n   This can be broken into:\n      - The cost of taking the GRE test is $205.\n      - $205 is cheaper than $300.\n\n   Therefore, we can conclude that the cost of taking the GRE test is below $300.\n\n   We don't need to model numbers. We can have:\n\n      axiom GRE_cost_below_300 : Prop\n\n   But wait, we are supposed to formalize the logical structure. We have a premise that directly states that the cost is below 300? Actually, the premise says it is cheaper than 300, meaning below 300.\n\n   So we can have:\n\n      axiom P1 : GRE_cost_below_300\n\n   And the conclusion is exactly GRE_cost_below_300.\n\n However, note that the problem also includes other premises about Tom and financial aid. But the conclusion does not depend on Tom. It is a standalone fact about the GRE cost.\n\n Therefore, we can ignore the other premises for the purpose of the conclusion? But wait, the problem says \"Premises\" and then lists several, including the one about the cost.\n\n But the conclusion is only about the cost being below $300. So we only need the premise that states that the cost is $205 and that $205 is cheaper than $300.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Conclusion to formalize: It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test.\"\n\n So we can have:\n\n   axiom obj : Type\n   axiom GRE : obj   -- representing the GRE test? Or we can have a proposition without an object?\n\n Alternatively, we can model the cost as a property of the test? But the test is fixed.\n\n Let's define:\n\n   axiom GRE_test : obj   -- we introduce an object for the GRE test.\n\n   -- Now, we need a way to talk about the cost. We can have:\n   axiom cost : obj \u2192 Nat   -- but we don't want to use numbers? We are not proving arithmetic.\n\n   Then we have:\n      axiom P1 : cost GRE_test = 205\n      axiom P2 : 205 < 300\n\n   Then the conclusion is: cost GRE_test < 300\n\n   But note: the conclusion is \"below US $300\", so we can write:\n\n      theorem goal : cost GRE_test < 300 := by sorry\n\n   However, we have to note that the premise says \"cheaper than $300\", which is the same as below $300.\n\n   But wait: the premise says \"which is cheaper than $300\". So we have:\n\n      axiom P1 : cost GRE_test = 205\n      axiom P2 : cost GRE_test < 300   -- because 205 is less than 300? Actually, we don't need P2 as an axiom? We can derive it.\n\n   However, the problem says: formalize the premises. So we have:\n\n      Premise 1: cost GRE_test = 205\n      Premise 2: 205 < 300   -- but this is a fact of arithmetic? We don't need to state it? Or we can state it as an axiom? But arithmetic is built-in.\n\n   In Lean, we can use the fact that 205 < 300 is true by `linarith` or `decide`. But note: we are not proving, we are just formalizing.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid numbers and just have:\n\n      axiom GRE_cost_below_300 : Prop\n      axiom P1 : GRE_cost_below_300   -- because the premise says it is cheaper than $300.\n\n   But then why do we have other premises? They are about Tom and financial aid, which are irrelevant to the conclusion.\n\n   So we can ignore the other premises? The problem says \"Premises\" and lists several, but the conclusion only depends on the first one.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Generate Lean 4 code with axiom definitions and a theorem declaration\".\n\n   We must include all premises? But note: the conclusion does not depend on Tom. So we can skip the axioms about Tom? But the problem says \"Premises\".\n\n   But the problem says: formalize the logical structure. The conclusion is independent of the other premises? Then we can have:\n\n      axiom GRE_cost_below_300 : Prop\n      axiom P1 : GRE_cost_below_300   -- from the first premise\n\n   and then the theorem is:\n\n      theorem goal : GRE_cost_below_300 := sorry\n\n   But that seems too trivial.\n\n   Alternatively, we can model the entire set of premises for completeness, even if they are not used in the conclusion.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"formalize the logical structure WITHOUT proving anything\". So we can include all premises and then state the conclusion.\n\n   But the conclusion is independent. So we can do:\n\n      We'll have:\n        obj : Type\n        Tom : obj\n        GRE : obj   -- the test? or perhaps we don't need GRE as an object? The cost is a fixed property.\n\n      Alternatively, we can have:\n\n        We are told about the cost of the GRE test. Let's have a constant for the cost of GRE.\n\n        axiom GRE_cost : Nat\n        axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205\n        axiom P2 : GRE_cost < 300   -- because it's cheaper than 300? Actually, the premise says \"which is cheaper than $300\", so we can interpret that as GRE_cost < 300.\n\n      Then the conclusion is: GRE_cost < 300, which is exactly P2.\n\n      So the theorem would be:\n\n        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry\n\n      But note: we have P2 as an axiom, so we are just restating it.\n\n   However, the premise says \"It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.\" So we can break it into two:\n\n        P1 : GRE_cost = 205\n        P2 : 205 < 300   -- but 205<300 is a fact that we can compute? In Lean, we can prove it by `decide`. But we are not proving, we are formalizing the premises.\n\n   We can avoid P2 and instead state:\n\n        P1 : GRE_cost = 205\n        -- and then the conclusion is GRE_cost < 300, which would be proven by rewriting with P1 and then using `decide`.\n\n   But again, we are not proving. We are only setting up the axioms and the theorem.\n\n   Since the problem says \"formalize\", we can do:\n\n        axiom GRE_cost : Nat\n        axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205\n        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry\n\n   Then the user would prove it by `rw [P1]` and then `decide`.\n\n   However, the problem says we are not proving. So we leave it as `sorry`.\n\n   Now, what about the other premises? They are:\n\n        ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.\n        Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.\n        Tom lives in a single-parent family.\n        Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.\n        Tom is applying to take the GRE test.\n\n   The conclusion does not depend on these. But the problem says \"Premises\", so we must include them.\n\n   We'll model:\n\n        obj : Type\n        Tom : obj\n        GRE : obj   -- but wait, the GRE test is not an applicant? We have applicants as people.\n\n   Actually, we have:\n\n        - Applicants: people who apply for the GRE test.\n        - We have Tom, who is an applicant.\n\n        Predicates:\n          Applicant : obj \u2192 Prop\n          CanProveEconomicHardship : obj \u2192 Prop   -- for applicants?\n          GetsFinancialAid : obj \u2192 Prop\n\n        We are told: ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.\n\n          axiom R1 : \u2200 x : obj, Applicant x \u2192 CanProveEconomicHardship x \u2192 GetsFinancialAid x\n\n        Then: \"Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.\"\n\n          axiom LiveInSingleParentFamily : obj \u2192 Prop\n          axiom HasFewResources : obj \u2192 Prop\n\n          axiom R2 : \u2200 x : obj, LiveInSingleParentFamily x \u2228 HasFewResources x \u2192 CanProveEconomicHardship x\n\n        Then: Tom lives in a single-parent family.\n\n          axiom T1 : LiveInSingleParentFamily Tom\n\n        Then: Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.\n\n          This implies: Tom has few resources.\n\n          axiom T2 : HasFewResources Tom\n\n        Then: Tom is applying to take the GRE test.\n\n          axiom T3 : Applicant Tom\n\n   But note: the conclusion is about the cost of the test, not about Tom. So we have two separate parts.\n\n   We must combine both? But the conclusion is independent.\n\n   So we can have:\n\n        axiom GRE_cost : Nat\n        axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205\n\n        -- Then the conclusion theorem is about GRE_cost < 300.\n\n        -- And we also have the other axioms about Tom? But they are not used in the conclusion.\n\n   Therefore, we can include all premises as axioms and then state the conclusion theorem.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Conclusion to formalize: It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test.\"\n\n   So we focus on that.\n\n   Let's decide:\n\n        We'll have:\n          axiom GRE_cost : Nat\n          axiom cost_205 : GRE_cost = 205\n\n        Then the theorem is: GRE_cost < 300.\n\n        But we also have the other premises? They are not used. We can include them as additional axioms? The problem says \"Premises\", so we list them all.\n\n   Therefore, we do:\n\n        axiom obj : Type\n        axiom Tom : obj\n        axiom GRE_cost : Nat   -- the cost of taking the GRE test (in dollars)\n\n        -- Premise 1: It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.\n        axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205\n        -- We don't need to state the cheaper part as an axiom? Because we can derive it? But we are formalizing the premises as given.\n        -- The premise says two things: cost is 205 and 205 is cheaper than 300. We can break it?\n        -- Actually, the second part is redundant because 205<300 is a fact. But we are told that it is cheaper, so we can also state:\n        axiom P1b : GRE_cost < 300   -- but we don't need both? We can have one.\n\n        Alternatively, we can interpret the premise as:\n\n          P1: GRE_cost = 205 \u2227 205 < 300\n\n        But then we can split it.\n\n        However, to be safe, we can state:\n\n          axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205 \u2227 GRE_cost < 300\n\n        But note: the conclusion is GRE_cost < 300, which is the second part of P1.\n\n        Then the theorem becomes:\n\n          theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry\n\n        And we have P1 as an axiom that we could use to prove it.\n\n        But the problem says we are not proving, so we leave it as sorry.\n\n        Now, the other premises:\n\n          axiom Applicant : obj \u2192 Prop\n          axiom CanProveEconomicHardship : obj \u2192 Prop\n          axiom GetsFinancialAid : obj \u2192 Prop\n          axiom LiveInSingleParentFamily : obj \u2192 Prop\n          axiom HasFewResources : obj \u2192 Prop\n\n          -- ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.\n          axiom R1 : \u2200 x : obj, Applicant x \u2192 CanProveEconomicHardship x \u2192 GetsFinancialAid x\n\n          -- Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.\n          axiom R2 : \u2200 x : obj, LiveInSingleParentFamily x \u2228 HasFewResources x \u2192 CanProveEconomicHardship x\n\n          -- Tom lives in a single-parent family.\n          axiom T1 : LiveInSingleParentFamily Tom\n\n          -- Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.\n          axiom T2 : HasFewResources Tom\n\n          -- Tom is applying to take the GRE test.\n          axiom T3 : Applicant Tom\n\n        Note: We don't use these in the conclusion theorem.\n\n   Therefore, we write:\n\n        <lean>\n        axiom obj : Type\n        axiom Tom : obj\n        axiom GRE_cost : Nat\n\n        -- Premise 1: It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.\n        axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205 \u2227 GRE_cost < 300\n\n        -- Other premises:\n        axiom Applicant : obj \u2192 Prop\n        axiom CanProveEconomicHardship : obj \u2192 Prop\n        axiom GetsFinancialAid : obj \u2192 Prop\n        axiom LiveInSingleParentFamily : obj \u2192 Prop\n        axiom HasFewResources : obj \u2192 Prop\n\n        axiom R1 : \u2200 x : obj, Applicant x \u2192 CanProveEconomicHardship x \u2192 GetsFinancialAid x\n        axiom R2 : \u2200 x : obj, LiveInSingleParentFamily x \u2228 HasFewResources x \u2192 CanProveEconomicHardship x\n        axiom T1 : LiveInSingleParentFamily Tom\n        axiom T2 : HasFewResources Tom\n        axiom T3 : Applicant Tom\n\n        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry\n        </lean>\n\n   However, note: the premise says \"which is cheaper than $300\" and we have captured that in P1. The conclusion is exactly the second part of P1.\n\n   Alternatively, we could have split P1 into two axioms:\n\n        axiom P1a : GRE_cost = 205\n        axiom P1b : GRE_cost < 300\n\n   Then the theorem is still `GRE_cost < 300`, which is P1b. Then we don't need to use P1a? But the theorem is exactly P1b.\n\n   So we could do:\n\n        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := P1b\n\n   But wait, we are not allowed to prove? We are to use `sorry`. So we write:\n\n        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry\n\n   And we have P1b as an axiom.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"formalize the logical structure\". We are free to split the premise.\n\n   However, the premise is one sentence. It is acceptable to split it.\n\n   Let me re-read: \"It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.\"\n\n   This implies two things: the cost is 205 and the cost is cheaper than 300 (i.e., less than 300).\n\n   So we can have two axioms.\n\n   We choose to split:\n\n        axiom P1a : GRE_cost = 205\n        axiom P1b : GRE_cost < 300\n\n   Then the theorem is:\n\n        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry   -- but note: we have P1b, so we could write `exact P1b` but we are not proving.\n\n   So we stick with `sorry`.\n\n   Now, what about the other premises? They are included as axioms.\n\n   But note: we have not connected the cost to the test? The cost is just a number? The premise says \"to take the GRE test\", so we have a constant GRE_cost that represents that cost.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we could have:\n\n        axiom GRE_test : obj   -- if we want to model the test as an object?\n        axiom cost : obj \u2192 Nat   -- then the cost of the GRE test would be `cost GRE_test`\n\n        Then:\n          axiom P1a : cost GRE_test = 205\n          axiom P1b : cost GRE_test < 300\n\n        And the theorem: cost GRE_test < 300\n\n   This might be more general? But the problem doesn't mention multiple tests. It's up to us.\n\n   Since the problem says \"take the GRE test\", we can model it as a specific object.\n\n   However, the problem also talks about \"GRE applicants\". We have Tom as an applicant. We don't have a connection between the test and the applicant? Except that Tom is applying to take the test.\n\n   But the cost is the same for everyone.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        axiom obj : Type\n        axiom GRE_test : obj   -- the GRE test\n        axiom Tom : obj\n\n        -- Cost function\n        axiom cost : obj \u2192 Nat   -- but wait, the cost of what? The cost to take the test? Then we can have:\n\n        -- However, note: the premise says \"It costs $205 to take the GRE test\". So we can interpret that the cost of taking the GRE test is 205. So:\n\n          axiom P1a : cost GRE_test = 205\n          axiom P1b : cost GRE_test < 300\n\n        But then what does it mean for Tom? We don't have a direct relation. The premise about Tom does not mention the cost? It only talks about financial aid.\n\n        And the financial aid might reduce the cost? But the problem doesn't say.\n\n        Therefore, we can keep the cost as a fixed property of the test.\n\n        Alternatively, we can have the cost as a fixed constant without attaching it to an object? Because it's the same for everyone.\n\n        Since the conclusion is about the cost of the test (not about Tom's cost), we can stick with a constant.\n\n   We'll choose the simpler way: a constant for the cost.\n\n   Final code:\n\n        <lean>\n        axiom obj : Type\n        axiom Tom : obj\n        axiom GRE_cost : Nat   -- the cost in dollars for taking the GRE test\n\n        -- Premise 1: It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.\n        axiom P1a : GRE_cost = 205\n        axiom P1b : GRE_cost < 300\n\n        -- Other premises:\n        axiom Applicant : obj \u2192 Prop\n        axiom CanProveEconomicHardship : obj \u2192 Prop\n        axiom GetsFinancialAid : obj \u2192 Prop\n        axiom LiveInSingleParentFamily : obj \u2192 Prop\n        axiom HasFewResources : obj \u2192 Prop\n\n        -- ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.\n        axiom R1 : \u2200 x : obj, Applicant x \u2192 CanProveEconomicHardship x \u2192 GetsFinancialAid x\n\n        -- Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.\n        axiom R2 : \u2200 x : obj, LiveInSingleParentFamily x \u2228 HasFewResources x \u2192 CanProveEconomicHardship x\n\n        -- Tom lives in a single-parent family.\n        axiom T1 : LiveInSingleParentFamily Tom\n\n        -- Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.\n        axiom T2 : HasFewResources Tom\n\n        -- Tom is applying to take the GRE test.\n        axiom T3 : Applicant Tom\n\n        -- Conclusion: It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test.\n        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry\n        </lean>\n\n   But note: the conclusion is exactly `GRE_cost < 300`, which is an axiom (P1b). So we are restating an axiom as the theorem? That's acceptable because the problem says to formalize the conclusion.\n\n   Alternatively, we could have omitted P1b and then the theorem would be:\n\n        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := by\n          rw [P1a]\n          decide   -- but we are not proving, so we use sorry.\n\n   But the problem says we are not proving. So we leave it as `sorry`.\n\n   We choose to include P1b because the premise explicitly states that it is cheaper than $300.\n\n   However, note: the premise says \"which is cheaper than $300\", meaning that the cost (which is 205) is cheaper than 300. So we can derive it. But we are formalizing the premises as axioms.\n\n   We decide to include both P1a and P1b to capture both parts of the premise.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n", "prediction": null, "parse_status": "PARSE_FAILED", "lean_code": "axiom obj : Type\naxiom GRE_cost : Nat  -- Cost of taking GRE test in dollars\n\n-- Premise: GRE costs $205 (which is cheaper than $300)\naxiom cost_205 : GRE_cost = 205\naxiom cheaper_than_300 : GRE_cost < 300\n\n-- Other premises (about applicants and financial aid)\naxiom Applicant : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom CanProveEconomicHardship : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom GetsFinancialAid : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom LiveInSingleParentFamily : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom HasFewResources : obj \u2192 Prop\n\naxiom Tom : obj\naxiom tom_applicant : Applicant Tom\naxiom tom_single_parent : LiveInSingleParentFamily Tom\naxiom tom_few_resources : HasFewResources Tom\n\naxiom financial_aid_rule : \u2200 x : obj, \n  Applicant x \u2192 CanProveEconomicHardship x \u2192 GetsFinancialAid x\n\naxiom hardship_criteria : \u2200 x : obj, \n  LiveInSingleParentFamily x \u2228 HasFewResources x \u2192 CanProveEconomicHardship x\n\n-- Conclusion: GRE costs below $300\ntheorem gre_below_300 : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry", "lean_error": null, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 360, "completion_tokens": 5169, "total_tokens": 5529}, "lean_verification": {"success": true, "env": 4, "errors": [], "warnings": ["declaration uses 'sorry'"], "all_messages": [{"severity": "warning", "data": "declaration uses 'sorry'"}]}}], "stage2_iterations": [], "story_id": 197, "example_id": 561, "error": "'dict' object has no attribute 'startswith'"}
