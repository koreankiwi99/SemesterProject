--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the following premises and conclusion.

Premises:
1. It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
   - We might not need this for the conclusion about financial aid to Tom.

2. ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
   - Let ETS_financial_aid (x) mean ETS provides financial aid to x.
   - Let prove_hardship (x) mean x proves economic hardship.

   So: ∀ x, GRE_applicant x → prove_hardship x → ETS_financial_aid x

3. Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
   - Let single_parent_family (x) : x lives in a single-parent family.
   - Let few_resources (x) : x has few resources.

   So: ∀ x, (single_parent_family x ∨ few_resources x) → prove_hardship x

4. Tom lives in a single-parent family.
   - single_parent_family Tom

5. Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.
   - We only care about "Tom has few resources", so: few_resources Tom

6. Tom is applying to take the GRE test.
   - GRE_applicant Tom

Conclusion: ETS provides financial aid to Tom.

We declare:
  obj : Type
  Tom : obj
  GRE_applicant : obj → Prop
  prove_hardship : obj → Prop
  ETS_financial_aid : obj → Prop
  single_parent_family : obj → Prop
  few_resources : obj → Prop

Axioms:
  A1: ∀ x, GRE_applicant x → prove_hardship x → ETS_financial_aid x
  A2: ∀ x, (single_parent_family x ∨ few_resources x) → prove_hardship x
  A3: single_parent_family Tom
  A4: few_resources Tom
  A5: GRE_applicant Tom

Theorem: ETS_financial_aid Tom

Note: The first premise about the cost is not used in the logical deduction for the conclusion about Tom, so we omit it.

Let's write the Lean code accordingly.

theorem ets_aids_tom : ETS_financial_aid Tom := sorry
</lean>

Explanation:
1. Declared `obj` as the base type for all entities
2. Introduced `Tom` as a specific constant
3. Defined predicates:
   - `GRE_applicant` for GRE test applicants
   - `prove_hardship` for proving economic hardship
   - `ETS_financial_aid` for receiving financial aid
   - `single_parent_family` for family status
   - `few_resources` for financial condition
4. Formalized premises as axioms:
   - `ETS_rule`: Financial aid provided to hardship-proving applicants
   - `hardship_criteria`: Hardship proven via family status OR resources
   - `toms_family`: Tom's family status
   - `toms_resources`: Tom's resource situation
   - `toms_applicant`: Tom's applicant status
5. Stated conclusion as `ets_aids_tom` theorem with `sorry` placeholder

Note: The $205/$300 cost comparison wasn't formalized since it's not relevant to the logical structure of the argument about Tom's financial aid eligibility.

STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and need to prove `ETS_financial_aid Tom`

The axioms we have:
1. `ETS_rule`: For any `x`, if `x` is a GRE applicant and can prove hardship, then `x` gets ETS financial aid.
2. `hardship_criteria`: For any `x`, if `x` is a single parent family OR has few resources, then `x` can prove hardship.
3. `toms_family`: Tom is a single parent family.
4. `toms_resources`: Tom has few resources.
5. `toms_applicant`: Tom is a GRE applicant.

We need to show that Tom gets ETS financial aid.

Proof strategy:
- We can use `ETS_rule` for Tom. This requires showing:
   (i) `GRE_applicant Tom`  -- which is given by `toms_applicant`
   (ii) `prove_hardship Tom`

- To show `prove_hardship Tom`, we use `hardship_criteria` which requires showing:
     `(single_parent_family Tom ∨ few_resources Tom)`
   We know `single_parent_family Tom` (by `toms_family`) so we have `single_parent_family Tom ∨ few_resources Tom` by using the left disjunct.

Therefore, the proof term can be constructed as:

`ETS_rule Tom toms_applicant (hardship_criteria Tom (Or.inl toms_family))`

But note: we also have `toms_resources`, so we could have used `Or.inr toms_resources` as well. Either will work because the disjunction only requires one.

However, we choose one of them. Since we have `toms_family`, we use `Or.inl toms_family`.

So the complete code becomes:
