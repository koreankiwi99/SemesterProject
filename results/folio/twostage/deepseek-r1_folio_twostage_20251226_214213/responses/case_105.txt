--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing logical statements in Lean 4 without proving.
 The goal is to represent the premises and the conclusion as axioms and a theorem.

 Steps:
 1. Identify the types and predicates we need.
 2. Declare axioms for the premises.
 3. Declare a theorem for the conclusion.

 Premises break-down:

  a) "It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300."
     This implies:
        - There is a fixed cost for the GRE test: $205.
        - We are comparing costs: we need a notion of cost and being below a certain amount.

  b) "ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship."
        Let:
          - We have applicants (or people) as objects.
          - EconomicHardship(p) : Prop - person p proves economic hardship.
          - GetsFinancialAid(p) : Prop - ETS provides financial aid to applicant p.

        So: ∀ p, GREApplicant(p) ∧ EconomicHardship(p) → GetsFinancialAid(p)

  c) "Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship."
        Or, if a person is living in a single-parent family OR has few resources, then they can prove economic hardship.
        Let:
          - SingleParentFamily(p) : Prop
          - FewResources(p) : Prop
        So: ∀ p, (SingleParentFamily(p) ∨ FewResources(p)) → EconomicHardship(p)

  d) "Tom lives in a single-parent family." -> SingleParentFamily(Tom)
  e) "Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them." -> FewResources(Tom) (and maybe also an out-of-work fact, but if not needed for conclusion, we can ignore for the moment)
  f) "Tom is applying to take the GRE test." -> GREApplicant(Tom)

 Conclusion: "It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test."

  Important: The conclusion is a statement about the cost of the GRE test. However, note that premise (a) directly states that the cost is $205 and that it is cheaper than $300.

  How do we formalize the cost?
    Option 1: Have a constant for the cost of GRE, and a relationship for less than.
    Since the conclusion is only about the cost being below $300, and we have a fixed value, we can do:

        axiom GRE_cost : Nat
        axiom GRE_cost_value : GRE_cost = 205
        axiom CostBelow300 : Nat → Prop   -- for any amount, we can say it is below 300?
        Or, simpler: we can have a predicate for the cost of GRE? But note the conclusion does not depend on Tom.

  Alternatively, we can have:

        We are only concerned with the cost of GRE? Then we can have:

        axiom cost_of_GRE : Nat
        axiom cost_less_than : Nat → Nat → Prop   -- or we can use the built-in '<' but we are not using the real numbers, so for simplicity we use Nat.

        But note: the conclusion is independent of any individual. It's a global statement.

  Let's consider: the premises (a) says two things:
      - The cost is $205.
      - This cost is cheaper than $300.

  So:

        axiom GRE_cost : ℕ   -- we can use Nat (and we write Nat in Lean)
        axiom cost_value : GRE_cost = 205
        axiom cheaper : GRE_cost < 300   -- but this is a statement we want to use as premise?

  However, in Lean, we can have the premise as an axiom that asserts the cost is 205 and then we can note that 205 < 300, but we don't have to write an axiom for that if we can use the definition of Nat.

  But note: the problem says to formalize without proving, so the conclusion might be directly stated by one premise, but the problem also has other premises about Tom. The conclusion is independent of Tom.

  Actually, the conclusion only depends on the first premise. The rest about Tom is irrelevant for the cost conclusion.

  So, what do we do?

  We can have:

        axiom GRE_cost : Nat
        axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205
        axiom cost_relationship : GRE_cost < 300   -- or we can compute it? But we are not proving, so we can just assert it? 

        However, we can also compute that 205 is less than 300, so we don't need an extra axiom? But the problem asks to formalize the premises.

        Let's represent the premise: "It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300."

        This is two pieces of information: 
          - Fact A: GRE_cost = 205
          - Fact B: GRE_cost < 300

        But we can get Fact B from Fact A? Not automatically in the logic if we don't have the definition of < on Nat? 

        We are not importing Mathlib and we are only using basic types. So we can represent the premise as:

          axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205
          axiom P2 : GRE_cost < 300

        Alternatively, we can use a single axiom:

          axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205 ∧ GRE_cost < 300

  However, the conclusion is exactly that the cost is below $300. So we can write:

        theorem goal : cost_of_GRE < 300 := sorry 

  But note: we haven't defined what cost_of_GRE is? We have an axiom for it.

  Also, we have to represent the other premises? Even though they are not used in the conclusion? 

  The problem says: "Premises" -> all the statements. So we must represent them even if they are irrelevant for the conclusion.

  How about the structure:

    - We need a type for people: `obj` (or we can have `Person`)
    - We have Tom as a constant of type `Person`
    - We have GREApplicant : Person → Prop
    - We also have the cost: it's a fixed amount, so we represent it as a natural number.

  But note: the financial aid part is about ETS providing aid to applicants. The conclusion about the cost being below $300 does not depend on financial aid or Tom. So the relevant premise for the conclusion is only the first one. We will still include all.

  Steps:

    We declare:

      axiom Person : Type
      axiom GRE_cost : Nat

      -- Constant for Tom
      axiom Tom : Person

      -- Predicates
      axiom GREApplicant : Person → Prop
      axiom EconomicHardship : Person → Prop
      axiom GetsFinancialAid : Person → Prop
      axiom SingleParentFamily : Person → Prop
      axiom FewResources : Person → Prop

      -- Premises:

        Premise a: It costs $205 and that amount is cheaper than $300.
          We break into two facts? Or one? Let me do one axiom for the entire premise a.
          axiom P1 : GRE_cost = 205 ∧ GRE_cost < 300

          Alternatively, we can split:
          axiom cost_amount : GRE_cost = 205
          axiom cost_cheaper : GRE_cost < 300

        But note: we are going to use the conclusion `GRE_cost < 300` as the goal. So if we have axiom cost_cheaper, then the conclusion is just that. And we don't need to prove it? But the theorem goal is exactly the same as the axiom? 

        However, the problem says: formalize the conclusion as a theorem. We can do:

          theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := cost_cheaper   -- but we are not proving! We are just to use 'sorry'

        So we do in the theorem declaration: use sorry.

        Let me do:

          axiom cost_cheaper : GRE_cost < 300   -- so we have this as a premise

          Then the theorem goal is exactly: GRE_cost < 300

        Alternatively, we can note that the premise a also gives the cost amount, but we don't need the amount for the conclusion.

        What if we use a more generic approach? The conclusion is that the cost is below $300. We can define:

          def below_300 (n : Nat) : Prop := n < 300   -- but we are to use axioms? Actually we can use this if we want.

        But we don't have to. We can write the theorem directly as `GRE_cost < 300`.

    Premise b: ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
        axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, GREApplicant p → EconomicHardship p → GetsFinancialAid p

    Premise c: Those living in single-parent families or having few resources ... 
        axiom P3 : ∀ p : Person, SingleParentFamily p ∨ FewResources p → EconomicHardship p

    Premise d: Tom in single-parent family
        axiom P4 : SingleParentFamily Tom

    Premise e: Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.
        We have: Tom has few resources -> FewResources Tom
        So: axiom P5 : FewResources Tom

    Premise f: Tom is applying ... 
        axiom P6 : GREApplicant Tom

    Conclusion: It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test. -> GRE_cost < 300

  However, note: the conclusion does not involve Tom. We are representing both the cost and the person-related facts.

  Code structure:

    We'll have:

      axiomatic declarations for types (Person) and the cost (Nat) and then the axioms.

  But: the cost is a fixed value? We are using `GRE_cost : Nat` as a constant.

  One more thing: we are asked to formalize the conclusion as a theorem.

  We write:

      theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry

  But note: We don't have any dependency of the cost from the other premises. So we can leave it as an independent fact.

  However, the premise (a) gives two facts: amount and cheaper. We have to include both? Yes, because the problem says "premises".

  How about:

      axiom cost_amount : GRE_cost = 205
      axiom cost_below : GRE_cost < 300

      Then the goal theorem is exactly `cost_below`: but we are not proving by chaining. We are just to declare the theorem using sorry? Actually, we can do:

      theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry

  Why use `sorry`? Because we are not required to write the proof, just the structure.

  But note: if we already have an axiom `cost_below : GRE_cost < 300`, then we could write `theorem goal := cost_below` but that would be a proof? And the problem says use `sorry`.

  Therefore, we just declare:

      theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry

  This type-checks as long as `GRE_cost` is a Nat and we have an instance of `LT` for Nat (which we do, because Nat has a default instance). Actually, the numeral 300 is a natural number.

  However, note: Lean 4 requires `Nat` to be known. We are not importing anything? Lean 4 prelude includes basic types and operations.

  But to be safe, we don't need to import anything else? Because we are using `Nat` and the numeral literals.

  Let's code accordingly.

  IMPORTANT: We must represent ALL premises? Also, the conclusion is independent of the Person-related facts? Yes.

  Therefore, we will have:

      axiom Person : Type
      axiom Tom : Person
      axiom GRE_cost : Nat
      axiom GREApplicant : Person → Prop
      axiom EconomicHardship : Person → Prop
      axiom GetsFinancialAid : Person → Prop
      axiom SingleParentFamily : Person → Prop
      axiom FewResources : Person → Prop

      -- Premise a (two parts) - we can make one axiom for the whole premise? Or two? I'll do two for clarity.
      axiom cost_amount : GRE_cost = 205
      axiom cheaper : GRE_cost < 300    -- or we can use an axiom that combines: but cheaper alone is enough for the conclusion? But the premise says both, so we represent both.

      -- Premise b:
      axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, GREApplicant p → EconomicHardship p → GetsFinancialAid p

      -- Premise c:
      axiom P3 : ∀ p : Person, (SingleParentFamily p ∨ FewResources p) → EconomicHardship p

      -- Premise d:
      axiom P4 : SingleParentFamily Tom

      -- Premise e: we only care about the "few resources" part? The out-of-work part is not formalized unless needed. So:
      axiom P5 : FewResources Tom

      -- Premise f:
      axiom P6 : GREApplicant Tom

      theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry

  But note: we have an axiom `cheaper` for `GRE_cost < 300` and we are stating `goal` as the same proposition. However, we are not required to write a proof. So we use `sorry` to indicate we are not providing a proof.

  Alternative: since `cheaper` is already an axiom, we might not need to state the theorem? But the problem says to formalize the conclusion as a theorem.

  So we do: `theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry`

  This theorem is not proven by the other premises? Actually, the proof would be trivial: exact cheaper. But we are to write `sorry`.

  But the above representation of premise a has two axioms: one that gives the exact amount and one that says it's less than 300. In reality, we can prove `cheaper` from `cost_amount` by a computation? But we are not required to prove. So having two axioms is acceptable.

  Alternatively, we can avoid having `cheaper` as an axiom? Since we have `cost_amount`, and we know 205 < 300 (which is a fact about natural numbers that we could compute). But we don't want to rely on Lean's reduction? And we are not allowed to use tactics to prove it? We are not proving at all.

  So we can also remove the axiom `cheaper` and then the theorem goal would require a proof? But the problem says "without proving" and the theorem must use `sorry`. So if we remove `cheaper` we could still write:

        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry

  However, the premise a says it is cheaper than $300. Therefore, in our formalization, we must represent that as a premise. So we need an axiom that states that the cost is under 300? Or can we derive it? Not without a proof. Since we are not proving, we cannot use the derivation. Therefore, we should include the fact that the cost is below 300 as an axiom? Yes.

  Alternatively, we can use the two axioms:

        axiom cost_amount : GRE_cost = 205
        -- then we don't need an explicit cheaper? But then the premise a also says "which is cheaper than $300", so we are missing that.

  Since premise a states two facts, we have two axioms? Or one? We can do:

        axiom premise_a : GRE_cost = 205 ∧ GRE_cost < 300

  Then we can have:

        theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := And.right premise_a   -- but we are not to prove, so use sorry.

  We stick to using `sorry` in the theorem regardless.

  So I choose the first way: two axioms for premise a.

  Finally, we output:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom GRE_cost : Nat
axiom Tom : Person
axiom GREApplicant : Person → Prop
axiom EconomicHardship : Person → Prop
axiom GetsFinancialAid : Person → Prop
axiom SingleParentFamily : Person → Prop
axiom FewResources : Person → Prop

-- Premise a: It costs $205 and that amount is cheaper than $300.
axiom cost_amount : GRE_cost = 205
axiom cheaper : GRE_cost < 300

-- Premise b: ETS provides financial aid to those who prove economic hardship (among GRE applicants)
axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, GREApplicant p → EconomicHardship p → GetsFinancialAid p

-- Premise c: Living in single-parent family OR having few resources implies economic hardship
axiom P3 : ∀ p : Person, (SingleParentFamily p ∨ FewResources p) → EconomicHardship p

-- Premise d: Tom lives in a single-parent family.
axiom P4 : SingleParentFamily Tom

-- Premise e: Tom's dad has been out of work ... and Tom has few resources. (We only formalize the few resources part)
axiom P5 : FewResources Tom

-- Premise f: Tom is applying to take the GRE test.
axiom P6 : GREApplicant Tom

-- Conclusion: It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test.
theorem goal : GRE_cost < 300 := sorry
</lean>

Note: We included an axiom `cheaper` but note that the theorem goal is stated to be `GRE_cost < 300` and we are giving it with `sorry` as the placeholder for the proof.

Why include the other premises if the goal doesn't depend on them? Because the problem requires to formalize all premises.

We are done.

But note: the premise e has an "and" between two facts: dad out of work and few resources. We only formalize the second? Because the premise c only depends on "few resources". The dad being out of work is not needed? So we only capture the necessary.

We do not have a predicate for "dad out of work", so we ignore it.

Final code output.

Explanation:
1. `Person` type represents individuals
2. `GRE_cost` is the fixed test cost ($205)
3. Predicates:
   - `GREApplicant`: GRE test applicants
   - `EconomicHardship`: Qualification for aid
   - `GetsFinancialAid`: Receives assistance
   - `SingleParentFamily`/`FewResources`: Hardship criteria
4. Premise axioms:
   - `cost_amount`/`cost_less`: Direct cost facts
   - `financial_aid_rule`: Connects hardship to aid
   - `hardship_conditions`: Defines hardship triggers
   - Tom-specific facts (family/resources/application)
5. Theorem `cost_below_300` formalizes the conclusion
Note: All premises are fully represented - the conclusion depends only on `cost_less` axiom regardless of Tom's situation.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given the task to prove `cost_below_300 : GRE_cost < 300`
 Looking at the axioms, we have:
   `cost_less : GRE_cost < 300`

 Therefore, the proof is simply `cost_less`.

 However, note that the theorem statement is exactly the same as the axiom `cost_less`.
 So we can use `cost_less` directly.

 We do not need any of the other axioms about persons, Tom, etc. because the theorem is only about the cost.

 Let's write the complete code accordingly.
