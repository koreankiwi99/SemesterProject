=== REASONING ===
We are given two premises and a conclusion to formalize.

Premises:
1. All horses have hooves.
   This can be formalized as: For every x, if x is a horse, then x has hooves.
   In symbols: ∀x, Horse(x) → Hooves(x)

2. No humans have hooves.
   This means: For every x, if x is a human, then x does not have hooves.
   Alternatively: There does not exist an x that is human and has hooves.
   We can use: ∀x, Human(x) → ¬ Hooves(x)

Conclusion: Some humans are horses.
   This would be: There exists an x such that x is human and x is a horse.
   In symbols: ∃x, Human(x) ∧ Horse(x)

However, note that the premises lead to a contradiction if we assume that there exists a human who is also a horse. But our task is not to prove or disprove, but to formalize the given statements.

We'll declare:
- A type `obj` for the domain of individuals.
- Predicates: `Horse : obj → Prop`, `Human : obj → Prop`, `Hooves : obj → Prop`.

Premise 1: ∀x, Horse x → Hooves x
Premise 2: ∀x, Human x → ¬ Hooves x   (which is equivalent to ∀x, Human x → Hooves x → False)

Conclusion: ∃x, Human x ∧ Horse x

But note: the conclusion is actually false given the premises. However, we are only formalizing.

We'll define:
  axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Horse x → Hooves x
  axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Human x → ¬ Hooves x   (or equivalently: ∀ x, Human x → Hooves x → False)

And the theorem we are to formalize is:
  theorem goal : ∃ x : obj, Human x ∧ Horse x := sorry

However, note that the conclusion is "Some humans are horses", which is an existential statement.

But wait: the premises actually imply that no human is a horse? Yes, but again we are only formalizing the given statements.

Let's write the code accordingly.

Important: We must use the Lean 4 syntax and wrap in <lean> tags.


=== RESPONSE ===
To formalize the given premises and conclusion in Lean 4, we declare the necessary types and predicates, then define axioms for the premises and a theorem for the conclusion. The conclusion uses `sorry` as a placeholder proof.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Horse : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Hooves : obj → Prop

-- Premise 1: All horses have hooves
axiom all_horses_have_hooves : ∀ x : obj, Horse x → Hooves x

-- Premise 2: No humans have hooves (equivalent to: humans lack hooves)
axiom no_humans_have_hooves : ∀ x : obj, Human x → ¬ Hooves x

-- Conclusion: Some humans are horses (existential claim)
theorem some_humans_are_horses : ∃ x : obj, Human x ∧ Horse x := sorry
</lean>

**Explanation:**
1. **`obj`**: Represents the type of entities in our domain
2. **Predicates**:
   - `Horse x`: x is a horse
   - `Human x`: x is a human
   - `Hooves x`: x has hooves
3. **Premise 1**: `∀ x, Horse x → Hooves x`  
   (If x is a horse, then x has hooves)
4. **Premise 2**: `∀ x, Human x → ¬ Hooves x`  
   (If x is human, then x does not have hooves)
5. **Theorem**: `∃ x, Human x ∧ Horse x`  
   (There exists an x that is both human and horse)  
   Uses `sorry` as a placeholder proof term

This formalization captures the logical structure while maintaining consistency with the premises. The conclusion is declared as a theorem requiring proof (though we use `sorry` to bypass actual proof construction).
