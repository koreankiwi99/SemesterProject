STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the given premises and the conclusion.
 We'll define:
   - A type `obj` for objects (entities) in our domain.
   - We'll have constants for the specific objects and stables mentioned.
   - Predicates to represent properties and relations.

 Premises:
   1. Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE.
   2. Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine.
   3. Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile.
   4. Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine.

 Conclusion to formalize: 
   "Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable."

 Steps:
   We need to represent:
     - "Diamond Mine" as an object. Let's call it `DiamondMine`.
     - "Roderick Strong", "Creed Brothers", "Ivy Nile", "Imperium" as objects: `RoderickStrong`, `CreedBrothers`, `IvyNile`, `Imperium`.
     - The concept of being a professional wrestling stable: `ProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj → Prop`
     - The relation of leading: `Leads : obj → obj → Prop` (meaning: the first leads the second)
        But note: conclusion says Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable -> so we have to relate RoderickStrong to a stable (without necessarily requiring that stable to be DiamondMine? However, the premises only talk about DiamondMine).
        However, the argument is that from the premises we know that Diamond Mine is a stable and Roderick Strong leads it, so we can conclude that Roderick Strong leads at least one stable (namely Diamond Mine).

   Also, we have:
     - "formed in WWE" might be an additional property? But the conclusion does not require it, so we can ignore if not needed for the conclusion.
        However, premise 1 says: "Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE". We break it down:
           - It is a professional wrestling stable: `ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine`
           - It is formed in WWE? Since the conclusion doesn't require this, we can capture just the stable part.

     - "includes": `Includes : obj → obj → Prop` (first includes the second) but we might not need this for the conclusion? 
        The conclusion is about Roderick Strong leading a stable, and we get that from premise 2 and the property of being a stable from premise 1.

     - "has a feud with": `Feud : obj → obj → Prop`

 But note: the conclusion only requires that there exists a stable that Roderick Strong leads.

 Therefore, we will have:

   Constants:
     `DiamondMine`, `RoderickStrong`, `CreedBrothers`, `IvyNile`, `Imperium` : obj

   Predicates:
     `ProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj → Prop`
     `Leads : obj → obj → Prop`   (first argument is the leader, second the group)
     `Includes : obj → obj → Prop` (first the group, second the member)
     `Feud : obj → obj → Prop`     (first has feud with second)

   Premises (as axioms):
     A1: ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
     A2: Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
     A3: Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
     A4: Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
     A5: Feud Imperium DiamondMine

   Conclusion:
     ∃ s : obj, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s

 However, note that the conclusion says: "Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable", which can be interpreted as: there exists a stable (which is a professional wrestling stable) that Roderick Strong leads.

 Important: The conclusion does not specify which stable, so we use an existential.

 But wait: the argument is that we know one (DiamondMine) so we can conclude existence.

 Alternatively, we could have a separate predicate for being a stable, but the premise already states that DiamondMine is a professional wrestling stable.

 Therefore, we formalize the conclusion as an existential.

 We can then write the theorem:

   theorem goal : ∃ s : obj, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry

 However, note: the problem says "without proving", so we just write the theorem with `sorry`.

 But let's consider: do we have enough in the premises? We only know about DiamondMine being a stable and RoderickStrong leading it. We don't know if he leads any others, and we don't need to. The existential is satisfied by DiamondMine.

 Now, let's write the code accordingly.

 One more note: we have the "formed in WWE" part in premise 1. Since the conclusion doesn't require that the stable is formed in WWE, we ignored that. Alternatively, we could have a predicate for being formed in WWE, but that is not necessary for the conclusion.

 Therefore, we skip that.

 Code:

   axiom obj : Type

   -- Constants
   axiom DiamondMine : obj
   axiom RoderickStrong : obj
   axiom CreedBrothers : obj
   axiom IvyNile : obj
   axiom Imperium : obj

   -- Predicates
   axiom ProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj → Prop
   axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
   axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
   axiom Feud : obj → obj → Prop

   -- Premises
   axiom A1 : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
   axiom A2 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
   axiom A3 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
   axiom A4 : Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
   axiom A5 : Feud Imperium DiamondMine

   theorem goal : ∃ s : obj, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry

 But note: we don't use A3, A4, A5 in the conclusion. That's okay because the problem is to formalize the entire set, and the conclusion only needs A1 and A2.

 However, we might question: what if the problem requires the entire context? But the instructions say: "formalize the logical structure". We are including all premises as axioms, even if the conclusion does not use them.

 Alternatively, we might note that the conclusion only requires the existence of a stable led by RoderickStrong, which we get by A1 and A2.

 Therefore, the above formalization is acceptable.

 Let me write it in the required format.


=== RESPONSE ===
To formalize the given premises and conclusion in Lean 4, we define objects and predicates representing the entities and relationships described. The conclusion requires proving that Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable, which follows from the premises stating that Diamond Mine is such a stable and Roderick Strong leads it.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type

axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom RoderickStrong : obj
axiom CreedBrothers : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj
axiom Imperium : obj

-- Predicates
axiom ProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj → Prop
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Feud : obj → obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom stable_formed : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
axiom strong_leads : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
axiom includes_creed : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
axiom includes_nile : Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom imperium_feud : Feud Imperium DiamondMine

-- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable
theorem leads_stable : ∃ s, ProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry
</lean>

**Explanation:**
- `obj` represents the type of all entities
- Specific objects (`DiamondMine`, `RoderickStrong`, etc.) are declared as constants
- Predicates define properties and relationships:
  - `ProfessionalWrestlingStable` identifies wrestling stables
  - `Leads` indicates leadership (agent leads organization)
  - `Includes` represents group membership
  - `Feud` denotes a rivalry between entities
- Premises are formalized as axioms using the predicates
- The conclusion is expressed as an existential: There exists a stable `s` that Roderick Strong leads


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and need to prove that there exists a stable `s` such that `ProfessionalWrestlingStable s` and `Leads RoderickStrong s`.

From the premises:
- `stable_formed : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine`
- `strong_leads : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine`

We see that `DiamondMine` is a stable and Roderick Strong leads it.

Therefore, we can use `DiamondMine` as the witness for the existential.

The proof term will be: `⟨DiamondMine, stable_formed, strong_leads⟩`

Let's write the complete code accordingly.
