STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the premises and the conclusion about Bonnie.
 We need to define:
   - A type for "people" (let's call it `Person`)
   - Predicates and relations as per the premises.

 Steps:
 1. Define the type `Person`.
 2. Define predicates:
    - `InClub` : Person → Prop  (but note: all mentioned are in the club, so we can omit a separate predicate for being in the club? Actually, the premises are about people in the club. So we can either have `InClub` and then the premises start with ∀ p, InClub p → ... OR we can note that the domain is restricted to club members. However, the conclusion is about Bonnie being in the club. We'll have an axiom that Bonnie is in the club. So let's define:

    However, note: the premises say "People in this club ...", so we can model the discussion to be about people in the club. But there might be people outside the club? The premises are universally quantifying over club members. We can do:

    Option A: Have a predicate `InClub` and then in the axioms, we write `∀ p, InClub p → ...`
    Option B: Since the whole problem is about club members, we can define a type `ClubMember` and then the axioms are about `ClubMember`. This avoids having `InClub` everywhere.

    Let's go with Option B for simplicity and to avoid repeating `InClub p ->` in every axiom.

    We define:
      `ClubMember : Type`

    Then we have Bonnie as a club member: `axiom Bonnie : ClubMember`

    But note: the premises are about "people in this club", so we are restricting to club members. So we don't need a predicate for being in the club because the type `ClubMember` already represents that.

 3. Now the predicates (all on `ClubMember`):

    - `PerformsOften : ClubMember → Prop`
    - `AttendsEngaged : ClubMember → Prop`   (attends and is very engaged with school events)
    - `InactiveDisinterested : ClubMember → Prop`
    - `Chaperones : ClubMember → Prop`   (chaperones high school dances)
    - `IsStudent : ClubMember → Prop`    (is a student who attends the school)

    For the last premise about young children and teenagers, we need:

    - `YoungChildOrTeenager : ClubMember → Prop`
    - `WishFurther : ClubMember → Prop`   (wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities)

    Note: The premise says "All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further ... are students". So we'll have a premise:
        ∀ c, YoungChildOrTeenager c → WishFurther c → IsStudent c

    Also, note the premise:
        "People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members."
        We can write: ∀ c, PerformsOften c ∨ InactiveDisinterested c

    But wait: the premise says "either ... or". We are taking it as inclusive or? However, the next premise says that the inactive ones chaperone, and the one about chaperones not being students. Also, the first premise says that those who perform often are engaged.

    However, note that the first premise says: "People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged". So: ∀ c, PerformsOften c → AttendsEngaged c.

    Also, the premise: "People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students." So: ∀ c, Chaperones c → ¬ IsStudent c.

    And: "All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested community members chaperone high school dances": ∀ c, InactiveDisinterested c → Chaperones c.

    Now the last premise about Bonnie: 
        "Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student, or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged and is not a student." 
        This is a bit complex. It says:
          (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ IsStudent Bonnie) ∨ ¬(AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ IsStudent Bonnie)

        Actually, note the wording: 
          "Bonnie ... she either both attends ... and is a student ... OR is not someone who both attends ... and is not a student"

        Let me parse: 
          Option 1: (AttendsEngaged and IsStudent)
          Option 2: not (someone who both attends and is very engaged and is not a student) -> Wait, it says: "is not someone who both attends and is very engaged and is not a student"

        Actually, the second part is: 
          "is not someone who [both (attends and is very engaged) and (is not a student)]"

        That is: ¬ (AttendsEngaged ∧ ¬ IsStudent)

        So the whole thing is:
          (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ IsStudent Bonnie) ∨ ¬ (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬ IsStudent Bonnie)

        But note: ¬(A ∧ ¬B) is equivalent to A → B. And the entire disjunction is actually a tautology? Let's see:
          (A ∧ B) ∨ (A → B)   [because ¬(A ∧ ¬B) ≡ A → B]
          But (A→B) is ¬A ∨ B, so we have: (A∧B) ∨ (¬A∨B) ≡ (A∧B) ∨ ¬A ∨ B ≡ (A∨¬A∨B) ∧ (B∨¬A∨B) ... actually, it's always true.

        However, the way it is worded is a bit ambiguous. But note: the text says "either both ... or ...", so we take it as a disjunction of two mutually exclusive? The problem states it as a fact about Bonnie.

        Alternatively, we can note that the second part is: 
          "is not someone who both attends and is very engaged and is not a student" 
          That is: she is not (AttendsEngaged and not IsStudent)

        So the axiom for Bonnie is:
          (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ IsStudent Bonnie) ∨ ¬(AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬IsStudent Bonnie)

        But this is equivalent to: 
          (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ IsStudent Bonnie) ∨ (¬AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∨ IsStudent Bonnie)
          which is equivalent to: (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ IsStudent Bonnie) ∨ ¬AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∨ IsStudent Bonnie

        This is a tautology? Because if we consider:
          if AttendsEngaged Bonnie is true and IsStudent Bonnie is true -> true.
          if AttendsEngaged Bonnie is true and IsStudent Bonnie is false -> then we have ¬(AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬IsStudent Bonnie) is false. So we require the first part to be true? But the first part is false. So then the disjunction would be false? 

        Actually, let me compute when AttendsEngaged=true and IsStudent=false:
          (true ∧ false) is false and ¬(true ∧ (¬false)) = ¬(true ∧ true) = ¬true = false. Then disjunction false ∨ false = false.

        So this is not a tautology? Then the premise is saying that Bonnie satisfies one of these two.

        Alternatively, let me read the original again: 
          "Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school."

        The first part: "both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student" -> that's three? Actually, the sentence structure: 
          "both A and is B" ... and then the sentence breaks with "or" ... actually, the "both" might be grouping the two? Let me break:

          The first option: "(both (attends and is very engaged with school events) and (is a student))"
          The second option: "is not someone who (both (attends and is very engaged with school events) and (is not a student))"

        So: 
          Option1: (AttendsEngaged ∧ IsStudent)
          Option2: ¬(AttendsEngaged ∧ (¬IsStudent))

        Which is ¬(AttendsEngaged ∧ ¬IsStudent) ≡ AttendsEngaged → IsStudent.

        Therefore, the axiom for Bonnie is:
          (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ IsStudent Bonnie) ∨ (AttendsEngaged Bonnie → IsStudent Bonnie)

        But this is also a tautology? Wait, if AttendsEngaged is true then: the disjunction becomes (IsStudent) ∨ (IsStudent) → IsStudent. Actually, it would be (IsStudent) ∨ (if true then IsStudent) ... which reduces to IsStudent ∨ IsStudent -> IsStudent. But if AttendsEngaged is false, then the first part is (false ∧ IsStudent) = false, and the second part is (false → IsStudent)=true. So always true? 

        So it is a tautology? Then why include it? 

        Wait, perhaps we are misreading. The second part says: "is not someone who both A and (not B)". So that is equivalent to: ¬ (A ∧ ¬B) which is A → B. So the entire axiom is:
          (A ∧ B) ∨ (A → B)

        And as we saw, (A→B) is ¬A ∨ B, so the disjunction is (A∧B) ∨ (¬A∨B) → which is equivalent to (A∧B)∨¬A∨B.
        Now, (A∧B)∨¬A∨B = (A∨¬A)∨B? Not exactly: 
          (A∧B) ∨ ¬A ∨ B = (¬A ∨ (A∧B)) ∨ B = [ (¬A∨A) ∧ (¬A∨B) ] ∨ B = (true ∧ (¬A∨B)) ∨ B = (¬A∨B) ∨ B = ¬A ∨ B.

        So actually, the entire axiom reduces to ¬AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∨ IsStudent Bonnie, which is equivalent to AttendsEngaged Bonnie → IsStudent Bonnie.

        That makes sense because the original disjunction is redundant. So we can write the axiom as:
          AttendsEngaged Bonnie → IsStudent Bonnie

        But wait, should we trust that? The original statement had an "either ... or", and that is how we interpreted. But if it is equivalent to a simple implication, then we can use that.

        However, let me note: the premise might be that she is exactly in one of these cases? But the word "either ... or" in natural language can be inclusive. But then we have a tautology, so it doesn't add information. Alternatively, perhaps we should take it as an exclusive disjunction? But the problem does not say "either ... or but not both". It just says "either ... or".

        But given that we have deduced that the disjunction is always true, then the premise is actually redundant? Then why have it? 

        Alternatively, the second part is negating the combination of (attends and is not a student), which is a statement that she is not in that category. But note we don't know if she is in the first category? So the axiom is saying: she does not have the property (AttendsEngaged and not IsStudent). So we get:
          ¬(AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬IsStudent Bonnie)
          ≡ AttendsEngaged Bonnie → IsStudent Bonnie

        So we'll take that.

        Therefore, the axiom for Bonnie becomes:
          axiom Bonnie_fact : ¬(AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬IsStudent Bonnie)

        Or equivalently, 
          axiom Bonnie_fact : AttendsEngaged Bonnie → IsStudent Bonnie

        Let me check with the two cases:

          Case 1: She is in the first part: she attends and is a student. Then the implication is true (because the premise becomes: AttendsEngaged Bonnie → IsStudent Bonnie, and if she attends and is a student, then the premise holds because the consequent is true).

          Case 2: She is not in the first part? Then the premise requires that she is not in the category of attending but not being a student. But if she doesn't attend, then the implication holds. So the premise holds.

        So we can use the implication.

 4. Now the conclusion:
        If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, 
        then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.

    Let H : (Chaperones Bonnie) ∨ (¬Chaperones Bonnie → PerformsOften Bonnie)

    Actually, note: "if she does not" chaperone, then she performs often -> this is: ¬Chaperones Bonnie → PerformsOften Bonnie.

    Then the conclusion: 
        (YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie ∧ WishFurther Bonnie) ∧ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie

    So the theorem is:
        H → ((YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie ∧ WishFurther Bonnie) ∧ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie)

 5. Now, let me write the axioms:

    We have a type `ClubMember`

    Constants and predicates:
      Bonnie : ClubMember
      PerformsOften : ClubMember → Prop
      AttendsEngaged : ClubMember → Prop
      InactiveDisinterested : ClubMember → Prop
      Chaperones : ClubMember → Prop
      IsStudent : ClubMember → Prop
      YoungChildOrTeenager : ClubMember → Prop
      WishFurther : ClubMember → Prop

    Axioms:

      A1: ∀ c : ClubMember, PerformsOften c → AttendsEngaged c
      A2: ∀ c : ClubMember, PerformsOften c ∨ InactiveDisinterested c
      A3: ∀ c : ClubMember, Chaperones c → ¬ IsStudent c
      A4: ∀ c : ClubMember, InactiveDisinterested c → Chaperones c
      A5: ∀ c : ClubMember, YoungChildOrTeenager c → WishFurther c → IsStudent c
      A6: AttendsEngaged Bonnie → IsStudent Bonnie   [as we derived]

    And note: the A5 says: if c is a young child/teen and wishes to further, then c is a student.

    Now, we can try to derive the theorem. But we are only formalizing.

    The theorem to state:

        ( (Chaperones Bonnie) ∨ (¬(Chaperones Bonnie) → PerformsOften Bonnie) ) 
        → ( (YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie ∧ WishFurther Bonnie) ∧ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie )

 6. Write the code accordingly.

 7. Note: In the premises, we have that people who are inactive and disinterested chaperone (A4), and chaperones are not students (A3). Also, from A2, everyone is either PerformsOften or InactiveDisinterested.

    And from A1, if you perform often then you are engaged.

 8. We'll now write the Lean code.


=== RESPONSE ===
To formalize the given premises and conclusion in Lean 4, we define the necessary types, predicates, and axioms based on the logical structure. The key steps involve:

1. Defining a `ClubMember` type representing people in the club
2. Creating predicates for properties like performing often, attending/engaging, etc.
3. Adding Bonnie as a specific club member
4. Formalizing premises as axioms using universal quantification
5. Stating Bonnie's specific situation as an implication axiom
6. Declaring the conclusion as a theorem with hypothesis and conclusion

The Lean code below captures all premises and the conclusion precisely:

<lean>
def ClubMember : Type

def PerformsOften : ClubMember → Prop
def AttendsEngaged : ClubMember → Prop
def InactiveDisinterested : ClubMember → Prop
def Chaperones : ClubMember → Prop
def IsStudent : ClubMember → Prop
def YoungChildOrTeenager : ClubMember → Prop
def WishFurther : ClubMember → Prop

axiom Bonnie : ClubMember

-- People who perform often attend and are engaged
axiom P1 : ∀ c : ClubMember, PerformsOften c → AttendsEngaged c

-- Club members either perform often or are inactive
axiom P2 : ∀ c : ClubMember, PerformsOften c ∨ InactiveDisinterested c

-- Chaperones are not students
axiom P3 : ∀ c : ClubMember, Chaperones c → ¬ IsStudent c

-- Inactive members chaperone
axiom P4 : ∀ c : ClubMember, InactiveDisinterested c → Chaperones c

-- Young children/teenagers who wish to further their academics are students
axiom P5 : ∀ c : ClubMember, YoungChildOrTeenager c → WishFurther c → IsStudent c

-- Bonnie's situation: If she attends and is engaged, then she is a student
axiom P6 : AttendsEngaged Bonnie → IsStudent Bonnie

-- Conclusion: 
-- If Bonnie (chaperones OR doesn't chaperone → performs often), 
-- then she is (young child/teen AND wishes to further AND inactive/disinterested)
theorem conclusion : 
  (Chaperones Bonnie ∨ (¬ Chaperones Bonnie → PerformsOften Bonnie)) → 
  YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie ∧ WishFurther Bonnie ∧ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie 
:= sorry
</lean>

Note: The `sorry` placeholder indicates the theorem isn't proven - we're only formalizing the logical structure. This translation maintains all logical relationships from the premises while correctly structuring the conclusion as an implication.

--------------------------------------------------
--- Iteration 2 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are defining a type for club members and then predicates (properties) about them.
 In the original code, the issue was that we used `def` without providing a definition. Since we are only declaring types and axioms, we should use `axiom` or `variable` for the type and then `axiom` for the predicates and individuals.

 However, note that the error says: unexpected token 'def'; expected ':=', 'where' or '|'

 We can fix this by using `axiom` for the type and for the predicates. Alternatively, we can use `variable` or even introduce a `constant` for the type and then use `axiom` for the rest.

 But note: The error says that after `def ClubMember : Type` it expected a definition. We can change it to:

   axiom ClubMember : Type

 But also note: in Lean, `def` requires a definition. Since we are not defining the type, we should use `axiom` or `constant`. However, the predicates can be declared as `def` only if we define them? But we don't have definitions, so we must use `axiom` for them too.

 So let's change every `def` to `axiom`? But wait, the `PerformsOften : ClubMember → Prop` is a function, so we can declare it as a constant.

 Alternatively, we can use:

   constant ClubMember : Type
   constant PerformsOften : ClubMember → Prop

 However, the problem says to use `axiom` for definitions? Actually, the example used `axiom` for the type and for the predicates? Let me check the example:

   axiom obj : Type
   axiom Cat : obj
   axiom Blue : obj → Prop

 So let's do:

   axiom ClubMember : Type
   axiom PerformsOften : ClubMember → Prop
   ... and so on.

 But the first error is on the first `def`: we can change it to `axiom`.

 Actually, the example uses `axiom` for everything that is not a theorem.

 Revised plan:

   axiom ClubMember : Type
   axiom PerformsOften : ClubMember → Prop
   axiom AttendsEngaged : ClubMember → Prop
   axiom InactiveDisinterested : ClubMember → Prop
   axiom Chaperones : ClubMember → Prop
   axiom IsStudent : ClubMember → Prop
   axiom YoungChildOrTeenager : ClubMember → Prop
   axiom WishFurther : ClubMember → Prop

   axiom Bonnie : ClubMember

 Then the premises as axioms.

 Also note: the last premise about Bonnie is complex. The premise says:

   Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.

 This can be interpreted as:

   (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ IsStudent Bonnie) ∨ (¬ (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ IsStudent Bonnie))

 But that is always true! So that doesn't give any information. Actually, it might be a tautology. However, let me read it again:

   "Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school."

 The second part: "is not someone who both attends and is very engaged and is not a student"? That is a negation of (AttendsEngaged and not a student). So:

   (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ IsStudent Bonnie) ∨ ¬ (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬ IsStudent Bonnie)

 Actually, that's equivalent to: 

   (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ IsStudent Bonnie) ∨ (¬AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∨ IsStudent Bonnie)

 Which is equivalent to: (IsStudent Bonnie) ∨ (¬AttendsEngaged Bonnie) 

 But wait, we can simplify:

   The premise says: she is either (attends and engaged and student) OR she is not (attends and engaged and not a student).

 The part "is not someone who both attends and is very engaged and is not a student" is:

   ¬ (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬ IsStudent Bonnie)

 So the entire disjunction:

   (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ IsStudent Bonnie) ∨ ¬(AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬ IsStudent Bonnie)

 And we can write ¬(A ∧ ¬B) as ¬A ∨ B.

 Therefore, the entire thing is:

   (A ∧ B) ∨ (¬A ∨ B) = (A ∧ B) ∨ ¬A ∨ B

 And that is equivalent to: (¬A) ∨ (A ∧ B) ∨ B = (¬A ∨ B) [because if we have ¬A we are done, if we don't then we have A and then we need B from the other term, and then B alone also covers the last B].

 Actually: 

   (A ∧ B) ∨ ¬A ∨ B = (A ∧ B) ∨ (¬A ∨ B) = (A ∧ B) ∨ ¬A ∨ B.

 Since (A∧B)∨B = B, and then ¬A∨B, we get ¬A∨B.

 But actually, we have:

   (A ∧ B) ∨ (¬A ∨ B) = (A ∧ B) ∨ ¬A ∨ B.

 Now, note that (A ∧ B) ∨ ¬A = (¬A ∨ (A ∧ B)) = (¬A ∨ A) ∧ (¬A ∨ B) = True ∧ (¬A ∨ B) = ¬A ∨ B.

 Then we have (¬A∨B) ∨ B = ¬A ∨ B.

 So the entire disjunction is equivalent to: ¬AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∨ IsStudent Bonnie.

 Which is: AttendsEngaged Bonnie → IsStudent Bonnie.

 So indeed, the premise is just: AttendsEngaged Bonnie → IsStudent Bonnie.

 Therefore, our axiom P6 is correctly stated.

 However, the problem says: "Bonnie is in this club" - we already have her as a ClubMember, so we don't need to repeat that.

 Now for the conclusion:

   If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.

 Formalizing:

   Let C = Chaperones Bonnie
   Let P = PerformsOften Bonnie

   The condition: (C ∨ (¬C → P))

   Then we must conclude: (YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie ∧ WishFurther Bonnie ∧ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie)

 So the theorem is:

   (Chaperones Bonnie ∨ (¬ Chaperones Bonnie → PerformsOften Bonnie)) →
   YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie ∧ WishFurther Bonnie ∧ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie

 We had correctly expressed that.

 Now, we fix the type errors by replacing `def` with `axiom` for the predicates and the type.

 Let me write the corrected code:


=== RESPONSE ===
To fix the type errors, I identified that declaring predicates using `def` without providing a definition is invalid. The solution is to replace all `def` declarations with `axiom` for both the universe type and predicates, ensuring consistent axiomatic declarations throughout.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom ClubMember : Type

axiom PerformsOften : ClubMember → Prop
axiom AttendsEngaged : ClubMember → Prop
axiom InactiveDisinterested : ClubMember → Prop
axiom Chaperones : ClubMember → Prop
axiom IsStudent : ClubMember → Prop
axiom YoungChildOrTeenager : ClubMember → Prop
axiom WishFurther : ClubMember → Prop

axiom Bonnie : ClubMember

-- Performers attend and are engaged
axiom P1 : ∀ c : ClubMember, PerformsOften c → AttendsEngaged c

-- Members perform often or are inactive
axiom P2 : ∀ c : ClubMember, PerformsOften c ∨ InactiveDisinterested c

-- Chaperones aren't students
axiom P3 : ∀ c : ClubMember, Chaperones c → ¬ IsStudent c

-- Inactive members chaperone
axiom P4 : ∀ c : ClubMember, InactiveDisinterested c → Chaperones c

-- Young academics are students
axiom P5 : ∀ c : ClubMember, YoungChildOrTeenager c → WishFurther c → IsStudent c

-- Bonnie: Engaged → Student
axiom P6 : AttendsEngaged Bonnie → IsStudent Bonnie

-- Conclusion structure:
-- Hypothesis: Bonnie chaperones OR (if she doesn't chaperone, she performs often)
-- Conclusion: Bonnie is young, wishes to further academics, and is inactive
theorem conclusion : 
  (Chaperones Bonnie ∨ (¬Chaperones Bonnie → PerformsOften Bonnie)) → 
  YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie ∧ WishFurther Bonnie ∧ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie 
:= sorry
</lean>

Key fixes made:
1. Changed all `def ... : ...` declarations to `axiom ... : ...`
2. Maintained predicate arity consistency (all take single `ClubMember` argument)
3. Preserved logical structure of premises and conclusion
4. Kept universal quantifiers for premises covering all club members
5. Maintained the complex hypothesis structure for Bonnie in the theorem


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and the theorem `conclusion` to prove.

The theorem states:
  (Chaperones Bonnie ∨ (¬Chaperones Bonnie → PerformsOften Bonnie)) → 
  YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie ∧ WishFurther Bonnie ∧ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie

We note that the hypothesis is a disjunction:
  Case 1: Chaperones Bonnie
  Case 2: If ¬Chaperones Bonnie then PerformsOften Bonnie

We are to prove that Bonnie is young (YoungChildOrTeenager), wishes to further (WishFurther), and is inactive (InactiveDisinterested).

We have the following axioms:

P1: ∀ c, PerformsOften c → AttendsEngaged c
P2: ∀ c, PerformsOften c ∨ InactiveDisinterested c   [but note this is for every member, so Bonnie too]
P3: ∀ c, Chaperones c → ¬ IsStudent c
P4: ∀ c, InactiveDisinterested c → Chaperones c
P5: ∀ c, YoungChildOrTeenager c → WishFurther c → IsStudent c
P6: AttendsEngaged Bonnie → IsStudent Bonnie

We are to assume the premise and derive the three parts.

Let's denote:
  H0: Chaperones Bonnie ∨ (¬Chaperones Bonnie → PerformsOften Bonnie)

We break into cases:

Case 1: Chaperones Bonnie.
  By P3, we have ¬ IsStudent Bonnie.
  We wish to show YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie ∧ WishFurther Bonnie ∧ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.

  However, from Chaperones Bonnie and P4? Actually, P4 says that InactiveDisinterested c → Chaperones c, but that doesn't necessarily go the other way.
  We do not have that Chaperones implies Inactive. So it is not immediate.

  We also note that we have P2: either PerformsOften Bonnie or InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.
  If we are in case 1 (Chaperones Bonnie) then we cannot have PerformsOften Bonnie? Why? Because P3 says that chaperones are not students. 
  But we have P6: if she is engaged then she is a student. And by P1, if she performs often then she is engaged. So if she performed often, she would be a student, which would contradict P3 (since Chaperones Bonnie gives ¬IsStudent Bonnie).

  So if she is Chaperones, then she cannot be a student, so she cannot be engaged (by P6: engaged would imply student), so she cannot perform often (by P1: performing often implies engaged).

  Then by P2, we must have InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.

  So we get InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.

  But we still need YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie and WishFurther Bonnie? We don't have that.

  The conclusion requires three things. We have InactiveDisinterested Bonnie, but what about the other two?

  Looking at P5: it says that if Bonnie is young and wishes to further, then she is a student. But we know she is not a student (from chaperone). Therefore, if she were both young and wished to further, we would have a contradiction. So we cannot have both YoungChildOrTeenager and WishFurther? That means one of them must be false. But we need both.

  So we are stuck in this case: we have Chaperones Bonnie and thus InactiveDisinterested Bonnie, but we cannot prove she is young and wishes to further.

Case 2: ¬Chaperones Bonnie → PerformsOften Bonnie.

  This means that if we can prove Bonne is not a chaperone, then she performs often.

  We don't know right away if she is a chaperone or not. But note that by P2, Bonnie is either performing often or inactive.
  Also note that P4 says that if she is inactive, then she is a chaperone.

  Let us assume that she is inactive. Then by P4, she is a chaperone. But then our case 2 hypothesis has an implication: ¬Chaperones Bonnie → ... But if she is a chaperone, then ¬Chaperones Bonnie is false, so the implication holds vacuously? 

  However, that doesn't give us the conclusion.

  We have to prove the three parts: young, wish, inactive.

  We are currently in the case where our hypothesis is: ¬Chaperones → PerformsOften. But we want to prove inactive? And also young and wish.

  Can we prove inactive? We try to see the possibilities:

  By P2: Bonnie is either PerformsOften or InactiveDisinterested.

  Subcase 2.1: InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.
      Then we have inactive. Also, by P4, she is a chaperone. But now we are in the situation of case 1? However, we are in the case of the disjunction that was the premise? Actually, our premise case is case 2, but having InactiveDisinterested Bonnie leads to chaperone, so ¬Chaperones Bonnie is false, so the hypothesis of the implication in case 2 is false, so we get PerformsOften Bonnie vacuously? But that would give both inactive and performs often? But that would be a contradiction? Why? Because inactive and performs often are not necessarily exclusive? The axioms don't say they are exclusive.

  However, the problem is that if she is inactive, we have chaperone (by P4) and then by P3 we are not a student. But if she performs often, then by P1 she is engaged, then by P6 she is a student. So if she is inactive and performs often, we have:
      IsStudent Bonnie (from engaged, which comes from performs often) and ¬IsStudent Bonnie (from chaperone) -> contradiction.

  Therefore, if she is inactive, we get that she is a chaperone and hence not a student, and also if she performs often she is a student. But we have both? Contradiction.

  So if we are in case 2, she cannot be inactive? Because if she were inactive, that leads to a contradiction? Then by P2, she must be performing often.

  But wait: we are in case 2: we have the implication that if she is not chaperone, then she performs often.

  If she is inactive, then she is chaperone (by P4). So ¬Chaperones is false -> the implication doesn't require anything. But we don't need her to perform often if she is chaperone? However, in the case of being chaperone, we are not using the implication to get that she performs often? But we have just shown that if she is inactive, then she is chaperone and that leads to a contradiction if we also get that she must perform often? Actually, we don't get that she performs often by the implication in case 2 when she is chaperone because the implication only applies if ¬Chaperones.

  The contradiction comes entirely from being inactive: 
    Inactive -> chaperone -> not student (P3, P4)
    And if we also have PerformsOften? We don't necessarily have that in case 2 from the hypothesis when she is chaperone? So why the contradiction?

  Actually, when she is inactive, we have chaperone, which is the first disjunct of the premise? But wait, the premise of the theorem is the entire disjunction: (Chaperones ∨ (¬Chaperones → PerformsOften)). In case 2 we are considering the second disjunct: (¬Chaperones → PerformsOften). But if she is inactive, we have chaperone, which may come from the first disjunct? But the premise is fixed: we are given one disjunction and we are splitting the OR in the premise into two cases. However, in the proof, we have to consider the two cases for the premise.

  Actually, the premise is the whole disjunction, and we are assuming either the first part OR the second part. In case 1 we assumed the first, in case 2 we assume the second.

  But when we look at the state of Bonnie, we have to use the axioms together.

  However, we have just argued that if Bonnie is inactive, then she is a chaperone (P4). Then by P3, she is not a student. Also, by P1 and P2? We know that if she were performing often, then she would be engaged (P1) and then student (P6). But if she is inactive, by P2 we have that she is inactive, so we don't get that she performs often? But how do we know she does not perform often? P2 says she either PerformsOften OR Inactive. So if she is inactive, she doesn't perform often. Therefore, we don't get a contradiction from that.

  So in case 2, if she is inactive, we have:
      Inactive -> chaperone (by P4)
      Therefore, is a chaperone, so not a student (P3)
      And since she is inactive, she doesn't perform often (by P2, but note the disjunction: if she is inactive then she is not performing).
      So no contradiction.

  But we are in case 2 of the premise? Case 2 is: (¬Chaperones → PerformsOften). But here she is chaperones, so ¬Chaperones is false -> the implication holds vacuously. So we don't get that she performs often in this subcase.

  Now, we require to show that she is young, wishes to further, and inactive. We have inactive, but what about the other two? We don't have any evidence. So again, we cannot prove young and wishes to further.

Therefore, in both cases we are missing the components YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie and WishFurther Bonnie.

Looking back at the axioms, we have no information about Bonnie being young or wishing to further, except P5 which requires these to be true to conclude she is a student.

But in one case (chaperone) we have that she is not a student, which by P5 (contrapositive) implies that she cannot be both young and wishing to further. But we need her to be both young and wishing to further. So that becomes impossible in the chaperone case.

In the non-chaperone case, we don't have any reason to believe she is young and wishes to further.

Therefore, the theorem might not hold. Let's try to see if we can find a counterexample.

Attempt to build a model:

Assume there is one member, Bonnie.

Case: She is chaperone. Then we know:
  - She is not a student (P3).
  - Also, by the above: we must be inactive? Because if she were performing often then she would be engaged, then student (P6) -> contradiction. So she is inactive (by P2: the other option, performing often, leads to contradiction).

So we set:
  Chaperones Bonnie = true
  InactiveDisinterested Bonnie = true
  PerformsOften Bonnie = false
  AttendsEngaged Bonnie: false (since if she performed we would have engaged, which we don't, but also we don't have any direct axiom? But we don't require this)
  IsStudent Bonnie: false

For the conclusion, we require YoungChildOrTeenager and WishFurther. We can set these arbitrarily. But the conclusion requires them to be true. But to be false? We can set them to false and avoid being forced to have IsStudent. How? P5: if she is young and wishes to further then she is student. Since she is not a student, if we set YoungChildOrTeenager and WishFurther to true, we get a contradiction? So we are forced to set at least one of them to false.

But the conclusion requires them true. Therefore, in this case we cannot have YoungChildOrTeenager and WishFurther both true. So the conclusion fails.

Case: The premise is the second disjunct: (¬Chaperones → PerformsOften). This is equivalent to Chaperones ∨ PerformsOften.

But we have two subcases: either she is chaperone (then we are as above) OR if not, she performs often.

We are also free to set her as not chaperone? Then she must perform often.

Set:
  Chaperones Bonnie = false
  PerformsOften Bonnie = true  (by the implication)

Then by P1, she is engaged: AttendsEngaged Bonnie = true.
By P6, she is a student: IsStudent Bonnie = true.

We don't know about inactive. By P2: we have two possibilities.

If we set InactiveDisinterested Bonnie = false, that's consistent (since P2 says either, so having PerformsOften true and inactive false is okay).

Now, we require the conclusion: YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie and WishFurther Bonnie and InactiveDisinterested. We have set inactive to false, so the inactive condition fails.

So in both models we have:
  Model 1 (chaperone): Bonnie is inactive but not young and not wishing (or at least not both) -> the conclusion fails because we don't have young and wish both true.
  Model 2 (performs often): Bonnie is active, not inactive, and again we haven't forced young and wish.

Therefore, the theorem is not provable.

But note: in the formulation, the premise is an OR. In model 1, we are using the first disjunct (chaperone). In model 2, we are using the second disjunct and then given that she is not chaperone, she performs often. In model 2, she is not inactive (we set inactive to false, and we have PerformsOften which is the other disjunct of P2). So inactive fails. In model 1, we have inactive but the other two conditions are not forced.

Hence, we conclude that the theorem is not provable.

But wait, what if in the non-performer case (inactive) we set Bonnie to be young and wish to further? Then we get from P5 that she is a student. But if she is inactive, she is a chaperone (P4) and then by P3 she is not a student. Contradiction. Therefore, in the inactive case, we cannot set both Young and Wish. So we have no model where the inactive case satisfies Young and Wish and Inactive? That means we cannot have the conclusion in that branch.

Similarly, in the performer case, we are not given any axioms that active performers are young and wish to further? So we don't get that.

Therefore, the theorem is actually false? Or at least not provable.

But note: we are supposed to replace the sorry. However, the theorem might not hold. The task says: replace sorry with a valid proof term. But if it is not true, we cannot. However, the instruction says: Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration. It says validated, so perhaps we are to assume the axioms are consistent and the theorem is true? But in this case, our analysis shows it might not be.

But let me double check the axioms and the conclusion.

Perhaps there is a way to derive the desired properties. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, the premise might be stronger than I thought:

Consider the premise: (Chaperones Bonnie ∨ (¬Chaperones Bonnie → PerformsOften Bonnie))

This is equivalent to: Chaperones Bonnie ∨ PerformsOften Bonnie   (because ¬A → B  is equivalent to A ∨ B).

So the premise is: Chaperones Bonnie ∨ PerformsOften Bonnie.

So we are given:
   Case 1: Chaperones Bonnie.
   Case 2: PerformsOften Bonnie.

But note: if she is a chaperone, then she is not a student and we can derive she must be inactive (by the contradiction argument: if she performed often she would be a student, but she is not, so by P2 she must be inactive). So we get inactive.

But we still need Young and Wish. We have no links.

If she performs often, then she is engaged (P1) and then a student (P6). But we don't have an axiom that says if she performs often then she is not chaperone? Actually, if she is not chaperone, that's fine. But we have the inactive part to prove? In this case we don't have inactive. In fact, she is performing, so P2 says she is not inactive? Actually, P2 says it's either, not that they are exclusive. But in the performer case, we don't have evidence for inactive. So we cannot get inactive. And also, we still don't get Young and Wish.

Therefore, we cannot prove the conclusion.

Thus, it seems that the theorem is unprovable from these axioms. So we might have to say that we cannot complete the proof.

But the task says: Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry' ... replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term. But if it's not valid, we cannot.

But note: the axiom set may be validated and the theorem may be true? But we've constructed two countermodels above.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed something. Let me try to derive the necessary properties.

In the case of Bonnie being a chaperone: 
  We have: Chaperones Bonnie -> ¬IsStudent Bonnie.
  Then, because she is a chaperone (case 1) we get inactive (as argued by P2: she must be inactive because if she performed, then she would be engaged and then student - contradiction).
  So we have InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.

  How can we get YoungChildOrTeenager and WishFurther? We don't have them.

In the case of Bonnie performing often:
  PerformsOften Bonnie -> AttendsEngaged Bonnie (P1) -> IsStudent Bonnie (P6)
  Now, we want her to be inactive, but we have just assumed she performs often, so she is active. How can she be inactive? That would be both. But we already argued that performing often and being inactive leads to a contradiction? Because being inactive leads to chaperone (P4), then not a student. But performing often leads to being a student by P1 and P6. So indeed, they are mutually exclusive? So she cannot be both, and by P2 she is one or the other. If she performs often, then she is not inactive.

  Therefore, we cannot get inactive in this case.

But the conclusion requires her to be inactive.

Therefore, in the first branch we have inactive but not young and wish, in the second branch we have not inactive. So the theorem is not provable.

Therefore, the answer is that we cannot provide a proof. But note: the task is to replace sorry with a valid proof term. Since there is no proof, we might mark it as uncertain. However, the instructions say to provide the complete code, so perhaps we can use a proof by cases with the disjunction and then in each case use `exfalso` or something?

But without additional axioms, we are stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the case of chaperone?

We have:
  Assume Chaperones Bonnie.
  Then by P3: not a student.
  We want to prove Inactive: by P2, suppose she performed often. Then by P1: engaged, then by P6: student -> contradiction with not a student. Therefore, she cannot perform often. Then by P2, she must be inactive. So we have InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.

  So we have that.

  Now, we need Young and Wish. How?

  We have no axiom that forces a chaperone to be anything in particular regarding young or wish.

Similarly, in the case she performs often: we get that she is not chaperone (by P3 and P6: she is a student, and chaperones are not students -> if she were chaperone she would not be a student, contradiction). Therefore, she is not chaperone.

  In this case we have: PerformsOften, Engaged, Student.

  And we can have: not chaperone. But the conclusion requires inactive? Which would require Inactive. But if she is inactive, we get (from P4) chaperone, which we just don't have. Also, we have PerformsOften, which by P1 gives engaged, and then student, and if she were inactive we get chaperone -> not student -> contradiction. So she cannot be inactive. Therefore, we have to set inactive to false. So we don't have inactive.

Hence, we cannot prove inactive in the performing case.

Therefore, the required inactive part is only proved in the first case, but the other two parts are not proved in either case.

So the entire conclusion (which is a conjunction) is not forced.

Thus, we cannot prove it.

We might try to derive a contradiction from the premises? But the premises are consistent because we built a model.

So our answer: Uncertain (since the theorem is not provable, but we are not sure if that is intentional).

Given the instructions, however, we must output either a proof or give an opinion at the end.

But the problem says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

So we can say Uncertain.

But how to write the Lean code? We cannot complete the proof. But the task says to replace sorry with a valid proof term. We cannot, so we have to leave it sorry? That would be invalid. Or we might use a tactic that gets stuck.

Alternatively, we can try to write a proof that covers the only case that is possible? In both cases we get InactiveDisinterested only in the first case. And we cannot get the conjunction of three when the first case cannot give the first two requirements and the second case cannot give the third.

But it gets worse: the conclusion requires all three in every case.

So we must be able to prove each one in every case. The conclusion is:

  YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie ∧ WishFurther Bonnie ∧ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie

We did show that in the first case we have inactive, but not the other two. In the second case we have active and not the other two? Actually, we haven't proved either of the other two in either case.

Therefore, the theorem is not provable.

ANSWER: Uncertain

But Lean requires a proof. How can we write a proof for something that is not true? We cannot.

However, the instruction says: "CRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax." and we have to replace sorry. Since the theorem is not valid, we might raise a contradiction? We simply cannot.

Another possibility: maybe the axioms are inconsistent? But we are told they are validated.

We are stuck.

So I will output the code with sorry and say Uncertain.

However, upon second thought, the problem might have been that we didn't generate the correct proof. Let me try one more time:

Let H0 be the premise: (Chaperones Bonnie ∨ (¬Chaperones Bonnie → PerformsOften Bonnie))

We know that this is the same as: Chaperones Bonnie ∨ PerformsOften Bonnie.

Now, by P2: Bonnie is either PerformsOften or InactiveDisinterested.

Case I: PerformsOften Bonnie.
   Then H0 holds by the second disjunct (since PerformsOften is True).
   Then we have:
     InactiveDisinterested Bonnie? But by P2, we have exactly one or the other? The axiom doesn't say exclusive. So she could be both? Actually, it says OR which in logic is not exclusive unless we have contradictions.

   But let me check: 
        If Bonnie is both PerformsOften and InactiveDisinterested, then by P4 she is chaperone, and by P3 not a student, and by P1 she is engaged and by P6 she is a student -> contradiction.

   Therefore, they are exclusive? From the axioms, we can prove that:

        ∀ c, ¬(PerformsOften c ∧ InactiveDisinterested c)

        Because if for any c, both hold, then:
           InactiveDisinterested c -> Chaperones c (P4) -> ¬IsStudent c (P3)
           PerformsOften c -> AttendsEngaged c (P1) -> IsStudent c   (by P6? wait, P6 is for Bonnie only? 

        Oh! P6 is only for Bonnie: 
            P6: AttendsEngaged Bonnie → IsStudent Bonnie

        But we are considering c in general? But the general case may not have P6 for every c? However, the theorem is only about Bonnie.

   For Bonnie, if she were both inactive and performs often, then we would have:
        InactiveDisinterested Bonnie -> Chaperones Bonnie (P4) -> ¬IsStudent Bonnie (P3)
        PerformsOften Bonnie -> AttendsEngaged Bonnie (P1) -> IsStudent Bonnie (P6) -> contradiction.

   So for Bonnie, we cannot have both. Therefore, by P2 we have an exclusive OR for Bonnie.

   Therefore, if PerformsOften Bonnie, then not InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.

   In case I of the premise (where we have PerformsOften Bonnie), we cannot have InactiveDisinterested Bonnie -> so then the conclusion which requires InactiveDisinterested Bonnie is false.

Case II: Chaperones Bonnie.
   Then as before, we get not student, then cannot perform often (because that gives student) -> then by P2 she must be inactive. 
        So we have InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.
   But we also need YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie and WishFurther Bonnie? How?
        If she is young and wishes to further, then by P5 she is a student -> contradiction.
        So we cannot have both? We need to prove both true, but that would yield a contradiction.

   So in this case, we have InactiveDisinterested Bonnie, but we don't have the other two and in fact their conjunction would be contradictory.

In both cases, we get that at least one of the three components is false in the required conjunction. Specifically:
   In case I: inactive is false.
   In case II: if we had both young and wish further, we would get a contradiction (but we can still avoid that by having at least one false? But the conclusion requires both true and inactive in the same time). 

So we can never get the entire conjunction true.

Therefore, the theorem is actually false. But we have the premise? And we are to prove a conclusion that is always false? 

But wait, in the second case, the conclusion not only requires Inactive (which we have) but also Young and WishFurther. And we just argued that you can't have Young and WishFurther in the same time as being a chaperone? That might not be a problem because we could set them true? But then we would be a student by P5, which contradicts the fact of being a chaperone (which implies not student). 

And if we set them false, then we have 

   YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie = false, WishFurther Bonnie = false, and Inactive = true.

Then the conjunction is false.

So in both cases the conclusion is false? Then the entire implication would be true only if the premise is false. That is, we should be able to prove that the premise leads to a contradiction? 

But what do we know? The premises. The premise of the theorem is true? But our model showed we can have the premise without the conclusion.

We built:
   Model 1: Bonnie is chaperone (so the premise is true) -> then inactive -> and then we set young to false and wish to false, then the conclusion (false∧false∧true) is false.
   So the implication (premise and not conclusion) holds.

   Model 2: Bonnie performs often. -> then we set chaperone=false, so the premise holds (because performs often is true? or by the disjunctive form). And conclusion is false because inactive=false (and the other two can be set arbitrarily, but they don't have to be true).

   But wait: the conclusion requires three things: you need the inactive to be true for the third part. We have inactive=false in the second model, so one of the three is false, so the conjunction is false.

   So the implication from the premise to the conclusion is false: there are assignment to the predicates that make the premise true and the conclusion false.

   Therefore the theorem is invalid.

Hence, ANSWER: False

But the theorem as stated is supposed to be proved. How can we output a proof?

However, the task says: replace sorry with a valid proof term. But if it's not true, there is no valid proof term.

The instruction says: Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'. We might interpret that there is a proof! Perhaps I missed it.

Let me see if there is a proof.

Premise: CB ∨ (¬CB → PO)   [CB: Chaperones Bonnie, PO: PerformsOften Bonnie]

We know:
   if CB, then by P4: inac leads to chaperone, but we already have chaperone so that's redundant. 
   Then by P3: not student.
   Then by P2: not PO because if PO, then by P1 engaged, then by P6 student -> contradiction. So not PO. 
   Then by P2: Inactive.

   Now, we have Inactive.

   We need and the other two. How to derive them? I have no idea.

   Perhaps from WishFurther and/or Young? We don't have forward axioms.

 Alternatively, we might use the fact that the only way to get student is by being young and wishing further? But we have an axiom P5 that if young and wishing then student. But we also have student if engaged (P6), and engaged if performs often (P1). But currently, we are in CB and have not student and inactive.

   So we haven't derived student and we haven't derived young or wishing.

   So it seems impossible.

Given the analysis, I think it's safe to say the theorem is not true and they haven't provided enough axioms. Therefore, we output: ANSWER: False

But note: the answer for the final answer is: True/False/Uncertain - and this is about the truth of the theorem? Or whether the theorem is provable? 

But the theorem is false in the sense that it is not logically valid under the axioms. So our output should be: ANSWER: False

We then output the code with an of course, we cannot provide a proof, so we might have to leave the sorry or provide a proof of false? not yet.>

 But wait, perhaps there is a proof of the negation of the theorem? Or not.

 I think we are to assert whether the theorem as stated is true (i.e., valid under the axioms) or false or uncertain. Our answer: False.

And in the code, since we cannot write a proof for it, we cannot, so we rely on the answer. But for the code, we must output something. We output the same code with sorry.

Since the problem says "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced", but we can't. Thus, it's a dilemma.

But note theEXAMPLE true: they provided a complete proof.

 Alternatively, we risk that might have a proof that we overseen? But based on the time, I think not.

 So I will output the code unchanged (with sorry) and then ANSWER: False.

 This is not strictly following the task, as the task says to replace sorry. But if we can't, then we have to admit it.

 Or, we can use an initial proof using `exfalso` and show that the premises lead to a contradiction? They don't, because we have models.

=== RESPONSE ===
After analyzing the axioms and the theorem, it is determined that the theorem `conclusion` is not provable from the given axioms. The reasoning is as follows:

1. **Premise**: The theorem assumes that Bonnie is either a chaperone or, if not a chaperone, she performs often. This is logically equivalent to `Chaperones Bonnie ∨ PerformsOften Bonnie`.

2. **Case 1: Chaperones Bonnie**  
   - By `P3`, Bonnie is not a student (`¬IsStudent Bonnie`).  
   - If Bonnie performed often, then by `P1`, she would be engaged (`AttendsEngaged Bonnie`), and by `P6`, she would be a student, contradicting `P3`. Thus, she cannot perform often (`¬PerformsOften Bonnie`).  
   - By `P2`, Bonnie must be inactive (`InactiveDisinterested Bonnie`).  
   - However, the axioms provide no way to derive `YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie` or `WishFurther Bonnie`. If both were true, `P5` would imply Bonnie is a student, contradicting `¬IsStudent Bonnie`.

3. **Case 2: PerformsOften Bonnie**  
   - By `P1`, Bonnie is engaged (`AttendsEngaged Bonnie`), and by `P6`, she is a student (`IsStudent Bonnie`).  
   - By `P3`, she cannot be a chaperone (`¬Chaperones Bonnie`).  
   - However, `PerformsOften Bonnie` and `InactiveDisinterested Bonnie` are mutually exclusive for Bonnie because inactivity (via `P4`) implies chaperoning (contradicting `¬Chaperones Bonnie`), and performing often implies she is a student, while chaperones cannot be students. Thus, Bonnie cannot be inactive.  
   - Again, there are no axioms forcing `YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie` or `WishFurther Bonnie`.

In both cases, the conclusion `YoungChildOrTeenager Bonnie ∧ WishFurther Bonnie ∧ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie` cannot be proven. Since the axioms do not provide sufficient information to derive Bonnie being young or wishing to further academics in either case, and the inactive requirement is unprovable in the second case, the theorem is **False**.
