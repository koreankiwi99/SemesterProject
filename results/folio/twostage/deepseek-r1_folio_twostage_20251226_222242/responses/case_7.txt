STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the following:

Premises:
1. When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox.
   Let's interpret: If the Monkeypox virus is present in a being, then that being may get Monkeypox.
   We'll have:
     - A predicate: MonkeypoxVirusIn : obj → Prop   (for a being, the virus is in them)
     - A predicate: HasMonkeypox : obj → Prop       (the being has the disease Monkeypox)

   Then: ∀ x, MonkeypoxVirusIn x → HasMonkeypox x   [Note: the word "may" might suggest possibility, but in logical translation for this context, we'll treat it as a conditional.]

2. Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals.
   This tells us that there are animals that can have the virus. We'll need:
     - Animal : obj → Prop
   Then: ∃ x, Animal x ∧ MonkeypoxVirusIn x

3. Humans are mammals.
   Mammals are animals.

   So:
     - Human : obj → Prop
     - Mammal : obj → Prop
     - Animal : obj → Prop

   Axioms:
     ∀ x, Human x → Mammal x
     ∀ x, Mammal x → Animal x

4. Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.
   We could introduce symptoms, but note that the conclusion is about the flu and tiredness.
   We are particularly interested in tiredness.

   We'll define:
     - HasSymptom : obj → symptom → Prop   (but we might not need all symptoms)

   Alternatively, since only tiredness is used later, we can have:
     - HasTiredness : obj → Prop   (the being experiences tiredness)

   And then: ∀ x, HasMonkeypox x → HasTiredness x

5. People feel tired when they get the flu.
   "When they get the flu" meaning if they have the flu, then they feel tired.

   We define:
     - HasFlu : obj → Prop
     - Axiom: ∀ x, Human x → (HasFlu x → HasTiredness x)   [Note: it says "people", so we restrict to humans?]

   However, the premise says "People feel tired when they get the flu." So it is about humans.

Conclusion: No one gets the flu.
   Which is: ¬∃ x, Human x ∧ HasFlu x   OR   ∀ x, Human x → ¬HasFlu x

But note: the conclusion is about the absence of flu in humans? Or in general? The premise about flu is only for people (humans). The conclusion is about "no one", which in context might mean no human.

So: ∀ x : Human x → ¬HasFlu x

Now, let's put it together.

We note: the argument might be trying to show that the flu doesn't occur because otherwise tiredness would be a symptom that is confused? But the premises do not state any contradiction. 

However, we are not proving, just formalizing.

But we have to be cautious: the conclusion is that no one (no human) gets the flu.

We are to formalize the premises as axioms and the conclusion as a theorem.

Steps:

Define types and predicates.

We'll have:
  obj : Type   (for beings: humans, animals)

Predicates:
  Human : obj → Prop
  Mammal : obj → Prop
  Animal : obj → Prop
  MonkeypoxVirusIn : obj → Prop
  HasMonkeypox : obj → Prop
  HasTiredness : obj → Prop
  HasFlu : obj → Prop

Axioms:
  P1: ∀ x, MonkeypoxVirusIn x → HasMonkeypox x
  P2: ∃ x, Animal x ∧ MonkeypoxVirusIn x
  P3: ∀ x, Human x → Mammal x
  P4: ∀ x, Mammal x → Animal x
  P5: ∀ x, HasMonkeypox x → HasTiredness x
  P6: ∀ x, Human x → (HasFlu x → HasTiredness x)

Theorem: ∀ x, Human x → ¬HasFlu x

But note: we don't have any connection that would cause a contradiction? Actually, the conclusion might not follow from the premises? Again, we are not proving, but formalizing.

Alternatively, the argument might be that if someone has the flu, they would have tiredness, but also if they have monkeypox they have tiredness. But there's no statement that tiredness only comes from one source? And we also don't have that humans can get monkeypox? 

We have that monkeypox virus occurs in certain animals. Then humans are mammals and mammals are animals. So if the monkeypox virus is in animals, and humans are animals, does that imply humans can have the virus? The premise says it occurs in certain animals, but not necessarily all. And we are not told that humans are among the animals that can get the virus.

But note: we have no axiom linking humans to monkeypox virus. So we cannot conclude that humans get monkeypox.

Therefore, in formalizing, we just write the axioms as given without filling gaps.

Let's write the code.

Important: We are not allowed to generate proofs, just the theorem with `sorry`.

Also, we note that the premise 5 says "People feel tired when they get the flu", so we interpret that as for humans, having the flu implies tiredness.

Conclusion: No one (no human) gets the flu: so for any human, they do not have the flu.

We'll write:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom MonkeypoxVirusIn : obj → Prop
axiom HasMonkeypox : obj → Prop
axiom HasTiredness : obj → Prop
axiom HasFlu : obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, MonkeypoxVirusIn x → HasMonkeypox x
axiom P2 : ∃ x : obj, Animal x ∧ MonkeypoxVirusIn x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Human x → Mammal x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, Mammal x → Animal x
axiom P5 : ∀ x : obj, HasMonkeypox x → HasTiredness x
axiom P6 : ∀ x : obj, Human x → (HasFlu x → HasTiredness x)

-- Conclusion: No one gets the flu (meaning: for all humans, they do not have the flu)
theorem goal : ∀ x : obj, Human x → ¬ HasFlu x := sorry
</lean>

But note: the conclusion is ambiguous. It says "no one gets the flu". In the context, "people" and "humans" are used interchangeably? And the premise about flu is about people. So the conclusion likely means no human gets the flu.

However, if we were to be more general, we might interpret "no one" as for all humans. We don't have any other "person" concept.

Alternatively, we could have a predicate for "Person" but the problem says "People" and "Humans". So we have used Human.

We have not used P2 in the theorem, but that's okay because we are just formalizing the premises and the conclusion.

Let me check: in the example, they defined specific objects like "Cat", but here we have general quantifiers. That's because the premises are general.

Another note: The premise 2 states that there exists an animal with the virus, but we don't specify which, so that's fine.

We'll go with this.

IMPORTANT: The problem says "Conclusion to formalize: No one gets the flu." and we formalize that as no human has the flu.

But note: in the context, the beings that get the flu are people (humans). So it's consistent.

Therefore, we output:


=== RESPONSE ===
The formalization uses predicates and axioms to represent the premises and the conclusion as a theorem. Here's the Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom Being : Type

axiom MonkeypoxVirusIn : Being → Prop
axiom HasMonkeypox : Being → Prop
axiom Animal : Being → Prop
axiom Mammal : Being → Prop
axiom Human : Being → Prop
axiom HasTiredness : Being → Prop
axiom HasFlu : Being → Prop

-- Premises
axiom virus_leads_to_disease : ∀ (b : Being), MonkeypoxVirusIn b → HasMonkeypox b
axiom virus_in_animals : ∃ (b : Being), Animal b ∧ MonkeypoxVirusIn b
axiom humans_are_mammals : ∀ (h : Being), Human h → Mammal h
axiom mammals_are_animals : ∀ (m : Being), Mammal m → Animal m
axiom monkeypox_symptoms : ∀ (b : Being), HasMonkeypox b → HasTiredness b
axiom flu_causes_tiredness : ∀ (p : Being), Human p → (HasFlu p → HasTiredness p)

-- Conclusion: No one (no human) gets the flu
theorem no_one_gets_flu : ¬∃ (h : Being), Human h ∧ HasFlu h := sorry
</lean>

**Key details:**
1. `Being` represents entities that can contract diseases
2. Predicates capture properties:
   - `MonkeypoxVirusIn`: Presence of virus
   - Disease states: `HasMonkeypox`/`HasFlu`
   - Biological categories: `Animal`, `Mammal`, `Human`
   - Symptom: `HasTiredness`
3. Premises directly translate to axioms:
   - Virus presence implies disease
   - Virus exists in animals
   - Human → Mammal → Animal hierarchy
   - Monkeypox causes tiredness
   - Flu causes tiredness in humans
4. Theorem formalizes "No one gets flu" as negation of existence (`¬∃`) of humans with flu

Note: The conclusion is intentionally formalized as `¬∃ (h), Human h ∧ HasFlu h` to capture "no human has the flu". The `sorry` placeholder indicates the proof is not provided.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and a theorem statement that we must prove: no_one_gets_flu : ¬∃ (h : Being), Human h ∧ HasFlu h

Let's analyze the premises:

1. virus_leads_to_disease : ∀ (b : Being), MonkeypoxVirusIn b → HasMonkeypox b
   If a being has the Monkeypox virus, then it has Monkeypox.

2. virus_in_animals : ∃ (b : Being), Animal b ∧ MonkeypoxVirusIn b
   There exists an animal that has the Monkeypox virus.

3. humans_are_mammals : ∀ (h : Being), Human h → Mammal h
   Every human is a mammal.

4. mammals_are_animals : ∀ (m : Being), Mammal m → Animal m
   Every mammal is an animal.

5. monkeypox_symptoms : ∀ (b : Being), HasMonkeypox b → HasTiredness b
   If a being has Monkeypox, then it has tiredness.

6. flu_causes_tiredness : ∀ (p : Being), Human p → (HasFlu p → HasTiredness p)
   For human beings, if they have the flu, then they have tiredness.

The conclusion is: no human gets the flu, meaning there does not exist a human who has the flu.

However, let's see what we can deduce:

From virus_in_animals, we know there is some animal, say a, that has MonkeypoxVirus.
Then by virus_leads_to_disease, a has Monkeypox (HasMonkeypox a).
Then by monkeypox_symptoms, a has tiredness (HasTiredness a).

But note: we have no information that links tiredness to any contradiction. In fact, there is nothing in the premises that says that having tiredness is exclusive or that having the flu would be in conflict with having monkeypox. Moreover, the premises do not say that the animal that has monkeypox is not a human. In fact, it could be that the animal is a human? But humans are mammals and mammals are animals, so a human is an animal.

But note: the conclusion is about the flu. The flu_causes_tiredness only applies to humans. The tiredness symptom from monkeypox applies to anyone with monkeypox, which could be an animal that is not necessarily a human.

We also note that the premises do not say that if you have tiredness then you have monkeypox or the flu. And they do not say that monkeypox and the flu are exclusive.

Moreover, consider the possibility: a human might have monkeypox and not the flu, and that is consistent with the premises. Similarly, a human might have the flu (which gives tiredness) and that would be consistent as long as the tiredness is explained? But note the premises do not say that tiredness only comes from one source.

Therefore, the conclusion "no one (human) gets the flu" does not follow from these premises.

In fact, to prove the negation of an existence (¬∃ h, ...) we must show that assuming there exists such an h leads to a contradiction.

Assume there exists a human h0 that has the flu. Then by flu_causes_tiredness, h0 has tiredness. But that is not a contradiction by itself: having tiredness is also possible from monkeypox, but we don't know that h0 has monkeypox, and even if so, that's not a contradiction because nothing says you can't have both.

Moreover, we know there is an animal (which might be a human or not) with monkeypox and therefore tiredness. That does not affect h0.

So we cannot derive a contradiction.

Therefore, the theorem as stated is not provable from the premises. However, the task is to replace the `sorry` with a proof if we can, or if not, we must note it.

But note: the instruction says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry', your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof."

However, if the theorem is not provable, we cannot provide a valid proof. But let me check again:

Perhaps there's a hidden contradiction. Let me assume we have a human with the flu, then derive tiredness for that human. But we also have the existence of an animal with monkeypox, which gives tiredness. But that doesn't contradict anything. The premises do not say that tiredness is a symptom that only one disease can cause, and they don't say anything about the flu being exclusive with monkeypox.

Therefore, it is not possible to prove the theorem from the given axioms. So we must answer with Uncertain? But the task says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

However, note that the instruction for the theorem prover is to replace the sorry with a valid proof if we can. Since we cannot, we have two options:

1. We cannot complete the code with a valid proof because it's impossible.
2. But the task says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'", and it implies that the proof can be completed? But in this case, it might be that the theorem is false.

But wait: the theorem states "no one (no human) gets the flu", meaning ¬∃ (h:Being), Human h ∧ HasFlu h.

From the premises, we cannot infer that. So it's not provable.

However, note that the premises do have an existence: there's an animal with monkeypox. But that animal is not necessarily human. Even if an animal (which might be human) has monkeypox, we still don't have any information that would prevent a human from having the flu.

Therefore, the theorem cannot be proven. But the problem says "your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof" — meaning we must find a proof? But if we cannot, then we have to be honest.

However, in an automated theorem proving setting, we are expected to find a proof when one exists. When one does not exist, we might get stuck. But the user has provided a theorem declaration with sorry, and we are to replace it.

Given that the theorem is not provable, how can we write Lean code? We have two choices:

Option A: Admit that we cannot, and leave sorry? But that is not the task.

Option B: Realize that the user might have intended to ask for a Lean proof only if one exists, but otherwise we must say Uncertain.

Looking at the example: in the example, the theorem was provable and we provided a proof.

But here, we cannot. So after the code, we must provide an answer of "Uncertain". However, the code must still be provided? And what should we put in place of sorry? We might not be able to do anything.

But the format says: "Provide the complete code with proof".

Alternatively, note that the problem says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

So we can provide the code with the original sorry, but that is not complete. Or we can try a proof that leads to a contradiction but fail? In Lean, to prove ¬ P, we usually do `fun h => ...`, where h is the existential, and then we try to derive a contradiction. But since we cannot derive a contradiction, we would get stuck.

Given the requirement, we will try to prove it and see where we get stuck. But the answer should be "Uncertain".

But note: the problem says the code is validated. So the axioms are fixed.

Given that we cannot prove the theorem, we must output the code as is? But then we cannot replace sorry? Alternatively, we can output a proof that uses an impossible case? But we don't have one.

Perhaps we can write a proof with an admitted contradiction? But that would be cheating. The task requires a valid proof.

Therefore, we conclude that the theorem is not provable. So we report:

ANSWER: Uncertain

But we still have to output the code? The instruction says to provide the complete code with the proof. We cannot provide a valid proof. So we must leave it as sorry? But the task says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term".

However, since no valid proof term exists given the premises, then we must return the same code with sorry? But that would be incomplete. Alternatively, we could state that we cannot prove it and so we return no code? But that violates the requirement.

But note: the problem says "your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof". If we cannot, then we cannot.

Therefore, I think the appropriate response is:

We output the same code, but replace the sorry by a proof that we attempt, but that will require a case we cannot solve. But that is not valid.

Alternatively, we can use classical logic to do a proof by contradiction, but then we get:

Assume there exists a human with flu. We then can conclude that human has tiredness. But we also know there is an animal (which might be the same or different) with tiredness. Since there is no connection between these, we get stuck.

But we must be honest: the proof is impossible, so we cannot. Therefore, we must not change the sorry? But the task demands replacing sorry.

Given the conflict, let me try to derive a contradiction:

We have:

  virus_leads_to_disease (b) : MonkeypoxVirusIn b → HasMonkeypox b
  virus_in_animals : ∃ (b : Being), Animal b ∧ MonkeypoxVirusIn b
  humans_are_mammals (h) : Human h → Mammal h
  mammals_are_animals (m) : Mammal m → Animal m
  monkeypox_symptoms (b) : HasMonkeypox b → HasTiredness b
  flu_causes_tiredness (p) : Human p → HasFlu p → HasTiredness p

We assume: ∃ h, Human h ∧ HasFlu h (call this h0)

We want to derive a contradiction. How?

The only information we have is that we get a tiredness from two different sources? But that is not a contradiction.

Unless we can show that the human with the flu should not get tiredness? Or that the same human cannot get tiredness in two ways? Not implied.

Alternatively, perhaps if we could show that the animal that has monkeypox is the human, then having both monkeypox and the flu might be contradictory? But there is no axiom that says that having monkeypox implies not having the flu, or vice versa.

Therefore, we must conclude that the theorem is not provable. So we cannot replace sorry with a valid proof term.

However, perhaps there is a proof by showing that the existence of the flu in humans leads to some property that conflicts with something. However, I don't see any.

Therefore, I will provide the code with the same sorry and then in the answer say Uncertain? But the task says: "Replace sorry with a valid proof term".

But if we cannot, we must not pretend. Therefore, we need to discuss with the user.

However, the problem states: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

The answer "Uncertain" means that we are not sure whether the theorem is true? Or that it is unprovable? In this context, it probably means that the theorem is not logically implied by the premises (and we are uncertain of its truth value). But note: the theorem is about the given axioms. If it is not provable, then the truth value in the context of the axioms is not fixed: it could be true in some models and false in others.

But the premises are consistent with both:
- A model where there is a human with the flu (and also the animal with monkeypox is not that human, or even if it is the human, then the human has two diseases and is tired and it's consistent).
- A model where no human has the flu (then the theorem is true).

Therefore, we cannot prove the theorem. So the answer is: the theorem is not provable -> ANSWER: Uncertain.

But how to write the Lean code? We must not leave sorry? But we must follow the instruction to provide the complete code. We can write the proof using classical reasoning and then get stuck? Or use by_contradiction, and then inside use the existential, and then show that the human has tiredness, but then get stuck.

But to be precise, we can write a proof that goes as far as we can and then admit? But that would be invalid.

Alternatively, we can note that the premises are insufficient, and therefore we cannot complete the proof, but the task forces us to output code. Therefore, we output the same code without changing the sorry? That would be:

<lean>
... (same axioms and premises)
theorem no_one_gets_flu : ¬∃ (h : Being), Human h ∧ HasFlu h := sorry
</lean>

But then we haven't replaced sorry.

Another idea: Maybe we misread the theorem. The theorem is ¬∃ h, ... . We can try to prove that no such human exists. But as we have no contradiction, we fail.

Considering the premises, perhaps the user intended to express different relationships.

Therefore, the only ethical solution is to output the same code with sorry and then say Uncertain.

But the problem says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". Since we don't have a valid proof term, we cannot, so we return the code with sorry and then indicate Uncertain.

But the ANSWER part is outside the lean tags.

Let me write the code and then have the ANSWER.

However, the task says: "IMPORTANT: ... Provide the COMPLETE code with proof (not just the proof term)"

If we cannot provide a proof, then we must not provide a proof term. So maybe we have to leave sorry and then say uncertain.

Therefore, I will output:

</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

But this solution does not replace the sorry. However, if we are allowed to use classical logic and proof by contradiction, we can start a proof by:

theorem no_one_gets_flu : ¬∃ (h : Being), Human h ∧ HasFlu h := by
  intro h_exists
  cases h_exists with
  | intro h hpf => 
    have has_tiredness_h : HasTiredness h := flu_causes_tiredness h hpf.left hpf.right
    -- Now we need a contradiction. We don't have any.
    -- But we can also get information from virus_in_animals?
    cases virus_in_animals with
    | intro a h_anim =>
      have has_tiredness_a : HasTiredness a := 
        have h_monkey : MonkeypoxVirusIn a := h_anim.right
        have h_has_monkey : HasMonkeypox a := virus_leads_to_disease a h_monkey
        monkeypox_symptoms a h_has_monkey
      -- Now we have two beings (h and a) with tiredness, but that doesn't contradict anything.
      -- We also know that a is an animal, but we don't know if a is human or not.
      -- To derive a contradiction, we need to show that h is already the animal with monkeypox and then show that having both diseases leads to double tiredness? But it's not a problem.
      -- We have no axiom that says that if you are a human with the flu then you don't have monkeypox, or vice versa.
  -- So we cannot close the goal.

And that is as far as we get. So we would have to put a `sorry` inside. That leaves unsolved goals.

Therefore, we cannot complete the proof.

Given that, the only option is to leave the top-level sorry and answer Uncertain.

But the problem says: "replace sorry with a valid proof term", and if we cannot, then we cannot.

However, after re‐reading the problem: it says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'", which might imply that the theorem is provable? But we see no way.

Perhaps we are misinterpreting the conclusion. The conclusion is that "no one (human) gets the flu", which is negative. The premises are about monkeypox. They don't prevent the flu. So the theorem is not valid.

Therefore, the answer should be that the theorem is not provable and so we answer Uncertain.

So I write the code as above with the top-level sorry still there.

But we must provide a proof? Or be truthful.

Given the instructions, we output the code with sorry and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

Note: In the example, ANSWER: wasn't provided by the user, but the instruction says to provide it.

So:
