STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the following:

Premises:
1. When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox.
   We interpret this as: If a being has the Monkeypox virus, then it may get Monkeypox (i.e., it gets the disease).
   So we can say: Having the virus causes the disease.

2. Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals.
   This tells us that the virus can be present in animals (so we have a category of animals that can be infected).

3. Humans are mammals.
4. Mammals are animals.

5. Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.
   So, if someone has Monkeypox, then they have these symptoms.

6. People feel tired when they get the flu.
   This is separate: Having the flu causes tiredness.

Conclusion to formalize: Symptoms of Monkeypox include coughing.

We note that the conclusion is about Monkeypox including coughing as a symptom. However, note that the premises do not directly mention coughing. We are only formalizing the structure, so we don't need to prove it, but we need to set up the logical structure so that the conclusion can be stated.

We need to define:
- Types or categories: beings, animals, mammals, humans, viruses, diseases, etc.
- However, let's keep it simple with a type for beings (which includes animals and humans) and define properties.

We can do:

Let `Being` be a type (or `Animal`? but note humans and animals). Since we have animals and humans, and humans are mammals and mammals are animals, we can have:

  axiom Being : Type   -- representing all beings (maybe including animals and humans)

But note: the problem says "Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals", and then "Humans are mammals" and "Mammals are animals", so we can have a hierarchy.

Alternatively, we can have a type `Animal` and then a subtype (if we want) but in Lean we can use predicates. Since we are using axioms, we can define:

  axiom Being : Type
  axiom isAnimal : Being → Prop
  axiom isMammal : Being → Prop
  axiom isHuman : Being → Prop

But note: humans are mammals and mammals are animals, so:

  axiom A1 : ∀ b : Being, isHuman b → isMammal b
  axiom A2 : ∀ b : Being, isMammal b → isAnimal b

Now, about the virus:

We can define a property `HasMonkeypoxVirus : Being → Prop` meaning the being has the Monkeypox virus.

Then premise 1: If a being has the Monkeypox virus, then it gets the disease (Monkeypox). We'll define:

  axiom HasMonkeypox : Being → Prop   -- the disease

  axiom P1 : ∀ b : Being, HasMonkeypoxVirus b → HasMonkeypox b

Premise 2: Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals. This is already captured by the fact that we have `isAnimal b` and then there exists some animals that can have the virus? But existence is not directly stated. We can interpret it as: not all beings have the virus, but it can occur in some animals. However, we don't need an existential for the structure we are building for the conclusion. We can just note that the virus is defined for beings that are animals.

But the premise doesn't say that only animals can get the virus? So we leave it open.

Premise 5: Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.

We can define symptoms as properties of a being at a time? But the problem does not explicitly model time. We can abstract away time and just say: if a being has Monkeypox, then they exhibit certain symptoms.

So let's define:

  axiom Fever : Being → Prop
  axiom Headache : Being → Prop
  axiom MusclePains : Being → Prop
  axiom Tiredness : Being → Prop

  axiom P2 : ∀ b : Being, HasMonkeypox b → (Fever b ∧ Headache b ∧ MusclePains b ∧ Tiredness b)

But note: the conclusion is about coughing. We'll need:

  axiom Coughing : Being → Prop

Premise 6: People feel tired when they get the flu.

  axiom HasFlu : Being → Prop

  axiom P3 : ∀ b : Being, HasFlu b → Tiredness b

Now, what is the conclusion? "Symptoms of Monkeypox include coughing" meaning:

  ∀ b : Being, HasMonkeypox b → Coughing b

But note: we have no direct link from Monkeypox to coughing in the premises. That is the formalization of the conclusion.

However, note: the problem states "Conclusion to formalize". So we are only to formalize the structure of the argument, not to prove it.

Therefore, we set:

  theorem goal : ∀ b : Being, HasMonkeypox b → Coughing b := sorry

But wait: the original premises do not say anything about coughing in relation to Monkeypox. Also, note that flu is mentioned only with tiredness, not with coughing. So we don't have a link. However, the user has asked to formalize the premises and the conclusion. So we do exactly that.

So, we put together:

<lean>
axiom Being : Type

-- Animal and mammal hierarchies
axiom isAnimal : Being → Prop
axiom isMammal : Being → Prop
axiom isHuman : Being → Prop

axiom HumanIsMammal : ∀ b : Being, isHuman b → isMammal b
axiom MammalIsAnimal : ∀ b : Being, isMammal b → isAnimal b

-- Monkeypox virus and disease
axiom HasMonkeypoxVirus : Being → Prop
axiom HasMonkeypox : Being → Prop

axiom VirusCausesDisease : ∀ b : Being, HasMonkeypoxVirus b → HasMonkeypox b

-- Premise 2 is about occurrence in animals. But we don't have a direct axiom about which beings can have the virus? 
-- But we can interpret that as: the virus only occurs in animals? Or that it can occur in some animals? 
-- The premise doesn't require an axiom for the conclusion. We might skip an explicit axiom for this.

-- Symptoms
axiom Fever : Being → Prop
axiom Headache : Being → Prop
axiom MusclePains : Being → Prop
axiom Tiredness : Being → Prop
axiom Coughing : Being → Prop

-- Premise 5: Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.
axiom MonkeypoxSymptoms : ∀ b : Being, HasMonkeypox b → 
  Fever b ∧ Headache b ∧ MusclePains b ∧ Tiredness b

-- Flu and tiredness
axiom HasFlu : Being → Prop
axiom FluCausesTiredness : ∀ b : Being, HasFlu b → Tiredness b

-- Conclusion: Symptoms of Monkeypox include coughing.
theorem goal : ∀ b : Being, HasMonkeypox b → Coughing b := sorry
</lean>

But note: the problem says "Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals". We haven't captured that. Should we? 

We might add:

  axiom VirusOccursInAnimals : ∃ b : Being, isAnimal b ∧ HasMonkeypoxVirus b

But the conclusion does not rely on an existence statement. Also, note that the existence of such beings is not needed to state the conclusion. Since the conclusion is universal (all beings with Monkeypox cough), and our theorem goal is a universal statement, we can omit the existence.

Alternatively, we might want to restrict the domain of beings that can get the virus? But the premises say that it occurs in animals, but also by the chain humans are mammals and mammals are animals, so humans are animals. Thus, we might not need an extra axiom because the existence is not used in the conclusion.

So we'll leave it as above.

However, note: the conclusion is specifically that Monkeypox includes coughing as a symptom. We have formalized that as: for any being, if it has Monkeypox then it is coughing.

This seems correct.

Let me check the formatting: we wrap in <lean> tags.

Important: We used `axiom` for all premises and `theorem` for the conclusion with `sorry`.

We did not use `λ` but instead used `fun ... =>`.


=== RESPONSE ===
The formalization captures the logical structure using axioms for premises and a theorem for the conclusion. Note that "Symptoms of Monkeypox include coughing" is formalized as a universal implication (`∀ b, HasMonkeypox b → Coughing b`).

<lean>
axiom Being : Type

-- Taxonomic hierarchies
axiom Animal : Being → Prop
axiom Mammal : Being → Prop
axiom Human : Being → Prop
axiom MammalIsAnimal : ∀ b : Being, Mammal b → Animal b
axiom HumanIsMammal : ∀ b : Being, Human b → Mammal b

-- Disease states
axiom HasMonkeypoxVirus : Being → Prop
axiom HasMonkeypox : Being → Prop
axiom HasFlu : Being → Prop

-- Symptoms
axiom Fever : Being → Prop
axiom Headache : Being → Prop
axiom MusclePains : Being → Prop
axiom Tiredness : Being → Prop
axiom Coughing : Being → Prop

-- Premises
axiom VirusCausesDisease : ∀ b : Being, HasMonkeypoxVirus b → HasMonkeypox b
axiom VirusOccursInAnimals : ∃ b : Being, Animal b ∧ HasMonkeypoxVirus b
axiom MonkeypoxSymptoms : ∀ b : Being, HasMonkeypox b → 
  Fever b ∧ Headache b ∧ MusclePains b ∧ Tiredness b
axiom FluCausesTiredness : ∀ b : Being, HasFlu b → Tiredness b

-- Formalized conclusion: "Symptoms include coughing"
theorem goal : ∀ b : Being, HasMonkeypox b → Coughing b := sorry
</lean>

Key decisions:
1. `Being` is the base type with taxonomic properties; mammals and humans are defined via predicates
2. Premise 1 became `VirusCausesDisease`
3. Premise 2 requires existence (`∃`) since it states the virus *can* occur in animals
4. Premise 5 is formalized with conjunction showing all symptoms follow from Monkeypox
5. Conclusion is formalized universally without presuming any direct link to premises


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and we are to prove the theorem:
  theorem goal : ∀ b : Being, HasMonkeypox b → Coughing b

Looking at the axioms, we have:
- VirusCausesDisease: If a being has the monkeypox virus, then it has monkeypox.
- VirusOccursInAnimals: There exists an animal that has the monkeypox virus.
- MonkeypoxSymptoms: If a being has monkeypox, then it has fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.
- FluCausesTiredness: If a being has the flu, then it is tired.

We also have taxonomic hierarchies:
- MammalIsAnimal: Every mammal is an animal.
- HumanIsMammal: Every human is a mammal.

However, note that the theorem we are to prove is that every being with monkeypox has coughing.

But looking at the symptoms listed in MonkeypoxSymptoms, coughing is not mentioned. The symptoms listed are fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.

Moreover, we have an axiom that the flu causes tiredness, but that does not connect to monkeypox causing coughing.

We also have no axiom that states that monkeypox causes coughing. Therefore, we cannot prove that having monkeypox implies coughing.

Additionally, the existence of an animal with the virus (VirusOccursInAnimals) does not help in proving a universal statement about symptoms.

Hence, the theorem as stated is not provable from the given axioms.

But let's double-check: Is there any way we can derive coughing from the given symptoms? The MonkeypoxSymptoms axiom lists four symptoms, and coughing is not one of them. There is no axiom that says monkeypox causes coughing, and there is no other link provided.

Therefore, we must conclude that the theorem is false. However, note that the problem asks for a proof term. Since we cannot prove it, we must mark it as false? But wait: the task says to replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term. If we cannot prove it, then we cannot provide a proof term.

But note: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

So we must decide: is the theorem true, false, or uncertain?

Given the axioms, we cannot prove the theorem. Moreover, we also cannot disprove it (i.e., show that there exists a being with monkeypox that does not have coughing) because we don't have enough information about the world. However, the problem is asking for a proof. Since we cannot provide a proof, and the theorem is not a consequence of the axioms, we must say that the theorem is false? Actually, the theorem might be false in the intended model. But note: the axioms do not force that monkeypox causes coughing, and they also do not say that coughing is not caused by monkeypox. So we are uncertain? However, in the context of logical reasoning, if we cannot prove it, then we cannot assert it.

But the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'", meaning we are to fill in the proof if possible. Since we cannot, we must indicate that.

However, note that the example provided a proof term because it was provable. Here, it is not.

Therefore, we must say that the theorem is false? But wait: the theorem is a universal statement. To show it false we would need a counterexample, which we don't have. So we are uncertain? Actually, the problem does not require us to prove the negation, but to provide a proof for the theorem. Since we cannot, we must indicate that the theorem is not provable (i.e., false in the sense that it does not follow) but the answer format is True/False/Uncertain.

Given the axioms, we have no information that would allow us to conclude coughing from monkeypox. Therefore, the theorem is not provable. However, the axioms do not contradict the theorem either. So we are uncertain? But note: the problem says "Formalized conclusion: 'Symptoms include coughing'". The axioms about monkeypox symptoms do not include coughing. So if the intended meaning is that coughing is a symptom of monkeypox, then the axioms are incomplete. But the problem states the axioms and asks for a proof.

Therefore, we must answer Uncertain? But let me see: the theorem is ∀ b, HasMonkeypox b → Coughing b. We have no axiom that says that monkeypox causes coughing, and we have no other way to deduce coughing. So we cannot prove it. Moreover, we cannot refute it without a counterexample. So the truth value is uncertain.

But note: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

However, we are expected to provide a proof term. Since we cannot, we must leave the theorem unproven? But the task says "replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". Since we cannot, we have to admit that we cannot.

But wait: perhaps we can use the fact that there exists an animal with the virus? But that doesn't give us a being with monkeypox and without coughing? It only gives one example that has the virus (and hence monkeypox by VirusCausesDisease) and then by MonkeypoxSymptoms we get tiredness, etc., but not coughing.

Alternatively, we might try to use the fact that flu causes tiredness, but that doesn't relate to monkeypox.

Therefore, we cannot prove the theorem.

So what should we do? The problem expects a complete Lean code. We cannot prove it, so we must leave it as sorry? But the task says to replace sorry with a valid proof term. Since we cannot, we must indicate that the theorem is false? But Lean does not allow us to prove false statements.

Alternatively, we can try to prove the negation? But the problem does not ask for that.

Given the instructions, I think we must be honest: we cannot prove it. Therefore, we should not change the sorry? But the task says to replace it.

But note: the problem says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'", meaning we are to fill in the proof if we can. Since we cannot, we must indicate that the theorem is not provable by answering Uncertain.

However, the problem expects a Lean code. We cannot provide a proof, so we leave the sorry? But that would violate the task. Alternatively, we can provide a proof of False? But that would be incorrect.

After re-examining the axioms, I notice that the MonkeypoxSymptoms axiom does not include coughing. Therefore, the theorem is not provable.

Therefore, we must answer Uncertain.

But how to represent that in the Lean code? We cannot prove it, so we must leave it as sorry? But the task says to replace sorry. However, we cannot. Therefore, we must write that we cannot prove it? But the task requires a Lean code.

Alternatively, we can prove it by contradiction? But we have no contradiction.

Or we can try to use the existence? But existence doesn't help for a universal.

Therefore, I conclude that the theorem is not provable. So we must answer Uncertain.

But the problem says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof." Since we don't have a proof, we cannot replace it. So we must leave it as sorry? But that would be against the task.

Alternatively, we can provide a proof that uses the existence to get a specific being and then try to derive coughing for that being? But even then, we don't have any axiom that says that animal with monkeypox has coughing? And we don't have coughing in the symptoms.

Therefore, we must admit that we cannot prove the universal statement.

So what to do? The instructions say: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

We will provide the same code but with the theorem still unproven? But the task says to replace sorry. However, since we cannot, we must leave it as sorry and then answer Uncertain.

But wait: the problem says "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". If we leave it as sorry, then we haven't replaced it. So we must provide something? But we cannot.

Alternatively, we can use `by_contradiction` and then get stuck? But that wouldn't be a proof.

Given the dilemma, I think the intended answer is that the theorem is false? But we don't have a counterexample.

Alternatively, note that the theorem says "Symptoms include coughing", but the MonkeypoxSymptoms axiom lists symptoms without coughing. So if we interpret the axioms as complete, then coughing is not a symptom. Therefore, the theorem is false.

But wait: the axioms might not be complete. However, in formal logic, we can only use what is given. And the given axioms do not allow us to prove coughing. Moreover, they do not say that these are the only symptoms. So we cannot conclude that coughing is not a symptom.

Therefore, we are uncertain.

But let me see the original problem: "Formalized conclusion: 'Symptoms include coughing'". The premises do not state that coughing is a symptom. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow. So the argument is invalid. But that doesn't make the theorem false; it just means we cannot prove it.

In the context of this exercise, since we are to prove the theorem and we cannot, we must answer Uncertain.

So I will write the same code and leave the theorem with sorry? But that violates the task. Alternatively, I can provide a proof that is not valid? But that would be wrong.

Given the above, I think the correct approach is to state that we cannot prove it and therefore answer Uncertain. But for the Lean code, we must leave it unproven. However, the task requires us to replace sorry.

But note: the example had a valid proof term. Here we don't. So we must not change the sorry? But the task says to replace it.

Alternatively, we can use `fun b h => ?` and then try to use the axioms? But we get stuck because we have no axiom for coughing.

Therefore, I decide to answer Uncertain and leave the proof as sorry? But that is not acceptable.

Another idea: perhaps we can use the flu axiom? But flu causes tiredness, and monkeypox also causes tiredness, but that doesn't give us coughing.

Therefore, I conclude that the theorem is not provable.

So I will write:

ANSWER: Uncertain

But for the Lean code, I cannot provide a proof. Therefore, I will leave the sorry and hope that the system understands.

Alternatively, I can provide a proof that uses `have` to get the symptoms from MonkeypoxSymptoms, but then we don't have coughing. So we cannot complete.

Given the constraints, I think the best is to leave the sorry and then answer Uncertain.

But the task says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof." Since we don't have a proof, we cannot replace it. So we must not change it? But then we haven't done the task.

Alternatively, we can provide a proof that is incorrect? But that would be dishonest.

After careful thought, I think the intended answer is that the theorem is false because coughing is not listed as a symptom in the axioms. Therefore, the conclusion is false.

But wait: the axioms do not say that these are the only symptoms. So it might be true in the real world, but based on the given axioms, we cannot prove it.

However, the problem says: "Formalized conclusion". The formalization of the conclusion is the theorem. And we are to prove it from the axioms. Since we cannot, the argument is invalid. But that doesn't make the theorem false.

Therefore, I think the answer is Uncertain.

But to satisfy the task, I will provide a proof that uses the existence of an animal with the virus to get a being, then use VirusCausesDisease to get monkeypox, then use MonkeypoxSymptoms to get the symptoms, but then we are stuck because we need coughing. So we cannot complete the proof.

So I will write:

</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

But note: this is not a complete proof. We still have sorry.

Alternatively, we can try to use the existence axiom? But it's an existence, not a universal. And it doesn't mention coughing.

Therefore, I think this is the best we can do.

But the task says to replace sorry with a valid proof term. We are not providing a valid proof term. So we are not following the task.

Given the above, I think the problem might have a typo or missing axiom. But as it is, we cannot prove it.

So I will output the code with the proof incomplete and answer Uncertain.

But to be precise, let's try to see if there is any way:

- We have FluCausesTiredness, but that doesn't help because we already have tiredness from monkeypox and it doesn't give coughing.
- We have taxonomic hierarchies, but they don't mention symptoms.

Therefore, no.

So final answer:

</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

But note: the problem says "complete code", and we have sorry. So it's not complete.

Alternatively, we can admit defeat and say we cannot prove it, so the answer is Uncertain.

I think that is the only honest answer.


=== RESPONSE ===
The given axioms do not provide any information that links `HasMonkeypox` to `Coughing`. The `MonkeypoxSymptoms` axiom explicitly lists fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness as symptoms, but does not include coughing. No other axiom establishes a connection between monkeypox and coughing. Therefore, the theorem `∀ b : Being, HasMonkeypox b → Coughing b` cannot be proven from the given premises.
