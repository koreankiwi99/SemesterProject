STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion. We need to define types and axioms for the objects and relations mentioned, and then state the conclusion as a theorem.

Steps:
1. We have entities: 
   - Diamond Mine (a stable)
   - Roderick Strong (a person)
   - Creed Brothers (a team? or individuals? but we are told they are included in Diamond Mine)
   - Ivy Nile (a person)
   - Imperium (another stable)

2. Relations and properties:
   - "Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE." -> We don't necessarily need an explicit axiom for this if we are just modeling the relations given. But note: we are told that Diamond Mine is a stable, and Imperium is having a feud with Diamond Mine. Also, the conclusion talks about "a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile". We might need a predicate for being a stable.

   However, looking at the conclusion: "Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile."

   We note that Diamond Mine is such a stable (because it includes Ivy Nile). But the conclusion is that Imperium does not have a feud with such a stable. However, from the premises we know that Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine. So we have to be cautious: maybe the conclusion is not about Diamond Mine? But the premises say that Diamond Mine includes Ivy Nile. Therefore, if the conclusion is to be true, we must interpret the conclusion as meaning that Imperium does not have a feud with ANY stable that includes Ivy Nile. But that would contradict the premise because they have a feud with Diamond Mine which includes Ivy Nile.

   There might be a misinterpretation. Alternatively, the natural language conclusion might be ambiguous. However, the problem says "conclusion to formalize", so we are to formalize the statement as given, regardless of whether it follows from the premises or not.

   Actually, the premises say: Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine, and Diamond Mine includes Ivy Nile. Therefore, it is false that Imperium doesn't have a feud with at least one stable that includes Ivy Nile (namely Diamond Mine). But the conclusion says that Imperium doesn't have a feud with any stable that includes Ivy Nile? Or with a particular one? The English is ambiguous.

   However, the conclusion says: "Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile." This is typically interpreted as: there does not exist a stable that includes Ivy Nile with which Imperium has a feud. But note: the premises tell us Diamond Mine is such a stable and they have a feud. So the conclusion, if interpreted as "there is no stable including Ivy Nile that Imperium feuds with", is false. 

   But the problem asks us to formalize the conclusion as stated. We are not to judge truth, just to represent the logical structure.

   Therefore, we formalize:

   Let S be a type for stables? Or we might have a more general type for objects? Since we have individuals (Roderick, Ivy) and stables (Diamond Mine, Imperium). Also, stable is a type? Or a property?

   How about:

   We'll have a type `entity` for everything? Then we'll define predicates:
   - `isStable : entity → Prop`
   - `leads : entity → entity → Prop`  (but note: Roderick leads Diamond Mine. So leads(Roderick, DiamondMine))
   - `includes : entity → entity → Prop`   (if a stable includes someone, then includes(stable, person) OR includes(stable, group)?)

   Alternatively, we might have:
   - A type for individuals and a type for stables? But then we have: Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile are included in Diamond Mine. Creed Brothers is a team? Or are they individuals? 

   Given the ambiguity, it might be simpler to have:

   We have a universe of entities. Some are stables, some are individuals (or groups). We don't necessarily need to distinguish them by type.

   So:

   - `axiom entity : Type`
   - `axiom DiamondMine : entity`  (constant)
   - `axiom RoderickStrong : entity`
   - `axiom CreedBrothers : entity`
   - `axiom IvyNile : entity`
   - `axiom Imperium : entity`

   Then we define predicates:
   - `isStable : entity → Prop`
   - `leads : entity → entity → Prop` (the first is the leader, the second the stable? Or the stable leads doesn't make sense. Only Roderick leads the stable. So: `leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine`)
   - `includes : entity → entity → Prop`   (if a stable includes an entity, then `includes stable entity`)

   Also, note: "Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile." So:
      `includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers`
      `includes DiamondMine IvyNile`

   And: "Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine" -> we need a relation `hasFeudWith : entity → entity → Prop`. But note: we only know about stables having feuds? But the relation may be between any two entities? However, the conclusion is about a stable and Imperium.

   Let's not overcomplicate: we can say:

   `axiom feud : entity → entity → Prop`

   Then the premise: `feud Imperium DiamondMine`

   But note: the conclusion is: "Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile."

   How to formalize:

   ¬ (∃ (s : entity), isStable s ∧ includes s IvyNile ∧ feud Imperium s)

   Alternatively: ∀ (s : entity), isStable s ∧ includes s IvyNile → ¬ feud Imperium s

   In classical logic, these are equivalent. Let's choose the existential form since it's closer to the negation in the natural language.

   However, note that the natural language says: "doesn't have a feud with a ...", meaning there is no stable of that kind with which it has a feud.

   Also, note: the premise says Diamond Mine is a stable? We have the axiom `isStable DiamondMine`. And `includes DiamondMine IvyNile`, and `feud Imperium DiamondMine`. Thus, we would have:

      ∃ (s : entity), isStable s ∧ includes s IvyNile ∧ feud Imperium s

   which is true. So the conclusion is ¬ ... exists ... which would be false. But our task is just to formalize it.

   We must also represent the premises:

   - "Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE." -> we capture only that it is a stable? So `isStable DiamondMine`.
   - "Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine." -> `leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine`
      However, note: does "leads" relate a person to a stable? We have not defined what can lead what. We'll assume that the first argument is an individual and the second is a stable? But we don't enforce that. We'll just use the relation as stated.
   - "Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile." -> `includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers` and `includes DiamondMine IvyNile`
   - "Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine." -> `feud Imperium DiamondMine`

   We are also told that "Diamond Mine" is a stable. We are not explicitly told that Imperium is a stable? But the conclusion is about a professional wrestling stable. So we don't necessarily need `isStable Imperium` unless it becomes relevant. For the conclusion, we are quantifying over stables. So we'll have:

   Conclusion: ¬ ∃ (s : entity), isStable s ∧ includes s IvyNile ∧ feud Imperium s

   Now, we write the Lean code.

   Let's define:

   - constants for entities: DiamondMine, RoderickStrong, CreedBrothers, IvyNile, Imperium
   - predicates: isStable, leads, includes, feud

   The axioms for the premises:

   P1: isStable DiamondMine
   P2: leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
   P3: includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
   P4: includes DiamondMine IvyNile
   P5: feud Imperium DiamondMine

   The theorem for the conclusion:

   theorem goal: ¬ ∃ (s : entity), isStable s ∧ includes s IvyNile ∧ feud Imperium s := sorry

   But note: the natural language also says "a professional wrestling stable", so we use `isStable`.

   However, there's a nuance: the premises say "professional wrestling stable" for Diamond Mine. The conclusion also uses "professional wrestling stable". Since we have the predicate `isStable`, we use that.

   But note: is Ivy Nile an individual or could she be a stable? And Creed Brothers? We have not defined any other stables. But we also haven't said that individuals cannot be stables. However, the context is clear that we are including individuals in the stable. So we might want to have:

   - `isStable` only for those entities that are stables.

   But we don't need to enforce disjointness.

   Now, note: the conclusion is about Imperium having a feud with a stable that includes Ivy Nile. It doesn't say anything about Creed Brothers. So we focus on Ivy Nile.

   Final structure:

   <lean>
   axiom entity : Type

   -- Constants
   axiom DiamondMine : entity
   axiom RoderickStrong : entity
   axiom CreedBrothers : entity
   axiom IvyNile : entity
   axiom Imperium : entity

   -- Predicates
   axiom isStable : entity → Prop
   axiom leads : entity → entity → Prop
   axiom includes : entity → entity → Prop
   axiom feud : entity → entity → Prop

   -- Premises
   axiom P1 : isStable DiamondMine
   axiom P2 : leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
   axiom P3 : includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
   axiom P4 : includes DiamondMine IvyNile
   axiom P5 : feud Imperium DiamondMine

   -- Conclusion: Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile.
   theorem goal : ¬ ∃ (s : entity), isStable s ∧ includes s IvyNile ∧ feud Imperium s := sorry
   </lean>

   However, note: the feud relation might not be symmetric? The problem says "has a feud with", which is symmetric? But we don't know. In the premise, we have `feud Imperium DiamondMine`. In the conclusion, we have `feud Imperium s`. So we are consistent.

   But note: the conclusion says "feud with a professional wrestling stable", so the stable is the object. We wrote `feud Imperium s` which matches the premise `feud Imperium DiamondMine`.

   This should be acceptable.

   However, let's note that the natural language might be interpreted as: there is no stable that includes Ivy Nile and that Imperium has a feud with. The formalization captures that.

   We use `¬ ∃` for "doesn't have a feud with any such stable".

   One more note: the English could be interpreted as: there is a stable that includes Ivy Nile and with which Imperium does not have a feud. But that is a different statement.

   However, the typical interpretation of the English sentence "X doesn't have a feud with a Y" in the context of a universal denial is that there is no such Y that X has a feud with. But note: the "doesn't have" is negating the entire action. The meaning is:

      It is not the case that there exists a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile and that Imperium has a feud with.

   So our formalization is correct.

   We'll write accordingly.

   One issue: The Creed Brothers might be a stable? But the premises don't say that. We are told that Diamond Mine is a stable and includes them. So we don't need `isStable CreedBrothers` (and in fact, we are not told they are a stable).

   Now, we code accordingly.

   IMPORTANT: The conclusion might not hold from the premises (as we see a counterexample with DiamondMine). But we are not required to prove it, just to formalize, so we use `sorry`.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion provided, here's the Lean 4 formalization:

<lean>
axiom Entity : Type

-- Specific entities
axiom DiamondMine : Entity
axiom RoderickStrong : Entity
axiom CreedBrothers : Entity
axiom IvyNile : Entity
axiom Imperium : Entity

-- Predicates
axiom ProfessionalWrestlingStable : Entity → Prop
axiom Leads : Entity → Entity → Prop
axiom Includes : Entity → Entity → Prop
axiom HasFeudWith : Entity → Entity → Prop

-- Premises
axiom stable_formed : ProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
axiom strong_leads : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
axiom includes_members : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers ∧ Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom feud_exists : HasFeudWith Imperium DiamondMine

-- Conclusion: Imperium doesn't have a feud with any professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile
theorem goal : ¬ ∃ (stable : Entity), ProfessionalWrestlingStable stable ∧ Includes stable IvyNile ∧ HasFeudWith Imperium stable := sorry
</lean>

Key aspects of this formalization:
1. Created a general `Entity` type for all objects
2. Defined distinct constants for each named entity
3. Created predicates for:
   - `ProfessionalWrestlingStable` (stable property)
   - `Leads` (leadership relation)
   - `Includes` (membership relation)
   - `HasFeudWith` (feud relationship)
4. Represented premises as axioms:
   - Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable
   - Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine
   - Diamond Mine includes both Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile
   - Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine
5. Formalized conclusion as:
   "There does not exist any professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile and has a feud with Imperium"
