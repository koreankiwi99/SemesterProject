STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the following:

Premises:
1. People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
   ∀x (InClub x ∧ PerformOften x → AttendSchoolEvents x ∧ EngagedWithEvents x)

2. People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
   ∀x (InClub x → (PerformOften x ∨ (Inactive x ∧ Disinterested x)))

3. People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
   ∀x (InClub x ∧ Chaperone x → ¬ StudentAttendSchool x)

4. All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
   ∀x (InClub x ∧ Inactive x ∧ Disinterested x → Chaperone x)

5. All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
   We note: "young children and teenagers" can be taken as a group. Let's call it `Young` (a predicate).
   ∀x (InClub x ∧ Young x ∧ WishFurtherCareer x → StudentAttendSchool x)

6. Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.
   Let B = Bonnie
   InClub B ∧ [ (AttendSchoolEvents B ∧ EngagedWithEvents B ∧ StudentAttendSchool B) ∨ ¬(AttendSchoolEvents B ∧ EngagedWithEvents B) ∧ ¬StudentAttendSchool B ]

   Actually, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse:

   "she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school
    OR
    is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school"

   This is an exclusive OR? But the second part is complex. We can write:

   (A1: (AttendSchoolEvents B ∧ EngagedWithEvents B) and also StudentAttendSchool B) 
   OR 
   (not ( (AttendSchoolEvents B ∧ EngagedWithEvents B) and not StudentAttendSchool B ))

   Actually, note the second part: "is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school"

   So: ¬ ( (AttendSchoolEvents B ∧ EngagedWithEvents B) ∧ ¬ StudentAttendSchool B)

   Which by DeMorgan is equivalent to: 
     ¬(AttendSchoolEvents B ∧ EngagedWithEvents B) ∨ StudentAttendSchool B

   So the entire disjunction is:

      [ (AttendSchoolEvents B ∧ EngagedWithEvents B ∧ StudentAttendSchool B) ] 
      ∨ 
      [ ¬(AttendSchoolEvents B ∧ EngagedWithEvents B) ∨ StudentAttendSchool B ]

   But note: the two parts are not mutually exclusive? And the premise says "either ... or ...". Actually, the way it's written, it's an inclusive OR? 

   However, observe: the first part is a conjunction (A∧B∧C) and the second part is (¬(A∧B) ∨ C). 

   But we can simplify the second part: ¬(A∧B) ∨ C is equivalent to (A∧B → C).

   And note that the entire disjunction is:

        (A∧B∧C) ∨ (A∧B → C)

   This is always true? Because if we have A∧B, then (A∧B→C) is equivalent to C, so then we have (A∧B∧C) ∨ C = C (if we already have A∧B). But if we don't have A∧B, then (A∧B→C) is true. So the entire thing is always true? 

   This doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the original text meant:

        ( (Attend and Engaged) AND (is a student) ) OR ( not( (Attend and Engaged) AND not(is a student) ) )

   But note: the second part says "is not someone who [both attends and is engaged] and [is not a student]".

   So: ¬ [ (Attend and Engaged) ∧ ¬ Student ]

   Which is equivalent to: (¬(Attend and Engaged) ∨ Student)

   Therefore, the disjunction is:

        [ (Attend and Engaged and Student) ] ∨ [ ¬(Attend and Engaged) ∨ Student ]

   Now, the "or" in the premise is between:

        [Attend and Engaged and Student]   and   [¬(Attend and Engaged) ∨ Student]

   So the entire statement for Bonnie is:

        InClub Bonnie ∧ ( (Attend Bonnie ∧ Engaged Bonnie ∧ Student Bonnie) ∨ (¬(Attend Bonnie ∧ Engaged Bonnie) ∨ Student Bonnie) )

   But note that (P ∨ Q) is equivalent to (P ∨ (¬R ∨ S))? Actually, we can combine:

        (A) ∨ (B ∨ C)   is equivalent to A ∨ B ∨ C.

   So: InClub Bonnie ∧ ( (Attend Bonnie ∧ Engaged Bonnie ∧ Student Bonnie) ∨ ¬(Attend Bonnie ∧ Engaged Bonnie) ∨ Student Bonnie )

   This is a bit messy. We can also note that the entire disjunction is a tautology? 

   Because if we have A∧B∧C, then we are done. 
   If we don't have A∧B∧C, then either we don't have A∧B (so ¬(A∧B) holds) or we have C (Student Bonnie) without A∧B? 

   Actually, it is a tautology because:

        (A∧B → C)   is equivalent to ¬(A∧B) ∨ C.

        And the disjunction can be written as: (A∧B∧C) ∨ (¬(A∧B) ∨ C)

        Which is equivalent to: (A∧B∧C) ∨ ¬(A∧B) ∨ C.

        Now, note that ¬(A∧B) covers the case where we don't have both A and B. And C covers the case where we have C. 
        And if we have A and B and not C, then we are missing? But in our expression we have A∧B∧C which would hold only in the positive case? 

   Actually, let me rewrite:

        (A∧B ∧ C) ∨ ¬(A∧B) ∨ C

        = (A∧B ∧ C) ∨ (¬(A∧B) ∨ C)

        Now, by associative and distributive laws:

        = [ (A∧B ∧ C) ∨ ¬(A∧B) ] ∨ C

        Now, (A∧B ∧ C) ∨ ¬(A∧B) is equivalent to (A∧B → C) (because if A∧B then we require C, otherwise the negation holds) but in fact it is equivalent to ¬(A∧B) ∨ C (which is the same as A∧B → C) and then we are ORing with C? 

        Actually, it is equivalent to: (A∧B → C) ∨ C.

        And (A∧B → C) ∨ C is always true? Because if C is true then we are done. If C is false, then we require A∧B → C to be true. But if C is false, then A∧B→false, which is equivalent to ¬(A∧B). But we don't have that condition? Actually, we have an OR so if C is false and ¬(A∧B) is true then it's true. If C is false and ¬(A∧B) is false (so A∧B is true) then we have A∧B and then we require C? which is false → so then the implication A∧B→C is false? Therefore in that case the disjunction is false? 

        Therefore it is not always true. 

   Actually, we can see that the expression is equivalent to: C ∨ ¬(A∧B)

        Because: (A∧B∧C) ∨ ¬(A∧B) ∨ C  = (A∧B∧C) ∨ C ∨ ¬(A∧B) = C ∨ (A∧B∧C) ∨ ¬(A∧B) = C ∨ [ (A∧B) → false ].

        But note also that (A∧B∧C) ∨ C  = C (because if C is true, then we don't care about A and B? Actually, no: because if C is true then the whole disjunction is true. But the term (A∧B∧C) is already absorbed by C? In fact, (A∧B∧C) ∨ C is equivalent to C.)

        Therefore: the disjunction is equivalent to C ∨ ¬(A∧B)

        So: InClub Bonnie ∧ ( StudentAttendSchool Bonnie ∨ ¬(AttendSchoolEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedWithEvents Bonnie) )

        But wait: the original disjunction was:

             (A∧B∧C) ∨ (¬(A∧B) ∨ C)

        = (A∧B∧C) ∨ ¬(A∧B) ∨ C

        Now, note that if we have C, we are done. If we don't have C, then we are left with (A∧B∧C) which without C is false, and ¬(A∧B). So indeed: if C is true, then the disjunction is true. If C is false, then we require ¬(A∧B) to be true.

        Therefore: InClub Bonnie ∧ ( StudentAttendSchool Bonnie ∨ ¬(AttendSchoolEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedWithEvents Bonnie) )

   This is the same as:

          InClub Bonnie ∧ ( (AttendSchoolEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedWithEvents Bonnie) → StudentAttendSchool Bonnie )

   Because (P → Q) is ¬P ∨ Q, which here is (¬(A∧B) ∨ C). But we have written it as (C ∨ ¬(A∧B)), which is the same.

   So we can write:

        InClub Bonnie ∧ ( (AttendSchoolEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedWithEvents Bonnie) → StudentAttendSchool Bonnie )

   This simplification is valid.

   So axiom for Bonnie:

        axiom Bonnie_in_club : InClub Bonnie
        axiom Bonnie_condition : (AttendSchoolEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedWithEvents Bonnie) → StudentAttendSchool Bonnie

Conclusion: Bonnie performs in school talent shows often. (PerformOften Bonnie)

Now, we introduce the necessary predicates and Bonnie as an individual.

Let's declare:
  ClubMember as a type? Or as a predicate? The problem says "people in this club". We assume we have a type `obj` of all people?

Alternatively, we can have a type `Person` and then:

  InClub : Person → Prop
  PerformOften : Person → Prop   (for "performs in school talent shows often")
  AttendSchoolEvents : Person → Prop
  EngagedWithEvents : Person → Prop
  Inactive : Person → Prop        (for "inactive")
  Disinterested : Person → Prop   (for "disinterested")
  Chaperone : Person → Prop       (for "chaperone high school dances")
  StudentAttendSchool : Person → Prop   (for "students who attend the school")
  Young : Person → Prop           (for "young children and teenagers")
  WishFurtherCareer : Person → Prop (for "wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities")

And Bonnie: a constant of type Person.

We then formalize the axioms:

1. ∀x : Person, InClub x ∧ PerformOften x → AttendSchoolEvents x ∧ EngagedWithEvents x
2. ∀x : Person, InClub x → (PerformOften x ∨ (Inactive x ∧ Disinterested x))
3. ∀x : Person, InClub x ∧ Chaperone x → ¬ (StudentAttendSchool x)
4. ∀x : Person, InClub x ∧ Inactive x ∧ Disinterested x → Chaperone x
5. ∀x : Person, InClub x ∧ Young x ∧ WishFurtherCareer x → StudentAttendSchool x
6. (as above) InClub Bonnie and
   ( (AttendSchoolEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedWithEvents Bonnie) → StudentAttendSchool Bonnie )

But note: the first part of the sixth premise is already given as "Bonnie is in this club", so:

   axiom Bonnie_in_club : InClub Bonnie
   axiom Bonnie_condition : (AttendSchoolEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedWithEvents Bonnie) → StudentAttendSchool Bonnie

Now, we want to prove: PerformOften Bonnie

We write the theorem as: theorem goal : PerformOften Bonnie := sorry

Now, we code:

Note: We must declare all the necessary types and predicates.

Important: Since the problem involves a club, but we are talking about people, we use a type `Person` and then predicates.

Let me structure:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type

-- Predicates
axiom InClub : Person → Prop
axiom PerformOften : Person → Prop
axiom AttendSchoolEvents : Person → Prop
axiom EngagedWithEvents : Person → Prop
axiom Inactive : Person → Prop
axiom Disinterested : Person → Prop
axiom Chaperone : Person → Prop
axiom StudentAttendSchool : Person → Prop
axiom Young : Person → Prop
axiom WishFurtherCareer : Person → Prop

-- Bonnie is a specific person
axiom Bonnie : Person

-- Premises

-- A1: People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x ∧ PerformOften x → AttendSchoolEvents x ∧ EngagedWithEvents x

-- A2: People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x → PerformOften x ∨ (Inactive x ∧ Disinterested x)

-- A3: People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x ∧ Chaperone x → ¬ StudentAttendSchool x

-- A4: All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x ∧ Inactive x ∧ Disinterested x → Chaperone x

-- A5: All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x ∧ Young x ∧ WishFurtherCareer x → StudentAttendSchool x

-- A6: Bonnie is in this club and the condition about her.
axiom A6a : InClub Bonnie
axiom A6b : (AttendSchoolEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedWithEvents Bonnie) → StudentAttendSchool Bonnie

-- Conclusion: Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.
theorem goal : PerformOften Bonnie := sorry

</lean>

But note: the problem does not tell us anything about Bonnie being young or wishing to further her career? So we don't use A5 for Bonnie? However, we have the condition A6b which relates (AttendSchoolEvents and EngagedWithEvents) to StudentAttendSchool.

However, note that A1 says that if she performs often then she attends and is engaged. So if she performs often, then by A1 she would have to be a student? But we have from A3 and A4 that inactive and disinterested members are chaperones and hence not students. 

But the conclusion is that she does perform often. We are not proving it, just formalizing.

But note: there is a catch. The condition about Bonnie is not directly about performance. We need to derive it. However, for formalization, we are only setting up the axioms and theorem.

Therefore, the above code should be the formalization.

One more thing: the problem says "People in this club either perform ... or are inactive and disinterested". This is an inclusive or? Probably. But in logic, we use ∨ which is inclusive.

We don't know if Bonnie is a young child or teenager? So we don't have the Young predicate or WishFurtherCareer for her? But we don't need if we are not going to use A5? However, if we are to prove, we might not need it? But we don't have to worry.

Therefore, the code below is produced accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises, I'll formalize the logical structure using Lean 4. The key steps are:
1. Define a type for people
2. Define predicates for all properties mentioned
3. Declare axioms for all premises
4. Formalize the conclusion about Bonnie

<lean>
axiom Person : Type

-- Define predicates
axiom InClub : Person → Prop
axiom Perform : Person → Prop

axiom WishFurther : Person → Prop

-- Bonnie is a specific person
axiom Bonnie : Person

-- Premise 1: Performers attend school events & are engaged
axiom P1 : ∀ p : Person, InClub p ∧ Perform p → AttendEngaged p

-- Premise 2: Club members perform or are inactive

-- Premise 3: Chaperones aren't students
axiom P3 : ∀ p : Person, InClub p ∧ Chaperone p → ¬ StudentAttend p

-- Premise 4: Inactive members chaperone

-- Premise 5: Young members wishing to advance are students
axiom P5 : ∀ p : Person, InClub p ∧ YoungTeen p ∧ WishFurther p → StudentAttend p

-- Premise 6: Bonnie's complex condition

axiom P6b : (AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ StudentAttend Bonnie) ∨ (¬AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬StudentAttend Bonnie)

-- Formalized conclusion: Bonnie performs in school talent shows
theorem BonniePerforms : Perform Bonnie := sorry
</lean>

Note: 
1. `AttendEngaged` combines "attends and is very engaged"
2. `InactiveDisinterested` combines "inactive and disinterested"
3. Premise 6 is formalized as an XOR-type condition (either both true or both false)
4. All axioms use propositional logic with quantifiers
5. The `sorry` placeholder indicates the theorem remains unproven


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and we need to prove that Bonnie performs.
 The goal: `theorem BonniePerforms : Perform Bonnie`

 Let's analyze the given premises:

 P1: ∀ p, InClub p ∧ Perform p → AttendEngaged p
 P2: ∀ p, InClub p → Perform p ∨ InactiveDisinterested p
 P3: ∀ p, InClub p ∧ Chaperone p → ¬ StudentAttend p
 P4: ∀ p, InClub p ∧ InactiveDisinterested p → Chaperone p
 P5: ∀ p, InClub p ∧ YoungTeen p ∧ WishFurther p → StudentAttend p

 For Bonnie:
   P6a: InClub Bonnie
   P6b: (AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ StudentAttend Bonnie) ∨ (¬AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬StudentAttend Bonnie)

 We want to show: Perform Bonnie.

 Approach:

 From P2 and P6a, we know:
   Perform Bonnie ∨ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie

 So if we can rule out InactiveDisinterested Bonnie, then we get Perform Bonnie.

 How to rule out InactiveDisinterested Bonnie?

 Suppose Bonnie is inactive. Then by P4, she becomes a chaperone (Chaperone Bonnie).
 Then by P3 (with InClub Bonnie and Chaperone Bonnie), we get ¬ StudentAttend Bonnie.

 Now look at P6b: it says either (AttendEngaged and StudentAttend) OR (not AttendEngaged and not StudentAttend).

 In the inactive case, we have ¬ StudentAttend Bonnie. So the second part of P6b would hold: ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬StudentAttend Bonnie.

 But what if we try to see if the first part could hold? We have ¬ StudentAttend Bonnie, so the first part (which requires StudentAttend Bonnie) is false.

 Therefore, in the inactive case, we must have ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie.

 However, note that if Bonnie were performing, then by P1 (with InClub Bonnie and Perform Bonnie) we would have AttendEngaged Bonnie. But in the inactive case we are assuming she is inactive (so not performing by the disjunction? Actually, note that P2 says "Perform p ∨ InactiveDisinterested p", so inactive and performing are mutually exclusive? Not exactly: the ∨ is inclusive, but note that if she is inactive, we don't necessarily have performing. However, the premises do not explicitly say that a person cannot be both performing and inactive? But let's look at the context.

 Actually, note that P4 says if inactive then chaperone, and P3 says chaperones are not students. Also, P1 says if in club and performing then attend and engaged. So if Bonnie is inactive, she is a chaperone and not a student. Also, she is not performing? Because if she were performing, then she would be engaged (by P1) but also chaperone (by P4) and then not a student (by P3). But note: we don't have a direct contradiction yet.

 However, we have P6b which tells us that Bonnie is either (engaged and student) or (not engaged and not student). In the inactive case, we have:
   ¬ StudentAttend Bonnie   (from P3 and P4)
   and we must also have ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie (from the second part of P6b).

 But note: if Bonnie were inactive, then she is a chaperone and not a student. Also, she is not performing? Actually, P2 says that every club member either performs or is inactive (or both?). But if she is inactive, she might still perform? The premises don't forbid that. However, if she is inactive, then by P4 she is a chaperone. And if she is performing, then by P1 she would be engaged. But we have in the inactive case that she is not engaged (because of P6b). So if she were inactive and performing, we would have both AttendEngaged Bonnie (from P1) and ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie (from P6b) -> contradiction.

 Therefore, in the inactive case, she cannot be performing. So the disjunction in P2 becomes exclusive? Actually, we don't need that: we are trying to rule out the inactive case entirely.

 Alternatively, we can try to derive a contradiction from assuming Bonnie is inactive.

 Assume Bonnie is inactive: InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.

 Then:
   By P4: Chaperone Bonnie.
   By P3: ¬ StudentAttend Bonnie.

 Now P6b: 
   Case 1: AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ StudentAttend Bonnie -> but we have ¬StudentAttend Bonnie, contradiction.
   Case 2: ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬StudentAttend Bonnie -> this holds.

 So no contradiction yet.

 But note: if Bonnie is inactive, then she is not performing? Actually, P2 says: InClub Bonnie -> Perform Bonnie ∨ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie. 
 Since we assumed inactive, then it doesn't require her to perform. So she might not be performing.

 However, we want to prove that she performs. So we must show that the inactive case leads to a contradiction? Not necessarily. We only need to show that she must perform. 

 Alternatively, we can use the fact that if she is inactive, then she is a chaperone and not a student. But we don't have any other condition that forces her to be a student? 

 However, note that we don't have any information about Bonnie being a young teen or wishing to advance. So P5 doesn't apply to her? 

 Therefore, we cannot derive a contradiction from the inactive case. 

 But wait: we have P6b. In the inactive case, we have ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie. However, if she were performing, then by P1 she would be engaged. But we are assuming inactive, and inactive doesn't necessarily imply not performing? Actually, we have no axiom that says inactive implies not performing. So she could be both? 

 However, let's look at P1: it says if she is in the club and performing, then she is engaged. So if she is inactive and also performing, then she would be engaged. But in the inactive case, we have from P6b that she is not engaged. So:

   If Bonnie is inactive and performing, then:
      AttendEngaged Bonnie (by P1: InClub Bonnie and Perform Bonnie)
      and ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie (from P6b in the inactive case: because we have ¬StudentAttend Bonnie and the second part of P6b gives ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie).

 Contradiction.

 Therefore, if Bonnie is inactive, she cannot be performing. So in the inactive case, we have:
   InactiveDisinterested Bonnie and ¬ Perform Bonnie.

 But then by P2, we have: InClub Bonnie -> Perform Bonnie ∨ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.
 Since we have InactiveDisinterested Bonnie, that's fine.

 However, we are trying to prove Perform Bonnie. So we must rule out the inactive case.

 How? We need to show that inactive leads to a contradiction in another way.

 Alternatively, we can consider the two cases from P6b and see what they imply.

 Case 1: AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ StudentAttend Bonnie.
   Since she is engaged, by P1 we know that she must be in the club and performing? Actually, P1 says: InClub p ∧ Perform p → AttendEngaged p. It doesn't say that engaged implies performing. So we cannot conclude that she performs from being engaged.

 But note: we have P2: InClub Bonnie → Perform Bonnie ∨ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.

 We know she is in the club (P6a). So she either performs or is inactive.

 In Case 1: we have AttendEngaged Bonnie. If she were inactive, then by P4 she would be a chaperone, then by P3 she would not be a student. But in Case 1, she is a student. Contradiction. Therefore, in Case 1 she cannot be inactive. So she must perform.

 Case 2: ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬StudentAttend Bonnie.
   We don't have an immediate contradiction. But can we derive that she must be inactive? 

   From P2: she is either performing or inactive.

   If she is performing, then by P1 we would have AttendEngaged Bonnie. But we have ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie. Contradiction. Therefore, she cannot be performing. So she must be inactive.

   But then by P4, she is a chaperone. And by P3, she is not a student, which matches ¬StudentAttend Bonnie.

   So in Case 2, she is inactive and not performing.

 Therefore, in Case 1 she performs, and in Case 2 she does not.

 But we want to prove that she performs. We cannot do that without knowing which case of P6b holds.

 However, the problem states: "Bonnie's complex condition" as an axiom (P6b). It doesn't tell us which one holds. So we cannot conclude that she performs.

 But wait: the theorem is stated as `Perform Bonnie`. We must prove it. Without knowing which case of P6b holds, we cannot.

 Therefore, is the theorem provable? Let me reexamine.

 Actually, we have shown:
   If Case 1 holds, then Bonnie performs.
   If Case 2 holds, then Bonnie does not perform.

 But we don't know which case holds. Therefore, we cannot prove `Perform Bonnie`.

 However, note that the problem says "Formalized conclusion: Bonnie performs in school talent shows". And we are asked to replace the sorry. But if we cannot prove it, then we must mark as Uncertain? But the task is to provide a proof term. 

 Alternatively, we might have missed something.

 Let me try to see if we can derive a contradiction from Case 2? 

 In Case 2: 
   ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie and ¬StudentAttend Bonnie.
   And we have InClub Bonnie (P6a).
   By P2: Perform Bonnie ∨ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.
   If she performs, then by P1: AttendEngaged Bonnie -> contradiction with ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie.
   So she must be inactive.
   Then by P4: Chaperone Bonnie -> which by P3 gives ¬StudentAttend Bonnie -> which we already have.

 So Case 2 is consistent.

 Therefore, without additional information, we cannot prove that Bonnie performs.

 But wait: the problem says "Bonnie's complex condition" is given as an axiom. It is a disjunction. We don't know which side. So the theorem BonniePerforms is not necessarily true.

 However, note that the problem might be designed so that one of the cases leads to a contradiction? We didn't get a contradiction in Case 2.

 Alternatively, we might have overlooked that Bonnie might be a young teen wishing to advance? But we don't have axioms about Bonnie's age or wishes.

 Therefore, the proof should be: we cannot prove it. But the task says to replace sorry. How?

 We must use the given axioms. Since we cannot prove it, we might need to use classical logic? But Lean is not necessarily classical.

 Alternatively, we can do case analysis on P6b:

   have h6 := P6b
   cases h6 with
   | inl h1 => ... -- in this case we can prove Perform Bonnie
   | inr h2 => ... -- in this case we cannot

 So overall, we cannot prove Perform Bonnie without knowing which case.

 But note: the problem says "Formalized conclusion: Bonnie performs", meaning we are expected to prove it? Or maybe not.

 Let me reexamine the premises:

 Premise 6: Bonnie's complex condition: 
   (AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ StudentAttend Bonnie) ∨ (¬AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬StudentAttend Bonnie)

 This is an exclusive or? The problem doesn't say. But it's written as an ∨.

 However, note that if Bonnie were both engaged and not a student, or not engaged and a student, then the disjunction would be false. But we don't have any information about that.

 Actually, we can show that one of these two must hold? No, because we don't have the law of excluded middle. But the axiom P6b states exactly one of these two? No, it states at least one. But note: it might be that both are false? But the axiom says OR, so if both are false, then the axiom would be false.

 But wait: the axiom is given. So we know that either the first holds or the second holds.

 However, we cannot decide which.

 Therefore, the proof term would have to be:

   cases P6b with
   | inl h => ... 
   | inr h => ... 

 And in the inl case we can prove Perform Bonnie, but in the inr case we cannot.

 So overall, we cannot prove `Perform Bonnie` without additional assumptions.

 But the problem says "Provide the complete code with proof". If we cannot prove it, then we must mark as Uncertain? However, the task says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 Alternatively, we might have missed an inference.

 Let me try to see if we can derive that Bonnie cannot be inactive? 

 Suppose Bonnie is inactive. Then:
   She is a chaperone (P4) -> not a student (P3).
   Then by P6b, we must have the second case: not engaged and not student.
   Also, from P2: she is inactive (so not performing? because if she performed, she would be engaged by P1, but we have not engaged).

   So she is not performing.

   But we don't have a contradiction. So inactive is possible.

 Now, if she is performing, then by P1 she is engaged. Then by P6b, we must have the first case: engaged and student. So she must be a student.

   But we don't have any condition that forces Bonnie to be a student? 

   Unless she is a young teen wishing to advance? But we don't know.

   So if she performs, then she is engaged and then by P6b she must be a student. But we don't have any axiom that says performers must be students? 

   Actually, no: P3 says chaperones are not students. But she is performing, so she is not inactive? Not necessarily: she could be both? But if she is both, then she would be a chaperone (by P4) and then not a student (by P3). But then if she is engaged (because performing) and not a student, then P6b would be false? Because P6b says: either (engaged and student) or (not engaged and not student). But we have engaged and not student -> neither of the two.

   Therefore, if Bonnie is both performing and inactive, then we have:
        AttendEngaged Bonnie (from P1: because performing) -> so she is engaged.
        ¬StudentAttend Bonnie (from P3: because inactive implies chaperone and then not student).

   But then P6b: 
        First part: requires student -> false.
        Second part: requires not engaged -> false (because she is engaged).

   So the disjunction fails.

   Therefore, Bonnie cannot be both performing and inactive.

   So the disjunction in P2 is exclusive? Because if she is inactive, she cannot be performing (because otherwise P6b would be false). Similarly, if she is performing, she cannot be inactive.

   Therefore, P2: InClub Bonnie → Perform Bonnie ∨ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie, and now we know that these two are mutually exclusive? Actually, we just showed that they cannot hold together.

   So now, we have two cases for Bonnie:

   Case 1: Perform Bonnie and not inactive.
   Case 2: InactiveDisinterested Bonnie and not performing.

   And we know from P6b that:

        If she performs, then she is engaged and then by P6b she must be a student (because the first part of P6b must hold: since if she performs, she is engaged, and then if she were not a student, then P6b would require the second part: not engaged and not student -> but she is engaged, so contradiction). 

        Actually, if she performs, then she is engaged. Then we look at P6b: 
            It must be either (engaged and student) or (not engaged and not student). 
            Since she is engaged, the second part is false. So the first part must hold: engaged and student. So she must be a student.

        Similarly, if she is inactive, then she is not performing (as we just saw) and then she is not a student (by P3 and P4) and not engaged (because if she were engaged, then P6b would require her to be a student, but she is not). But wait: from P1, engagement only comes from performing. Since she is not performing, she is not engaged. So in the inactive case, we have not engaged and not student -> which matches the second part of P6b.

   So now, can we force Bonnie to be a student? We don't have any information that Bonnie is a young teen wishing to advance. So we cannot.

   Therefore, we still have two possibilities: she performs (and is a student) or she is inactive (and not a student).

   Without knowing which, we cannot prove that she performs.

   However, note that the problem states that Bonnie is in the club (P6a) and the complex condition (P6b). We have no information about her being a young teen or wishing to advance. Therefore, we cannot force her to be a student.

   So the answer is Uncertain.

   But the task is to replace the sorry. How? We cannot prove it. Therefore, we must leave it as an unproven theorem? But the task says "valid proof".

   Alternatively, we can try to use proof by contradiction:

      Assume ¬ Perform Bonnie.

      Then from P2 and P6a, we have InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.

      Then by P4, Chaperone Bonnie.
      Then by P3, ¬ StudentAttend Bonnie.

      Then by P6b, we must have the second case: ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬StudentAttend Bonnie.

      But also, because she is inactive, she is not performing -> so we don't get engagement from P1.

      Now, is there a contradiction? We don't see one.

   Therefore, we cannot prove it.

   But note: the problem might have intended that Bonnie is a young teen wishing to advance? But we don't have that axiom.

   Alternatively, perhaps we can show that if she is inactive, then she must be a student? But we have the opposite: she cannot be a student.

   So the theorem as stated is not provable.

   Therefore, we must answer Uncertain.

   However, the task says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof." 

   But we don't have a proof. So we cannot replace sorry with a valid proof term.

   This means that the answer is Uncertain, and we cannot provide a complete proof.

   But wait: the example provided a proof term. So if we cannot prove it, we might have to use a classical axiom? But that's not in the given axioms.

   Alternatively, we might have made a mistake: perhaps Bonnie is forced to be a student by some other means.

   Let me try to see if we can derive that Bonnie must be a student? 

   We have no information about Bonnie's age or wishes. So P5 doesn't apply.

   Therefore, we cannot.

   Conclusion: the theorem is not provable from the given axioms.

   So we must mark as Uncertain.

   However, the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'", implying that it is provable? 

   Let me double-check the premises:

   Premise 6: 
        (AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ StudentAttend Bonnie) ∨ (¬AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬StudentAttend Bonnie)

   This is an exclusive or? It is written as inclusive, but in this context, it might be exclusive because the two cases are mutually exclusive? 

   But note: it is possible that both are true? 
        If both are true, then we have:
          AttendEngaged Bonnie and StudentAttend Bonnie and also ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie and ¬StudentAttend Bonnie -> contradiction.
        Similarly, both false: not engaged and not student? That would be the second part, so it would be true. Wait, no: if both are false, then the disjunction is false.

   But the axiom P6b is given, so it must be true. Therefore, exactly one of the two cases holds.

   But still, we don't know which.

   So without additional information, we cannot prove that Bonnie performs.

   Therefore, we cannot replace sorry with a proof.

   But the task requires a complete code. How? We must provide a proof that uses the disjunction and in one branch proves the goal and in the other branch we must find a way? But in the other branch we have the opposite.

   We might try to show that in the second branch we get a contradiction? But we don't.

   Alternatively, we can use the fact that if she is inactive, then she is not a student and not engaged, and then try to apply P5? But P5 requires YoungTeen and WishFurther, which we don't have for Bonnie.

   Therefore, the only possibility is that the first branch holds? But we don't know.

   This is not constructive.

   Given that the problem might expect a proof by cases, and in the second case we get that she is inactive, which does not imply she performs, we cannot.

   Therefore, the answer is Uncertain.

   But the task says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

   So we will write: ANSWER: Uncertain

   However, for the code, we must provide something. We can try to write a proof that covers the first case and in the second case we get stuck? But that's not a complete proof.

   Alternatively, we can use `by_cases` on whether she is a student or not? But we don't have that.

   But note: we have P6b which gives us two cases. We can do:

      cases P6b with
      | inl h1 => ... -- then we can prove Perform Bonnie as follows:
          have hEng := h1.left
          have hStu := h1.right
          -- Now, from P2 and P6a: Perform Bonnie ∨ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie
          cases (P2 Bonnie P6a) with
          | inl perf => exact perf
          | inr inactive => 
               -- Then she is inactive, so by P4: Chaperone Bonnie, then by P3: ¬StudentAttend Bonnie
               have hChap : Chaperone Bonnie := P4 Bonnie (And.intro P6a inactive)
               have hNotStu : ¬ StudentAttend Bonnie := P3 Bonnie (And.intro P6a hChap)
               -- But we have hStu: StudentAttend Bonnie, contradiction.
               contradiction
      | inr h2 => 
          -- In this case, we have ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie and ¬StudentAttend Bonnie.
          -- Now, from P2 and P6a: Perform Bonnie ∨ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.
          cases (P2 Bonnie P6a) with
          | inl perf => 
               -- If she performs, then by P1: AttendEngaged Bonnie
               have hEng : AttendEngaged Bonnie := P1 Bonnie (And.intro P6a perf)
               -- But h2.left says ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie -> contradiction.
               contradiction
          | inr inactive => 
               -- Then she is inactive, and we cannot prove Perform Bonnie. In fact, we have to prove Perform Bonnie, but we have inactive and we want Perform Bonnie -> we cannot.
               -- So we are stuck.

   In the second branch, we have a dead end: we have inactive, and we need to prove Perform Bonnie, which is false in this branch.

   Therefore, we cannot complete the proof.

   This shows that the theorem is not provable.

   So we must conclude Uncertain.

   However, note: in the second branch, we have inactive, and we want Perform Bonnie. But we have no way to prove it. And it is actually false in that branch.

   Therefore, we cannot prove the theorem.

   So we will output the code with a sorry in the second branch? But that's not allowed.

   Alternatively, we might have made a mistake: in the second branch, after we get inactive, we have no contradiction? But the goal is Perform Bonnie, which we cannot prove.

   Therefore, the only way is if we can show that the second branch is impossible? But we cannot.

   Given the above, I think the intended answer might be that Bonnie must perform, and the complex condition is meant to force her to be a student and hence not a chaperone, so she cannot be inactive? But in the second branch she is not a student, so she can be inactive.

   Without additional information, we cannot.

   So I will output the code with a proof that covers the first branch and in the second branch we get stuck. But that's not a proof.

   Alternatively, we can use classical logic: by_contradiction. But even then:

      Assume ¬ Perform Bonnie.
      Then by P2 and P6a, she is inactive.
      Then by P4, chaperone.
      Then by P3, not a student.
      Then by P6b, we must have the second case: not engaged and not student.
      And we also have not performing -> so no engagement from P1 -> which is consistent.

      So no contradiction.

   Therefore, the theorem is not provable.

   Conclusion: ANSWER: Uncertain

   But for the code, we must provide something. The instructions say: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." If we cannot, then we cannot complete the task.

   However, after rethinking, I see that in the second branch, we have:

        ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie and ¬StudentAttend Bonnie.

        And from P2 and P6a: Perform Bonnie ∨ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.

        And if we assume ¬ Perform Bonnie, then we get InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.

        But then we are not forced to have a contradiction. However, the goal is Perform Bonnie. So in the second branch, we cannot prove it.

   Therefore, the only hope is if we can show that the second branch leads to a contradiction with some other axiom? We have not used P5. But P5 requires YoungTeen and WishFurther, which we don't have for Bonnie.

   So I think the answer is Uncertain.

   Given the above, I will write the proof for the first branch and in the second branch I will admit defeat by using `sorry` again? But that's not allowed.

   Alternatively, we can try to use the fact that in the second branch, we have inactive, and then we have not performing, which is the negation of our goal. So we cannot prove the goal in that branch.

   Therefore, the theorem is not provable.

   We must output the code with the original sorry and mark Uncertain? But that's not what the task asks.

   The task says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof." 

   Since we cannot provide a proof, we must output the code with sorry still there? But that's not allowed.

   Alternatively, we can write a proof that is conditional: if the first branch of P6b holds, then Bonnie performs, but if the second holds, then she doesn't. So we cannot prove it unconditionally.

   Therefore, the answer is Uncertain.

   I will output the code with a comment and mark Uncertain.

   But the instructions require a complete proof.

   After careful thought, I realize that there is a way to prove it if we use the law of excluded middle on `StudentAttend Bonnie`? But we have P6b which already decides that. However, we don't know which.

   But note: P6b is an axiom, so we are forced to do cases on it.

   And in the second case, we cannot prove Perform Bonnie.

   Therefore, the proof is not possible.

   So I will write: 

   ANSWER: Uncertain

   And for the code, I will leave the sorry and explain? But the task requires complete code.

   Given the constraints, I must provide a proof that uses only the given axioms. Since I cannot, I will provide a proof that shows the first case and in the second case gets stuck, but then use `False.elim` or something? But that's not valid.

   Alternatively, we can notice that in the second case, after deriving that she is inactive, we can try to derive that she is a student from somewhere? We cannot.

   Therefore, I think the only honest answer is that the proof is not possible.

   But let me try one more time:

   Perhaps from the inactive case, we can show that she must be a student by some means? For example, if she is a young teen wishing to advance, then by P5 she would be a student. But we don't have that.

   So without that, she might not be.

   Therefore, the answer is Uncertain.

   I will output the code with a proof that handles the first case and in the second case we use:

      have h_inactive : InactiveDisinterested Bonnie := by 
          -- from P2 and the fact that we are in the second case and assuming not performing leads to inactive
          ... 
      but then we cannot prove Perform Bonnie.

   So I must not complete the proof.

   Given the above, I will not provide any code and instead say Uncertain.

   But the task requires code.

   Alternatively, we can use `classical` to use the law of excluded middle, but the problem doesn't say we can.

   The axioms are intuitionistic.

   Therefore, I will output the code with a sorry in the second branch and then overall sorry, but that's not allowed.

   This is a dilemma.

   However, note that the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", and we are to provide a proof. If it's not possible, then we must indicate Uncertain.

   So for the code, I will write a proof that only covers the first branch and in the second branch we get a contradiction? But we don't.

   Wait, in the second branch, when we assume she is performing, we get a contradiction (because if she performs, she is engaged, but the second branch says not engaged). And if we assume she is inactive, we don't get a contradiction, but we also don get the goal.

   But in the proof, we are required to prove `Perform Bonnie`. In the second branch, after we case on P2, we have two subcases: performing (which we then contradiction) or inactive. In the inactive subcase, we have not performing, but we need performing -> so we can only use the performing subcase which gives contradiction, and then we can use `False.elim` to prove anything? 

   Specifically, in the second branch:

        have h2 : ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬StudentAttend Bonnie := by assumption
        have h2_left := h2.left
        have h2_right := h2.right
        have h_disj := P2 Bonnie P6a
        cases h_disj with
        | inl perf => 
             have h_eng : AttendEngaged Bonnie := P1 Bonnie (And.intro P6a perf)
             contradiction   -- because h2_left and h_eng
        | inr inactive => 
             -- Now we want to prove Perform Bonnie, but we have inactive and not performing (from the meaning of inactive? but not explicitly)
             -- But note: we have no axiom that says inactive implies not performing. However, if she is inactive and also performing, then we would have engagement (from P1) -> contradiction with h2_left.
             -- So she cannot be performing. Therefore, we have a dead end.

   In the inactive subcase, we cannot prove Perform Bonnie. But we can prove that it is not possible to have inactive and not have the goal? 

   Alternatively, we can do:

        in the second branch, after cases on P2, we have:
          either we have a contradiction (from the performing subcase) or we have inactive.
        and in the inactive subcase, we have not performing (because if she were performing, we would have engagement -> contradiction), so we have ¬ Perform Bonnie.

        But then we have to prove Perform Bonnie -> contradiction.

        So we can prove ¬ Perform Bonnie in the second branch.

        But our goal is Perform Bonnie.

        So in the second branch, we have ¬ Perform Bonnie and we are asked to prove Perform Bonnie -> this is impossible.

   Therefore, in the second branch, we can only prove the goal if we can derive a contradiction from the assumptions. But we cannot.

   So the proof term would be:

   theorem BonniePerforms : Perform Bonnie := by
     have h6 := P6b
     cases h6 with
     | inl h => 
          -- h : AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ StudentAttend Bonnie
          have hEng := h.left
          have hStu := h.right
          cases (P2 Bonnie P6a) with
          | inl perf => exact perf
          | inr inactive => 
               have hChap : Chaperone Bonnie := P4 Bonnie (And.intro P6a inactive)
               have hNotStu : ¬ StudentAttend Bonnie := P3 Bonnie (And.intro P6a hChap)
               contradiction
     | inr h => 
          -- h : ¬AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬StudentAttend Bonnie
          have hNotEng := h.left
          have hNotStu := h.right
          cases (P2 Bonnie P6a) with
          | inl perf => 
               have hEng : AttendEngaged Bonnie := P1 Bonnie (And.intro P6a perf)
               contradiction
          | inr inactive => 
               -- We need to prove Perform Bonnie, but we have inactive.
               -- If we could show that inactive implies not performing, then we have not performing, but we need performing.
               -- So we are stuck.
               sorry   -- This sorry remains

   This is not a complete proof.

   Therefore, the answer is Uncertain.

   I will output the code with this structure and leave the second branch as sorry, but then the whole theorem is not proven.

   Alternatively, we can try to use classical.em for Perform Bonnie in the second branch? But the problem doesn't give classical axioms.

   Given the instructions, we must not modify the axioms.

   Therefore, I will output the code as above with one sorry remaining, and then answer Uncertain.

   But the task says "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term", meaning remove all sorry.

   So we cannot.

   This means that the theorem is not provable.

   Therefore, I will output:

   ANSWER: Uncertain

   And for the code, I will not provide a complete proof.

   But the task requires complete code.

   This is a contradiction.

   Perhaps the intended resolution is that in the second branch, after deriving inactive, we can use that to prove anything? But we cannot.

   Another idea: from inactive, we have chaperone, and then not student, and then by P6b we have the second case. But then we have not engaged. Is there a way to derive that she must be engaged from somewhere else? No.

   Therefore, I think the only option is to say Uncertain.

   I will output the code with the proof attempt that has a sorry in the second branch, and then answer Uncertain.

   But note: the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", so the axioms are fixed.

   So here is the code with the proof attempt, but it has a sorry in the second branch. This is not valid, but it's the best we can do.

   Alternatively, we can try to prove it by showing that the second branch is impossible? Let's try:

        in the second branch, we have inactive.
        then we have chaperone (P4) -> not student (P3) -> matches the second part of P6b.

        also, because she is inactive, she might not be performing, so not engaged by P1.

        so no contradiction.

   Therefore, the second branch is possible.

   So the code with a sorry in the second branch is the best we can do.

   We will provide that.

   But the task says "valid proof", and this is not valid.

   Given the above, I think the answer is that the theorem is not provable, so we output Uncertain.

   Code with the proof attempt and one sorry:

   ANSWER: Uncertain

   This is the best we can do.


=== RESPONSE ===
The theorem `BonniePerforms` cannot be conclusively proven from the given axioms. The proof attempt shows that:
- If Bonnie is engaged and a student (first case of P6b), she must perform.
- If Bonnie is not engaged and not a student (second case of P6b), she is inactive and does not perform, but we cannot derive a contradiction or force her to perform.

Since the axioms do not provide enough information to resolve which case of P6b holds (and P5 doesn't apply to Bonnie), the theorem is unprovable.
