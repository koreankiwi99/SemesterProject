STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the given premises and the conclusion about Bonnie.

 Steps:
 1. We'll define a type `Person` for people in the club.
 2. We'll define predicates for the properties mentioned.

 Premises:

 P1: People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
    ∀ p, (InClub p ∧ PerformsInTalentShows p) → (AttendsSchoolEvents p ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents p)

 P2: People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
    ∀ p, InClub p → (PerformsInTalentShows p ∨ (Inactive p ∧ Disinterested p))

 P3: People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
    ∀ p, InClub p → (ChaperonesDances p → ¬ StudentAttendsSchool p)

 P4: All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
    ∀ p, InClub p → ((Inactive p ∧ Disinterested p) → ChaperonesDances p)

 P5: All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
    ∀ p, InClub p → ( (YoungChild p ∨ Teenager p) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer p → StudentAttendsSchool p )

 P6: Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.
    Let B = Bonnie.
    InClub B ∧ 
      ( (AttendsSchoolEvents B ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents B ∧ StudentAttendsSchool B) ∨ 
        ¬ (AttendsSchoolEvents B ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents B ∧ StudentAttendsSchool B) )
    But note: the second disjunct is the negation of the first. So this is always true? 
    Actually, the premise says: she either [A and B] or not [A and B]. That's a tautology. 
    However, note the phrasing: "she either both attends and is very engaged ... and is a student ... OR is not someone who both ... and ...". 
    So it's: 
        (AttendsSchoolEvents B ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents B ∧ StudentAttendsSchool B) ∨ 
        ¬ (AttendsSchoolEvents B ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents B ∧ StudentAttendsSchool B)
    But that is always true. So we can skip this premise? However, note that the premise says "Bonnie is in this club" and then the tautology. 
    So we only need: InClub B.

    But wait, let me parse: 
        "Bonnie is in this club and she [either X or not X]"
        where X = "both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school"

    So we have:
        InClub B ∧ (X ∨ ¬X)

    Since (X ∨ ¬X) is always true, we can just say `InClub B`.

    However, note: the tautology doesn't give us any new information. So we only record `InClub B`.

 Conclusion:

 If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.

 Let:
   A = (YoungChild B ∨ Teenager B) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer B
   C = ChaperonesDances B

 The first part: "Bonnie is either both A and C or neither A nor ..." 
   Actually: "either both ... and ... or neither ... nor ..."

   Specifically: 
        (A ∧ C) ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬C)   ?

 But note: "neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes ..." -> that would be ¬A? And then "and chaperones high school dances" is missing? 
 Actually: "neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes ..." -> ¬A, and then the next part? The sentence says: "or neither is ... and chaperones ..."? 

 Wait, the conclusion says:
   "If Bonnie is either 
        [both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances] 
        or 
        [neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities] 
    then ..."

 So it's: 
        ( (A ∧ C) ∨ (¬A) )   ?

 But note: the second part says "neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes ..." -> that is ¬A. There's no mention of chaperoning in the second part? 

 However, the condition in the conclusion is: 
        Bonnie is either (A and C) OR (not A) 

 So: (A ∧ C) ∨ ¬A

 Now the consequence: then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.

        StudentAttendsSchool B ∨ (Inactive B ∧ Disinterested B)

 Therefore, the conclusion to formalize is:

        ( ( (YoungChild B ∨ Teenager B) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer B ∧ ChaperonesDances B ) ∨ ¬ ( (YoungChild B ∨ Teenager B) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer B ) )
        → 
        ( StudentAttendsSchool B ∨ (Inactive B ∧ Disinterested B) )

 However, note that the condition can be simplified: 
        (A ∧ C) ∨ ¬A = (¬A) ∨ (A ∧ C) = ¬A ∨ C   [because: ¬A ∨ (A ∧ C) = (¬A ∨ A) ∧ (¬A ∨ C) = true ∧ (¬A ∨ C) = ¬A ∨ C]

 But wait: 
        ¬A ∨ (A ∧ C) = (¬A ∨ A) ∧ (¬A ∨ C) = true ∧ (¬A ∨ C) = ¬A ∨ C.

 So the condition becomes: ¬A ∨ C.

 Therefore, the conclusion is:

        (¬A ∨ C) → (StudentAttendsSchool B ∨ (Inactive B ∧ Disinterested B))

 But note: A is defined as (YoungChild B ∨ Teenager B) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer B.

 However, let me double-check the original:

        "Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities"

        The second part: "neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes ..." -> that is ¬A. But note: the first part is A and C, the second part is ¬A. So condition: (A ∧ C) ∨ ¬A.

        We can write it as: ¬A ∨ (A ∧ C) = (¬A ∨ A) ∧ (¬A ∨ C) = true ∧ (¬A ∨ C) = ¬A ∨ C.

        So condition: ¬A ∨ C.

        But note: the condition does not require ¬C in the second part? The second part only says ¬A. So Bonnie could be ¬A and still be C? Or not C? The condition doesn't say anything about C in the second part.

        Therefore, we must use the condition as: (A ∧ C) ∨ ¬A.

        However, note that the condition does not force that if ¬A then ¬C? It doesn't say that. So we must use the disjunction as given.

        Alternatively, we can leave it as: (A ∧ C) ∨ ¬A.

        But note: the condition is equivalent to ¬A ∨ C? Let me test:

          If ¬A is true, then the condition holds regardless of C -> so condition holds even if C is true? That matches the disjunction: (A∧C)∨¬A holds when ¬A holds.

          If A is true, then we require C to be true (because then A∧C must hold). So condition: when A is true, then C must be true.

          Therefore, condition: (A → C) ∧ (¬A → true) -> which is equivalent to A → C.

        Actually: (A ∧ C) ∨ ¬A = ¬A ∨ (A ∧ C) = (¬A ∨ A) ∧ (¬A ∨ C) = true ∧ (¬A ∨ C) = ¬A ∨ C = A → C.

        So condition: A → C.

        But wait: the condition is exactly A → C? 

        However, note the original: 
          "either (A and C) or ¬A" -> that is equivalent to A → C? 

          Yes: A → C is equivalent to ¬A ∨ C, and we have shown that (A∧C)∨¬A = ¬A∨C.

        Therefore, the condition is: A → C.

        So the conclusion becomes:

          (A → C) → (StudentAttendsSchool B ∨ (Inactive B ∧ Disinterested B))

        But note: the original conclusion says "then Bonnie is either a student ... or ...". 

        Therefore, we formalize the conclusion as:

          ( ( (YoungChild B ∨ Teenager B) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer B ) → ChaperonesDances B ) 
          → 
          ( StudentAttendsSchool B ∨ (Inactive B ∧ Disinterested B) )

        However, wait: the condition was (A → C) and A = (YoungChild B ∨ Teenager B) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer B, C = ChaperonesDances B.

        So we write:

          axiom Bonnie : Person
          theorem goal : ( ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ) → ChaperonesDances Bonnie ) 
                         → 
                         ( StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie) ) := sorry

 But note: the premises might help derive this, but we are only formalizing.

 However, let me check: the original condition was stated as an "if" with a disjunction. We have transformed it to an implication. Is that acceptable?

 Alternatively, we can formalize the condition exactly as the disjunction:

          ( ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ∧ ChaperonesDances Bonnie ) ∨ 
            ¬ ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ) 
          ) → ( ... )

 But note that the disjunction is equivalent to the implication. However, to be faithful to the text, we can use the disjunction.

 However, the text says: "If Bonnie is either [both ... and ...] or [neither ...]", meaning:

          Condition = (A ∧ C) ∨ (¬A)

        So:

          theorem goal : ( ( ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ) ∧ ChaperonesDances Bonnie ) ∨ 
                          ¬ ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ) 
                        ) → 
                        ( StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie) ) := sorry

 This is equivalent to the implication version, but we'll use the disjunction as stated.

 Now, let's define the predicates.

 We'll have:

   Person : Type
   Bonnie : Person

   InClub : Person → Prop
   PerformsInTalentShows : Person → Prop
   AttendsSchoolEvents : Person → Prop
   EngagedWithSchoolEvents : Person → Prop
   Inactive : Person → Prop
   Disinterested : Person → Prop
   ChaperonesDances : Person → Prop
   StudentAttendsSchool : Person → Prop
   YoungChild : Person → Prop
   Teenager : Person → Prop
   WishesToFurtherCareer : Person → Prop

 Premises:

   P1: ∀ p, InClub p → (PerformsInTalentShows p → AttendsSchoolEvents p ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents p)
        But note: the premise says "People in this club who perform ...", so we have:
          ∀ p, InClub p ∧ PerformsInTalentShows p → AttendsSchoolEvents p ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents p

        We can write:
          axiom P1 : ∀ p : Person, InClub p → PerformsInTalentShows p → AttendsSchoolEvents p ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents p

   P2: ∀ p, InClub p → (PerformsInTalentShows p ∨ (Inactive p ∧ Disinterested p))

   P3: ∀ p, InClub p → ChaperonesDances p → ¬ StudentAttendsSchool p

   P4: ∀ p, InClub p → (Inactive p ∧ Disinterested p) → ChaperonesDances p

   P5: ∀ p, InClub p → ( (YoungChild p ∨ Teenager p) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer p ) → StudentAttendsSchool p

   P6: InClub Bonnie   (and we ignore the tautology)

 Therefore, we write:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type

axiom InClub : Person → Prop
axiom PerformsInTalentShows : Person → Prop
axiom AttendsSchoolEvents : Person → Prop
axiom EngagedWithSchoolEvents : Person → Prop
axiom Inactive : Person → Prop
axiom Disinterested : Person → Prop
axiom ChaperonesDances : Person → Prop
axiom StudentAttendsSchool : Person → Prop
axiom YoungChild : Person → Prop
axiom Teenager : Person → Prop
axiom WishesToFurtherCareer : Person → Prop

axiom Bonnie : Person

axiom P1 : ∀ p : Person, InClub p → PerformsInTalentShows p → AttendsSchoolEvents p ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents p
axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, InClub p → PerformsInTalentShows p ∨ (Inactive p ∧ Disinterested p)
axiom P3 : ∀ p : Person, InClub p → ChaperonesDances p → ¬ StudentAttendsSchool p
axiom P4 : ∀ p : Person, InClub p → (Inactive p ∧ Disinterested p) → ChaperonesDances p
axiom P5 : ∀ p : Person, InClub p → ( (YoungChild p ∨ Teenager p) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer p ) → StudentAttendsSchool p
axiom P6 : InClub Bonnie

-- Conclusion: 
-- Condition: ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ∧ ChaperonesDances Bonnie ) ∨ 
--            ¬ ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie )
-- Then: StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

theorem goal : 
  ( ( ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ∧ ChaperonesDances Bonnie ) ∨ 
      ¬ ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ) 
    ) 
  ) → 
  ( StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie) ) := sorry
</lean>

However, note: the condition in the conclusion is an "if" clause, so we are stating that if the disjunction holds, then the consequence holds. But note that the disjunction is always true? Because it's of the form (X ∨ ¬X). 

Wait, let me see: the condition is (A ∧ C) ∨ ¬A, which is equivalent to ¬A ∨ (A ∧ C) and that is equivalent to ¬A ∨ C? But note: ¬A ∨ (A ∧ C) is not equivalent to ¬A ∨ C? Actually:

  ¬A ∨ (A ∧ C) = (¬A ∨ A) ∧ (¬A ∨ C) = true ∧ (¬A ∨ C) = ¬A ∨ C.

But ¬A ∨ C is not a tautology? It depends on A and C.

However, the condition is not always true? For example, if A is true and C is false, then ¬A is false and (A∧C) is false -> so the disjunction is false.

Therefore, the condition is not always true. So the theorem is conditional.

But note: the condition in the conclusion is exactly the disjunction we wrote.

Alternatively, we can write the condition as:

  (A → C)   [because the condition fails when A is true and C is false]

But we are formalizing the text literally.

So we leave it as the disjunction.

However, note: the second part of the disjunction is "neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes ...", which we interpreted as ¬A. But note: "neither is a young child nor teenager" is not exactly ¬A? 

A = (YoungChild p ∨ Teenager p) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer p

So ¬A = ¬( (YoungChild p ∨ Teenager p) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer p )

Which is equivalent to: ¬(YoungChild p ∨ Teenager p) ∨ ¬WishesToFurtherCareer p

But note: "neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes ..." might be interpreted as:

  not being a young child or teenager who wishes ... -> that is ¬A.

So it's correct.

Therefore, the code above is our formalization.

Explanation:
1. `Person` is the type representing all individuals
2. Predicates defined for all properties mentioned:
   - Club membership (`InClub`)
   - Behaviors (`PerformsInTalentShows`, `AttendsSchoolEvents`, etc.)
   - Demographics (`YoungChild`, `Teenager`)
   - Statuses (`StudentAttendsSchool`, `Inactive`, etc.)
3. Premises P1-P6 directly translate the given statements:
   - P1: Talent show performers → engaged attendees
   - P2: Dichotomy between performers or inactive members
   - P3: Chaperones aren't students
   - P4: Inactive members chaperone
   - P5: Ambitious youth are students
   - P6: Bonnie is in the club
4. The conclusion formalizes:
   - Antecedent: Bonnie is either (young/teen AND ambitious AND chaperones) OR NOT (young/teen AND ambitious)
   - Consequent: Bonnie is either a student OR inactive/disinterested
5. The theorem uses `sorry` as a placeholder for proof


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion about Bonnie.
 The goal is to prove:
   ( ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ∧ ChaperonesDances Bonnie ) ∨
     ¬ ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ) ) →
   ( StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie) )

 We have axioms P1 to P6.

 Approach:
 Let H be the antecedent: 
   H : ((YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ∧ ChaperonesDances Bonnie) ∨ 
       ¬ ((YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie)

 We need to show: StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

 We know Bonnie is in the club (P6).

 From P2, since Bonnie is in the club, we have:
   PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

 So one disjunct of the conclusion is (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie). If we can show that sometimes we get that, 
 but note the implication: we have to use the antecedent H.

 Alternatively, we might break into cases on H.

 Case 1: Suppose we have 
          (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ∧ ChaperonesDances Bonnie
   Then we have:
        (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie   [from the conjunction]
        and ChaperonesDances Bonnie.

   Now, by P5: 
        ∀ p, InClub p → ((YoungChild p ∨ Teenager p) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer p) → StudentAttendsSchool p
   So applying to Bonnie (with InClub Bonnie by P6) we get:
        StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie.

   So in this case we have StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie, which gives the left disjunct of the conclusion.

 Case 2: Suppose we have 
          ¬ ((YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie)

   We don't immediately get StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie. But note we have from P2:
        PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   We want to show that if we don't have the condition for being a student (i.e., the negation) then we might still get 
   either the student part or the inactive part. However, note that we don't have a direct link.

   But observe: we have P4 and P3.

   Alternatively, note that the conclusion is a disjunction. We are already getting from P2 a disjunction that includes 
   (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie). So if we can show that in this case we don't necessarily get StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie, 
   but we might get the inactive part, then we can use the disjunction.

   However, we must be cautious: the antecedent in this case doesn't tell us anything about inactivity.

   But note: we don't have an obligation to prove StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie in this case. We just have to prove the disjunction.

   Since from P2 we have:
        PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   We can break into two subcases:

   Subcase 2a: PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie.
        Then by P1: 
             ∀ p, InClub p → PerformsInTalentShows p → AttendsSchoolEvents p ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents p
        This gives us information about Bonnie attending events, but not directly about StudentAttendsSchool or inactivity.

        How does this help? Actually, it doesn't seem to directly help for the conclusion.

        We need to show either StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie or (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie). 
        But we have PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie, so the second disjunct of P2 is false? Actually, no: P2 says that one of the two holds.

        But note: we are in the case where we have PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie, so we don't have (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie) necessarily.

        Now, we have to consider: can we get StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie? We don't have the condition for P5 because we are in the case where 
        we have the negation of ((YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie). So we cannot apply P5.

        How else can we get StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie? We don't have an axiom that gives it without the condition.

        This suggests that in this subcase we might not be able to prove StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie, but note the conclusion is a disjunction: 
        we are currently stuck because we don't have StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie and we don't have (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie) (because we have the other disjunct of P2).

        This is a problem.

   Let me reexamine the axioms:

   We have P3: 
        ∀ p, InClub p → ChaperonesDances p → ¬ StudentAttendsSchool p

   In Case 2, we do not have the condition that would force StudentAttendsSchool via P5, but we also don't have ChaperonesDances Bonnie? 
   Actually, in Case 2 we don't have any information about ChaperonesDances Bonnie.

   However, note that in Case 1 we had ChaperonesDances Bonnie, but in Case 2 we don't have the antecedent that gives ChaperonesDances Bonnie.

   So in Case 2, we don't know if Bonnie chaperones dances.

   Now, let's look at P4:
        ∀ p, InClub p → (Inactive p ∧ Disinterested p) → ChaperonesDances p

   So if Bonnie is inactive and disinterested, then she chaperones dances.

   Then by P3, if she chaperones dances then she is not a student.

   But again, we are in Subcase 2a: she performs in talent shows. Then by P1 she attends school events and is engaged. 
   This doesn't contradict inactivity? Actually, if she is inactive (which would be part of the other disjunct) then she doesn't perform? 
   But we have PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie, so she is not inactive? 

   How do we know? We don't have an axiom that says inactive people don't perform. 

   However, note that P2 says: 
        InClub p → PerformsInTalentShows p ∨ (Inactive p ∧ Disinterested p)

   So if she performs, then she is not inactive? Actually, no: the disjunction is inclusive. But note that if she performs, 
   then the disjunct (Inactive p ∧ Disinterested p) is false? Not necessarily: we don't have an axiom that says these are exclusive.

   But wait: if she is inactive and disinterested, does that preclude performing? The axioms don't say.

   This suggests that we might have a problem.

   However, note that in Subcase 2a we have PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie, and we are trying to prove 
        StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   We don't have (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie) because we have the other disjunct? Actually, no: we have PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie, 
   but that doesn't necessarily mean she isn't inactive? We don't have an axiom that says inactive people don't perform.

   So we cannot rule out that she is both inactive and disinterested and performing? That would be inconsistent? Not by the axioms.

   But note: P2 says "or", so it could be both? Actually, in logic, "or" is inclusive. So we cannot assume that if she performs then she is not inactive.

   Therefore, we cannot derive a contradiction. So we are stuck in Subcase 2a: we have PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie, but we don't know if she is inactive or not.

   How can we get the disjunction? We have two possibilities from P2: either she performs or she is inactive and disinterested.

   But we are already in the subcase where she performs. So we don't have the inactive part. And we don't have StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie.

   So we cannot prove the conclusion in Subcase 2a.

   This suggests that the theorem might not hold? But wait, let me check the entire context.

   Alternatively, note that the antecedent H is:
        [Case 1: (young/teen ∧ wishes ∧ chaperones)] OR [Case 2: ¬ (young/teen ∧ wishes)]

   In Case 1 we proved the conclusion (by getting StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie).

   In Case 2, we have ¬ (young/teen ∧ wishes). Now, we want to show the conclusion. We have P2 for Bonnie:

        PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   So if we can show that if Bonnie performs then we get StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie? But we don't have an axiom for that.

   Or perhaps we can show that if she performs then we get a contradiction? Or we get StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie by some other means?

   We have P5 that gives StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie only if she is young/teen and wishes. But we are in the case where we don't have that.

   So if she is not young/teen or doesn't wish, then P5 doesn't apply.

   How else can we get StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie? There is no other axiom.

   Therefore, in Case 2, if Bonnie performs, we cannot get StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie. And we don't have the inactive part. 
   So we cannot prove the disjunction.

   But wait: the disjunction we need is StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie OR (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie). 
   In the subcase where she performs, we don't have the inactive part, and we don't have the student part. So we are stuck.

   Therefore, the theorem might not hold? Or did I miss something?

   Let me look again at the entire argument.

   Alternatively, note that in Case 2 we have ¬ (young/teen ∧ wishes). Now, we have P2: 
        PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   We can break Case 2 into two subcases:

   Subcase 2a: PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie -> then we don't have the inactive part? But we don't know.

   Actually, we don't have an axiom that says if you perform then you are not inactive. So we cannot assume that.

   Therefore, it is possible that Bonnie is both performing and inactive? Then we would have the inactive part? 
   But note: the inactive part requires both inactive and disinterested. So even if she is inactive, if she is not disinterested, we don't get the disjunct.

   This is getting messy.

   Another idea: use the fact that if she is inactive and disinterested, then by P4 she chaperones dances. Then by P3, she is not a student.

   But in Case 2, we don't have the condition that would make her a student (via P5) because we have the negation of the condition.

   However, note that we are trying to prove the disjunction: either she is a student OR she is inactive and disinterested.

   So if she is inactive and disinterested, then we have the second disjunct.

   And if she is not inactive and disinterested, then by P2 she must perform (since the disjunction is exclusive? No, but if she is not inactive and disinterested, then the second disjunct fails, so she must perform).

   But then we are back to Subcase 2a: she performs and we don't have inactive and disinterested, and we don't have student.

   So we are stuck.

   Therefore, I suspect the theorem is not provable. But let me check the original problem.

   The antecedent H is a tautology? Actually, H is of the form: (A ∧ B ∧ C) ∨ ¬(A ∧ B) 
   where A = (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie), B = WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie, and C = ChaperonesDances Bonnie.

   Note that C is not used in the negation. So H is always true? Because:
        If (A ∧ B) is true, then we can take the left disjunct by also having C? But we don't necessarily have C. 
        Actually, the left disjunct requires A ∧ B ∧ C, so if we have A ∧ B but not C, then we cannot use the left. Then we must use the right: ¬(A ∧ B) which would be false.

   Therefore, H is not a tautology. It is equivalent to: (A ∧ B) → C   ??? Let me see:

        H = (A ∧ B ∧ C) ∨ ¬(A ∧ B) 
           = (A ∧ B → C) ? No.

        Actually:
          (A ∧ B ∧ C) ∨ ¬(A ∧ B) 
          = (A ∧ B → C) is not equivalent.

        Example: if A and B are true and C is false, then H is false.

        So H is not always true.

   Therefore, we are given that H holds. In particular, if A ∧ B is true, then we must have C (because otherwise H would be false). 
   So H is equivalent to: (A ∧ B) → C   ??? Not exactly:

        H = (A ∧ B ∧ C) ∨ ¬(A ∧ B)
           = (A ∧ B) → C   ??? Let's check:
              If A∧B is true, then H becomes C ∨ false = C. So H implies that if A∧B then C.
              Conversely, if we have (A∧B → C), then if A∧B is true we have C, so we have A∧B∧C. If A∧B is false, then we have ¬(A∧B). So H holds.

        Therefore, H is equivalent to (A ∧ B) → C.

   So the antecedent is: 
        ((YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie) → ChaperonesDances Bonnie

   And we want to prove:
        StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   Now, we know Bonnie is in the club (P6).

   We have P2: 
        PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   So if we can show that if Bonnie performs then she is a student, then we are done? Because then we have:
        If she is inactive and disinterested, then we have the second disjunct.
        If she performs, then we have StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie.

   But we don't have an axiom that says performing implies student.

   However, note P5: 
        ∀ p, InClub p → ((YoungChild p ∨ Teenager p) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer p) → StudentAttendsSchool p

   So if Bonnie is young/teen and wishes, then she is a student. But we don't know if she is young/teen and wishes.

   But we have the antecedent H: which says that if she is young/teen and wishes then she chaperones dances.

   And by P3: 
        ∀ p, InClub p → ChaperonesDances p → ¬ StudentAttendsSchool p

   So if she is young/teen and wishes, then she chaperones dances (by H), and then by P3 she is not a student.

   But by P5, if she is young/teen and wishes, then she is a student.

   Therefore, if she is young/teen and wishes, we get a contradiction: she is a student and not a student.

   Therefore, it cannot be that she is young/teen and wishes.

   So we must have ¬ (A ∧ B), i.e., ¬((YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie)

   Then by P2, we have:
        PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   Now, we need to show the disjunction: StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie OR (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   But note: we have just deduced that ¬(A∧B) holds. So we cannot use P5 to get StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie.

   And we don't have any other way to get StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie.

   So we must rely on the disjunction from P2. But the disjunction from P2 is exactly the second disjunct OR the first disjunct (performing). 
   However, the conclusion requires either StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie OR (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie). 

   We have (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie) in the second part of P2, but if we get the first part (performing) then we don't have that.

   So we are stuck again.

   But wait: we have a contradiction in the case where she is young/teen and wishes? So that case is impossible. 
   Therefore, we are only in the case where she is not young/teen or not wishes.

   And then we have P2: performing or inactive.

   Now, if she is inactive and disinterested, then we have the second disjunct of the conclusion.

   If she performs, then we don't have the inactive part? But we don't know.

   However, note that we have no way to get StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie in this case.

   Therefore, the only hope is to show that if she performs, then she must be a student? But we have no axiom for that.

   Alternatively, we might show that if she performs, then she cannot be chaperoning? But we don't have that.

   Let me try to derive a contradiction if she is young/teen and wishes? We already did: it leads to her being a student and not a student.

   Therefore, we have established that ¬(A∧B) holds. So we are in Case 2.

   Now, we have P2: 
        PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   And we want to show: 
        StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   So if we can show that if she performs then she is a student, we are done. But we cannot.

   However, note that we have no information that would make her a student. So the conclusion might require that we have the inactive part.

   But we don't have an axiom that says that if she performs then she is not inactive. So it is possible that she is both performing and inactive? 
   Then we would have the inactive part? But wait, the inactive part requires both inactive and disinterested. So if she is inactive and disinterested, then we have the disjunct.

   But if she is inactive and disinterested, then by P4 she chaperones dances. And then by P3, she is not a student. That's consistent.

   However, if she is performing and not inactive (or not disinterested), then we have neither StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie nor the inactive part.

   Therefore, the conclusion might not hold.

   But wait, the problem states that the axioms are validated and the theorem is to be proven. So there must be a proof.

   Let me try to use P1 and see if we can get anything.

   If she performs, then by P1 she attends school events and is engaged. Does that imply she is a student? Not by any axiom.

   Another idea: perhaps we can show that she must be inactive and disinterested? But we have no axiom that forces that if she is not young/teen and not wishes then she is inactive.

   Given the above, I think the theorem is not provable. But let me double-check with a truth assignment.

   We can try to build a model where the premises hold and the antecedent H holds, but the conclusion fails.

   Let me assume:

   Bonnie is in the club (P6).

   Let A = (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) and B = WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie. We have H: (A∧B → ChaperonesDances Bonnie). 
   We want the conclusion: StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   Suppose we set:
        A = false, B = false. Then H holds (since the implication is true).

   Now, from P2: we need either PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie or (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie). 
        Let us set: PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie = true, and Inactive Bonnie = false, Disinterested Bonnie = false.

   Then the conclusion is: StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (false ∧ false) = StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ false.

   We need this to be true, so we must set StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie = true? But we have no axiom that forces it.

   However, note P5: 
        InClub Bonnie → ( (A∨B?) ... wait, P5: 
        ∀ p, InClub p → ((YoungChild p ∨ Teenager p) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer p) → StudentAttendsSchool p

   Since we have A=false and B=false, the condition ((YoungChild p ∨ Teenager p) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer p) is false, so P5 doesn't force StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie.

   And there is no other axiom that forces StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie.

   So we can set StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie = false.

   Then the conclusion is false.

   Now, check the premises:

   P1: InClub Bonnie → PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie → AttendsSchoolEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents Bonnie.
        We have InClub Bonnie=true, PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie=true, so we need AttendsSchoolEvents Bonnie and EngagedWithSchoolEvents Bonnie. 
        We can set them to true.

   P2: InClub Bonnie → PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie) -> true because she performs.

   P3: InClub Bonnie → ChaperonesDances Bonnie → ¬ StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie.
        We haven't set ChaperonesDances Bonnie. We have H: (A∧B) → ChaperonesDances Bonnie. Since A∧B is false, H is true regardless of ChaperonesDances Bonnie.
        We can set ChaperonesDances Bonnie arbitrarily, say false. Then P3: true → false → ... is true.

   P4: InClub Bonnie → (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie) → ChaperonesDances Bonnie.
        Since Inactive and Disinterested are false, the implication is true.

   P5: InClub Bonnie → ((YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie) → StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie.
        The condition is false, so true.

   P6: true.

   So all premises are true, H is true, but the conclusion is false.

   Therefore, the theorem is not valid.

   But wait, the antecedent H in the theorem is an implication. In the model above, H is true, and the conclusion is false.

   So the statement of the theorem is not valid.

   However, the problem says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", meaning the premises are true, and we are to prove the theorem.

   But our model shows a counterexample.

   Therefore, the theorem is not provable.

   But note: the problem asks for a proof. Given that we found a counterexample, we must conclude that the theorem is false.

   However, the task is to replace 'sorry' with a proof. But if it's not true, then we cannot.

   But wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the antecedent? The antecedent is:

        ( ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ∧ ChaperonesDances Bonnie ) ∨
          ¬ ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ) )

   In our model, we have:
        (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) = false
        WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie = false
        ChaperonesDances Bonnie = false   [we set arbitrarily]

   Then the left disjunct: false ∧ false ∧ false = false.
   The right disjunct: ¬ (false ∧ false) = ¬false = true.
   So H = true.

   Conclusion: StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie) = false ∨ (false ∧ false) = false.

   So the implication H → conclusion is false in this model.

   Therefore, the theorem is not valid.

   Given that, we cannot provide a proof.

   But the problem says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", which might imply that the premises are consistent and the theorem is true? 
   Or does it mean that the axioms are syntactically valid?

   Since we found a counterexample, the theorem is false.

   However, the task is to provide a proof. If it's false, then we cannot.

   But note: the problem says "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". If the theorem is not true, then there is no proof.

   Therefore, I must conclude that the theorem is not provable from the premises.

   But let me double-check the counterexample:

   We have:
     InClub Bonnie = true.
     PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie = true.
     Inactive Bonnie = false, Disinterested Bonnie = false.
     StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie = false.
     YoungChild Bonnie = false, Teenager Bonnie = false, WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie = false.
     ChaperonesDances Bonnie = false.

   Check P1: true → true → (we set AttendsSchoolEvents and EngagedWithSchoolEvents to true) -> holds.
   P2: true → true (because she performs) -> holds.
   P3: true → false (because she doesn't chaperone) -> true (since false implies anything).
   P4: true → (false) -> true.
   P5: true → (false) -> true.
   P6: true.

   H: (false ∨ false) is false, so (false ∧ false ∧ false) is false, but the second part ¬(false) is true, so H=true.

   Conclusion: false.

   So the implication H → conclusion is true → false = false.

   Therefore, the statement is not valid.

   However, the problem asks for a proof. Since there is a counterexample, we cannot provide a proof.

   But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the interpretation of H? The left disjunct is:
        (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ∧ ChaperonesDances Bonnie

   In our model, we have:
        (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) = false, so the entire conjunction is false.

   The right disjunct is: ¬ ( (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie ) = ¬(false) = true.

   So H is true.

   Conclusion is false.

   So the theorem does not hold.

   Given the above, the answer should be that the theorem is false.

   But the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain".

   However, the task is to replace 'sorry' with a proof. If the theorem is false, then we cannot.

   But note: the problem says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", which might mean that the axioms are not only syntactically valid but also that they are true in the intended model? 
   But our counterexample shows they can be true while the theorem is false.

   Therefore, I must answer that the theorem is false.

   But the instruction says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". If it's false, there is no proof.

   However, the problem might have been intended to be true, and my counterexample might be invalid because of some hidden constraint.

   Let me reexamine the axioms:

   P1: InClub p → PerformsInTalentShows p → AttendsSchoolEvents p ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents p
   P2: InClub p → PerformsInTalentShows p ∨ (Inactive p ∧ Disinterested p)
   P3: InClub p → ChaperonesDances p → ¬ StudentAttendsSchool p
   P4: InClub p → (Inactive p ∧ Disinterested p) → ChaperonesDances p
   P5: InClub p → ((YoungChild p ∨ Teenager p) ∧ WishesToFurtherCareer p) → StudentAttendsSchool p

   Is there any interaction that forces StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie to be true in the case where she performs and is not young/teen and not wishes?

   None that I see.

   Therefore, I conclude the theorem is false.

   So I will not provide a proof, but instead, I will answer that it is false.

   However, the problem says "Provide the complete code with proof". If I cannot provide a proof, what should I do?

   Given the instructions, I must output the code with the theorem and then the answer.

   But I cannot fill in the sorry because there is no proof.

   Alternatively, I might try to prove it by contradiction? Let's try.

   We have the antecedent H. We also have the negation of the conclusion as an additional temporary hypothesis and derive a contradiction.

   The negation of the conclusion is:
        ¬ (StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie))
        = ¬ StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∧ ¬ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   So we have:
        (1) ¬ StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie
        (2) ¬ Inactive Bonnie ∨ ¬ Disinterested Bonnie   [by de Morgan]

   From P2 and P6, we have:
        PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

   But by (2) and the second part of the negation, we have that (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie) is false. Therefore, we must have:
        PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie

   Then by P1, we have:
        AttendsSchoolEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents Bonnie

   Now, we have H: 
        [ (A∧B∧C) ∨ ¬(A∧B) ]

   We also have (1) ¬ StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie.

   Now, can we derive a contradiction?

   We have P5: 
        InClub Bonnie → (A∧B) → StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie

   So if we had A∧B, then we would have StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie, contradicting (1). Therefore, we must have ¬(A∧B).

   So H becomes: ¬(A∧B) (since the left disjunct is false because we don't have A∧B).

   But we already have ¬(A∧B) from the above.

   Now, we have PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie (as established).

   We have no further contradiction.

   So we have:
        ¬ StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie, 
        PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie,
        ¬(A∧B)

   This is consistent with the premises.

   Therefore, we cannot derive a contradiction.

   Hence, the theorem is indeed false.

   Given the above, I will output the code as is with 'sorry' and then answer False.

   But the problem says "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". Since there is none, I cannot.

   However, the instructions also say: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain".

   So I will output the code unchanged and then answer False.

   But note: the problem says "Provide the complete code with proof", so if I leave 'sorry', it is not a proof.

   Alternatively, I might use `by admit` to bypass the proof, but that is not a valid proof.

   Given the instructions, I think the intended answer is to recognize that the theorem is false.

   Therefore, I will output the code with 'sorry' and then answer False.

   However, the problem says "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term", but there isn't one.

   So I must leave it as sorry and then say False.

   But let me reread the task: "TASK: Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." -> if there is no valid proof term, then I cannot.

   Therefore, I will not change the sorry.

   But then the code is not complete.

   Given the dilemma, I think the best is to output the code with sorry and then answer False.

   Or perhaps use `False.elim` or something, but that would require a proof of False, which we don't have.

   I think the answer is to state that the theorem is false.

   So I will output the same code with sorry, and then answer:
        ANSWER: False

   But note: the problem says "Provide the complete code with proof", so if I leave sorry, it's not complete.

   However, the instructions also say: "After your code, provide your answer".

   So I will do:

<lean>
... [the given code with the theorem still having sorry] ...
</lean>
ANSWER: False

   But to be safe, I will include a comment in the code that the theorem is not provable.

   However, the problem says: "Do NOT modify the axioms or theorem statement".

   So I cannot add a comment.

   Therefore, I will output the code unchanged and then answer False.

   Let's do it.


=== RESPONSE ===
After analyzing the given axioms and the theorem, I determined that the theorem is not provable. The premises do not entail the conclusion, as demonstrated by a counterexample where all premises and the antecedent hold, but the conclusion is false. Specifically:

- Set `YoungChild Bonnie = false`, `Teenager Bonnie = false`, `WishesToFurtherCareer Bonnie = false`, `ChaperonesDances Bonnie = false`, `PerformsInTalentShows Bonnie = true`, `Inactive Bonnie = false`, `Disinterested Bonnie = false`, and `StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie = false`.
- All premises (`P1`-`P6`) hold in this model, and the antecedent `H` is true (since `¬((false ∨ false) ∧ false)` is true).
- However, the conclusion `StudentAttendsSchool Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)` evaluates to `false ∨ (false ∧ false) = false`.

Thus, the theorem is false under these axioms.
