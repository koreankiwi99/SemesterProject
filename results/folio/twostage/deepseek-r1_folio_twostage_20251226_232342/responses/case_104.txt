--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the following:
Premises:
1. It costs $205 to take the GRE test, which is cheaper than $300.
    - We might not need this for the conclusion about financial aid to Tom, but note that the cost is a fact. However, since the conclusion is about financial aid, we may not need the exact cost but rather the condition on economic hardship.

2. ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.
    - Let F(x) mean "ETS provides financial aid to x"
    - Let H(x) mean "x proves economic hardship"

3. Those living in single-parent families or having few resources available to them can prove economic hardship.
    - Let S(x) mean "x lives in a single-parent family"
    - Let R(x) mean "x has few resources"

4. Tom lives in a single-parent family.
5. Tom's dad has been out of work, and Tom has few resources available to them.
    - We are told Tom has few resources (R(Tom))
    - Also, we are told Tom lives in a single-parent family (which is already stated in premise 4, and repeated in 5? But note: premise 5 is additional: dad out of work and few resources. But we can take that as reinforcing R(Tom). However, premise 4 already says Tom lives in a single-parent family, so S(Tom) is given. And premise 5 says Tom has few resources (R(Tom)).

6. Tom is applying to take the GRE test.
    - We are told Tom is a GRE applicant. Let A(x) mean "x is applying to take the GRE test".

Conclusion: ETS provides financial aid to Tom.

So, we have:

Axioms:
- H(x) is required for F(x), and only GRE applicants (with H) get the aid? Actually, the premise says: "ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship." So it's conditional on being an applicant and proving hardship. So:
  ∀x, (A(x) ∧ H(x)) → F(x)

- How to prove H(x)? 
  Premise: Those living in single-parent families OR having few resources can prove economic hardship.
  So: ∀x, (S(x) ∨ R(x)) → H(x)

- We have:
  A(Tom)   (Tom is applying)
  S(Tom)   (Tom lives in a single-parent family)
  R(Tom)   (Tom has few resources)

From S(Tom) we get S(Tom) ∨ R(Tom) -> H(Tom). Actually, we have both S and R, so definitely H(Tom).

Then, since A(Tom) and H(Tom), we get F(Tom).

Now, we need to define:
- A type for the individuals (let's call it 'person', since we are talking about GRE applicants)
- Constants: Tom (of type person)
- Predicates:
  A : person → Prop   (is a GRE applicant)
  S : person → Prop   (lives in single-parent family)
  R : person → Prop   (has few resources)
  H : person → Prop   (proves economic hardship)
  F : person → Prop   (ETS provides financial aid to this person)

Axioms:
axiom T1 : S Tom   -- Tom lives in a single-parent family
axiom T2 : R Tom   -- Tom has few resources
axiom T3 : A Tom   -- Tom is applying

axiom R1 : ∀ (x : person), (S x ∨ R x) → H x
axiom R2 : ∀ (x : person), (A x ∧ H x) → F x

Then the theorem is: F Tom.

Note: The first premise about cost is not used in the logical deduction for the conclusion, so we skip it.

Let's code accordingly.

Based on the premises and conclusion, the Lean 4 formalization is as follows:

<lean>
axiom person : Type
axiom ETS : person → Prop
axiom FinancialAid : person → Prop
axiom GREApplicant : person → Prop
axiom ProveEconomicHardship : person → Prop
axiom LivesSingleParent : person → Prop
axiom HasFewResources : person → Prop
axiom Tom : person

axiom financial_aid_rule : ∀ (p : person), 
  GREApplicant p → ProveEconomicHardship p → ETS p → FinancialAid p

axiom hardship_rule : ∀ (p : person), 
  (LivesSingleParent p ∨ HasFewResources p) → ProveEconomicHardship p

axiom tom_applicant : GREApplicant Tom
axiom tom_single_parent : LivesSingleParent Tom
axiom tom_few_resources : HasFewResources Tom
axiom tom_ets_applicant : ETS Tom

theorem ets_aid_for_tom : FinancialAid Tom := sorry
</lean>

Explanation:
1. `person` - Type representing people/entities
2. `ETS` - Predicate for ETS interaction (required for financial aid rule)
3. `FinancialAid` - Predicate for receiving financial aid
4. `GREApplicant` - Predicate for GRE test applicants
5. `ProveEconomicHardship` - Predicate for proving economic hardship
6. `LivesSingleParent` - Predicate for living in single-parent family
7. `HasFewResources` - Predicate for having few resources
8. `Tom` - Constant representing Tom

Axioms:
- `financial_aid_rule`: Combines applicant status, proven hardship, and ETS requirement for aid
- `hardship_rule`: Shows how economic hardship is proven through family or resources
- Personal facts about Tom: Applicant status, single-parent family, low resources, and ETS interaction

The theorem `ets_aid_for_tom` declares the conclusion (unproven) that Tom receives financial aid.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and need to prove `FinancialAid Tom`.
 The key axiom for financial aid is:
   `financial_aid_rule : ∀ (p : person), GREApplicant p → ProveEconomicHardship p → ETS p → FinancialAid p`
 So for Tom, we need to show:
   1. GREApplicant Tom
   2. ProveEconomicHardship Tom
   3. ETS Tom

 We have axioms for Tom:
   `tom_applicant : GREApplicant Tom`
   `tom_ets_applicant : ETS Tom`

 So we only need to prove `ProveEconomicHardship Tom`.

 To get `ProveEconomicHardship Tom`, we use:
   `hardship_rule : ∀ (p : person), (LivesSingleParent p ∨ HasFewResources p) → ProveEconomicHardship p`

 We have for Tom:
   `tom_single_parent : LivesSingleParent Tom`
   `tom_few_resources : HasFewResources Tom`

 Either `LivesSingleParent Tom` or `HasFewResources Tom` would be enough to prove `ProveEconomicHardship Tom` via `hardship_rule`.
 Since we have `LivesSingleParent Tom`, we can use that to form a disjunction (`Or.inl`).

 Steps:
   1. Apply `financial_aid_rule` to Tom. This will require three premises: 
        - GREApplicant Tom
        - ProveEconomicHardship Tom
        - ETS Tom

   2. For `GREApplicant Tom`: use `tom_applicant`.
   3. For `ETS Tom`: use `tom_ets_applicant`.
   4. For `ProveEconomicHardship Tom`: 
          We can use `hardship_rule Tom` which requires a proof of `LivesSingleParent Tom ∨ HasFewResources Tom`.
          We can prove that disjunction by `Or.inl tom_single_parent` (since we have `LivesSingleParent Tom`).

 So the proof term for `ProveEconomicHardship Tom` is:
        `hardship_rule Tom (Or.inl tom_single_parent)`

 Thus, the entire proof term is:
        `financial_aid_rule Tom tom_applicant (hardship_rule Tom (Or.inl tom_single_parent)) tom_ets_applicant`

 Alternatively, we could have used `tom_few_resources` with `Or.inr` and that would also work.

 However, note that we have both conditions, but we only need one.

 We choose to use `tom_single_parent` with `Or.inl`.

 Therefore, we can write the proof as:

   financial_aid_rule Tom tom_applicant (hardship_rule Tom (Or.inl tom_single_parent)) tom_ets_applicant

 But note: we could have also used `tom_few_resources` (with `Or.inr`). However, the one we gave is good.

 Let's write the complete code.

 IMPORTANT: We must not change any of the given declarations, only replace `sorry` with the proof term.


=== RESPONSE ===
The proof demonstrates that Tom qualifies for financial aid using the given rules. The `financial_aid_rule` requires three premises: that Tom is a GRE applicant, that he can prove economic hardship, and that he is an ETS applicant. The `hardship_rule` establishes economic hardship through disjunctive reasoning (either living with a single parent or having few resources). Since Tom satisfies both conditions for economic hardship, either is sufficient. We use `Or.inl tom_single_parent` to satisfy the disjunction, proving economic hardship, and apply the rules accordingly.
