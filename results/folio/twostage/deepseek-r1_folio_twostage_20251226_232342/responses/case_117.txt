STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are dealing with places and their relationships.
 We have several entities: Barutin Cove, Snow Island, Greenwich Island, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica.
 We have relations:
   - "is a cove named after X": We'll have a predicate for being named after, but note the conclusion says "named after all islands in Antarctica". 
     However, note that the premise says it is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin, not an island. So we have to model two different things: 
        * being a cove
        * being named after something (which might be a settlement or an island, but note that the conclusion is about islands in Antarctica)

 Steps:
 1. We will need a type for `Place`.
 2. We have specific places: BarutinCove, SnowIsland, GreenwichIsland, DeceptionIsland, SouthShetland, Antarctica.
 3. We have a relation for "located in": `LocatedIn` (which takes two places). But note: the premise "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands" is a bit odd. 
    Actually, it says "located on", but in the context, it probably means that the South Shetland Islands are part of Antarctica? However, the premise says "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands", which might be a mistake? 
    But the logical rule is: if A is in B and B is in C then A is in C.

 Let me re-read: "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands." -> This is problematic because the South Shetland Islands are part of Antarctica, not the other way around.

 However, note the problem states: 
    "Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands."
    "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands."

 This must be a confusion in the problem. But we have to represent what is stated.

 Since we are just formalizing, we will represent the statements as given.

 But the conclusion: "Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica."

 How to model "named after"? 
    We can have a relation: `NamedAfter (a: Place) (b: Place) : Prop`
    However, note: in the premise Barutin Cove is named after a settlement (which we can model as a Place, but the settlement is not in Antarctica?).

 The conclusion is tricky: it says that Barutin Cove is named after every island that is in Antarctica. 

 But note: the conclusion says "named after all islands in Antarctica", meaning for every island that is in Antarctica, Barutin Cove is named after that island.

 This seems odd because typically a place is named after one thing. However, we have to take the statement literally.

 Alternatively, it might be a mistranslation? But we are to formalize as per the problem.

 We need:
   - A way to designate islands: `Island : Place → Prop`
   - The relation `LocatedIn` (with the transitive rule)

 However, note that in the premises, we are told that Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin. But the conclusion is about islands in Antarctica.

 How is the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin related to these islands? It doesn't say. Therefore, the conclusion might not follow? 
 But we are not to judge, just formalize.

 Steps for the conclusion:
   We want: ∀ (island : Place), Island island → LocatedIn island Antarctica → NamedAfter BarutinCove island

 But wait, the premise says Barutin Cove is named after the settlement, not after an island. So without additional premises, the conclusion does not follow? 
 Again, we are just formalizing.

 Therefore, we must have an axiom:
   T1: NamedAfter BarutinCove BarutinSettlement

 But note: the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin is a specific settlement. How do we model it? We need to introduce an entity for the settlement? 

 Let's see the conclusion: it does not mention the settlement again, so we can introduce:

   axiom Place : Type
   axiom BarutinCove : Place
   axiom BarutinSettlement : Place   -- representing the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin

   axiom NamedAfter : Place → Place → Prop
   axiom LocatedIn : Place → Place → Prop
   axiom Island : Place → Prop

   Premises:

   1. Barutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.
      We can break this into two? 
        - It is a cove: we haven't defined `Cove` as a predicate? 
        - But the conclusion doesn't mention being a cove. So we might skip it? Or if it is necessary for the logic, we define it?
        - However, the conclusion is about being named after, so we'll have:

          axiom T1 : NamedAfter BarutinCove BarutinSettlement

   2. Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island.
        This might be modeled as: LocatedIn BarutinCove SnowIsland? 
        But note: it says "on the southwest coast", which implies that BarutinCove is part of SnowIsland? 
        We'll use LocatedIn for "is part of" or "is in".

        axiom T2 : LocatedIn BarutinCove SnowIsland

   3. Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands.
        So:
          axiom T3 : LocatedIn SnowIsland SouthShetland
          axiom T4 : LocatedIn GreenwichIsland SouthShetland
          axiom T5 : LocatedIn DeceptionIsland SouthShetland

        But note: we don't have predicates for them being islands? The premise states they are islands. 
        Also, in the conclusion we care about islands. So we need to know that SnowIsland, etc. are islands? The premise doesn't say "Snow Island is an island" explicitly, but that is the name.

        So we need axioms that they are islands:

          axiom I1 : Island SnowIsland
          axiom I2 : Island GreenwichIsland
          axiom I3 : Island DeceptionIsland

        But note: the conclusion is about islands in Antarctica, so we need to know that they are islands.

   4. Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands.
        This is stated as: LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetland.

        But as we noted, that's the opposite of what we typically know. We'll go with the problem.

        axiom T6 : LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetland

   5. Transitivity: 
        axiom R1 : ∀ (A B C : Place), LocatedIn A B → LocatedIn B C → LocatedIn A C

 Conclusion: 
        Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica.

        ∀ (i : Place), Island i → LocatedIn i Antarctica → NamedAfter BarutinCove i

 However, note: there is no axiom that would make BarutinCove named after every island? We are just formalizing the structure, but we are including the specific conclusion as a theorem that we will not prove.

 But wait: the problem says "generate ... theorem declaration" with a placeholder. So we will state the theorem even if it doesn't follow (using `sorry`).

 But note: the conclusion says "all islands in Antarctica". We have introduced a predicate for islands. However, we have not stated that Antarctica is a place that contains islands? The `LocatedIn` relation for an island in Antarctica would be: if `i` is an island and `LocatedIn i Antarctica`, then we require `NamedAfter BarutinCove i`.

 The challenge: We don't have information about BarutinSettlement being an island or in Antarctica? And the conclusion is about naming the cove after islands. There is no apparent connection.

 But again, we are just formalizing.

 Let's define all the axioms and the conclusion theorem.

 We must also introduce all the places:

   Place: Type
   BarutinCove: Place
   SnowIsland: Place
   GreenwichIsland: Place
   DeceptionIsland: Place
   SouthShetland: Place   -- representing the South Shetland Islands
   Antarctica: Place
   BarutinSettlement: Place   -- the Bulgarian settlement

 But note: the conclusion does not mention the settlement, so it's okay.

 However, there might be an issue: the conclusion has "Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica". This means that for every island i that is in Antarctica, BarutinCove is named after i. 

 We have not introduced an axiom about BarutinSettlement being located anywhere? But the premise only says Barutin Cove is named after the settlement.

 Let's write the Lean code accordingly.

 Important: We must only use the relations we defined.

 Also, note the transitive rule applies to any places A, B, C.

 We are also missing the fact that BarutinCove is a cove? But the conclusion doesn't depend on it, so we skip since the predicate "Cove" isn't used elsewhere.

 If the problem had stated that the cove is named after the settlement and the settlement is in Antarctica, then we might have been able to use the transitivity? But that's not the case.

 We'll formalize as per the literal reading.

 Let's write the Lean code.

<lean>
axiom Place : Type

-- Specific places
axiom BarutinCove : Place
axiom SnowIsland : Place
axiom GreenwichIsland : Place
axiom DeceptionIsland : Place
axiom SouthShetland : Place
axiom Antarctica : Place
axiom BarutinSettlement : Place   -- the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin

-- Predicates and relations
axiom NamedAfter : Place → Place → Prop
axiom LocatedIn : Place → Place → Prop
axiom Island : Place → Prop

-- Premises

-- Also note: Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands.
axiom P6 : LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetland

-- And the transitive rule for LocatedIn

axiom P9 : Island DeceptionIsland

-- Conclusion: Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica.
theorem conclusion : ∀ (i : Place), Island i → LocatedIn i Antarctica → NamedAfter BarutinCove i :=
  sorry
</lean>

But wait: is the conclusion about the entire Antarctica? The premise says Antarctica is located in the South Shetland Islands, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the South Shetland Islands are the only part. However, we are not told anything else.

Also, note we have no information about BarutinSettlement being in Antarctica? And obviously, if we had one island in Antarctica, we have no axiom that would force that island to be named after the settlement? We are just stating the theorem.

But there's a problem: our conclusion says FOR EVERY island i in Antarctica, Barutin Cove is named after i. But we have no reason to believe that? But again, we are formalizing.

However, note: the logical rule of transitivity might help with location? For example, we can derive that BarutinCove is in SouthShetland? 
  LocatedIn BarutinCove SnowIsland (P2)
  LocatedIn SnowIsland SouthShetland (P3) 
  so by R1: LocatedIn BarutinCove SouthShetland

And also, Antarctica in SouthShetland (P6), but that doesn't help directly with islands in Antarctica? 

But more importantly, the conclusion requires that every island contained in Antarctica must be such that the cove is named after it. That's a strong statement.

We leave it to the formalization.

But note: what does "located in" mean? Is it the same as "part of"? We have used it that way.

One more thing: is Antarctica a place that is a container? And the islands are inside? But our R1 would propagate the located relation.

But wait: what if we have an island in Antarctica? How is that island located? We have:

  LocatedIn i Antarctica

By R1 and P6 (LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetland) we get LocatedIn i SouthShetland.

But we don't have any axioms that would force connections with the naming.

We are ready to output.

However, note that the conclusion does not rely on the transitivity? We are not proving, just formalizing.

But the theorem is stated as having the form:

  ∀ i, ... → ... 

And we have introduced the necessary premises.

One last note: the problem does not explicitly state that BarutinCove is a Place? We have introduced it as a Place.

We also introduced the settlement as a Place.

We must include all.

Final code:


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion provided, I've formalized the logical structure in Lean 4. The key aspects:

1. A `Place` type represents all geographic entities
2. Specific places: 
   - BarutinCove (cove)
   - BarutinSettlement (Bulgarian settlement)
   - SnowIsland/GreenwichIsland/DeceptionIsland (islands)
   - SouthShetland (island group)
   - Antarctica (continent)
3. Relations:
   - `LocatedIn` for geographical containment
   - `Island` predicate for island places
   - `NamedAfter` for naming relationships
4. Premises include both specific facts and transitivity rule
5. Conclusion formalized as a theorem with `sorry`

<lean>

The theorem states: "For any place that is an island and located in Antarctica, Barutin Cove is named after that island." All premises are converted to axioms with descriptive names, and the conclusion uses `sorry` as a placeholder for proof.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given a set of axioms and need to prove:
  ∀ (i : Place), Island i → LocatedIn i Antarctica → NamedAfter BarutinCove i

 However, looking at the axioms, we have:
   named_after: NamedAfter BarutinCove BarutinSettlement
   but note that the theorem states that for any island i that is located in Antarctica, we have NamedAfter BarutinCove i.

 But we have no axiom that links BarutinSettlement to Antarctica or to any other island.

 Let's analyze the location chain for BarutinCove:
   - LocatedIn BarutinCove SnowIsland (cove_location)
   - LocatedIn SnowIsland SouthShetland (snow_in_shetland)
   - But we also have LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetland (antarctica_in_shetland) -> this is backward.

 Note: 
   - LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetland means that Antarctica is located in SouthShetland? 
     That does not make geographical sense, but we have to go by the axioms.

 However, the theorem requires that the island i is located in Antarctica: LocatedIn i Antarctica.

 But note: we have 
   - Antarctica is located in SouthShetland: antarctica_in_shetland
   - SnowIsland is also located in SouthShetland: snow_in_shetland

 The location chain for BarutinCove goes to SnowIsland and then to SouthShetland.

 There is no axiom that says that SnowIsland (or any other island) is located in Antarctica. In fact, we have Antarctica located in SouthShetland, which suggests that Antarctica is a part of SouthShetland, not the other way around.

 Moreover, the theorem says: for any island i that is located in Antarctica. But we have no islands that are stated to be located in Antarctica. We have islands (SnowIsland, GreenwichIsland, DeceptionIsland) that are located in SouthShetland, and we have Antarctica also located in SouthShetland.

 But we are missing the connection from the island to Antarctica? Actually, the requirement for the island i is that it is located in Antarctica. We have no such island in our axioms.

 Also, note the chain for BarutinCove:
   BarutinCove -> SnowIsland -> SouthShetland

 The only thing we know about the island i is that it is located in Antarctica and is an island. But there is no axiom that tells us that Antarctica is at the top of the hierarchy? In fact, we have Antarctica located in SouthShetland, so it is a sublocation of SouthShetland.

 We also have the transitivity axiom.

 Now, can we prove that BarutinCove is located in SouthShetland?
   - Using location_transitivity: 
        LocatedIn BarutinCove SnowIsland (cove_location)
        LocatedIn SnowIsland SouthShetland (snow_in_shetland)
        Therefore, LocatedIn BarutinCove SouthShetland.

 Similarly, we have LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetland (antarctica_in_shetland).

 But we don't have any information that would force an island i that is located in Antarctica to have the property of being named after by BarutinCove? Actually, the theorem says that BarutinCove is named after i (if we read `NamedAfter BarutinCove i`). However, we only have one `named_after` axiom: `NamedAfter BarutinCove BarutinSettlement`.

 And BarutinSettlement is not an island? (we are not told that it is an island) and we are not told that it is located in Antarctica.

 So the theorem as stated requires that for every island i that is located in Antarctica, we have that the cove is named after i. But we don't have any such islands? And we don't have a way to connect BarutinSettlement to Antarctica.

 Also, note: the theorem is saying that the cove is named after every such island. That is, if there are multiple islands in Antarctica, then the cove is named after all of them? That seems very strong and we have no evidence.

 Therefore, it seems the theorem does not follow from the axioms.

 But let's check the possibility that we need to use the given islands.

 We are only given:

   BarutinCove, BarutinSettlement, SnowIsland, GreenwichIsland, DeceptionIsland, SouthShetland, Antarctica.

 And we know that SnowIsland is an island (island_snow) and we know that SnowIsland is located in SouthShetland (snow_in_shetland) but NOT in Antarctica. In fact, we have LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetland, which is the opposite.

 Since the theorem requires that the island i is located in Antarctica, we would need to have at least one island that is located in Antarctica. However, the axioms do not state that any island is located in Antarctica. The only location of Antarctica is that it is located in SouthShetland.

 Therefore, the theorem is about an arbitrary island i that is located in Antarctica. Since we have no such island in the premises, it might be that we cannot prove it for any i? But note, the theorem is a universal statement. If there is no such island (i.e., no island in Antarctica) then the statement is vacuously true? However, in the logic we are using, if we cannot provide an island i that is both an island and located in Antarctica, then we can still have the universal statement? But the problem is that we must prove it for every i that satisfies the two conditions.

 However, we have no premises that would establish NamedAfter BarutinCove i for an arbitrary i that satisfies Island i and LocatedIn i Antarctica.

 Moreover, we have only one named_after axiom: relating BarutinCove and BarutinSettlement. And BarutinSettlement is not necessarily an island and we don't know its location.

 Therefore, it seems impossible to prove the theorem from the given premises.

 Hence, we should return a proof that fails? Or note that the theorem is not provable.

 But the task is to replace `sorry` with a valid proof term. Since the theorem is not provable from the axioms, what can we do?

 However, note: the theorem statement says:
   ∀ (i : Place), Island i → LocatedIn i Antarctica → NamedAfter BarutinCove i

 We have no way to prove `NamedAfter BarutinCove i` for any `i` that satisfies `Island i` and `LocatedIn i Antarctica`, because:

   - We have no axiom that says that BarutinSettlement is the only place that BarutinCove is named after? Actually, the `named_after` axiom only gives one instance.

   - We have no way to connect an arbitrary island i in Antarctica to BarutinSettlement.

 Therefore, the theorem as stated is false? Or unprovable?

 After careful thought, the theorem is actually unprovable with the given axioms.

 However, note: the theorem is about BarutinCove being named after every island in Antarctica. But we have no evidence that it is named after any island (except possibly BarutinSettlement, but again we don't know if BarutinSettlement is an island or in Antarctica).

 But wait: the premises do not require that there is any island in Antarctica. So in the absence of any island in Antarctica, the statement is vacuously true? 

 However, in Lean, when we have a universal quantifier with an implication, we must provide a proof for any i that satisfies the two conditions. We don't have to construct one, but we must handle any such i that is given.

 But if we have no information about i other than Island i and LocatedIn i Antarctica, we cannot conclude NamedAfter BarutinCove i.

 Therefore, the theorem is not provable.

 So what should we do? 

 We must provide a correct Lean proof. Since we cannot prove it, we might have to leave the theorem as unproven? But the task says to replace `sorry` by a valid proof term.

 The only valid proof term in such a case would be to use `False.elim` on an unprovable goal? But we don't have a contradiction.

 Alternatively, we might notice that the theorem is stated in a way that is not supported by the premises. However, the instructions say to use the validated axioms and the theorem declaration.

 After re-examination:

   The theorem says: BarutinCove is named after every island that is located in Antarctica.

   Our premises:

      named_after : NamedAfter BarutinCove BarutinSettlement

   So if BarutinSettlement is an island and is located in Antarctica, then we can prove it for i = BarutinSettlement. Otherwise, we don't.

   But we are not given that BarutinSettlement is an island, nor that it is located in Antarctica.

 Alternatively, if there were a chain of reasoning that forces BarutinSettlement to be in Antarctica? 

   We have:

      LocatedIn BarutinCove SnowIsland
      LocatedIn SnowIsland SouthShetland
      LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetland

   And transitivity. But that only gives that BarutinCove is in SouthShetland and Antarctica is in SouthShetland. They are both in SouthShetland, but not necessarily related to each other.

   We do not have any axiom that says that places located in the same larger place are related by naming?

   So we have no way to prove the theorem.

 But why was the theorem stated? Perhaps there is a misinterpretation of the location chain?

   Note: The theorem requires the island i to be located in Antarctica. But in our location chain for BarutinCove: 
        BarutinCove is in SnowIsland, which is in SouthShetland.
   And we have Antarctica located in SouthShetland. So Antarctica is a sibling of SnowIsland? They are both inside SouthShetland.

   And we are not told that SouthShetland is located inside itself? Or that there is a hierarchy that would make one go through Antarctica? 

   In fact, if we try to derive that SnowIsland is in Antarctica, we cannot because we have:
        cove_location: LocatedIn BarutinCove SnowIsland
        snow_in_shetland: LocatedIn SnowIsland SouthShetland
        and antarctica_in_shetland: LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetland

   So we cannot get from BarutinCove to Antarctica via transitivity? Because we have:

        BarutinCove -> SnowIsland -> SouthShetland <- Antarctica

   But there's no connection from SouthShetland to Antarctica? Or the other way? We have only that Antarctica is in SouthShetland.

   And to connect BarutinCove to Antarctica, we would need a path that goes through a common container? That doesn't help.

   For SnowIsland to be located in Antarctica? We would need that SouthShetland is in Antarctica? But we don't have that. We have Antarctica in SouthShetland.

   Or if we think of the chain: 
        If we want to show that for an island i located in Antarctica, then to have BarutinCove named after i, we have no premises that force any such naming.

 Therefore, the proof cannot be completed.

 Given the above, what can we do?

 The task requires a valid proof term. Since the theorem is unprovable from the axioms, we might be forced to write a proof that cheats? But that wouldn't be valid.

 Alternatively, perhaps the user made an error? But we are instructed to not change the axioms or theorem.

 However, we must notice that the theorem is trying to express? Maybe it was intended to state that BarutinCove is named after BarutinSettlement, and BarutinSettlement is an island in Antarctica? But we don't have that.

 Therefore, the only honest thing is to return the same theorem with `sorry`, but the task forbids that.

 But the problem says: 
      "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term."

 And we must use a valid proof term. How about:

      we use `False.elim` and then try to prove False? 

      But we don't have a contradiction.

 Another idea: we can use classical logic? But we don't have those axioms.

 Or we can notice that there are no islands in Antarctica? Then the antecedent `LocatedIn i Antarctica` would never be true? So we can do:

      fun (i : Place) (h1 : Island i) (h2 : LocatedIn i Antarctica) => ...

      then we must prove `NamedAfter BarutinCove i`, but we have no way.

      Alternatively, we can state that because there are no islands in Antarctica, we have a contradiction. But is it the case that there are no islands? We don't have an axiom that Antarctica has no islands.

      In fact, we are told nothing about Antarctica having islands or not.

 Therefore, we cannot do anything but leave it unproven? 

 However, the instructions say we cannot leave it unproven.

 After careful thought, it seems we must conclude that the theorem as stated is not provable. We do not have the necessary premises.

 So what should the answer be? The problem says: after the code, provide an answer: True/False/Uncertain.

 We output:

   ANSWER: Uncertain   (but actually we know it's unprovable, but the truth value might be true? We don't know from the premises. The premises don't force it to be true nor false.)

 But note: the theorem might be false? Because it makes a strong claim that BarutinCove is named after every island in Antarctica, and we only know that it is named after BarutinSettlement. And BarutinSettlement might not be in Antarctica. But then, if there is an island in Antarctica that it is not named after, the theorem would be false. But we don't have such a counterexample in the axioms.

 Since the premises don't specify either way, we cannot prove it's true, but we also don't have a model where it's false? Actually, in the absence of information, the theorem might be false. But the problem asks for a proof, so we must either give one or ... 

 Given the problem constraints, we have to try to build a proof using the axioms.

 But after trying, I cannot build one.

 How about we try to assume that BarutinSettlement is in Antarctica? 

   We have no axiom that allows that.

 Alternatively, we might interpret the `named_after` axiom as a clue that BarutinSettlement is the only island that BarutinCove is named after? And then the universal quantifier would be impossible? 

   Unless there is at most one island in Antarctica? But we have no premise for that.

 Therefore, the only reasonable course is to note that the proof is impossible, and hence the answer should be "False" for the validity of the proof? But the problem is not about the proof being valid but about the truth of the theorem.

 However, the task is to provide the code with proof, and if we cannot, our substitute proof must be valid Lean code? It must type-check and close the goal? Otherwise, it will be rejected.

 But I have failed to construct a proof term.

 I see that the user may have made an error in the formalization. The intended conclusion might be:

      ∃ i, Island i ∧ LocatedIn i Antarctica ∧ NamedAfter BarutinCove i

   or maybe:

      NamedAfter BarutinCove BarutinSettlement   (which is given) and then add that BarutinSettlement is in Antarctica? but we don't have that.

   Alternatively, the chain of LocatedIn might be misinterpreted. The axiom `antarctica_in_shetland` might be intended to mean that SouthShetland is in Antarctica? But our axiom says `LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetland`, which is the opposite.

   So if we changed the axiom to say `LocatedIn SouthShetland Antarctica`, then we could prove that BarutinCove is in Antarctica by transitivity:

        LocatedIn BarutinCove SnowIsland -> SnowIsland in SouthShetland -> SouthShetland in Antarctica.

        Then BarutinCove is in Antarctica.

   But then the theorem is about i being any island located in Antarctica? That does not relate to where BarutinCove is but to what it is named after.

   And we still wouldn't know that BarutinSettlement is in Antarctica.

 Therefore, I must conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 However, this is an AI assistant for completing the proof. Sometimes users may make mistakes, but we are instructed to not modify the theorem nor axioms.

 So my answer:
   I will write a proof that works by way of contradiction? But we don't have a contradiction.

   Another idea: we don't have any premises that give multiple ways to do naming. We only have one naming. And we have no way to propagate the naming?

   We must try to derive the unless we can connect Antarctica with BarutinSettlement.

 Given the time, and since we must provide an answer, I will state:

   The proof is impossible to construct, so we must output the initial code without proof. But we cannot do that.

   We will assume that there is insufficient information to prove the theorem and since the instructions say to replace the sorry with a proof term, we do our best: we provide a term that uses the `named_after` if we can show that i must be BarutinSettlement? But we cannot show that.

   We might try to rely on the fact that the only (named_after) in the context is `BarutinSettlement`, but we have multiple islands: SnowIsland, etc.

   Therefore, we must admit this as an open goal? 

   This is not acceptable.

   How about we use classical.choice and classical.indefinite_description? That wouldn't be a proof because we don't have those in the axioms.

   So we have to say that the proof cannot be done.

   But the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry', your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof."

   If we cannot, then we have failed the task.

   However, after re-examining, it's possible that the theorem had an error.

   But we being an automated theorem prover must output a valid proof.

   So we output a proof that miraculously relies on the fact that there are no islands in Antarctica? Then it would be vacuously true.

   However, we are not told that there are no islands in Antarctica, so we cannot assume that.

   We could try:
        fun (i : Place) (hIsland : Island i) (hLoc : LocatedIn i Antarctica) => ...

        Then we would have to construct a proof of NamedAfter BarutinCove i.

        We have no axiom that relates i to BarutinSettlement.

        And we have no axiom that says that if two places are located in the same containing region, then one is named after the other? Of course not.

   Therefore, we must give up.

   Output: We say that the proof is missing and return the code with `sorry` but we are not allowed to do that.

   In desperation, we use `False.elim` on a proof of False, but how to get a proof of False? We cannot.

   For example, we might try to pr


=== RESPONSE ===
After analyzing the axioms and theorem, I conclude that the theorem cannot be proved from the given premises. Here's why:

1. The theorem requires that for any place `i` that is both an island and located in Antarctica, Barutin Cove is named after `i`.
2. The only naming relationship provided is `NamedAfter BarutinCove BarutinSettlement`.
3. There's no connection between BarutinSettlement and Antarctica in the axioms.
4. While we're given several islands (SnowIsland, GreenwichIsland, DeceptionIsland) and their location in SouthShetland, there's no evidence any place is located in Antarctica except Antarctica itself.
5. Antarctica is only said to be located in SouthShetland, not the other way around.

Therefore, while Barutin Cove is shown to be located in SnowIsland and ultimately SouthShetland, the crucial link between Antarctica and the island naming required for the proof is missing.

The complete code remains with 'sorry' since no valid proof term exists given the current premises:
