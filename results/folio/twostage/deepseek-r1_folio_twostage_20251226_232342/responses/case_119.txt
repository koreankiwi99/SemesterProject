STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are dealing with places and the "located in" relation.

 Let's define:
   - A type `Place` for the places.
   - Constants for the specific places: Barutin_Cove, Snow_Island, Greenwich_Island, Deception_Island, South_Shetland_Islands, Antarctica.
   - A predicate `LocatedIn` that relates two places: `LocatedIn x y` means "x is located in y".

 Premises:
   1. Barutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin. [This is descriptive and doesn't directly translate to a logical axiom. We can ignore it for the logical structure.]
   2. Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island. -> This implies Barutin_Cove is located in Snow_Island? 
      However, note: being on the coast of an island might mean it is part of the island. But to be safe, we'll interpret as: 
          LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Snow_Island

   3. Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands.
          LocatedIn Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands
          LocatedIn Greenwich_Island South_Shetland_Islands
          LocatedIn Deception_Island South_Shetland_Islands

   4. Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands. 
      This seems odd because typically we think of the islands being part of Antarctica. But the premise says: 
          "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands" 
      This might be a mistake? Let me read again: "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands." 
      Actually, it might be intended to say that South Shetland Islands are part of Antarctica? 
      But the premise says the opposite.

      Since our task is to formalize the given text, we must take it as is: 
          LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands   ??? 

      However, this is geographically incorrect and might be a confusion in the premise. 
      We note the premise: "Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands." 
      and then "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands".

      But the conclusion says: "Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica".

      How to interpret? If we take the premises as given, then we have:
          Barutin_Cove is in Snow_Island, which is in South_Shetland_Islands, and Antarctica is also in South_Shetland_Islands.

      So from this, we cannot conclude that Barutin_Cove is not in Antarctica? 

      However, note the transitive rule: 
          If A is located in B and B is located in C, then A is located in C.

      But we have:
          Barutin_Cove -> Snow_Island -> South_Shetland_Islands
          and Antarctica -> South_Shetland_Islands.

      We do not have that the South_Shetland_Islands are inside Antarctica? Actually, we have the opposite: Antarctica is located in the South_Shetland_Islands? That would mean Antarctica is a part of the South Shetland Islands? That is not the usual geography.

      The problem might have meant: "South_Shetland_Islands are located in Antarctica".

      But the premise says: "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands", which is the opposite.

      We are forced to formalize as stated.

      So we have:
        axiom A4: LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands

      Then the conclusion we are to formalize is: 
          Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica.

      How can we get that? 

      With the given axioms and transitivity, we have:
          Barutin_Cove is located in South_Shetland_Islands (via Snow_Island)
          Antarctica is also in South_Shetland_Islands.

      But we do not have any premise that says that being in South_Shetland_Islands and being in Antarctica are disjoint? 
      Without more information, we cannot conclude that Barutin_Cove is not in Antarctica.

      However, note that the problem might be relying on the fact that the islands are distinct from Antarctica? 

      But the premises do not state that. 

      We are only to formalize the logical structure. We are not proving the theorem. We just need to declare the axioms and the theorem.

      Therefore, we will formalize the premises as given and the conclusion as the theorem to be proved (using sorry).

      But note: the problem says "Conclusion to formalize: Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica."

      So we will write:

        theorem goal: ¬ LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica := sorry

      However, we must note: the premises state that Antarctica is in the South_Shetland_Islands, and Barutin_Cove is in the South_Shetland_Islands. But that does not by itself imply that they are disjoint. 

      But the problem is asking to formalize, so we do exactly that.

      Additional note: the problem has a transitive rule. We must represent that:

        axiom R: ∀ (a b c: Place), LocatedIn a b → LocatedIn b c → LocatedIn a c

      Now, the premises:

        axiom P1: LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Snow_Island
        axiom P2: LocatedIn Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands
        axiom P3: LocatedIn Greenwich_Island South_Shetland_Islands   -- even though we don't use this for the conclusion
        axiom P4: LocatedIn Deception_Island South_Shetland_Islands   -- same
        axiom P5: LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands

      The conclusion is: ¬ LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica

      However, note that from transitivity we can derive:
          LocatedIn Barutin_Cove South_Shetland_Islands   [from P1, P2 and R]
          LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands is given (P5)

      But we do not have any contradiction? In fact, we don't have any axiom that says two different places cannot both be in the same place? 
      And we don't have an axiom that says if two things are in the same container, then one is in the other? Or that they are disjoint? 

      So it's possible the problem is missing a premise? 

      But again, we are only translating the given natural language.

      We'll formalize exactly as given.

      Steps:

        - Define `Place` as a type.
        - Constants: Barutin_Cove, Snow_Island, Greenwich_Island, Deception_Island, South_Shetland_Islands, Antarctica : Place.
        - Predicate `LocatedIn : Place → Place → Prop`
        - Axiom for transitivity: for all a, b, c, if LocatedIn a b and LocatedIn b c then LocatedIn a c.
        - Premises P1: LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Snow_Island
        - Premise for Snow_Island: LocatedIn Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands
          (and similarly for Greenwich_Island and Deception_Island? But the conclusion doesn't use these, so we might need only the ones that are necessary? 
           However, to be faithful, we include all. But the problem states that Snow Island, Greenwich, and Deception are in the South Shetlands. So we must include them?)

        But note: the conclusion only involves Snow_Island and Barutin_Cove and Antarctica. The others are not used. But to be complete, we'll have:

          axiom SnowIn : LocatedIn Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands
          axiom GreenwichIn : LocatedIn Greenwich_Island South_Shetland_Islands
          axiom DeceptionIn : LocatedIn Deception_Island South_Shetland_Islands

        Premise: Antarctica is located in the South Shetland Islands: 
          axiom AntarcticaIn : LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands

        And the conclusion is: not (LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica)

      However, note: if we are including Greenwich and Deception, the problem doesn't require them for the conclusion. 
      We can choose to omit them? But the premises state them. To make it complete, we include all.

      But the problem says "Premises", and we are to include all? 

      However, for the proof we are not doing, we only need the ones that are necessary? But the problem doesn't say we can omit. 
      We will include them.

      However, lean might complain about unused axioms? But that's okay.

      Alternatively, we can have only the necessary ones? But let's see: 
        The conclusion is about Barutin_Cove and Antarctica. We have:
          Barutin_Cove -> Snow_Island -> South_Shetland_Islands
        And Antarctica -> South_Shetland_Islands.

        The other islands are not used.

      But the premise says "Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands" — so we must represent the entire premise.

      So we'll include the two extra islands but note they are not used.

      But if we are being minimalist, we could have:

        axiom obj : Type
        axiom Barutin_Cove : obj
        axiom Snow_Island : obj
        axiom South_Shetland_Islands : obj
        axiom Antarctica : obj
        axiom LocatedIn : obj → obj → Prop
        axiom P1 : LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Snow_Island
        axiom P2 : LocatedIn Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands
        axiom P5 : LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands
        axiom Trans : ∀ a b c, LocatedIn a b → LocatedIn b c → LocatedIn a c

        theorem goal : ¬ LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica := sorry

      But wait, the premise mentions Greenwich Island and Deception Island. We have to represent that there are three islands? 
      However, the conclusion does not require them. The problem says to formalize the premises. So we must define them? 

      Since the problem states that "Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands", we cannot omit the others.

      Let's define:

        Place: Type
        Constants: Barutin_Cove, Snow_Island, Greenwich_Island, Deception_Island, South_Shetland_Islands, Antarctica: Place

        Then the premises:

          LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Snow_Island
          LocatedIn Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands
          LocatedIn Greenwich_Island South_Shetland_Islands
          LocatedIn Deception_Island South_Shetland_Islands
          LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands

        And the transitivity rule.

      Now, note that we have two constants: 
        - "Barutin Cove" and "Snow Island", etc. So we will define each as a constant of type `Place`.

      One last note: The descriptive premise about Barutin Cove being named after the Bulgarian settlement is not used and can be skipped.

      So here is the code:


=== RESPONSE ===
To formalize the given premises and conclusion in Lean 4, we'll define a `Place` type for locations and a `LocatedIn` predicate to represent the "located in" relationship. The premises describe specific locations and their containment relationships, including a transitivity rule. The conclusion asserts that Barutin Cove is not contained within Antarctica.

<lean>
axiom Place : Type

-- Define all mentioned places
axiom Barutin_Cove : Place
axiom Snow_Island : Place
axiom Greenwich_Island : Place
axiom Deception_Island : Place
axiom South_Shetland_Islands : Place
axiom Antarctica : Place

-- "Located In" relation
axiom LocatedIn : Place → Place → Prop

-- Premise: Barutin Cove is on Snow Island
axiom barutinOnSnow : LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Snow_Island

-- Premise: Snow, Greenwich, and Deception Islands are in South Shetland Islands
axiom snowInShetland : LocatedIn Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands
axiom greenwichInShetland : LocatedIn Greenwich_Island South_Shetland_Islands
axiom deceptionInShetland : LocatedIn Deception_Island South_Shetland_Islands

-- Premise: Antarctica is located in South Shetland Islands
axiom antarcticaInShetland : LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands

-- Transitivity rule: If A in B and B in C, then A in C
axiom transitivity : 
  ∀ (a b c : Place),
  LocatedIn a b → 
  LocatedIn b c → 
  LocatedIn a c

-- Conclusion: Barutin Cove is not in Antarctica
theorem barutin_not_in_antarctica : 
  ¬ LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica := 
sorry
</lean>

**Key decisions:**
1. `Place` is the base type for all locations
2. Each specific location is a constant of type `Place`
3. `LocatedIn x y` encodes "x is located in y"
4. `transitivity` axiom handles nested containment
5. All premises become axioms using `LocatedIn`
6. Conclusion theorem negates `LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica`
7. `sorry` stands for the unproven conclusion

Note: The unused islands (Greenwich, Deception) are included to fully represent the premises, though they're not needed for this specific conclusion.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given the task to prove that Barutin Cove is not in Antarctica.
 However, looking at the axioms, we have:
   barutinOnSnow: LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Snow_Island
   snowInShetland: LocatedIn Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands
   antarcticaInShetland: LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands

 We also have transitivity for the LocatedIn relation.

 But note: the theorem is a negation: ¬ LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica.

 We do not have any axiom that says that the South Shetland Islands are disjoint from Antarctica, or that any of the islands are not Antarctica.

 In fact, the axiom "antarcticaInShetland" states that Antarctica is located in South Shetland Islands. This is unusual because typically we think of the South Shetland Islands as being part of Antarctica, but here it says Antarctica is in the South Shetland Islands.

 Moreover, we can derive that Barutin Cove is in South Shetland Islands:
   transitivity Barutin_Cove Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands barutinOnSnow snowInShetland
   → LocatedIn Barutin_Cove South_Shetland_Islands

 Similarly, Antarctica is in South Shetland_Islands (by antarcticaInShetland).

 But without knowing that the relation is asymmetric or that there is no cycle, we cannot conclude that Barutin Cove is not in Antarctica.

 In fact, if we had:
   LocatedIn Antarctica Barutin_Cove   (we don't have this)
 then we might have a cycle, but we don't have that either.

 However, note that the theorem is a negation. We must show that there is no chain that would put Barutin Cove in Antarctica.

 But observe: we have no axiom that would force Antarctica to be a different place from the islands. In fact, the transitivity axiom might allow Antarctica to be one of the islands? But we have:
   LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands

 And we also have:
   LocatedIn Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands

 So both Antarctica and Snow_Island are in South_Shetland_Islands. But that doesn't tell us that Antarctica is not Snow_Island.

 Without additional axioms (like disjointness of places or that the LocatedIn relation is acyclic and irreflexive), we cannot prove the negation.

 Therefore, the theorem as stated is not provable from the given axioms.

 But wait: what if we try to derive a contradiction? We don't have any contradiction in the axioms.

 Alternatively, note that the user might have intended that Antarctica is the continent and the South Shetland Islands are part of it, but the axiom says the opposite: Antarctica is located in South Shetland Islands. This is the opposite of reality.

 Given the premises, we have no way to prove that Barutin Cove is not in Antarctica. In fact, if Antarctica were Snow_Island, then we would have:
   LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica   (because barutinOnSnow would be LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica)

 But we don't have an axiom that says Antarctica is not Snow_Island.

 Therefore, we must conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 However, the problem says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof." and then answer True/False/Uncertain.

 Since we cannot prove the negation from the given axioms, we must mark it as Uncertain? But note: the theorem is a negation. Without knowing that Antarctica is not Snow_Island, we cannot be sure.

 But let me reexamine the axioms:

   We have:
     Barutin_Cove, Snow_Island, Greenwich_Island, Deception_Island, South_Shetland_Islands, Antarctica: Place

   Axioms:
     barutinOnSnow: LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Snow_Island
     snowInShetland: LocatedIn Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands
     greenwichInShetland: LocatedIn Greenwich_Island South_Shetland_Islands
     deceptionInShetland: LocatedIn Deception_Island South_Shetland_Islands
     antarcticaInShetland: LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands

   Transitivity: if A in B and B in C, then A in C.

   We want: ¬ LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica.

 How can we prove this? We cannot without additional information.

 Therefore, we must answer Uncertain.

 However, note that the problem says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 But the theorem is stated as a goal. We are to replace the 'sorry' with a proof if we can, or if we cannot, we must still write something? However, the instructions say: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term."

 Since we cannot prove it, we cannot provide a valid proof term.

 But wait: perhaps we can use the fact that the relation is not reflexive? We don't have that. Or perhaps we can show that there is no chain? We have no axioms that prevent Antarctica from being Snow_Island.

 Therefore, I conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 However, the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'", meaning that the theorem is expected to be provable? But in this case, it is not.

 Given the ambiguity, I will provide a proof that attempts to show that if Barutin_Cove were in Antarctica, then we would have a chain that leads to a contradiction? But we don't have any contradiction.

 Alternatively, we can try to show that the premises do not force Barutin_Cove to be in Antarctica, but that doesn't prove the negation.

 Since we cannot prove the theorem, we must leave it as sorry? But the task says to replace sorry.

 Alternatively, we can try to refute the theorem by building a model? But that is not a proof.

 After careful thought, I decide that the theorem is not provable. Therefore, I will write:

   theorem barutin_not_in_antarctica : 
     ¬ LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica := 
   by
     intro h
     -- We have h: LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica
     -- We also have barutinOnSnow: LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Snow_Island
     -- And antarcticaInShetland: LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands
     -- We can use transitivity to get LocatedIn Barutin_Cove South_Shetland_Islands from barutinOnSnow and snowInShetland (already known).
     -- But also: from h and antarcticaInShetland, by transitivity we get LocatedIn Barutin_Cove South_Shetland_Islands? That's the same as before.

     -- Now, we have no contradiction. So we cannot complete the proof.

     -- Therefore, we must admit that the proof is not possible.

 But wait: what if we use the transitivity in a different way? For example, if we assume that Antarctica is Snow_Island, then h would be exactly barutinOnSnow. But that doesn't contradict anything.

 So I think the answer is that the theorem is not provable. Therefore, we cannot replace the 'sorry' with a valid proof.

 However, the problem says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof." meaning that we must provide a proof if we can. Since we cannot, we must leave it as sorry? But that is not allowed.

 Alternatively, we can state that the theorem is false? But the problem asks for a proof.

 Given the instructions, I think we must be honest: the theorem is not provable. Therefore, we cannot provide a proof.

 But note: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 So perhaps we can write:

   We cannot prove the theorem, so we mark Uncertain.

 However, the problem expects a Lean code. We cannot leave the theorem unproven.

 After rethinking: perhaps the user intended that Antarctica is the top-level place? But the axiom says Antarctica is in South Shetland Islands.

 Without additional axioms (like that South_Shetland_Islands is not contained in any other place, or that Antarctica is the top), we cannot prove the negation.

 Therefore, I will output the code with a sorry and mark Uncertain? But the task says to replace sorry.

 Alternatively, we can try to prove that Barutin_Cove is in South_Shetland_Islands and Antarctica is in South_Shetland_Islands, and if we had an axiom that South_Shetland_Islands is a set of disjoint places, then we could get a contradiction. But we don't have that.

 Therefore, I conclude that the theorem is not provable. So I will not change the sorry and mark Uncertain? But the task says to replace sorry.

 Given the dilemma, I will provide a proof that uses the fact that we have no evidence that Barutin_Cove is in Antarctica. But that is not a proof.

 Alternatively, we can use classical logic: we don't have LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica as an axiom, so it must be false? But that is not sound.

 I think the correct answer is that the theorem is uncertain.

 Therefore, I will write:

   ANSWER: Uncertain

 But what about the Lean code? We must replace the sorry. Since we cannot prove it, we have to leave it as sorry? But the problem says "replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". We don't have one.

 After careful thought, I decide to write a proof that shows that if Barutin_Cove were in Antarctica, then we would have a loop? But we don't have any loop condition.

 Alternatively, we can assume that the LocatedIn relation is acyclic and that Antarctica is not Snow_Island, but we don't have that.

 Therefore, I must say that the proof is not possible. So I will not provide a Lean proof.

 But the problem requires a Lean code. So I will output the same code with the sorry still there? That is not acceptable.

 Given the instructions, I think we must be honest and say that we cannot prove it. Therefore, we leave the sorry and mark Uncertain.

 However, the problem says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." So if we cannot, we cannot complete the task.

 But note: the example provided a proof. So the task expects that the theorem is provable.

 Let me double-check the axioms:

   Premise: "Barutin Cove is on Snow Island" -> LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Snow_Island
   Premise: "Snow, Greenwich, and Deception Islands are in South Shetland Islands" -> LocatedIn Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands, etc.
   Premise: "Antarctica is located in South Shetland Islands" -> LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands

   Transitivity: if A in B and B in C, then A in C.

   We want: Barutin Cove is not in Antarctica.

   How can we prove that? We can't without knowing that Snow_Island is not Antarctica and that there is no chain from Snow_Island to Antarctica? But we have:

        Barutin_Cove -> Snow_Island -> South_Shetland_Islands
        Antarctica -> South_Shetland_Islands

   So both Barutin_Cove and Antarctica are in South_Shetland_Islands. That doesn't tell us that Barutin_Cove is not in Antarctica.

   In fact, if Antarctica were Snow_Island, then Barutin_Cove would be in Antarctica.

   Since we don't have an axiom that says Antarctica is not Snow_Island, the theorem is not provable.

 Therefore, I will output:

   <lean>
   ... [the same axioms] ...
   theorem barutin_not_in_antarctica : 
     ¬ LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica := 
   sorry   -- because we cannot prove it
   </lean>

   ANSWER: Uncertain

 But the problem says "replace 'sorry'", and we are replacing it with ... sorry? That is not a valid proof term.

 Alternatively, we can try to use the fact that we have no way to prove LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica, so we can use a proof by negation that it is not true? But that is not constructive.

 In classical logic, we could do:

   by_contra h
   -- but then we have h: LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica
   -- and we can derive LocatedIn Barutin_Cove South_Shetland_Islands via:
   have h1 := transitivity Barutin_Cove Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands h antarcticaInShetland
   -- but we already have h2: LocatedIn Barutin_Cove South_Shetland_Islands from barutinOnSnow and snowInShetland
   -- and that's not a contradiction.

   So we cannot close the goal.

 Therefore, I think the only honest way is to leave it as sorry and mark Uncertain.

 But the task says to replace sorry with a valid proof term. We don't have one.

 Given the instructions, I will provide a proof that uses the absence of a chain to Antarctica? But that is not possible.

 I think there is a mistake in the problem. The theorem is not provable.

 So I will write:

   We cannot prove the theorem, so we output the code with sorry and mark Uncertain.

 However, to comply with the format, I will output the code as is, with sorry, and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

 But note: the problem says "complete code with proof", and if we leave sorry, it is not complete.

 Therefore, I must not leave sorry. I must provide a proof or admit that it is unprovable in the answer.

 Since the answer is Uncertain, we are not providing a proof.

 So in the code, we leave sorry? But that is not a proof.

 Alternatively, we can use `by_contra h; admit` but that is not a proof.

 I think the best is to output the code with sorry and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

 Let me do that.

 However, the problem says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." So if we leave sorry, we are not replacing it.

 Given the instructions, I will provide a proof that shows that from the premises, we cannot derive LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica, but that doesn't prove the negation.

 I think the intended answer might be that the theorem is true, and they expect a proof by showing that there is no chain. But without negative axioms, we cannot.

 After re-examining, I notice that the user wrote: "Conclusion: Barutin Cove is not in Antarctica". This is the desired theorem.

 In the absence of any axiom that would force Barutin_Cove to be in Antarctica, and given that we have a transitivity axiom, it is possible that Barutin_Cove is in Antarctica only if there is a chain. But the only chain we have is Barutin_Cove -> Snow_Island -> South_Shetland_Islands, and then we would need Snow_Island to be Antarctica or South_Shetland_Islands to be Antarctica? But we have:

   LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands

 So if we had LocatedIn South_Shetland_Islands Antarctica, then by transitivity we would have Barutin_Cove in Antarctica. But we don't have that.

 Therefore, we cannot prove that Barutin_Cove is in Antarctica, but that doesn't mean we can prove that it is not.

 So the answer is still Uncertain.

 I will output the code with sorry and mark Uncertain.

 But note: the problem says "complete code with proof". We are not completing the proof.

 Given the instructions, I think we must do:

   <lean>
   ... [the axioms] ...
   theorem barutin_not_in_antarctica : 
     ¬ LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica := 
   by
     intro h
     -- We have h: LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica
     -- We also have antarcticaInShetland: LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands
     -- So by transitivity, we have LocatedIn Barutin_Cove South_Shetland_Islands
     have h1 := transitivity Barutin_Cove Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands h antarcticaInShetland
     -- But we also can get LocatedIn Barutin_Cove South_Shetland_Islands from barutinOnSnow and snowInShetland
     have h2 := transitivity Barutin_Cove Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands barutinOnSnow snowInShetland
     -- Now we have two proofs of LocatedIn Barutin_Cove South_Shetland_Islands: h1 and h2. That's not a contradiction.
     -- We have no axiom that says LocatedIn is unique or that leads to false.
     sorry
   </lean>

   ANSWER: Uncertain

 But this is not a proof.

 Alternatively, we can try to use the fact that the places are distinct? But we don't have an axiom that says Barutin_Cove is not Antarctica, etc.

 Therefore, I think the only reasonable answer is Uncertain.

 So I will write:

=== RESPONSE ===
The theorem is not provable from the given axioms. The axioms establish that both Barutin Cove and Antarctica are located in South Shetland Islands, but they don't provide any information that would prevent Barutin Cove from being located in Antarctica. In fact, if Antarctica were Snow Island (which isn't contradicted by the axioms), then Barutin Cove would be located in Antarctica. Therefore, the negation cannot be proven.

Here is the complete code with the unproven theorem:
<lean>
axiom Place : Type

-- Define all mentioned places
axiom Barutin_Cove : Place
axiom Snow_Island : Place
axiom Greenwich_Island : Place
axiom Deception_Island : Place
axiom South_Shetland_Islands : Place
axiom Antarctica : Place

-- "Located In" relation
axiom LocatedIn : Place → Place → Prop

-- Premise: Barutin Cove is on Snow Island
axiom barutinOnSnow : LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Snow_Island

-- Premise: Snow, Greenwich, and Deception Islands are in South Shetland Islands
axiom snowInShetland : LocatedIn Snow_Island South_Shetland_Islands
axiom greenwichInShetland : LocatedIn Greenwich_Island South_Shetland_Islands
axiom deceptionInShetland : LocatedIn Deception_Island South_Shetland_Islands

-- Premise: Antarctica is located in South Shetland Islands
axiom antarcticaInShetland : LocatedIn Antarctica South_Shetland_Islands

-- Transitivity rule: If A in B and B in C, then A in C
axiom transitivity : 
  ∀ (a b c : Place),
  LocatedIn a b → 
  LocatedIn b c → 
  LocatedIn a c

-- Conclusion: Barutin Cove is not in Antarctica
theorem barutin_not_in_antarctica : 
  ¬ LocatedIn Barutin_Cove Antarctica :=
