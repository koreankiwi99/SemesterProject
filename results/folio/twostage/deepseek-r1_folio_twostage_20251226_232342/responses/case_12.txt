--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the following premises and conclusion.

Premises:
1. A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.
   We interpret this as: There exists a Japanese game company that created Zelda.
   However, since we are dealing with a specific game (Zelda) and we don't have variables for companies, we can simplify.
   We can have:
     - A constant for the game: `zelda : obj`
     - A predicate for being a Japanese game company: `JapaneseGameCompany : obj → Prop`
     - A predicate for creating a game: `CreatedBy : obj → obj → Prop` (where the first argument is the company, the second is the game)
   But note: the premise says "a Japanese game company created Zelda", so we can have:
     ∃ (c : obj), JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c zelda
   However, since we are in a simple logic, we might not need to introduce the company as an existential. Instead, we can note that Zelda was created by a Japanese company and then use that property indirectly.

   Alternatively, we can have a property for games: `CreatedByJapaneseCompany : obj → Prop` and then assert `CreatedByJapaneseCompany zelda`.

   But let's stick closer to the natural language: We have companies and games. However, the conclusion does not mention companies directly. So we can abstract away the company? Actually, the second premise says "all games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies", meaning that the company that made the game is Japanese.

   We decide to have:
     - Type `obj` for everything (both games and companies? or separate types?)
   Since the problem talks about games and companies, we can either:
     Option 1: Use one type `obj` for both, and then have predicates to distinguish.
     Option 2: Use two types: `game` and `company`.

   Let's choose Option 2 for clarity.

   So:
     axiom game : Type
     axiom company : Type

   Then:
     axiom zelda : game
     axiom JapaneseGameCompany : company → Prop
     axiom CreatedBy : company → game → Prop

   Premise 1: There exists a company that is Japanese and created Zelda.
        ∃ (c : company), JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c zelda

   However, in Lean we cannot have an existential in an axiom without a witness? Actually, we can have an axiom that asserts existence, but then we would have to introduce a specific company? Alternatively, we can avoid the existential by introducing a constant for the company that created Zelda? But the premise doesn't name the company.

   We can do:
        axiom some_company : company
        axiom P1 : JapaneseGameCompany some_company
        axiom P1' : CreatedBy some_company zelda

   But that would be introducing a specific company. Alternatively, we can use:

        axiom created_by_japanese : ∃ c : company, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c zelda

   However, in the context of the proof, we don't need the specific company, only the fact that Zelda was created by a Japanese company. So we can define:

        axiom CreatedByJapaneseCompany : game → Prop
        axiom P1 : CreatedByJapaneseCompany zelda

   And then we can relate this to the second premise? The second premise says: "All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies." meaning that if a game is on the Top 10 list, then it was made by a Japanese company. So we can define:

        axiom Top10List : game → Prop
        axiom P2 : ∀ g : game, Top10List g → CreatedByJapaneseCompany g

   But note: the second premise says "made by Japanese game companies", which we can interpret as `CreatedByJapaneseCompany g`.

   Alternatively, we can keep the company type and define:

        axiom P2 : ∀ g : game, Top10List g → ∃ c : company, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c g

   And then we have to connect `zelda` having been created by a Japanese company (from premise 1) to the same notion? But premise 1 says there exists a company that is Japanese and created Zelda, so we can have:

        axiom P1 : ∃ c : company, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c zelda

   Then, for the second premise:

        axiom P2 : ∀ g : game, Top10List g → ∃ c : company, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c g

   But then note: the conclusion does not require the company, only that Zelda is on the Top 10 list.

   However, we have two more premises:

   Premise 3: If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
        axiom P3 : ∀ g : game, SellsOverMillion g → Top10List g

   Premise 4: The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.
        axiom P4 : SellsOverMillion zelda

   Conclusion: The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.
        theorem goal : Top10List zelda

   Now, the issue is: we have two different representations for the first premise and the second premise? The second premise uses the same existential form as the first? Then we can use the same.

   However, we must note: the second premise says "made by Japanese game companies", which we represented as `∃ c, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c g`. And the first premise is the same for `zelda`.

   But then, in the proof we would have to use existential instantiation? Since we are not proving, we can leave the axioms as is.

   Alternatively, we can avoid the existential by defining:

        def CreatedByJapaneseCompany (g : game) : Prop := ∃ c, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c g

   Then:
        axiom P1 : CreatedByJapaneseCompany zelda
        axiom P2 : ∀ g : game, Top10List g → CreatedByJapaneseCompany g

   However, note that the second premise is actually the converse: it says that if a game is on the Top 10 list then it is made by a Japanese company. But that doesn't require that every game made by a Japanese company is on the Top 10 list.

   So we can do:

        axiom game : Type
        axiom company : Type
        axiom zelda : game
        axiom JapaneseGameCompany : company → Prop
        axiom CreatedBy : company → game → Prop
        axiom Top10List : game → Prop
        axiom SellsOverMillion : game → Prop

        -- Premise 1: There exists a Japanese company that created Zelda.
        axiom P1 : ∃ c : company, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c zelda

        -- Premise 2: All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
        axiom P2 : ∀ g : game, Top10List g → ∃ c : company, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c g

        -- Premise 3: If a game sells more than one million copies, then it is on the Top 10 list.
        axiom P3 : ∀ g : game, SellsOverMillion g → Top10List g

        -- Premise 4: Zelda sold more than one million copies.
        axiom P4 : SellsOverMillion zelda

        theorem goal : Top10List zelda := sorry

   However, note that the second premise is not used in the proof of the conclusion? Because we have:
        P4: SellsOverMillion zelda
        P3: SellsOverMillion g → Top10List g, so by P3 and P4 we get Top10List zelda.

   So the second premise is actually redundant? And the first premise is also not used? Then why are they there?

   But wait, the problem states all these premises. So we must include them.

   Alternatively, the problem might be testing the chain:
        P4 -> P3 -> Top10List zelda.

   So the second premise and the first premise are not needed for the conclusion? Then why are they included? Maybe to distract? Or perhaps we misinterpreted the premises.

   Let me re-read:

   Premises:
   1. A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda.
   2. All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
   3. If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
   4. The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.

   Conclusion: The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.

   Indeed, from 4 and 3 we get that Zelda is on the Top 10 list. So the first two premises are not needed for the conclusion? Then why are they there? Maybe the problem is part of a larger context? Or perhaps we are expected to use them? But logically, they are not required.

   However, the problem says to formalize all premises. So we must include them.

   But note: the second premise says "All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies". This is not used in the derivation of the conclusion. So we can have:

        axiom game : Type
        axiom company : Type
        axiom zelda : game
        axiom JapaneseGameCompany : company → Prop
        axiom CreatedBy : company → game → Prop
        axiom Top10List : game → Prop
        axiom SellsOverMillion : game → Prop

        axiom P1 : ∃ c, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c zelda
        axiom P2 : ∀ g, Top10List g → ∃ c, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c g
        axiom P3 : ∀ g, SellsOverMillion g → Top10List g
        axiom P4 : SellsOverMillion zelda

        theorem goal : Top10List zelda := sorry

   Now, we can prove `goal` by `P3 zelda P4`.

   So the theorem is straightforward.

   However, the problem says: "Conclusion to formalize: The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list."

   We'll formalize exactly as above.

   But note: we have two types: `game` and `company`. Alternatively, we can use one type `obj` and then have predicates `isGame`, `isCompany`? But that complicates. Since the problem clearly distinguishes games and companies, two types are better.

   Let me write the code accordingly.

   IMPORTANT: We are not proving, so the theorem is just `sorry`.

   We'll define:

        axiom game : Type
        axiom company : Type
        axiom zelda : game
        axiom JapaneseGameCompany : company → Prop
        axiom CreatedBy : company → game → Prop
        axiom Top10List : game → Prop
        axiom SellsOverMillion : game → Prop

        -- Premise 1: There exists a Japanese company that created Zelda.
        axiom P1 : ∃ c : company, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c zelda

        -- Premise 2: For any game, if it is on the Top 10 list, then there exists a Japanese company that created it.
        axiom P2 : ∀ g : game, Top10List g → ∃ c : company, JapaneseGameCompany c ∧ CreatedBy c g

        -- Premise 3: If a game sells over a million copies, then it is on the Top 10 list.
        axiom P3 : ∀ g : game, SellsOverMillion g → Top10List g

        -- Premise 4: Zelda sold over a million copies.
        axiom P4 : SellsOverMillion zelda

        theorem goal : Top10List zelda := sorry

   However, note: the conclusion is exactly `Top10List zelda`.

   But wait, the second premise is about the games on the Top 10 list having a Japanese creator, but we don't need that for the conclusion. We are including it because it is a premise.

   Alternatively, if we don't want to introduce the existential quantifier and the company type (since the conclusion doesn't require it), we can abstract the first premise as a property of the game:

        axiom game : Type
        axiom zelda : game
        axiom Top10List : game → Prop
        axiom SellsOverMillion : game → Prop
        axiom CreatedByJapaneseCompany : game → Prop   -- meaning the game was created by a Japanese company

        -- Premise 1: Zelda was created by a Japanese company.
        axiom P1 : CreatedByJapaneseCompany zelda

        -- Premise 2: Every game on the Top 10 list was created by a Japanese company.
        axiom P2 : ∀ g : game, Top10List g → CreatedByJapaneseCompany g

        -- Premise 3: If a game sells over a million, then it is on the Top 10 list.
        axiom P3 : ∀ g : game, SellsOverMillion g → Top10List g

        -- Premise 4: Zelda sold over a million copies.
        axiom P4 : SellsOverMillion zelda

        theorem goal : Top10List zelda := sorry

   This is simpler and avoids the existential and the company type. And note: the second premise is still not used for the conclusion, but we are including it.

   Which representation to choose? The problem says "a Japanese game company", so introducing a type for company might be more faithful. However, the conclusion doesn't require the company, so the simpler representation is acceptable.

   Let me choose the simpler representation without introducing the company type.

   Why? Because the conclusion only talks about the game being on the Top 10 list, and we have a direct chain from P4 to P3 to the conclusion.

   So:

        axiom game : Type
        axiom zelda : game
        axiom Top10List : game → Prop
        axiom SellsOverMillion : game → Prop
        axiom CreatedByJapaneseCompany : game → Prop

        axiom P1 : CreatedByJapaneseCompany zelda
        axiom P2 : ∀ g : game, Top10List g → CreatedByJapaneseCompany g
        axiom P3 : ∀ g : game, SellsOverMillion g → Top10List g
        axiom P4 : SellsOverMillion zelda

        theorem goal : Top10List zelda := sorry

   Now, we can see that `goal` is proved by `P3 zelda P4`.

   But again, we are not proving, just formalizing.

   However, note: the second premise is not used. But the problem requires formalizing all premises, so we include it.

   Alternatively, if we want to be very faithful to the natural language, we might include the company. But the problem does not require reasoning about companies beyond the fact that they are Japanese and created the game.

   Since the conclusion does not mention companies, the simpler representation is acceptable.

   We'll go with the simpler representation.

   Let's write the code accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
Here's the Lean 4 formalization of the given premises and conclusion:

<lean>
axiom Game : Type
axiom zelda : Game
axiom CreatedByJapaneseCompany : Game → Prop
axiom Top10List : Game → Prop
axiom SellsOverMillion : Game → Prop

-- Premise 1: A Japanese game company created Zelda
axiom P1 : CreatedByJapaneseCompany zelda

-- Premise 2: All Top 10 games are made by Japanese companies
axiom P2 : ∀ g : Game, Top10List g → CreatedByJapaneseCompany g

-- Premise 3: Selling over a million copies implies Top 10 list inclusion
axiom P3 : ∀ g : Game, SellsOverMillion g → Top10List g

-- Premise 4: Zelda sold over a million copies
axiom P4 : SellsOverMillion zelda

-- Conclusion: Zelda is on the Top 10 list
theorem goal : Top10List zelda := sorry
</lean>

Explanation:
- We declare `Game` as a type representing all games
- `zelda` is a specific constant of type `Game`
- Predicates defined:
  * `CreatedByJapaneseCompany g` means game g was made by a Japanese company
  * `Top10List g` means game g is on the Top 10 list
  * `SellsOverMillion g` means game g sold >1M copies
- Premises are translated as axioms:
  * P1: Zelda was made by a Japanese company
  * P2: Any Top 10 game was made by a Japanese company
  * P3: Games selling >1M copies make the Top 10 list
  * P4: Zelda sold >1M copies
- The theorem `goal` states Zelda is on the Top 10 list (with `sorry` as placeholder proof)

Note: The formalization captures the logical structure directly. While premise 2 isn't needed for the conclusion (since P3 and P4 suffice), it's included as requested for completeness.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and we need to prove that Zelda is on the Top 10 list.
 The premises are:
 P1: CreatedByJapaneseCompany zelda
 P2: Every Top 10 game is made by a Japanese company (so if a game is Top10List, then it is CreatedByJapaneseCompany)
 P3: If a game sells over a million copies, then it is on the Top 10 list (SellsOverMillion implies Top10List)
 P4: Zelda sold over a million copies (SellsOverMillion zelda)

 We are to prove: Top10List zelda.

 Notice that P4 says SellsOverMillion zelda, and P3 says that if a game sells over a million then it is on the Top 10 list.
 Therefore, we can apply P3 to zelda and P4 to get Top10List zelda.

 So the proof is: P3 zelda P4

 Let's write the complete code accordingly.

</lean>

ANSWER: True

Explanation:
- Premise 3 (P3) states that for any game `g`, if it sells over a million copies (SellsOverMillion g), then it is on the Top 10 list (Top10List g).
- Premise 4 (P4) states that Zelda sold over a million copies (SellsOverMillion zelda).
- Applying P3 to zelda using P4 directly proves Top10List zelda.
- The proof term `P3 zelda P4` satisfies the theorem.
