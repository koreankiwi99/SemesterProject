STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion.
 We need to define types and predicates to represent the statements.

 Steps:
 1. Identify the domain: We are talking about cars (or objects that can be cars). Let's define a type for the objects (say, `Car`).
 2. We have specific cars: 
     - Tesla Model 3 (probably a set of cars? but the conclusion is about John's car, so we can model John's car as a constant)
     - Solo EV cars (a type of car)
 3. We need predicates:
     - `CanTransportMultiplePassengers (c : Car) : Prop` : meaning the car `c` can transport multiple passengers.
     - `IsOneSeater (c : Car) : Prop` : meaning the car is a one-seater.
     - `IsTeslaModel3 (c : Car) : Prop`
     - `IsSingleSeatElectricCar (c : Car) : Prop`
     - `IsSoloEV (c : Car) : Prop`

 4. We also have John's car as a specific constant: `johnsCar : Car`

 5. Premises:
    a. "If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters."
        ∀ c : Car, CanTransportMultiplePassengers c → ¬ (IsOneSeater c)

    b. "All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers."
        ∀ c : Car, IsTeslaModel3 c → CanTransportMultiplePassengers c

    c. "All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters."
        ∀ c : Car, IsSingleSeatElectricCar c → IsOneSeater c

    d. "All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars."
        ∀ c : Car, IsSoloEV c → IsSingleSeatElectricCar c

    e. "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car."
        Note: The premise says: "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car."
        This is a bit tricky. Let's break it down:
        Let P: John's car is a Tesla Model 3.
        Let Q: John's car is a single-seat electric car.
        The premise says: ¬P → (¬P ∨ ¬Q)   ??? But wait, the premise says: "John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car" meaning ¬(P ∨ Q) or ¬P ∨ ¬Q?
        Actually, the natural language is ambiguous. However, note that the premise says: "John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 OR a single-seat electric car". 
        This is usually interpreted as: ¬(P ∨ Q) which is equivalent to ¬P ∧ ¬Q. But the premise says: "if not P then ...", and then "then John's car is not (a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car)" meaning ¬(P ∨ Q).

        Alternatively, we might read it as: "if not P, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 OR it is not a single-seat electric car", but that would be ¬P → (¬P ∨ ¬Q) which is always true.

        However, the original statement in natural language: 
          "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car."

        The or might be in the scope of "not". Let's look at the last part: "John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car". 
        This is ambiguous. In logic, we often interpret "not (A or B)" as "neither A nor B". However, sometimes it can be misread.

        Given the context, the intended meaning is likely that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is also not a single-seat electric car? 
        But the premise doesn't say that. It says that if it is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is not (a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car). 
        That is: ¬P → ¬(P ∨ Q)

        But note: ¬(P ∨ Q) is equivalent to ¬P ∧ ¬Q.

        So the premise is: ¬P → (¬P ∧ ¬Q)

        This is equivalent to: (¬P → ¬P) ∧ (¬P → ¬Q), which is always true for the first part, and so effectively it is ¬P → ¬Q.

        Alternatively, we might have misread the natural language. Could the premise be intended as:
          "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is either not a Tesla Model 3 or it is not a single-seat electric car"?
        That would be: ¬P → (¬P ∨ ¬Q). But that is a tautology (since ¬P implies ¬P ∨ anything).

        Given the ambiguity, note that the conclusion is that John's car is a Tesla Model 3. 
        So the premise might be intended to force that John's car must be a Tesla Model 3 because the alternative (being a single-seat electric car) is also excluded? 
        However, if we interpret it as ¬P → (¬P ∧ ¬Q), then that would force that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is both not a Tesla Model 3 and not a single-seat electric car. 
        But from the other premises, we have that if it is a Solo EV (and if it is a single-seat electric car, then it might be a Solo EV) then it would be a single-seat electric car, which contradicts ¬Q.

        Let me think: Maybe the intended logic is that John's car is either a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car? 
        The premise as given: "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car" does not imply that it must be one or the other.

        After re-examining: The premise literally says:
          If ¬P, then (¬(P ∨ Q))   [where P: TeslaModel3, Q: single-seat electric car]
          which expands to: if ¬P, then ¬P and ¬Q.

        But note: if we assume ¬P, then we get ¬P and ¬Q. This is consistent, but doesn't give new information about Q? 

        Alternatively, we should consider the possibility that the premise is meant to be:
          If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is a single-seat electric car? 
        But that is not what is said.

        Another possibility: The word "or" in the conclusion part might be misinterpreted. The sentence:
            "John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car"
        is ambiguous. It could mean:
          (John's car is not a Tesla Model 3) OR (John's car is a single-seat electric car)?
        That would be a very misleading way to put it.

        Let me look again at the original text: 
          "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car."

        I think the intended meaning is that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is not the case that John's car is (a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car). 
        So that means that if it is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is also not a single-seat electric car. 

        So we formalize:
          ¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬(IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)

        But note: ¬(A ∨ B) ↔ ¬A ∧ ¬B. So the premise is equivalent to:
          ¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → (¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∧ ¬IsSingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)

        However, the implication with the same antecedent and a conjunction that includes the antecedent is redundant: we can split and keep the part we don't have:
          ¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬IsSingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar

        Now, how does that help? The conclusion is that John's car is a Tesla Model 3.

        But note: we also have information from the other premises that might relate to John's car.

        However, the premise e is only about John's car, so we can write it specifically for the constant `johnsCar`.

 6. We are to formalize the conclusion: "John's car is a Tesla Model 3" as `IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar`.

 Let me propose the Lean 4 code.

 Steps in Lean:

   - We define `Car` as a type (a Type with possibly multiple cars, even though we only use John's car and generic ones)
   - We have a constant for John's car: `johnsCar : Car`
   - We define the predicates as functions from `Car` to `Prop`.

   Premise a: ∀ c : Car, CanTransportMultiplePassengers c → ¬ IsOneSeater c
   Premise b: ∀ c : Car, IsTeslaModel3 c → CanTransportMultiplePassengers c
   Premise c: ∀ c : Car, IsSingleSeatElectricCar c → IsOneSeater c
   Premise d: ∀ c : Car, IsSoloEV c → IsSingleSeatElectricCar c
   Premise e: ¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬(IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)

        Alternatively, we can write the premise e using the equivalence we found:
          ¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬(IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)

        But we can also write:
          ¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → (¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∧ ¬IsSingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)

        However, the first form (with the disjunction inside the negation) is closer to the text.

   Conclusion: IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar.

  However, note: the problem does not say that we are to model the entire universe of cars. We are only concerned with the logical structure. 

  We'll write:

<lean>
axiom Car : Type

-- Define predicates on Car
axiom CanTransportMultiplePassengers : Car → Prop
axiom IsOneSeater : Car → Prop
axiom IsTeslaModel3 : Car → Prop
axiom IsSingleSeatElectricCar : Car → Prop
axiom IsSoloEV : Car → Prop

-- John's car is a specific car
axiom johnsCar : Car

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ (c : Car), CanTransportMultiplePassengers c → ¬ IsOneSeater c
axiom P2 : ∀ (c : Car), IsTeslaModel3 c → CanTransportMultiplePassengers c
axiom P3 : ∀ (c : Car), IsSingleSeatElectricCar c → IsOneSeater c
axiom P4 : ∀ (c : Car), IsSoloEV c → IsSingleSeatElectricCar c
axiom P5 : ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)

-- Conclusion
theorem goal : IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar := sorry
</lean>

But note: the premise e (P5) is written in a way that leads to a contradiction if we assume ¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar? 
We don't have to prove it, just formalize.

Alternatively, we could write P5 as:

   ¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → (¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∧ ¬IsSingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)

But that is equivalent? Because by definition of disjunction and negation:

   ¬(A ∨ B) ↔ ¬A ∧ ¬B

So we can define P5 in either way. To match the text, I will stick to the disjunction version.

However, there is an alternative interpretation: what if the premise e was intended as:

   If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then either it is not a Tesla Model 3 OR it is not a single-seat electric car.

But that would be: ¬P → (¬P ∨ ¬Q) which is tautological and doesn't add new information.

But the original text says: "John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car", which in natural language often means "neither". 

So we stick to the "neither" interpretation.

Thus, we leave P5 as: 
   ¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬(IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)

But note: this is equivalent to:
   ¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → (¬IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∧ ¬IsSingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)

We don't need to change it because in Lean we can use the disjunction form without expanding.

Let me check: the disjunction version is acceptable and type-checks.

But note: the statement `¬ (A ∨ B)` is well-defined.

Therefore, we proceed.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the given premises and conclusion, here is the Lean 4 formalization:

<lean>
axiom Car : Type

-- Predicates
axiom TransportMultiple : Car → Prop
axiom IsOneSeater : Car → Prop
axiom IsTeslaModel3 : Car → Prop
axiom IsSingleSeatElectric : Car → Prop
axiom IsSoloEV : Car → Prop

-- John's specific car
axiom johnsCar : Car

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ c : Car, TransportMultiple c → ¬ IsOneSeater c
axiom P2 : ∀ c : Car, IsTeslaModel3 c → TransportMultiple c
axiom P3 : ∀ c : Car, IsSingleSeatElectric c → IsOneSeater c
axiom P4 : ∀ c : Car, IsSoloEV c → IsSingleSeatElectric c
axiom P5 : ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar)

-- Conclusion to prove
theorem JohnsCarIsTesla : IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar := sorry
</lean>

Key decisions:
1. Created a `Car` type for all vehicles
2. Used explicit predicate names that match the natural language descriptions
3. Represented "John's car" as a constant `johnsCar`
4. Formalized the conditional in premise 5 using disjunction inside negation (equivalent to "neither A nor B")
5. Named the final theorem for readability
6. All type declarations are explicit
7. Used `sorry` as required for the conclusion placeholder

This captures all premises:
- Premise 1: Multi-passenger implies not one-seater (P1)
- Premise 2: All Teslas transport multiple (P2)
- Premise 3: Single-seat electrics are one-seaters (P3)
- Premise 4: Solo EVs are single-seat electrics (P4)
- Premise 5: If not Tesla, then neither Tesla nor single-seat electric (P5)


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and need to prove that John's car is a Tesla Model 3.
 The premises are:
   P1: ∀ c, TransportMultiple c → ¬ IsOneSeater c
   P2: ∀ c, IsTeslaModel3 c → TransportMultiple c
   P3: ∀ c, IsSingleSeatElectric c → IsOneSeater c
   P4: ∀ c, IsSoloEV c → IsSingleSeatElectric c
   P5: ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar)

 We are to prove: IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar

 Let's analyze:

 We can try to prove by contradiction. Assume that John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 (¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar).
 Then by P5, we get: ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar)
 This is equivalent to: ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∧ ¬ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar.

 So we have:
   (1) ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar (by assumption)
   (2) ¬ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar (from above)

 But note that we don't have any information about IsSoloEV for johnsCar, so we cannot use P4 to get a contradiction.

 Alternatively, note that P5 only tells us that if it is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is neither a Tesla Model 3 nor a single seat electric.
 This doesn't directly give a contradiction.

 Let's see if we can use the other premises.

 However, note that we don't have any positive information about John's car. In particular, we don't have any axiom stating that John's car has any of these properties.

 Without additional information, it seems we might not be able to prove the theorem.

 But wait, let's look at P5 again. The conclusion of P5 is a negation: ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar).
 If we assume ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar, then we get that both IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar and IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar are false.

 However, we don't have any way to derive a contradiction from this because we don't have any axiom that forces John's car to be either a Tesla Model 3 or a single seat electric.

 Therefore, the theorem is not provable from the given premises.

 But wait, perhaps we are missing something. Let me try to write down the premises and the goal.

 Alternatively, we might try to show that the negation of the goal leads to a contradiction. However, without a positive fact to contradict, we can only get the two negations (not Tesla and not single seat electric) and then we are stuck.

 Since the premises do not provide any information that forces John's car to be a Tesla Model 3, we must conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 However, note that the user in the previous stage validated these axioms. But we are to provide a proof if possible.

 But wait, let me try to derive by using the fact that if we assume ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar, we get ¬ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar.

 Now, we can try to see if there is an alternative path.

 Actually, note that the premises do not say anything about whether John's car is a solo EV or not, so we cannot conclude anything about IsSingleSeatElectric.

 Therefore, the premise P5, in the case that we assume ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar, only gives us the negation of a disjunction. And that doesn't interact with the other premises without additional positive information.

 We do not have any axiom that says that John's car must be either a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric? No, we don't.

 Therefore, the theorem is not provable. However, let's check the possibility that the steps might be broken down.

 But note: the theorem is called "JohnsCarIsTesla", and we have the axiom P5 which is a conditional that, in the absence of the Tesla, also removes the possibility of being a single-seat electric. But without a starting point (like an axiom about johnsCar being one of these), we cannot get going.

 Since the problem does not have any axiom that states a positive fact about johnsCar (like it is a SoloEV or something), we cannot prove it.

 However, let me read P5 again: 
   ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar)

 This is equivalent to:
   ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → (¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∧ ¬ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar)

 But note that the right-hand side of the implication is exactly the same as what we get by pushing the negation into the disjunction. 

 However, this doesn't force the car to be a Tesla. It only says: if it isn't a Tesla, then it isn't a Tesla and it isn't a single-seat electric. 

 But we don't have any axiom that says that John's car must be one of those.

 Therefore, we must say that the theorem is not provable. But note: the task says to replace 'sorry' with a proof. If we believe the theorem is false (i.e., not provable), then we cannot complete the proof? 

 The instruction: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 We are to answer with True if we can prove it, False if we can prove its negation, or Uncertain if neither is provable.

 However, note that we are only to complete the code with a valid proof if we can. If we cannot, we must still write something? But the problem says: replace sorry with a valid proof term. 

 Since the given axioms do not allow a proof, but note: maybe we are missing a way to put things together.

 Another look: perhaps we can use the law of excluded middle? But Lean has it by default? Actually, we're not in a classical setting unless we open it. But let's assume we can use classical reasoning.

 Let me try to reason:

 Assume ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar (for contradiction).
 Then by P5: ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar) 
 which means ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar and ¬ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar.

 Now, we don't have any contradiction from the other premises because they all require positive information.

 Therefore, we cannot get a contradiction.

 Alternatively, assume that John's car is a Tesla Model 3. Then we are done.

 But we cannot assume the goal to prove the goal.

 So without additional information, we cannot prove it.

 However, note that in the problem, we have no other axiom about johnsCar. 

 Therefore, we must conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 But wait, what if we try to prove that the car must be one of these? Actually, we don't have any axiom that tells us that every car is either a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric? So we cannot.

 Therefore, we cannot prove the theorem. 

 But note: the previous stage validated the axioms? How? The axioms are accepted as definitions in Lean. So they are valid to input.

 So I will say that the theorem cannot be proven. Therefore, we mark Uncertain.

 However, the problem says: After the code, provide your answer. The answer is for the provability.

 But what about the proof term? We cannot write a proof term because we don't have a proof. However, the task requires a valid proof. Therefore, we must write that we cannot replace sorry? But that breaks the requirement.

 Alternatively, let me try to see if there is a way.

 We have P5: ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar)

 We are missing a premise: we need something that forces johnsCar to be either a Tesla or something that leads to single-seat electric? We don't have that.

 Therefore, we cannot construct a proof of IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar. 

 But note: we have the premises P2, P1, P3, P4 which are implications, but without any starting point (like johnsCar satisfies one of the predicates) we cannot use them.

 The only axiom about johnsCar is P5, which talks about what happens if it is NOT a Tesla.

 Since we cannot prove the goal, we output the original code with sorry, and then answer Uncertain? 

 However, the task says: replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term. We cannot. So we have to leave it as sorry? Or we can try to use classical reasoning to do a case split?

 Let's try to use classical reasoning and the law of excluded middle on the property (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar).

 Example:

 open Classical

 theorem JohnsCarIsTesla : IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar :=
   byContradiction (
     fun h : ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar => 
        have h1 := P5 h   -- h1 : ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar)
        have h2 : ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar := by
            exact h1.left   -- Actually, h1 is a negation of a disjunction, which is equivalent to a conjunction of negations.
        -- But we know h is ¬IsTeslaModel3, and we also get ¬IsSingleSeatElectric.
        -- But now, we need to find a contradiction. 
        -- How? We don't have any information that John's car must be one of these.

        -- Without additional information, we are stuck.

        -- Therefore, we cannot complete the proof by contradiction.

        -- This fails.

   )

 Alternatively, we might try to see if there is a positive chain of reasoning.

 Suppose we try to use P2, P1: if johnsCar were a Tesla, then by P2 it transports multiple, and then by P1 it is not a one-seater. But that doesn't help.

 Or if we had that it is a one-seater, then by P1 we would get that it doesn't transport multiple, and by P2 that it is not a Tesla. But we don't have any such fact.

 Therefore, we must admit that we cannot prove it.

 Consequently, we cannot provide a valid proof term. However, the instruction says to replace sorry. Since we cannot, we have to leave it as sorry? 

 But the task is: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term."

 If we don't, we don't complete the task.

 So what to do? 

 Let's read the problem again: the theorem statement is "JohnsCarIsTesla".

 And we have P5: 
   ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar)

 This can also be written as:
   (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar) → IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar

 because if the antecedent holds, then if IsTeslaModel3 is true we are done, and if IsSingleSeatElectric is true, then in the consequent we need to show IsTeslaModel3, which we don't have. So it's actually:

   IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar → IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar

 This would only be true if the consequence of the disjunction is always the left disjunct? Not necessarily.

 Hence, P5 by itself doesn't allow us to conclude that the car is a Tesla, because it might be a single-seat electric, but then we don't have any link to Tesla.

 Therefore, we are stuck.

 But note: perhaps over the entire universe of cars, we can deduce something? However, we have no other information about johnsCar.

 I decide that the theorem is not provable. So I will write a proof by contradiction that fails? Or rather, I will use classical logic to try and if I get stuck, I must change course.

 Given that the theorem cannot be proven, we must answer Uncertain.

 How to output the code? We cannot write a proof, so we leave the sorry? But the instruction says to replace it with a valid proof term.

 What if we use the law of excluded middle? 

 Let’s consider:
   open Classical

   theorem JohnsCarIsTesla : IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar :=
     byCases 
        (fun h : IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar => h)
        (fun h : ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar => 
           have h1 := P5 h  -- h1 : ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar)
           have h2 : ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∧ ¬ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar := by
                rw [not_or] at h1; exact h1
           -- But then what? We need to prove IsTeslaModel3 from h2 which says it's false. 
           contradiction   -- fails because no contradiction is found.

        )

 So we cannot.

 Alternatively, could there be a diamond in the premises that I missed? 

 Remember P4: 
   ∀ c, IsSoloEV c → IsSingleSeatElectric c

 But if John's car were a solo EV, then by P4 it would be single-seat electric, and then by P3 it is a one-seater, and then by P1 (with P2) if it were a Tesla it would transport multiple and hence not one-seater, but then we get a conflict. However, this is conditional on being a Tesla and a solo EV? 

 But note: we don't have any information that John's car is a SoloEV. 

 And also, if the car is a solo EV, then it is a single-seat electric and hence a one-seater. If it is ALSO a Tesla, then by P2 it transports multiple, and then by P1 it is NOT a one-seater. This is a contradiction.

 Therefore, it is impossible for a car to be both a Tesla and a SoloEV?

 But then what if John's car is a SoloEV? Then we get that it is a one-seater and by P1 it cannot transport multiple, but then by P2 if it is a Tesla it would transport multiple -> contradiction. So it cannot be both.

 But we don't have that johnsCar is a SoloEV.

 Also, if johnsCar is a solo EV, then it cannot be a Tesla. But then P5 says: if it is not a Tesla, then it's not a Tesla and not a single-seat electric. But if it is a solo EV, then it is a single-seat electric (by P4), which contradicts P5's consequence.

 Therefore, in the case that John's car is a solo EV, then:

   not-Tesla (because solo EV implies single-seat electric, which by P5's consequence is not allowed) => but also single-seat electric is true, which contradicts ¬ IsSingleSeatElectric from P5.

 So if we assume ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar, we get that it cannot be a solo EV either? 

 Actually, this creates a contradiction if johnsCar were a solo EV.

 But do we know that johnsCar is a solo EV? We don't.

 Alternatively, if it isn't a Tesla, then by P5 it is not a single-seat electric, and then by P4 it is not a solo EV. 

 But this doesn't contradict anything.

 So unless we have an axiom that says johnsCar is one of: Tesla, or solo EV, or single-seat electric, or something, we don't have a contradiction.

 The only hope is if there is a possibility that the car must be in at least one of these categories. But we lack such an axiom.

 Therefore, we cannot prove the theorem.

 We output Uncertain.

 However, note: perhaps the answer is to show that, from the given premises, we cannot prove the goal, so we should leave the proof as "sorry" and state Uncertain.

 But the instruction is to replace sorry with a valid proof term. Since we cannot, we must or else? 

 Given the instructions, it seems we are to provide the code only if we can prove it. But we cannot. Therefore, I see a dilemma.

 Looking back at the initial example: they provided a proof even if trivial.

 But here, we don't have a proof. 

 Given the task: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term" implies that we should be able to do it. However, we have discovered that it is not possible.

 Therefore, we must use a different approach: it is possible that the user in Stage 1 made a mistake? Or we are missing something.

 Let me try to derive step-by-step:

 We have:
   P1: ∀ c, TransportMultiple c → ¬ IsOneSeater c
   P2: ∀ c, IsTeslaModel3 c → TransportMultiple c
   P3: ∀ c, IsSingleSeatElectric c → IsOneSeater c
   P4: ∀ c, IsSoloEV c → IsSingleSeatElectric c
   P5: ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar)

 Now, if we assume that johnsCar is a solo EV, then by P4: IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar.
   Then by P3: IsOneSeater johnsCar.
   By P2: if it were a Tesla, then TransportMultiple.
   Then by P1: ¬ IsOneSeater, which contradicts.

   Thus, johnsCar cannot be both a Tesla and a solo EV.

   Furthermore, if it is a solo EV, then it cannot be a Tesla (as above, would lead to contradiction) and then by P5: since it is not a Tesla, then it is not a Tesla and not a single-seat electric. But we have that it is a single-seat electric (from solo EV). Contradiction.

   Therefore, johnsCar cannot be a solo EV.

   Then what is left? We don't have any other category. 

   But note that the car might be a Tesla but not a solo EV, or something else.

   Alternatively, the only property that might apply is being a Tesla.

   But we cannot deduce that it must be a Tesla because we haven't ruled out every other possibility? In particular, we've only ruled out solo EV under the assumption that it is a soloEV. 

   But wait, what if we use P5 in the forward direction? P5 is: if not Tesla, then not (Tesla or single-seat). If not Tesla, then it is not single-seat. And not Tesla by assumption.

   Now, if it were a solo EV, then it would be single-seat, contradiction. So it cannot be a solo EV either.

   So under the assumption not Tesla, we get that it is not a solo EV and not a single-seat electric and not a Tesla. And then we don't have any positive property? 

   This at least doesn't cause an immediate contradiction, but then we ask: is there any axiom that requires that johnsCar have at least one of the properties TransportMultiple, IsOneSeater, etc.? No.

   Therefore, the car could be an ordinary car that is none of these.

   Hence, not Tesla does not lead to a contradiction.

   So the theorem is not provable.

   We must answer Uncertain.

 However, this discussion indicates that we cannot provide a proof. 

 Given the requirement to output the complete code with valid proof, I we cannot do it. So I will output the code with sorry and then state Uncertain.

 But that does not replace sorry. 

 Alternatively, if we are allowed to use classical.choice or some axiom, we cannot.

 Therefore, I must admit it is impossible and answer Uncertain.

 Code output with no change, but then ANSWER: Uncertain.

 However, note that the problem says "complete code with proof", but we don't have the proof. So we leave sorry.

 And then ANSWER: Uncertain.

 But wait, the user in Stage 1 might have validated these axioms because they expected a proof. Perhaps they made a mistake?

 Given the above, we output:

ANSWER: Uncertain

 But you can see that we did not replace sorry. 

 Alternatively, we might write a proof that is "by_contradiction" and then they we get a contradiction if we can find one? But when it fails, it's not valid.

 Therefore, we see no alternative.

 FINAL OUTPUT: Uncertain.

 However, let me try to prove it in a different way: maybe using the contrapositive of P5?

 We have: ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar) → ¬ ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar

 This is the contrapositive: ¬ A → B is equivalent to ¬ B → A.

   P5: ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬ C   [where C = IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar]
   Contrapositive: ¬ ¬ C → IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar

   But this is: ¬ ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar) → IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar

   We don't have C, so we cannot get the double negation eliminated? In classical logic, we have ¬¬D → D for any D, but D = the disjunction. So we would have to use the law of excluded middle on the disjunction.

 Step in classical logic:

   open Classical

   theorem JohnsCarIsTesla : IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar := by 
      by_contra h
      have h1 := P5 h   -- h1 : ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar)
      have h2 : ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∧ ¬ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar := by finish? 
      -- Now, we don't have a contradiction from any positive fact? 
      -- How about if we assume it's a solo EV?
      have h3 : IsSoloEV johnsCar → IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar := P4 johnsCar
      have h4 : IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar → IsOneSeater johnsCar := P3 johnsCar
      -- If we had IsSoloEV johnsCar, then we would have IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar, which contradicts h2.right.
      -- But we don't have IsSoloEV johnsCar.
      have h5 : ¬ IsSoloEV johnsCar := by 
          intro h5
          have h6 := h3 h5   -- h6: IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar
          exact h2.right h6
      -- But this doesn't give a contradiction.

      -- We also haven't used P1 or P2. 

      -- What if johnsCar is a one-seater?
      -- We don't have any information.

      -- Alternatively, assume it's a one-seater:
      --   Then by P1, we would have if it has TransportMultiple then contradiction. 
      --   But we don't know if it has TransportMultiple.

      -- So no contradiction yields.

      admit

 End we are stuck.

 Your option is to state Uncertain.

 But actually, wait! There is a way out? At the beginning, we thought we could prove:

   (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar) → IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar

 by P5. But actually, P5 does not say that.

 P5 says that if it's not a Tesla, then it is not (Tesla or single-seat). 

 But consider the disjunction altogether: either we have IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar or we don't.

   Case 1: IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar -> done.
   Case 2: ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar -> then by P5, we have ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar), which means ¬ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar.

        And then? We cannot use this to get IsTeslaModel3.

 So we are in case 2: we can only get that it is not single-seat and not Tesla, but we need the goal to be Tesla, which is false.

 Therefore, we finish case 1, but case 2 doesn yield the goal.

 But wait, what about if we have the disjunction of Tesla or single-seat? That's exactly what we need to get from somewhere? We don't have it.

 Hence, we cannot.

 Given that we cannot, the only option is to state Uncertain.

 We output the code as is with sorry, and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

 But then the user will see we did not replace sorry. And the instruction says to replace it with a valid proof term. So if we cannot, we must not output code without a proof? 

 I think the intended use is that when we can't prove it, we leave sorry and answer Uncertain.

 So the output should be the same code with an additional ANSWER: Uncertain.

 But note: we must use the classical namespace if we want to use by_contra? Let's try to check without open Classical.

 In the Proof: by_contra is not available without classical

 We are not given any classical axiom. So we Thisof using classical logic.

 Given the lack of classical reasoning and the inability to prove, we stick to sorry.

 Therefore, the complete code is as given, and then we answer Uncertain.

 Let's write:

<lean>
axiom Car : Type

axiom TransportMultiple : Car → Prop
axiom IsOneSeater : Car → Prop
axiom IsTeslaModel3 : Car → Prop
axiom IsSingleSeatElectric : Car → Prop
axiom IsSoloEV : Car → Prop

axiom P4 : ∀ c : Car, IsSoloEV c → IsSingleSeatElectric c
axiom P5 : ¬ IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar → ¬ (IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar ∨ IsSingleSeatElectric johnsCar)

theorem JohnsCarIsTesla : IsTeslaModel3 johnsCar := sorry
</lean>
ANSWER: Uncertain

 However, the problem did not include classical axioms. So we cannot by_contradiction unless we open classical. But we cannot modify the axiom section? 

 We are not allowed to modify the axioms or theorem statement. So we cannot add `open Classical`.

 Therefore, we cannot use by_contra. And without classical i.e., in intuitionistic logic, we cannot use the law of excluded middle. So even that avenue is closed.

 Hence, even more so, we cannot prove it.

 Therefore, the only option is to saying we cannot.

 We output the code with sorry and ANSWER: Uncertain.


=== RESPONSE ===
The given axioms do not provide enough information to prove that John's car is a Tesla Model 3. While P5 establishes a relationship between not being a Tesla Model 3 and not being a Tesla or single-seat electric car, the premises lack any assertion that John's car must have one of the defined properties (e.g., SoloEV, single-seat electric, etc.). Without additional information linking John's car to any specific characteristic that would force it to be a Tesla Model 3 (or lead to a contradiction if it isn't), the proof remains unattainable. Thus, the theorem cannot be proven.
