STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the given premises and the conclusion about "Rock".
 We'll define:
   - A type for the entities (let's call it `Entity`)
   - Peter's pets: we can have a predicate `IsPetersPet : Entity → Prop`
   - Predicates: `IsMammal`, `IsAnimal`, `IsMonkey`, `IsBird`, `CanFly`, `CanBreathe`, `HasWings`
   - Specific entity: `Rock : Entity`

 Premises:
  1. All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.
      ∀ x, (IsPetersPet x ∧ IsMammal x) → IsAnimal x
     But note: the premise says "that are mammals", so it's conditional on being a mammal.

  2. All monkeys are mammals.
      ∀ x, IsMonkey x → IsMammal x

  3. Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds.
      ∀ x, IsPetersPet x → (IsMonkey x ∨ IsBird x)

  4. Peter's birds can fly.
      ∀ x, IsPetersPet x → (IsBird x → CanFly x)

  5. All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
      ∀ x, IsAnimal x ∧ IsPetersPet x → CanBreathe x
     But note: the premise says "animals that are Peter's pets", so both conditions.

  6. If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
      ∀ x, IsPetersPet x → (CanFly x → HasWings x)

  7. Rock is Peter's pet.
      IsPetersPet Rock

  8. Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.
      CanFly Rock ∨ IsBird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock

 Conclusion: Rock is a monkey.
      IsMonkey Rock

 Let's formalize accordingly.

 However, note: the premise 8 says "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe."

 We'll create an axiom for each premise and then state the theorem.

 Important: We use `sorry` for the theorem, which is just the goal.

 We assume a type `Entity` for our universe.

 Let's write the code accordingly.

======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion to prove: `IsMonkey Rock`.
 However, note that we have a constant `Rock` and premise7 says `IsPetersPet Rock`.
 Also, premise8 says: `CanFly Rock ∨ IsBird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock`

 Let's try to prove by contradiction or by cases.

 But first, let's see what we can derive:

 From premise3: since `IsPetersPet Rock`, we have `IsMonkey Rock ∨ IsBird Rock`.

 We want to show `IsMonkey Rock`. So we can try to rule out `IsBird Rock`.

 How? If we assume `IsBird Rock`, then we can derive a contradiction? Let's see:

 If `IsBird Rock`, then from premise4: `IsPetersPet Rock → IsBird Rock → CanFly Rock`, so we get `CanFly Rock`.
 Then from premise6: `IsPetersPet Rock → CanFly Rock → HasWings Rock`, so we get `HasWings Rock`. But that doesn't contradict anything.

 Alternatively, we might use premise8.

 Let's break down premise8: `CanFly Rock ∨ IsBird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock`

 We have two cases for Rock: either `IsMonkey Rock` or `IsBird Rock` (from premise3).

 Case 1: `IsMonkey Rock` -> then we are done.

 Case 2: `IsBird Rock` -> then we get `CanFly Rock` (by premise4) and also we can try to derive `CanBreathe Rock`?

 How can we derive `CanBreathe Rock`?

 From premise5: `∀ x, IsAnimal x → IsPetersPet x → CanBreathe x`
 So we need to show that Rock is an animal.

 How? From premise1: `∀ x, IsPetersPet x → IsMammal x → IsAnimal x`
 But we don't have `IsMammal Rock` yet.

 If Rock is a bird, then is it a mammal? Our premises don't say that birds are not mammals, but also we don't have that birds are mammals.

 Actually, premise2 says monkeys are mammals, but not birds.

 So if Rock is a bird, then we don't have that it is a mammal.

 Therefore, we cannot use premise1 to get that Rock is an animal? Because we don't have `IsMammal Rock`.

 But wait: premise1 requires both `IsPetersPet x` and `IsMammal x` to get `IsAnimal x`. Without `IsMammal Rock`, we cannot get `IsAnimal Rock`.

 Then we cannot use premise5 to get `CanBreathe Rock`.

 Now, look at premise8: `CanFly Rock ∨ IsBird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock`
 If we are in the case `IsBird Rock`, then we have `IsBird Rock` (so the second disjunct is true) and also we have `CanFly Rock` (so the first disjunct is true). But that doesn't cause a contradiction.

 However, note that in the case `IsBird Rock`, we have both `CanFly Rock` and `IsBird Rock` (so the first two disjuncts of premise8 are true). But premise8 is an OR, so it's satisfied.

 So we don't get a contradiction in the case `IsBird Rock`.

 Therefore, we cannot rule out `IsBird Rock`? Then how can we conclude `IsMonkey Rock`?

 Let me reexamine the premises:

 premise3: `IsPetersPet Rock → (IsMonkey Rock ∨ IsBird Rock)`

 We have `IsPetersPet Rock` (premise7), so we have `IsMonkey Rock ∨ IsBird Rock`.

 We want to show `IsMonkey Rock`. So we must show that `IsBird Rock` leads to a contradiction.

 How? We don't have any negative premises.

 Alternatively, let's see if we can derive `CanBreathe Rock`:

 We need `IsAnimal Rock` and `IsPetersPet Rock` for premise5.

 How to get `IsAnimal Rock`? We need `IsMammal Rock` and `IsPetersPet Rock` (from premise1).

 How to get `IsMammal Rock`? From premise2: `IsMonkey Rock → IsMammal Rock`. But if we are in the case `IsBird Rock`, we don't have `IsMonkey Rock`.

 So without `IsMonkey Rock`, we cannot get `IsMammal Rock`, hence we cannot get `IsAnimal Rock`, hence we cannot get `CanBreathe Rock`.

 Now, premise8: `CanFly Rock ∨ IsBird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock`

 In the case `IsBird Rock`, we have:
   - `IsBird Rock` (so the second disjunct is true) -> the whole disjunction is true.

 But note: we don't have any contradiction.

 However, what if we try to assume `IsBird Rock` and see if we can derive `CanBreathe Rock`? We cannot, as argued above.

 Therefore, in the case `IsBird Rock`, we have `¬ CanBreathe Rock`? Not necessarily: premise8 says one of the three must hold. Since `IsBird Rock` holds, the disjunction is satisfied regardless of `CanBreathe Rock`.

 So we have no contradiction.

 This suggests that the conclusion `IsMonkey Rock` might not be provable.

 But wait, what if we use the disjunction in premise8 to get more?

 We have:
   `IsMonkey Rock ∨ IsBird Rock` (from premise3 and premise7)

 We consider two cases:

 Case 1: `IsMonkey Rock` -> then we are done.

 Case 2: `IsBird Rock` -> then we get:
   - `CanFly Rock` (by premise4: since `IsPetersPet Rock` and `IsBird Rock`)
   - Then by premise6: `HasWings Rock` (since `IsPetersPet Rock` and `CanFly Rock`)

 But still, no contradiction.

 Now, what about `CanBreathe Rock`? We cannot derive it in this case.

 But premise8 says: `CanFly Rock ∨ IsBird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock`

 In this case, we have both `CanFly Rock` and `IsBird Rock`, so the disjunction holds. We don't learn anything about `CanBreathe Rock`.

 Therefore, we cannot get a contradiction in the case `IsBird Rock`.

 This means that the statement `IsMonkey Rock` is not forced by the premises.

 In fact, the premises allow for Rock to be a bird.

 Example: 
   - Let Rock be a bird that is Peter's pet.
   - Then we have `IsBird Rock` -> so `IsMonkey Rock` is false.

 Therefore, the theorem is not valid.

 But wait, let me check if there is a way to derive a contradiction from `IsBird Rock`?

 We have:
   premise4: `IsPetersPet Rock → IsBird Rock → CanFly Rock` -> so `CanFly Rock`
   premise6: `IsPetersPet Rock → CanFly Rock → HasWings Rock` -> so `HasWings Rock`

 And that's it. There is no premise that says that a bird is not a monkey, but that's okay because we don't require mutual exclusivity.

 Also, there is no premise that says that rocks cannot be birds. The constant is named "Rock", but that doesn't impose any restriction.

 Therefore, the conclusion `IsMonkey Rock` is not necessarily true.

 So the answer is: we cannot prove the conclusion.

 But note: the problem asks to replace `sorry` with a proof. However, if the conclusion is not provable, then we must not provide a proof.

 However, the instructions say: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof." and then "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 Since we cannot prove the conclusion, we should not replace `sorry` with a proof. But wait, perhaps I missed something.

 Let me try to derive `IsMammal Rock` in the bird case? We don't have any premise that says birds are mammals. In fact, we have premise2: monkeys are mammals, but not birds.

 So without `IsMonkey Rock`, we don't get `IsMammal Rock`.

 Then we cannot get `IsAnimal Rock` (from premise1) because we need `IsMammal Rock`.

 Then we cannot get `CanBreathe Rock` (from premise5) because we need `IsAnimal Rock`.

 Now, premise8: `CanFly Rock ∨ IsBird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock`

 In the bird case, we have `IsBird Rock` and `CanFly Rock`, so the disjunction holds. We don't get any new information.

 Therefore, the case `IsBird Rock` is consistent.

 Hence, the conclusion `IsMonkey Rock` is not forced.

 So the theorem is not provable.

 But note: the problem says "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof". If we cannot prove it, we cannot replace `sorry` with a valid proof.

 However, the example provided in the instructions was a provable theorem. Here, we are stuck.

 Therefore, I must conclude that the conclusion is not provable from the premises.

 So I will not provide a proof. Instead, I will leave the theorem as unproven? But the task says to replace `sorry`.

 Alternatively, I can try to prove the negation? But the theorem is stated as `IsMonkey Rock`.

 Since I cannot prove it, I must answer that the conclusion is not provable.

 But the instructions say: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 Here, the conclusion is not necessarily true: it might be false (if Rock is a bird). So the answer is "False" meaning that the conclusion is false? But actually, the premises do not force it to be true, but they also do not force it to be false.

 However, note that the premises allow for Rock to be a bird, so the conclusion might be false.

 But the question is: is the conclusion true? It is not necessarily true.

 The problem does not ask for the truth value in the real world, but in the context of the premises.

 Since the premises are consistent with both `IsMonkey Rock` and `¬IsMonkey Rock` (if Rock is a bird), we cannot prove the conclusion.

 Therefore, the answer should be "Uncertain" because the premises do not determine the truth of the conclusion.

 However, note: the conclusion is a specific statement: `IsMonkey Rock`. We have two models:

 Model 1: Rock is a monkey -> then `IsMonkey Rock` is true.
 Model 2: Rock is a bird -> then `IsMonkey Rock` is false.

 So the truth of the conclusion is uncertain.

 But wait, is there a way to derive that Rock must be a monkey? We have not found one.

 Therefore, I will not provide a proof. Instead, I must indicate that the proof is not possible.

 However, the task requires me to replace `sorry`. If I cannot, then I must leave it as `sorry`? But that would be the same as the input.

 Alternatively, I can use classical reasoning to do a case split on `IsMonkey Rock` and then in the case `IsMonkey Rock` we are done, and in the other case we get `IsBird Rock` and then ... but we cannot close the case.

 Actually, we can try to use the disjunction in premise8 to derive a contradiction in the bird case? But we don't have any contradiction.

 Therefore, I conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 So I will not change the `sorry`. But the task says to replace it.

 Alternatively, I can use `exfalso` and try to derive a contradiction? But I don't see any.

 Given the above, I think the intended answer might be that the conclusion is not provable, so we mark it as Uncertain.

 But note: the problem says "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof". If I cannot prove it, I cannot provide a proof.

 However, let me try to prove it by cases:

 We have from premise3: `IsMonkey Rock ∨ IsBird Rock`

 We do cases on this.

 Case 1: `IsMonkey Rock` -> trivial.

 Case 2: `IsBird Rock` -> then we want to show `IsMonkey Rock`? But we cannot. So we must show that this case leads to a contradiction.

 How? We need to derive a contradiction from `IsBird Rock`.

 What do we have?
   - `CanFly Rock` (from premise4: `IsPetersPet Rock` and `IsBird Rock`)
   - `HasWings Rock` (from premise6: `IsPetersPet Rock` and `CanFly Rock`)

 And we have premise8: `CanFly Rock ∨ IsBird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock`

 But we have both `CanFly Rock` and `IsBird Rock`, so no contradiction.

 We also have that we cannot derive `CanBreathe Rock` (as argued). But that doesn't give a contradiction.

 Therefore, we cannot close the second case.

 So the proof attempt fails.

 Hence, I must conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 Therefore, I will not change the `sorry`. But the task requires me to replace `sorry`. 

 Alternatively, I can try to use the fact that `Rock` is called `Rock`? But there is no premise about rocks.

 Actually, there is a constant named `Rock`, but no predicate about being a rock.

 So I think the only honest answer is that we cannot prove the conclusion.

 But the problem says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 So I will provide the code unchanged (with `sorry`) and then answer "Uncertain"?

 However, the instructions say: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." and I cannot.

 Therefore, I must indicate that the proof is not possible.

 But note: the problem says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'", implying that it is provable.

 Let me double-check the premises:

 premise1: ∀ x, IsPetersPet x → IsMammal x → IsAnimal x
 premise2: ∀ x, IsMonkey x → IsMammal x
 premise3: ∀ x, IsPetersPet x → (IsMonkey x ∨ IsBird x)
 premise4: ∀ x, IsPetersPet x → IsBird x → CanFly x
 premise5: ∀ x, IsAnimal x → IsPetersPet x → CanBreathe x
 premise6: ∀ x, IsPetersPet x → CanFly x → HasWings x
 premise7: IsPetersPet Rock
 premise8: CanFly Rock ∨ IsBird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock

 Now, let me try to derive `IsMammal Rock`:

 We have from premise3: `IsMonkey Rock ∨ IsBird Rock`.

 If `IsMonkey Rock`, then by premise2: `IsMammal Rock`.

 If `IsBird Rock`, then we don't have any premise that says birds are mammals.

 So we cannot derive `IsMammal Rock` in the bird case.

 Then we cannot derive `IsAnimal Rock` (premise1) because we need `IsMammal Rock`.

 Then we cannot derive `CanBreathe Rock` (premise5) because we need `IsAnimal Rock`.

 Now, premise8: `CanFly Rock ∨ IsBird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock`

 In the bird case, we have `IsBird Rock` and `CanFly Rock` (from premise4), so the disjunction holds.

 There is no contradiction.

 Therefore, the conclusion `IsMonkey Rock` is not provable.

 So I will not provide a proof.

 But the task requires me to replace `sorry`. I must provide something.

 Alternatively, I can use `classical.choice` or something, but that would be cheating.

 Given the above, I think the only reasonable thing is to answer that the conclusion is Uncertain.

 So I will output the same code with `sorry` and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

 However, the instructions say to replace `sorry` with a proof. Since I cannot, I will leave it as `sorry`.

 But then the task is not completed.

 Alternatively, I can try to provide a proof that uses the disjunction in premise8 to derive a contradiction in the bird case? But I don't see how.

 Let me try to derive `CanBreathe Rock` in the bird case:

 We cannot, as discussed.

 But what if we use the disjunction in premise8? In the bird case, we have `IsBird Rock`, so the disjunction holds. We don't need to use the other disjuncts.

 So no contradiction.

 Therefore, I must conclude that the proof is not found.

 So I will output the code with `sorry` and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

 But the problem says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." and I cannot.

 Given the constraints, I will write:

 <lean>
 ... (the same axioms) ...
 theorem conclusion : IsMonkey Rock := sorry
 </lean>

 ANSWER: Uncertain

 However, the example in the instructions had a proof. This one does not.

 But the problem might be designed to be unprovable.

 Alternatively, I might have missed a way to derive a contradiction in the bird case.

 Let me try to derive `CanBreathe Rock`:

 We have `IsPetersPet Rock` (premise7).

 We need `IsAnimal Rock` for premise5.

 How to get `IsAnimal Rock`? We need `IsMammal Rock` and `IsPetersPet Rock` (premise1).

 How to get `IsMammal Rock`? We have no premise that says birds are mammals. In fact, mammals and birds are distinct in common sense, but the premises don't state that.

 Moreover, premise2 only says monkeys are mammals, but it doesn't say that birds are not mammals.

 So it is possible that in this logic, birds are mammals? But then we could use that.

 But we don't have any premise that says birds are mammals.

 Therefore, without `IsMammal Rock`, we cannot get `IsAnimal Rock`.

 Hence, we cannot get `CanBreathe Rock`.

 So the bird case is consistent.

 Therefore, the conclusion is not provable.

 So I will output the code unchanged and mark as Uncertain.

ANSWER: Uncertain

The premises do not force Rock to be a monkey. The disjunction in premise3 allows Rock to be a bird, and the premises are consistent with Rock being a bird (which would make the conclusion false). Premise8 does not provide a contradiction in the bird case, as its disjunction is satisfied by either IsBird Rock or CanFly Rock (derived from premise4). There is no premise linking birds to mammals or contradicting bird properties for Rock. Therefore, the conclusion is not provable from the given premises.
