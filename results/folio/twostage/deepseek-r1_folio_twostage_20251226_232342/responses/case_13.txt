STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given premises and a conclusion. We need to formalize the logical structure in Lean 4.

Premises:
1. A Japanese game company created the game The Legend of Zelda.
   We can interpret this as: There exists a Japanese game company that created The Legend of Zelda.
   However, note that the conclusion is about FIFA 22 being made by a Japanese video game company.
   So we need to have a way to talk about games and companies.

2. All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
   This means: For every game, if it is on the Top 10 list, then it is made by a Japanese game company.

3. If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
   So: For every game, if it sold more than one million copies, then it is on the Top 10 list.

4. The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.

Conclusion: FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese video game company.

We note that the conclusion is about FIFA 22, which is not mentioned in the premises. Therefore, we cannot prove the conclusion from the premises without additional assumptions? Actually, the premises do not mention FIFA 22 at all. However, let's see the logical structure:

The premises tell us about The Legend of Zelda: it sold more than one million, so it is on the Top 10 list, and therefore it is made by a Japanese company. But that doesn't directly say anything about FIFA 22.

But wait: the conclusion is independent of the premises? Actually, the problem says "Conclusion to formalize", meaning we are to formalize the entire argument, including the conclusion. However, note that the premises do not provide information about FIFA 22. Therefore, we must be missing something? Or perhaps the conclusion is not provable? But our task is just to formalize, not to prove.

We are to formalize the premises and the conclusion. We must introduce:

- Types: We'll have a type for `Game` and possibly for `Company`? Alternatively, we can have `JapaneseCompany` as a predicate on companies? But note the premises talk about "Japanese game company" and "Japanese video game company" (which we can consider the same).

Alternatively, we can have:
  `Game` : Type
  `Company` : Type
  `createdBy : Game → Company → Prop`   (or `madeBy : Game → Company → Prop`)
  `isJapanese : Company → Prop`

But note premise 2: "All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies." This means: for every game on the Top 10 list, there exists a Japanese company that made it? Or that the company that made it is Japanese? We'll interpret it as: the company that made the game is Japanese.

But note: a game might be made by one company. We can assume each game is made by one company? Or we can have a relation `madeBy : Game → Company → Prop` meaning that the company made the game, and we assume that each game is made by exactly one company? Actually, the problem doesn't specify, so we'll use a relation and then the axiom would be: if a game is on the Top 10 list, then there exists a company that made it and that company is Japanese.

Alternatively, we can have a function `maker : Game → Company` that assigns to each game its maker. Then we can say:

  axiom Top10 : Game → Prop
  axiom madeByJapanese : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → isJapanese (maker g)

But the problem does not specify that every game has a maker? Actually, the premises mention "created the game", so we assume every game we talk about has a maker? But note the conclusion: FIFA 22 must have a maker.

We have two options:

Option 1: Use a function `maker : Game → Company` (so every game has exactly one maker). Then:

  Premise 1: Let `zelda : Game`. Then `isJapanese (maker zelda)`
  Premise 2: ∀ g, Top10 g → isJapanese (maker g)
  Premise 3: ∀ g, SoldOverMillion g → Top10 g
  Premise 4: SoldOverMillion zelda

Conclusion: Let `fifa22 : Game`, then `isJapanese (maker fifa22)`

But wait, we don't have any information about fifa22? So how can we conclude? Actually, the premises don't tell us anything about fifa22. Therefore, we must have misunderstood.

Alternatively, note that premise 2 says "All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies." and premise 3 and 4 tell us that zelda is on the Top 10 list. But that doesn't help for fifa22.

But the conclusion is about FIFA 22. Since FIFA 22 is not mentioned in the premises, we cannot prove it. However, the problem says "Conclusion to formalize", meaning we are to formalize the conclusion as a statement. But without premises about FIFA 22, we cannot prove it. Therefore, in the formalization, we must note that the conclusion is independent.

But wait: perhaps the premises are intended to be general, and then we are to show that FIFA 22 satisfies the condition? However, we have no information about FIFA 22.

Alternatively, let me reread the premises: "All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies." and "If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list." and "The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies." -> so zelda is on the Top 10 list and hence made by a Japanese company. But that doesn't say anything about FIFA 22.

Unless we interpret the conclusion as: FIFA 22 is a game and we want to know if it is made by a Japanese company? But without any information about FIFA 22, we cannot prove it.

Therefore, I suspect that the problem might be misstated? Or perhaps we are missing a premise? But the problem gives exactly these premises.

Alternatively, note that the conclusion says "FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese video game company." and we have no premises about FIFA 22. Therefore, we must formalize the argument as given, even if the conclusion doesn't follow.

But wait: the problem says "formalize the logical structure", so we just represent the statements.

So we'll have:

  Game : Type
  Company : Type
  zelda : Game
  fifa22 : Game   -- because we need to talk about FIFA 22 in the conclusion
  maker : Game → Company   -- function assigning each game to its maker
  isJapanese : Company → Prop
  Top10 : Game → Prop
  SoldOverMillion : Game → Prop

Premises:
  axiom P1 : isJapanese (maker zelda)   -- because a Japanese company created it
  axiom P2 : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → isJapanese (maker g)
  axiom P3 : ∀ g : Game, SoldOverMillion g → Top10 g
  axiom P4 : SoldOverMillion zelda

Conclusion:
  theorem goal : isJapanese (maker fifa22) := sorry

But note: the first premise says "A Japanese game company created the Legend of Zelda", which we interpreted as `isJapanese (maker zelda)`. However, the second premise says "All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies", which we interpreted as `∀ g, Top10 g → isJapanese (maker g)`. And the third and fourth premises are clear.

But the conclusion is about `fifa22`, which is not mentioned in any premise. Therefore, we cannot prove it. However, we are to formalize the argument as given.

Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is intended to be about The Legend of Zelda? But the problem states "FIFA 22".

Another possibility: the premises are meant to be general, and then we are to show that any game that sells over one million is made by a Japanese company? And then if we knew that FIFA 22 sold over one million, we could conclude? But we don't have that.

But note: the premises do not say anything about FIFA 22. Therefore, we must include FIFA 22 as a constant and then the conclusion is a statement about it, but without any premises that mention it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to introduce FIFA 22 and then the conclusion is a separate statement? But that would be unprovable.

Given the instructions, we are to formalize the premises and the conclusion exactly as stated.

Therefore, we define:

  axiom Game : Type
  axiom Company : Type
  axiom maker : Game → Company   -- every game has a maker
  axiom isJapanese : Company → Prop
  axiom Top10 : Game → Prop
  axiom SoldOverMillion : Game → Prop

  -- Specific games:
  axiom zelda : Game
  axiom fifa22 : Game   -- because the conclusion mentions it

  -- Premises:
  axiom P1 : isJapanese (maker zelda)   -- The Legend of Zelda is made by a Japanese company.
  axiom P2 : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → isJapanese (maker g)   -- All games in Top10 are made by Japanese companies.
  axiom P3 : ∀ g : Game, SoldOverMillion g → Top10 g      -- Selling over a million implies Top10.
  axiom P4 : SoldOverMillion zelda                       -- Zelda sold over a million.

  -- Conclusion: FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese video game company.
  theorem goal : isJapanese (maker fifa22) := sorry

But note: we have no premise about FIFA 22. Therefore, the theorem `goal` is not provable from the premises. However, that's the problem's statement.

Alternatively, we might interpret "made by a Japanese video game company" as meaning that the company that made it is Japanese, which is exactly `isJapanese (maker fifa22)`.

So we'll formalize it as above.

However, note: the first premise says "A Japanese game company created the game the Legend of Zelda". We interpreted that as `isJapanese (maker zelda)`. But what if there are multiple companies? We assumed a function `maker` that assigns a unique maker. Alternatively, we could have a relation `createdBy : Game → Company → Prop` and then:

  axiom P1 : ∃ c : Company, createdBy zelda c ∧ isJapanese c

But then the second premise would be: ∀ g, Top10 g → ∃ c, createdBy g c ∧ isJapanese c

And the conclusion: ∃ c, createdBy fifa22 c ∧ isJapanese c

But note: the conclusion is about existence, and we have no information about fifa22.

This representation is more general because it allows multiple makers? But the problem says "created", which might imply one. However, the problem doesn't specify. We'll choose the simpler one: the function `maker`.

But let me see: the second premise says "made by Japanese game companies" (plural) but that could be interpreted as at least one. However, in the context, it's common to assume one maker per game.

Given the conclusion is about "made by a Japanese video game company" (singular), we'll use the function.

Therefore, the code is as below.

Note: We must declare `Company` as a type, and `maker` as a function from `Game` to `Company`.

Let's write the Lean code accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion, here's the formalization in Lean 4:

<lean>
axiom Game : Type
axiom Company : Type
axiom maker : Game → Company
axiom Japanese : Company → Prop

-- Top 10 list predicate
axiom Top10 : Game → Prop

-- Sales predicate
axiom SoldOverOneMillion : Game → Prop

-- Specific games
axiom zelda : Game
axiom fifa22 : Game

-- Premises
axiom created_zelda_japanese : Japanese (maker zelda)
axiom top10_japanese : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → Japanese (maker g)
axiom high_sales_top10 : ∀ g : Game, SoldOverOneMillion g → Top10 g
axiom zelda_sales : SoldOverOneMillion zelda

-- Conclusion to formalize
theorem fifa22_japanese : Japanese (maker fifa22) := sorry
</lean>

Explanation:
1. `Game` and `Company` are base types
2. `maker` function assigns a company to each game
3. `Japanese` predicate identifies Japanese companies
4. `Top10` and `SoldOverOneMillion` are game predicates
5. Specific games `zelda` and `fifa22` are declared
6. Premises are formalized as axioms:
   - Zelda's maker is Japanese
   - Top 10 games have Japanese makers
   - Million-sellers make Top 10 list
   - Zelda sold over a million copies
7. Conclusion is formalized as a theorem with `sorry` placeholder


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given the following axioms and a theorem to prove:

We have:
  - `maker zelda` is Japanese (by `created_zelda_japanese`)
  - If a game is in the Top10, then its maker is Japanese (by `top10_japanese`)
  - If a game sold over one million, then it is in the Top10 (by `high_sales_top10`)
  - `zelda` sold over one million (by `zelda_sales`)

The theorem we want to prove is: `Japanese (maker fifa22)`

Looking at the premises, we see that all the information is about `zelda` and there is no information about `fifa22` or its sales. The only game that has sold over one million is `zelda`, and hence only `zelda` is in the Top10. There is no premise that says anything about `fifa22`.

Therefore, we cannot prove that `fifa22_japanese` (i.e., that the maker of `fifa22` is Japanese) because we lack any information about `fifa22`.

However, let me double-check the axioms:

1. `created_zelda_japanese`: Japanese (maker zelda)
2. `top10_japanese`: for every game g, if it is Top10 then Japanese (maker g)
3. `high_sales_top10`: for every game g, if it sold over one million then it is Top10.
4. `zelda_sales`: SoldOverOneMillion zelda

From 3 and 4 we get: Top10 zelda (by applying high_sales_top10 to zelda and zelda_sales).
Then from 2 and Top10 zelda we get: Japanese (maker zelda) — which is exactly axiom 1.

But note: there is no connection between `zelda` and `fifa22`. We have no information about `fifa22`:

- Is `fifa22` sold over one million? We don't know.
- Is `fifa22` in the Top10? We don't know.

Therefore, we cannot prove that the maker of `fifa22` is Japanese.

Thus, the theorem as stated is not provable from the premises.

However, note that the theorem statement is `Japanese (maker fifa22)`. Since there is no information about `fifa22`, we cannot provide a proof.

But wait, the example in the instructions asked for a proof term. However, in this case, we cannot prove the theorem.

Given that the problem says to replace `sorry` with a valid proof term, but we don't have one, what should we do?

Looking back at the problem: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term."

But if the theorem is not provable, we cannot.

However, note that the instruction says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'", meaning that the axioms are already validated and the theorem should be provable? But in this case, it seems not.

Alternatively, I might have misunderstood the axioms.

Let me reexamine:

The goal is `Japanese (maker fifa22)`.

But none of the axioms provide any information about `fifa22`. Therefore, we cannot prove the goal.

But then, the answer should be that the theorem cannot be proven. However, the problem says "provide the complete code with a valid proof", but if the theorem is false under the given axioms, we cannot.

But wait: The problem says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", meaning that the axioms are consistent and the theorem is intended to be provable? Or not?

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the axioms.

Is there a premise that every game that sold over one million is in the Top10? Yes. And we know `zelda` did, so `zelda` is in the Top10. And then we know that if a game is in the Top10 then the maker is Japanese. So `zelda`'s maker is Japanese (which we already had). But what about `fifa22`? There is no information about `fifa22`.

So, the answer is that we cannot prove `fifa22_japanese`.

Therefore, the only possibility is that the theorem as stated is not provable. Hence, we must leave the proof as `sorry`? But the instruction says to provide a valid proof term. However, without more information, we cannot.

But note: the problem has two parts: (1) provide the code with the proof, and (2) after the code, provide an answer (True/False/Uncertain). The answer part is for the truth value of the conclusion? Actually, the problem says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

So, for the conclusion `fifa22_japanese` (that the maker of fifa22 is Japanese), given the premises, we do not know if it is true or false. Therefore, the answer is "Uncertain".

Therefore, we can do the following:

1. In the lean file, we must replace the `sorry` with something. But if we cannot prove it, we cannot.

But the theorem might be false? However, we cannot disprove it either because we don't have negative axioms.

Alternatively, maybe we can prove that it is not provable? But that is not a term in the logic.

I think the task is asking for a proof of the theorem if it exists. Since it doesn't, we have to admit we cannot. But the instruction says "provide the complete code with a valid proof". This is contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed something. Let me look again at the axioms:

The axioms are:
  - `maker` assigns a company to a game.
  - `Japanese` is a predicate on companies.

Given:
  `created_zelda_japanese`: the maker of zelda is Japanese.
  `top10_japanese`: for any game in the Top10, its maker is Japanese.
  `high_sales_top10`: any game that sold over one million copies is in the Top10.
  `zelda_sales`: zelda sold over one million.

From these, we conclude that zelda's maker is Japanese (which is given independently and also follows from the rules).

But about `fifa22` we have nothing. So we have no proof that its maker is Japanese.

So, if we are forced to write a proof, we cannot. Therefore, I suspect that the theorem `fifa22_japanese` is not provable from the premises.

But then, what should we do? The instruction says to replace `sorry` with a valid proof term. Without a proof, this is impossible.

Therefore, I must reexamine: did I misread the theorem? The theorem is `Japanese (maker fifa22)`. There is no evidence about `fifa22`.

But note: the `answer` part: after the code, we must answer True/False/Uncertain. So I think the answer is "Uncertain", meaning we cannot prove it from the given premises.

But for the Lean code, if we try to write a proof, we cannot. Therefore, we might have to leave it as `sorry`, but the task says to replace it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use an `example` that shows we cannot prove it? But that's not the task.

Wait, the example given in the instructions was provable. So what is different here? In the example, they proved `goal : Nice Cat` by using `R1 Cat T1`. Here, we have no analogous fact about `fifa22`.

Therefore, I think the intended conclusion might have been about `zelda`, but by mistake, it was written as `fifa22`. But the problem says: we are to formalize the conclusion that the maker of fifa22 is Japanese? The premise says nothing about fifa22.

So, in the Lean code, we cannot replace `sorry` by a valid proof because none exists.

Thus, I must conclude that the theorem is not provable, and report that the answer is "Uncertain".

But what to write in the Lean code? I cannot write a proof. So I will leave it as `sorry`? But that's the original.

Alternatively, the problem might be that we are to write a proof if it exists, and if not, then we should just leave it? But the instruction says "replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term", implying that it exists.

This is confusing.

Perhaps I overlooked an axiom? Let me read the axioms again:

There is an axiom `fifa22 : Game`, and we have:

  `created_zelda_japanese : Japanese (maker zelda)`
  `top10_japanese : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → Japanese (maker g)`
  `high_sales_top10 : ∀ g : Game, SoldOverOneMillion g → Top10 g`
  `zelda_sales : SoldOverOneMillion zelda`

No axiom about `fifa22`.

Therefore, we cannot. Thus, I must report that the proof is not possible and so the answer is "Uncertain".

But for the Lean file, I have to output something. I cannot output an unproven theorem with a proof.

Therefore, I will output the same code with `sorry` (because I have no proof) and then in the ANSWER part, I will say "Uncertain".

But the task says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term", meaning that we are only to do the replacement when we can. And if we can't, then we must report that it is not provable? But the format requires an ANSWER.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write a proof of negation? But that would be to prove that the maker of fifa22 is not Japanese, which we also cannot.

So, in the Lean code, we cannot write a proof, but we are required to replace the `sorry`. Therefore, I must leave it as `sorry` and add an answer?

Wait, the ANSWER is after the code. So:

<lean>
... same axioms ...
theorem fifa22_japanese : Japanese (maker fifa22) := sorry
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

But that uses `sorry`, which was already there. So we have not replaced it. We are stuck.

Alternatively, if we cannot prove it, we might try to prove something else? But the theorem statement is fixed.

Given the instructions, I think it is acceptable to conclude that the proof cannot be completed, so we output the same theorem declaration and then indicate that in the answer.

Therefore, the only honest approach is:

  We replace `sorry` with ...? We cannot. So we leave it as `sorry` and then say "Uncertain".

But the task says to replace with a valid proof term. So perhaps in case if it is unprovable, we should not output a proof.

But the problem says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

So, for the conclusion, we are asked if it is true, false, or uncertain (i.e., we cannot be sure from the premises).

In the example, the conclusion was True (because it was provable).

Here, we cannot be sure, so Uncertain.

Therefore, I will output:

<lean>
[the same axioms, and then the theorem with sorry]
</lean>
ANSWER: Uncertain

But the Lean linter would say that the theorem is not proven. But we have no choice.

Alternatively, write a comment that we cannot prove it? But the problem doesn't say.

To adhere to the format, I'll output the original code with the theorem as `sorry` and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

So, the code will be:

<lean>
axiom Game : Type
axiom Company : Type
axiom maker : Game → Company
axiom Japanese : Company → Prop

-- Top 10 list predicate
axiom Top10 : Game → Prop

-- Sales predicate
axiom SoldOverOneMillion : Game → Prop

-- Specific games
axiom zelda : Game
axiom fifa22 : Game

-- Premises
axiom created_zelda_japanese : Japanese (maker zelda)
axiom top10_japanese : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → Japanese (maker g)
axiom high_sales_top10 : ∀ g : Game, SoldOverOneMillion g → Top10 g
axiom zelda_sales : SoldOverOneMillion zelda

-- Conclusion to formalize
theorem fifa22_japanese : Japanese (maker fifa22) := sorry
</lean>
ANSWER: Uncertain

But that doesn't replace the `sorry` with a proof. So it's not following the instruction "replace sorry with a valid proof term".

So, what is the way out?

I think the only logical thing is that there was a mistake in the problem. Perhaps the theorem was supposed to be about `zelda` and not `fifa22`. If we change the theorem to be about `zelda`, then we can prove it.

But we are not allowed to change the theorem statement.

Alternatively, maybe there is an additional, unspoken axiom? For example, that `fifa22` also sold over one million? Then we could use the same chain. But we are not given that.

Therefore, I must report that it is not provable.

Given the constraints, since we are to output a valid Lean file and when loaded it should not have errors, we can only output a file with a `sorry` in the theorem.

So, I decide to output the same file and then say "Uncertain".

But let me see if we can provide a proof using classical logic? For example, by using `classical` we can make assumptions? But without additional axioms, we still cannot.

Conclusion: it's Uncertain.

Therefore, my output will be:

<lean>
axiom Game : Type
axiom Company : Type
axiom maker : Game → Company
axiom Japanese : Company → Prop

axiom Top10 : Game → Prop

axiom SoldOverOneMillion : Game → Prop

axiom zelda : Game

axiom top10_japanese : ∀ g : Game, Top10 g → Japanese (maker g)
axiom high_sales_top10 : ∀ g : Game, SoldOverOneMillion g → Top10 g
axiom zelda_sales : SoldOverOneMillion zelda

theorem fifa22_japanese : Japanese (maker fifa22) := sorry
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain


=== RESPONSE ===
The proof cannot be constructed because the premises provide no information about `fifa22` or its sales. The axioms mention `zelda` having high sales and being in the Top 10, but there are no axioms about `fifa22` being in the Top 10, having high sales, or having a Japanese maker. Therefore, the conclusion `Japanese (maker fifa22)` cannot be inferred from the given premises.

However, the Lean syntax requires replacing `sorry` with a term. Since the theorem is unprovable, we use `False.elim` applied to a contradiction that cannot be filled, indicating the proof is impossible under the current axioms. In practice, this demonstrates the unprovability, though Lean will show an error because the contradiction term is missing.
