STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the given premises and conclusion about John.
 First, we need to declare types and predicates.

 We have "people" as a type. Let's call it `Person`.
 We have John as a specific person.

 Predicates and actions:
  - "make wedding plans": we can define a predicate `MakesWeddingPlans : Person → Prop`
  - "are engaged": `Engaged : Person → Prop`
  - "invite others to come to their ceremony": `InvitesToCeremony : Person → Prop`
  - "has a well-attended wedding": `HasWellAttendedWedding : Person → Prop`
  - "have larger families": `HasLargerFamily : Person → Prop`
  - "invite friends to their ceremony": Note that the premise says "invite friends", but the conclusion says "invite others". We must note the difference.

 However, note the last premise: 
   "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony."

 And the conclusion: 
   "John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding."

 We have two different actions: 
   - inviting others (to come to their ceremony) [from premise 2 and 3]
   - inviting friends (to their ceremony) [from premise 5 and 6]

 So we must define two predicates:
   `InvitesOthersToCeremony : Person → Prop`   (for "invite others to come to their ceremony")
   `InvitesFriendsToCeremony : Person → Prop`  (for "invite friends to their ceremony")

 Now, let's break down the premises:

 Premise 1: "All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged."
   ∀ p, MakesWeddingPlans p → Engaged p

 Premise 2: "All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans."
   ∀ p, InvitesOthersToCeremony p → MakesWeddingPlans p

 Premise 3: "Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony."
   ∀ p, HasWellAttendedWedding p → InvitesOthersToCeremony p

 Premise 4: "Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families."
   ∃ p, HasWellAttendedWedding p ∧ HasLargerFamily p

 Premise 5: "If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans."
   Engaged John → ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)

   But note: the premise says "does not invite friends ... and make wedding plans". So it's negating the conjunction.

   Alternatively, we can read: John does not invite friends OR John does not make wedding plans? Actually, the negation of a conjunction is a disjunction of negations, but in the premise it's stated as a negation of the conjunction.

   So we write: Engaged John → ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)

 Premise 6: "If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony."
   HasLargerFamily John → (HasWellAttendedWedding John ∨ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John)

 Conclusion: "John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding."
   ¬ HasLargerFamily John ∧ ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John

 We'll declare:
   `axiom Person : Type`
   `axiom John : Person`

 Then the predicates.

 Note: We are not trying to prove the conclusion, just formalizing the premises and the conclusion as a theorem.

 Let's write the axioms for the premises:

  axiom P1 : ∀ (p : Person), MakesWeddingPlans p → Engaged p
  axiom P2 : ∀ (p : Person), InvitesOthersToCeremony p → MakesWeddingPlans p
  axiom P3 : ∀ (p : Person), HasWellAttendedWedding p → InvitesOthersToCeremony p
  axiom P4 : ∃ (p : Person), HasWellAttendedWedding p ∧ HasLargerFamily p
  axiom P5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)
  axiom P6 : HasLargerFamily John → (HasWellAttendedWedding John ∨ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John)

 And the theorem we want to formalize (without proof) is:

  theorem goal : ¬ HasLargerFamily John ∧ ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John := sorry

 However, note that premise 4 is about "some people", but we don't have any information that John is one of them. So we don't use premise 4 for John specifically.

 But the conclusion is about John. We are only formalizing the logical structure.

 Important: We must declare all the predicates and the type Person.

 Let's write the Lean code accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion provided, here is the formalization in Lean 4:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom John : Person

-- Predicates
axiom MakesWeddingPlans : Person → Prop
axiom Engaged : Person → Prop
axiom InvitesOthersToCeremony : Person → Prop
axiom HasWellAttendedWedding : Person → Prop
axiom HasLargerFamily : Person → Prop
axiom InvitesFriendsToCeremony : Person → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ (p : Person), MakesWeddingPlans p → Engaged p
axiom P2 : ∀ (p : Person), InvitesOthersToCeremony p → MakesWeddingPlans p
axiom P3 : ∀ (p : Person), HasWellAttendedWedding p → InvitesOthersToCeremony p
axiom P4 : ∃ (p : Person), HasWellAttendedWedding p ∧ HasLargerFamily p
axiom P5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)
axiom P6 : HasLargerFamily John → (HasWellAttendedWedding John ∨ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John)

-- Conclusion
theorem goal : ¬ HasLargerFamily John ∧ ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John := sorry
</lean>

Key elements:
1. Declares `Person` as a type and `John` as a specific person
2. Defines 6 predicates corresponding to the natural language concepts
3. Formalizes each premise as an axiom:
   - P1: Wedding planners are engaged
   - P2: Inviting others implies making plans
   - P3: Well-attended weddings require invitations
   - P4: Some with well-attended weddings have large families
   - P5: John's engagement excludes him from both inviting friends and planning
   - P6: Large family implies either well-attended wedding or friend invitations
4. The conclusion states John has neither a large family nor invites others to his ceremony
5. Uses `sorry` as a placeholder for the proof


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and need to prove the conclusion: ¬ HasLargerFamily John ∧ ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John.

Let me outline the premises:

P1: ∀ (p : Person), MakesWeddingPlans p → Engaged p
P2: ∀ (p : Person), InvitesOthersToCeremony p → MakesWeddingPlans p
P3: ∀ (p : Person), HasWellAttendedWedding p → InvitesOthersToCeremony p
P4: ∃ (p : Person), HasWellAttendedWedding p ∧ HasLargerFamily p
P5: Engaged John → ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)
P6: HasLargerFamily John → (HasWellAttendedWedding John ∨ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John)

We are to prove: ¬ HasLargerFamily John ∧ ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John.

Breaking down the conclusion, we need to show two things:
1. John does not have a larger family: ¬ HasLargerFamily John
2. John does not invite others to the ceremony: ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John

We have an existential in P4, but note that it does not specify which person. However, we are only concerned with John.

Let me try to see if we can derive a contradiction if we assume the negation of the conclusion.

But note: the conclusion is a conjunction. So we must prove both parts.

Alternatively, we can try to prove each part separately.

First, let's try to prove ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John.

Suppose, for contradiction, that John invites others to the ceremony: InvitesOthersToCeremony John.

Then by P2: MakesWeddingPlans John (applying P2 to John).
Then by P1: Engaged John.

Now, P5 says: Engaged John → ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)

We have Engaged John and MakesWeddingPlans John, so by P5 we get that John does not invite friends to the ceremony? Actually, P5 says that it is not the case that both are true. Since we have MakesWeddingPlans John, then it must be that ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

So we have: ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

But note that we haven't used P6 yet.

Now, what about the other part? We need to show ¬ HasLargerFamily John.

Assume HasLargerFamily John. Then by P6: HasWellAttendedWedding John ∨ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

We already have ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John (from above), so we must have HasWellAttendedWedding John.

Then by P3: InvitesOthersToCeremony John. But that's what we assumed and we are using it. So no contradiction yet.

Wait, we assumed InvitesOthersToCeremony John and then derived HasWellAttendedWedding John? Actually, from HasWellAttendedWedding John we get InvitesOthersToCeremony John by P3, but we already have that.

But note: we have an existential P4: there exists someone with HasWellAttendedWedding and HasLargerFamily. But that someone might not be John.

So far, we have assumed InvitesOthersToCeremony John and HasLargerFamily John, and we derived HasWellAttendedWedding John (via P6 and the fact that we don't have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John). So now we have:

John has a well attended wedding and has a larger family. That satisfies the existential, but that's okay.

But we haven't found a contradiction. So perhaps we need to consider the possibility that John is the one in P4? But P4 doesn't say that John is the one.

Alternatively, we might try to prove that John cannot have a larger family.

Let me try to assume HasLargerFamily John and derive a contradiction.

Assume HasLargerFamily John.

Then by P6: HasWellAttendedWedding John ∨ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

Case 1: HasWellAttendedWedding John.
  Then by P3: InvitesOthersToCeremony John.
  Then by P2: MakesWeddingPlans John.
  Then by P1: Engaged John.
  Then by P5: ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)
  But we have MakesWeddingPlans John, so we get ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

Case 2: InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.
  Then we have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

But note that we are in case 2 of the disjunction. Now, we don't have HasWellAttendedWedding John in this case? But we don't need it.

But wait, we assumed HasLargerFamily John and we are in case 2: InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

Now, does this lead to a contradiction? Not yet.

But note: we also have P5? We don't have Engaged John yet.

How do we get Engaged John? We would need MakesWeddingPlans John. But we don't have that from InvitesFriendsToCeremony John. We have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John, but that doesn't directly give MakesWeddingPlans John.

P2 says: InvitesOthersToCeremony p → MakesWeddingPlans p. But we don't have that John invites others to the ceremony? We have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John, which is a different predicate.

So we cannot derive MakesWeddingPlans John from InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

Therefore, in case 2, we have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John and HasLargerFamily John, but we don't have a contradiction.

But note: we are trying to prove the conjunction. We haven't used P4 yet.

P4 says there exists someone with a well attended wedding and a larger family. Let that person be called, say, p0.

So we have: HasWellAttendedWedding p0 ∧ HasLargerFamily p0.

Then by P3: InvitesOthersToCeremony p0.
Then by P2: MakesWeddingPlans p0.
Then by P1: Engaged p0.

But we don't know if p0 is John. So that doesn't directly help.

Now, let's go back to the two parts of the conclusion.

We need to show both ¬ HasLargerFamily John and ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John.

But note: if we can show that if John has a larger family, then we get a contradiction? Or if John invites others, then we get a contradiction?

Alternatively, we might show that John cannot be engaged? But we don't have that.

Wait, P5 is about John: Engaged John → ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)

But we don't know if John is engaged.

Let me try to assume that John invites others to the ceremony and see if we can derive a contradiction.

Assume InvitesOthersToCeremony John.
Then by P2: MakesWeddingPlans John.
Then by P1: Engaged John.
Then by P5: ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)
But we have MakesWeddingPlans John, so we get ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

Now, we have ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

But we don't have any contradiction yet.

Now, consider P6: if John has a larger family, then he either has a well attended wedding or invites friends to the ceremony.

But we have ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John, so if he has a larger family, then he must have a well attended wedding.

So assume HasLargerFamily John.
Then HasWellAttendedWedding John (because the other option is false).
Then by P3: InvitesOthersToCeremony John. But we already assumed that.

So we have: InvitesOthersToCeremony John and HasLargerFamily John leads to HasWellAttendedWedding John and then InvitesOthersToCeremony John (which we have) and also ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

But still no contradiction.

But note: we have an existential P4. However, John having a well attended wedding and a larger family would be consistent with P4.

So why would that be a problem? It isn't.

Therefore, we must consider that the conclusion might not be provable? But the task is to replace the sorry, so it must be provable.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me look again at P5.

P5: Engaged John → ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)

But note: the negation of a conjunction is equivalent to: ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∨ ¬ MakesWeddingPlans John.

So if John is engaged, then either he does not invite friends or he does not make wedding plans.

But in our case, when we assume InvitesOthersToCeremony John, we get MakesWeddingPlans John and Engaged John, so then by P5 we get that either ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John or ¬ MakesWeddingPlans John.

But we have MakesWeddingPlans John, so we must have ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

That's what we had.

But then if we assume HasLargerFamily John, we get HasWellAttendedWedding John (because the other option InvitesFriendsToCeremony John is false). Then we get InvitesOthersToCeremony John (by P3) which we already have.

So no contradiction.

But wait, we also have P4: there exists someone with both properties. But that someone might be John, and that seems consistent.

So what is the issue?

Perhaps the conclusion is not always true? But the task is to prove it.

Alternatively, maybe we can show that John does not have a well attended wedding? Or that John does not have a larger family?

Let me try to prove that John cannot have a well attended wedding.

Assume HasWellAttendedWedding John.
Then by P3: InvitesOthersToCeremony John.
Then by P2: MakesWeddingPlans John.
Then by P1: Engaged John.
Then by P5: ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)
But we have MakesWeddingPlans John, so ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

Now, by P6: if John has a larger family, then he has a well attended wedding or invites friends. We have well attended wedding, so that's fine. But we also have ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

But again, no contradiction.

Unless we can show that John does not have a larger family? But we haven't used P4 in a way that forces John to not have these properties.

Perhaps the trick is that P4 says there exists at least one person with both, but it doesn't say that John is that person. However, we are free to have John be that person or not.

But the conclusion claims that John does not have a larger family and does not invite others.

So if we let John be the person in P4, then we would have HasLargerFamily John and HasWellAttendedWedding John, which would contradict the conclusion.

Therefore, we must show that John cannot be the person in P4.

How can we show that John does not have a larger family?

We have to use P5 and P6 in a way that leads to a contradiction if John has a larger family.

Let me try to assume HasLargerFamily John and derive a contradiction.

Assume HasLargerFamily John.
Then by P6: HasWellAttendedWedding John ∨ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

Case 1: HasWellAttendedWedding John.
  Then by P3: InvitesOthersToCeremony John.
  Then by P2: MakesWeddingPlans John.
  Then by P1: Engaged John.
  Then by P5: ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)
  Since we have MakesWeddingPlans John, we get ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

  But we are in case 1, so we don't have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John? We have HasWellAttendedWedding John, which is fine.

  So in case 1, we have:
    HasLargerFamily John, HasWellAttendedWedding John, InvitesOthersToCeremony John, MakesWeddingPlans John, Engaged John, and ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

  Now, is there a contradiction? Not yet.

Case 2: InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.
  Then we have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John and HasLargerFamily John.

  Now, we don't have HasWellAttendedWedding John necessarily.

  Can we derive MakesWeddingPlans John? We have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John, but that doesn't give us MakesWeddingPlans John (only InvitesOthersToCeremony does by P2).

  So we don't have MakesWeddingPlans John yet.

  But we have Engaged John? We don't have that either.

  So in case 2, we have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John and HasLargerFamily John.

  Now, is there a way to get a contradiction? We haven't used P4 yet.

  P4 says there exists someone with HasWellAttendedWedding and HasLargerFamily. Let that person be p0.

  Then p0 has HasWellAttendedWedding p0 and HasLargerFamily p0.
  Then by P3: InvitesOthersToCeremony p0.
  Then by P2: MakesWeddingPlans p0.
  Then by P1: Engaged p0.

  But that's about p0, not John.

  So no contradiction.

But wait, in case 2, we have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John. And we have MakesWeddingPlans John? No, we don't have that.

However, P5 is about John: Engaged John → ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)

But we don't have Engaged John in case 2.

So case 2 seems consistent: John has a larger family and invites friends to the ceremony, but he may not be engaged and may not make wedding plans? But then he wouldn't be engaged, which is fine.

But then the conclusion claims that John does not have a larger family, but in case 2 we have HasLargerFamily John, which would be a problem.

Unless we can show that case 2 leads to a contradiction.

How? We have no premise that says that if you invite friends to the ceremony then you must make wedding plans or something.

So it seems that the premises do not force John to not have a larger family.

Perhaps the conclusion is not provable? But the task is to replace sorry, so it must be.

Wait, let me read P5 again: Engaged John → ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)

This is equivalent to: ¬ Engaged John ∨ ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John)

But in case 2, we have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John. If we also had MakesWeddingPlans John, then we would need ¬ Engaged John. But we don't have MakesWeddingPlans John.

So case 2 is: HasLargerFamily John and InvitesFriendsToCeremony John, and we have no information about MakesWeddingPlans John or Engaged John.

But then the conclusion would be false if case 2 holds.

Therefore, the only way the conclusion can hold is if case 2 is impossible. But we have no premise that says that if you have a larger family and invite friends then you must make wedding plans or be engaged.

So how can we force case 2 to be impossible?

Perhaps by using the existential P4 and then showing that if John has a larger family, then he must be engaged or something, but we don't have that.

Alternatively, maybe we can show that John cannot have a larger family by showing that if he does, then he would have to invite friends and make wedding plans, which would contradict P5.

But in case 1, we have MakesWeddingPlans John and not InvitesFriendsToCeremony John, which is fine for P5 because P5 only requires that they are not both true.

In case 2, we have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John, but not necessarily MakesWeddingPlans John, so P5 is not triggered.

So it seems the premises are consistent with John having a larger family (in either case).

But then the conclusion claims that John does not have a larger family, which would be false in that model.

Therefore, the theorem might not be true.

But let's try to build a model.

Assume there are two people: John and Alice.

Let Alice be the one who has a well attended wedding and has a larger family (satisfying P4).

For Alice:
  HasWellAttendedWedding Alice -> by P3: InvitesOthersToCeremony Alice -> by P2: MakesWeddingPlans Alice -> by P1: Engaged Alice.

For John:
  We are free to assign properties.

The conclusion says: ¬ HasLargerFamily John ∧ ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John.

But what if we set:
  HasLargerFamily John = true.
  InvitesOthersToCeremony John = false.

Then by P6: HasLargerFamily John -> HasWellAttendedWedding John ∨ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

We can set InvitesFriendsToCeremony John = true.

Then we have:
  HasLargerFamily John = true.
  InvitesFriendsToCeremony John = true.
  InvitesOthersToCeremony John = false.

Now, check P5: Engaged John -> not (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John and MakesWeddingPlans John)
  We have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John=true, so if Engaged John were true, then we would need not (true and MakesWeddingPlans John) = not MakesWeddingPlans John, i.e., MakesWeddingPlans John=false.
  But we can set Engaged John=false and MakesWeddingPlans John=false.

Then all premises are satisfied:

P1: for any p, if MakesWeddingPlans p then Engaged p. For Alice: true. For John: MakesWeddingPlans John=false, so implication holds.
P2: if InvitesOthersToCeremony p then MakesWeddingPlans p. For Alice: true. For John: InvitesOthersToCeremony John=false, so holds.
P3: if HasWellAttendedWedding p then InvitesOthersToCeremony p. For Alice: true. For John: we can set HasWellAttendedWedding John=false (since we have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John=true for P6).
P4: Alice satisfies.
P5: Engaged John=false, so the implication holds.
P6: HasLargerFamily John=true -> HasWellAttendedWedding John or InvitesFriendsToCeremony John. We have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John=true, so holds.

In this model, the conclusion is false because HasLargerFamily John is true and InvitesOthersToCeremony John is false, but the conclusion claims both are false. In particular, it claims ¬ HasLargerFamily John, but we have it true.

Therefore, the theorem is not true.

But the task is to provide a proof. However, in this model the conclusion is false, so the theorem is not valid.

But the user said "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", so perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the predicates.

Perhaps "InvitesOthersToCeremony" and "InvitesFriendsToCeremony" are related? But the premises don't say so.

Or maybe the person in P4 is not John? In my model, it is not John, and John has a larger family.

So the conclusion is not provable.

Therefore, I should answer Uncertain or False.

But the task is to replace the sorry, which suggests that it is provable.

Perhaps I missed a connection.

Another thought: P6 says: HasLargerFamily John -> (HasWellAttendedWedding John or InvitesFriendsToCeremony John)

In the case where John has a larger family and we are in case 2 (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John), then we have InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

Now, is there a way to derive that John must make wedding plans if he invites friends? The premises don't say that.

So I think the theorem is not provable.

Therefore, I will not be able to provide a proof.

But the instructions say: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry', your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof."

However, if the theorem is not true, then I cannot provide a valid proof.

Perhaps there is a proof that I am missing.

Let me try one more time.

Assume that John has a larger family. We want to derive a contradiction.

From P6: HasWellAttendedWedding John or InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

Case 1: HasWellAttendedWedding John.
  Then InvitesOthersToCeremony John (by P3).
  Then MakesWeddingPlans John (by P2).
  Then Engaged John (by P1).
  Then by P5: not (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John and MakesWeddingPlans John)
  Since MakesWeddingPlans John is true, we have not InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

  This is consistent.

Case 2: InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.
  Now, we don't have HasWellAttendedWedding John.

  Can we derive that John must make wedding plans? No.

  But wait, what if we use the existential P4? Let p0 be the person who has well attended wedding and larger family.

  Then for p0: 
    HasWellAttendedWedding p0 -> InvitesOthersToCeremony p0 -> MakesWeddingPlans p0 -> Engaged p0.

  But this is about p0, not John.

  So no interaction.

Therefore, no contradiction in either case.

So HasLargerFamily John is consistent.

Similarly, InvitesOthersToCeremony John: if we assume it, then we get Engaged John and not InvitesFriendsToCeremony John, and then if we assume HasLargerFamily John, we get HasWellAttendedWedding John, which is consistent.

So the only way the conclusion could be true is if in all models, John does not have a larger family and does not invite others.

But in the model I built, John has a larger family and does not invite others (but invites friends), and the premises are satisfied.

Therefore, the theorem is not valid.

So I should answer Uncertain or False.

But the user expects a proof.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the model. In the model, I set InvitesOthersToCeremony John = false, which is what the conclusion claims for the second part, but the first part (¬ HasLargerFamily John) is false because HasLargerFamily John=true.

And the conclusion is a conjunction, so it requires both to be true.

In the model, the conclusion is false.

Therefore, the theorem is not true.

Given that, I cannot provide a proof.

But the instructions say: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

So I will say Uncertain or False.

But let's see the example: in the example, the proof was provided.

So for this one, since I cannot find a proof and found a countermodel, I should say False.

However, the task is to replace the sorry. If the theorem is not true, then I cannot.

Perhaps the premises are intended to be only about John? But P4 is existential, and P1, P2, P3 are for all.

Or maybe I need to use the existential to derive something about John.

Another idea: maybe from P4 and the other premises, we can show that there is someone who is engaged, but that doesn't help.

Perhaps we can show that John is not the person in P4.

But how?

Unless we can show that if John has a larger family, then he would have properties that conflict with P4 or something.

But P4 is just an existence; it doesn't preclude others from having those properties.

In fact, in my model, both Alice and John have larger families, but only Alice has well attended wedding.

So it's fine.

Therefore, I conclude that the theorem is not provable.

So I will output the code with a placeholder and then answer False.

But the instructions say: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." and if I can't, then perhaps I should leave it as sorry and answer.

But the user said: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof."

Since I cannot, I will state that it is not possible.

However, for the sake of the format, I might try to write a proof that is incorrect, but that would be bad.

Perhaps there is a proof using the existential.

Let me try to use the existential.

 We have P4: exists p, HasWellAttendedWedding p ∧ HasLargerFamily p.
 Let's call that person a.

 then for a:
   HasWellAttendedWedding a -> InvitesOthersToCeremony a (P3) -> MakesWeddingPlans a (P2) -> Engaged a (P1).

 Now, we are to show things about John.

 But there is no connection between a and John.

 So it doesn't help.

 Therefore, I think the theorem is not provable.

 So I will output the code with 'sorry' replaced by a proof that uses the existential, but I know it won't work.

 Alternatively, I can try to prove one part.

 For example, can we prove ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John?

 Assume InvitesOthersToCeremony John.
 Then as before: MakesWeddingPlans John, Engaged John, and then by P5: ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John) -> since MakesWeddingPlans John is true, we have ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

 But that's it. We cannot go further.

 And we cannot discharge the assumption.

 So we have not proven ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John; we only have that if he invites others, then he doesn't invite friends.

 Similarly for the other part.

 So I think the answer is that the theorem is false.

 Therefore, I will answer False.

 But the code must be provided. Since I cannot provide a proof, I will leave sorry and explain, but the format requires complete code.

 Given the instructions, I must provide code.

 So I will provide a proof that is not valid, but that's not good.

 Perhaps the premises are meant to be used differently.

 Let me try to derive a contradiction from the negation of the conclusion.

 Negation of the conclusion: ¬ (¬ HasLargerFamily John ∧ ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John) 
 = HasLargerFamily John ∨ InvitesOthersToCeremony John.

 So assume either HasLargerFamily John or InvitesOthersToCeremony John.

 But we need to derive a contradiction.

 Case 1: InvitesOthersToCeremony John.
   Then as before: Engaged John and ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.
   Then by P6: if HasLargerFamily John, then HasWellAttendedWedding John or InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.
   But we have ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John, so if HasLargerFamily John, then HasWellAttendedWedding John, which then gives InvitesOthersToCeremony John (which we have) and then no contradiction.

   But if not HasLargerFamily John, then we only have InvitesOthersToCeremony John, and that's it.

   No contradiction.

 Case 2: HasLargerFamily John and not InvitesOthersToCeremony John.
   Then by P6: HasWellAttendedWed wedding John or InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

   Subcase 2.1: HasWellAttendedWedding John.
        Then by P3: InvitesOthersToCeremony John, which contradicts not InvitesOthersToCeremony John.

   Subcase 2.2: InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.
        Then we have HasLargerFamily John and InvitesFriendsToCeremony John and not InvitesOthersToCeremony John.

        Now, is there a contradiction? We don't have any premise that says that if you have a larger family and invite friends, then you must invite others or something.

        So no contradiction.

 Therefore, only in subcase 2.1 do we have a contradiction.

 So if HasLargerFamily John and not InvitesOthersToCeremony John, and if then HasWellAttendedWedding John, we get a contradiction.

 But in subcase 2.2, we don't.

 Therefore, the negation of the conclusion does not necessarily lead to a contradiction.

 So the theorem is not valid.

 Given that, I will output the code with a proof that is not valid, but I must do something.

 Alternatively, I might have missed that in subcase 2.2, we can derive something else.

 For example, from InvitesFriendsToCeremony John, can we derive MakesWeddingPlans John? The premises don't say that.

 So I think it's hopeless.

 Therefore, I will output the following code with a proof that is incomplete, and then answer False.

 But the instructions say "valid proof", so I cannot.

 Perhaps the answer is Uncertain.

 So I will output the code with sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 But the user said to replace sorry.

 I think I have to make a decision.

 Let me try to prove the part about not having a larger family.

 We can't.

 So I will provide a proof that only proves part of it, but that's not the theorem.

 Given the above, I will state that the theorem is not provable and answer False.

 But for the code, I will leave sorry and then answer.

 However, the format requires complete code.

 So I will provide a proof that uses classical logic and the existential to derive a contradiction, but I know it's not correct.

 But let's try one more idea: maybe from P4, we have a person a with HasWellAttendedWedding a and HasLargerFamily a.
 then for a: Engaged a, etc.

 Now, if we assume that John has a larger family, then by P6, John has either well attended wedding or invites friends.

 If John has well attended wedding, then we have two people with well attended wedding? That's not a problem.

 So no contradiction.

 Therefore, I give up.

 I will output the code with a proof that is not valid, but for the sake of the format, I will use the following incorrect proof:

 theorem goal : ¬ HasLargerFamily John ∧ ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John := by
   have ⟨p, hwp, hlp⟩ := P4
   have h1 : InvitesOthersToCeremony p := P3 p hwp
   have h2 : MakesWeddingPlans p := P2 p h1
   have h3 : Engaged p := P1 p h2
   -- but this is about p, not John
   -- now assume John has a larger family
   by_contra h
   rw [not_and] at h
   -- h: HasLargerFamily John ∨ InvitesOthersToCeremony John
   cases h with
   | inl hlj => 
        have h6 : HasWellAttendedWedding John ∨ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John := P6 John hlj
        cases h6 with
        | inl hwj => 
             have io : InvitesOthersToCeremony John := P3 John hwj
             have mw : MakesWeddingPlans John := P2 John io
             have ej : Engaged John := P1 John mw
             have : ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John) := P5 John ej
             -- and we have mw, so not (InvitesFriends ...)
             -- but we don't have that he invites friends, so no contradiction
             admit
        | inr ifj => 
             -- we have ifj: InvitesFriendsToCeremony John
             -- but we don't have that he makes wedding plans, so P5 doesn't apply
             admit
   | inr ioj =>
        have mw : MakesWeddingPlans John := P2 John ioj
        have ej : Engaged John := P1 John mw
        have : ¬ (InvitesFriendsToCeremony John ∧ MakesWeddingPlans John) := P5 John ej
        -- again, no contradiction
        admit

 This has admits, so not valid.

 Therefore, I cannot provide a proof.

 So I will output the original code with sorry and then answer False.

 But the user said to replace sorry.

 Given the instructions, I must provide a proof. Since I cannot, I will state that.

 But for the format, I will output the code with sorry and then answer False.

 However, the user might not accept that.

 Perhaps the theorem is true and I missed a connection.

 Let me read the predicates again.

 MakesWeddingPlans
 Engaged
 InvitesOthersToCeremony
 HasWellAttendedWedding
 HasLargerFamily
 InvitesFriendsToCeremony

 And the premises.

 Another thought: "InvitesOthersToCeremony" might include inviting friends? But the premises don't say that.

 In fact, there are two separate predicates.

 So I think my model is valid.

 Therefore, the answer is that the theorem is false.

 So for the code, I will leave sorry and then answer False.

 But let's try to at least prove part of it.

 We can prove that if InvitesOthersToCeremony John, then ¬ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John.

 But that's not the conclusion.

 So I think the best is to output:

<lean>
... axioms ...
theorem goal : ¬ HasLargerFamily John ∧ ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John := by
  sorry
</lean>
ANSWER: False

 But the user might not like the sorry.

 Perhaps in the context, "InvitesOthersToCeremony" means inviting non-friends, and "InvitesFriendsToCeremony" is separate, and together they might be used, but the premises don't connect them.

 So I think it's hopeless.

 Therefore, I will output the code with sorry and answer False.


=== RESPONSE ===
After careful analysis, the provided premises do not entail the conclusion `¬ HasLargerFamily John ∧ ¬ InvitesOthersToCeremony John`. A countermodel exists where John has a larger family (`HasLargerFamily John = true`) and does not invite others to the ceremony (`InvitesOthersToCeremony John = false`), while satisfying all premises. Specifically:

- Let there be two persons: John and Alice.
- Alice satisfies `HasWellAttendedWedding Alice` and `HasLargerFamily Alice` (P4).
- Alice's properties trigger `InvitesOthersToCeremony Alice`, `MakesWeddingPlans Alice`, and `Engaged Alice` via P3, P2, P1.
- For John: 
  - Set `HasLargerFamily John = true`.
  - Set `InvitesFriendsToCeremony John = true` (satisfying P6 via the disjunct).
  - Set `HasWellAttendedWedding John = false`, `InvitesOthersToCeremony John = false`, `MakesWeddingPlans John = false`, `Engaged John = false`.
- All premises hold:
  - P1, P2, P3 hold vacuously for John (antecedents false).
  - P5 holds since `Engaged John = false`.
  - P6: `HasLargerFamily John → (HasWellAttendedWedding John ∨ InvitesFriendsToCeremony John)` holds via `InvitesFriendsToCeremony John = true`.
- Conclusion is false: `HasLargerFamily John` is true.

Thus, the theorem is **not provable** from the given premises. The `sorry` cannot be replaced with a valid proof.
