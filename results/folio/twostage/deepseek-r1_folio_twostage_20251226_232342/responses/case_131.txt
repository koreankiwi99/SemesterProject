STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the following premises and conclusion.

Premises:
1. Some mammals have teeth.
   This is existential: ∃ (x : obj), Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x

2. Platypuses have no teeth.
   For the platypus, it does not have teeth. Since we have a specific platypus, we can have:
   ¬ HasTeeth Platypus

3. Platypuses are mammals.
   Mammal Platypus

4. Humans have teeth.
   HasTeeth Human

Conclusion: Platypuses are mammals with no teeth.
This is: Mammal Platypus ∧ ¬ HasTeeth Platypus

But note: premise 3 already states that platypuses are mammals, and premise 2 states they have no teeth.
So the conclusion is essentially restating two premises.

However, we are to formalize the entire argument.

We'll need:
- A type `obj` for objects.
- Predicates: Mammal, HasTeeth.
- Constants: Platypus, Human.

But note: the first premise says "some mammals", so we don't need to introduce a specific constant for that. We can use an existential.

However, the other premises mention specific entities: Platypus and Human.

So we'll have:
axiom obj : Type
axiom Platypus : obj
axiom Human : obj
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop

Premise 1: ∃ x : obj, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
Premise 2: ¬ HasTeeth Platypus
Premise 3: Mammal Platypus
Premise 4: HasTeeth Human

Conclusion: Mammal Platypus ∧ ¬ HasTeeth Platypus

But note: the conclusion is exactly the conjunction of premise 3 and premise 2.

So we can write:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Platypus : obj
axiom Human : obj
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∃ x : obj, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom P2 : ¬ HasTeeth Platypus
axiom P3 : Mammal Platypus
axiom P4 : HasTeeth Human

theorem goal : Mammal Platypus ∧ ¬ HasTeeth Platypus := sorry
</lean>

However, note that the conclusion is about platypuses being mammals with no teeth, which is exactly `Mammal Platypus ∧ ¬ HasTeeth Platypus`.

But wait: the premises also include that platypuses are mammals and have no teeth, so the theorem is trivial from P3 and P2. But we are not proving, just formalizing.

Alternatively, we might interpret the conclusion as a general statement? But the conclusion says "Platypuses", meaning the specific platypus we are talking about.

Also note: the problem says "Platypuses are mammals with no teeth", which is a general statement about platypuses? But in the premises, we have a specific platypus (as a constant). However, in logic, if we have a constant `Platypus`, then we are talking about a specific one. If we wanted to say all platypuses, we would need to have a set of platypuses.

But the premises say "Platypuses have no teeth" and "Platypuses are mammals", which are general statements. However, in the given context, we have a constant `Platypus` and we are stating properties about that constant. This might be a simplification: we are modeling one representative platypus.

Alternatively, we could model:
- Have a type for animals, and then have a predicate `IsPlatypus`? But the premises say "Platypuses" as a plural, meaning we are talking about the entire kind.

But the problem also says "Platypuses have no teeth" meaning universally: every platypus has no teeth.

Similarly, "Platypuses are mammals" means every platypus is a mammal.

So we have two approaches:

Approach 1 (using constants for kinds? but then we have individuals) - but the premises mix individuals and kinds? Actually, the premises are about individuals: "Some mammals" (individuals that are mammals and have teeth), "Platypuses have no teeth" (meaning every platypus has no teeth), etc.

So we need:

obj: Type (for individual animals)
Platypus : obj → Prop   (to say which animals are platypuses)
Mammal : obj → Prop
HasTeeth : obj → Prop

Premises:
1. Some mammals have teeth: ∃ x, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
2. Platypuses have no teeth: ∀ x, Platypus x → ¬ HasTeeth x
3. Platypuses are mammals: ∀ x, Platypus x → Mammal x
4. Humans have teeth: ... but wait, we don't have a human predicate? And we have a constant Human? Or should we have a predicate for humans?

Alternatively, we can have:
axiom Human : obj   (a specific human)
and then premise 4: HasTeeth Human

But then premise 4 is about one human, not all humans.

The problem says "Humans have teeth", which is a general statement. So we should model:

axiom IsHuman : obj → Prop
axiom P4 : ∀ x, IsHuman x → HasTeeth x

But then we don't have a specific human? However, the first premise doesn't require a specific mammal either.

But note: the conclusion is about platypuses (the entire kind): so we want to say that every platypus is a mammal and has no teeth.

Conclusion: ∀ x, Platypus x → (Mammal x ∧ ¬ HasTeeth x)

But note: from premises 2 and 3 we have:
∀ x, Platypus x → Mammal x
∀ x, Platypus x → ¬ HasTeeth x

So the conclusion is the conjunction of these two.

But the theorem we state should be the conclusion: ∀ x, Platypus x → (Mammal x ∧ ¬ HasTeeth x)

However, we can derive it from the two premises.

But wait: the premises also include that there exists a mammal with teeth and that humans have teeth, which are not needed for the conclusion? That's fine.

So let's formalize with predicates for kinds:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop
axiom Platypus : obj → Prop
axiom IsHuman : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∃ x : obj, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → ¬ HasTeeth x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → Mammal x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, IsHuman x → HasTeeth x

theorem goal : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → Mammal x ∧ ¬ HasTeeth x := sorry
</lean>

But note: the conclusion says "Platypuses are mammals with no teeth", which is exactly the above.

Alternatively, if we interpret the premises as talking about specific representatives, then we could have:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom someMammal : obj   -- witness for some mammal (but we don't know if it's platypus or human) but we don't need to name it? Actually, we don't need a witness for the existential.

But the existential doesn't require a constant.

So the first approach with existential and universal quantifiers is better.

But wait: the premises say "Platypuses have no teeth" and "Platypuses are mammals" as general statements. So the second approach (using predicates for kinds) is more appropriate.

However, the problem also says "Platypuses" in the conclusion, meaning the entire kind.

So I think the second approach is correct.

But note: the problem says "Platypuses are mammals" as a premise, and then the conclusion is "Platypuses are mammals with no teeth". So we are restating that they are mammals and adding that they have no teeth.

In the premises, we have two separate statements: they are mammals and they have no teeth.

So the conclusion is combining them.

Therefore, we formalize:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop
axiom Platypus : obj → Prop
axiom IsHuman : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∃ x, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom P2 : ∀ x, Platypus x → ¬ HasTeeth x
axiom P3 : ∀ x, Platypus x → Mammal x
axiom P4 : ∀ x, IsHuman x → HasTeeth x

theorem goal : ∀ x, Platypus x → Mammal x ∧ ¬ HasTeeth x := sorry
</lean>

But note: we don't use `IsHuman` in the conclusion, but that's okay.

Alternatively, we could have omitted `IsHuman` and had a constant for a human individual? But the premise says "Humans have teeth", which is a general statement. So we must use a predicate.

But if we don't need the human in the conclusion, we could even omit the human predicate? However, the premise is given so we must include it.

But the problem says "Premises" and lists four premises, so we must formalize all four.

So we'll include `IsHuman`.

However, note: the conclusion does not mention humans, so it's fine.

Let me check: the conclusion is only about platypuses.

So the above formalization seems complete.

But wait: in the premises, we have "Platypuses are mammals" and "Platypuses have no teeth", and we are concluding the same? Actually, the conclusion is redundant, but we are just formalizing the argument.

So we output:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop
axiom Platypus : obj → Prop
axiom IsHuman : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∃ x : obj, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → ¬ HasTeeth x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → Mammal x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, IsHuman x → HasTeeth x

theorem goal : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → Mammal x ∧ ¬ HasTeeth x := sorry
</lean>


=== RESPONSE ===
The premises describe properties of mammals, platypuses, and humans. The conclusion restates that platypuses are mammals without teeth, which combines two premises.

Formalization:
- `obj` represents individual animals
- `Mammal` predicate for mammals
- `HasTeeth` predicate for having teeth
- `Platypus` predicate for platypuses
- `IsHuman` predicate for humans
- Premises use quantifiers for general statements
- Conclusion combines mammal and no-teeth properties for platypuses

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop
axiom Platypus : obj → Prop
axiom IsHuman : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∃ x : obj, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → ¬ HasTeeth x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → Mammal x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, IsHuman x → HasTeeth x

theorem goal : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → Mammal x ∧ ¬ HasTeeth x := sorry
</lean>


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and a theorem to prove.
 The theorem states: ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → Mammal x ∧ ¬ HasTeeth x

 We have the following axioms:
 P1: ∃ x : obj, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
 P2: ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → ¬ HasTeeth x
 P3: ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → Mammal x
 P4: ∀ x : obj, IsHuman x → HasTeeth x

 Note: The theorem only requires Platypus x to imply Mammal x and not HasTeeth x.

 We can break the theorem into two parts for a given x:
  1. Platypus x → Mammal x
  2. Platypus x → ¬ HasTeeth x

 Part 1 is directly given by P3.

 Part 2 is directly given by P2.

 Therefore, for any x, if we assume Platypus x, then by P3 we get Mammal x, and by P2 we get ¬ HasTeeth x.
 So we can form the conjunction.

 However, note that the theorem is universally quantified. We can prove it by introducing an arbitrary x and then assuming Platypus x.

 In Lean, we can write the proof term as:
   fun (x : obj) (h : Platypus x) => And.intro (P3 x h) (P2 x h)

 But note: P2 x h is a proof of ¬HasTeeth x, which is the same as (HasTeeth x → False). And similarly, P3 x h is a proof of Mammal x.

 Alternatively, we can use tactics mode.

 However, the problem says: "Use 'by' followed by tactics (no 'begin...end')", so we can write:

   by
     intro x h
     apply And.intro
     . apply P3; assumption
     . apply P2; assumption

 But note: the theorem is a forall-implication, so we can also write a term without tactics.

 Since the example provided used a term (R1 Cat T1) without tactics, but the requirement allows by-tactics, we have two options.

 However, the problem says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." and in the example they used a term. But note the example was very simple.

 But the problem also says: "Use 'by' followed by tactics" as an alternative to `begin ... end`. So we can use either a term or a tactic proof.

 Let me choose a term proof because it is short.

 Proof term: `fun x hx => ⟨P3 x hx, P2 x hx⟩`

 Explanation:
   We introduce x and hx (Platypus x). Then we form a pair (conjunction) of:
     - P3 x hx : Mammal x
     - P2 x hx : ¬ HasTeeth x

 So the complete code becomes:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop
axiom Platypus : obj → Prop
axiom IsHuman : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∃ x : obj, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → ¬ HasTeeth x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → Mammal x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, IsHuman x → HasTeeth x

theorem goal : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → Mammal x ∧ ¬ HasTeeth x := fun x hx => ⟨P3 x hx, P2 x hx⟩
</lean>

 But note: the theorem is exactly what P3 and P2 say. So we are done.

 However, note that P1 and P4 are not used. That is okay because we don't need them for this proof.

 After the code, we must provide an answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain

 The theorem we proved is True (because we provided a proof). But note: the question is about the theorem statement in the context of the axioms.

 Since we proved it from the given axioms, the answer is True.

 But note: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 So we write: ANSWER: True

 However, let me double-check: the theorem is exactly the conjunction of P3 and P2 for the same x. So yes.

 But note: P2 says ∀ x, Platypus x → ¬ HasTeeth x, and P3 says ∀ x, Platypus x → Mammal x. Therefore, for any x with Platypus x, we have both Mammal x and ¬ HasTeeth x.

 So the theorem is true.

 However, note that the theorem does not say anything about the existence of a platypus. We don't have an axiom that says there exists a platypus. But the theorem is universally quantified: for every x, if it is a platypus then ... So it holds vacuously if there are no platypuses. But our proof does not require existence.

 Therefore, we have proved the theorem.

 Final code:


=== RESPONSE ===
The proof relies directly on axioms P2 and P3. For any object `x`, if `Platypus x` holds:
- Axiom P3 proves `Mammal x`
- Axiom P2 proves `¬ HasTeeth x`
The conjunction is formed using `⟨⟩` syntax.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop
axiom Platypus : obj → Prop
axiom IsHuman : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∃ x : obj, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → ¬ HasTeeth x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → Mammal x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, IsHuman x → HasTeeth x

theorem goal : ∀ x : obj, Platypus x → Mammal x ∧ ¬ HasTeeth x := 
  fun x h => ⟨P3 x h, P2 x h⟩
</lean>

ANSWER: True
