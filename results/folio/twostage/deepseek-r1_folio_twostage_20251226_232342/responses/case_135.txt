STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given premises and a conclusion. We need to define objects and properties.

 Premises:
 1. Plungers suck.
 2. Vacuums suck.
 3. Vampires suck.
 4. Space is a vacuum.
 5. A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck.

 Conclusion: Space is a vampire.

 We note that the premises talk about different things: plungers, vacuums, vampires, space, and duster.
 We are going to model:

 - We need a type for the entities (let's call it `obj`).
 - We need predicates (or constants) for the properties and relations.

 Let's break down:

 Premise 1: "Plungers suck."
   We can interpret this as: every plunger sucks. But note that we don't have a universal quantification in the premise statement?
   Alternatively, we might take "Plungers" as a category that has the property of sucking, meaning that if something is a plunger then it sucks.

   Similarly, for vacuums and vampires: they are categories that have the property of sucking.

   However, note the fifth premise: "A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck." This implies that we have a category "duster" (one particular duster? or all dusters?) and also a category "household appliance". But the conclusion is about space and vampire.

   Let's think:

   We have:
     - Space is a vacuum (so Space is an object that belongs to the category vacuum).
     - Vacuums suck (so every vacuum sucks).

   Similarly, if we could show that every vacuum is a vampire? But that is not provided. The conclusion is that space is a vampire.

   However, note that the premises also state that a duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck. This might be used to contrast, but the conclusion is about space and vampire.

   How to relate?

   Actually, the premises are:

     P1: ∀x, Plunger(x) → Sucks(x)
     P2: ∀x, Vacuum(x) → Sucks(x)
     P3: ∀x, Vampire(x) → Sucks(x)
     P4: Vacuum(Space)
     P5: There exists a duster which is a household appliance and doesn't suck. OR we might take it as: 
          "A duster" meaning we have a particular duster: so we can declare a constant for that duster, and say that it is a household appliance and does not suck.

   But note: the conclusion is just "Space is a vampire", i.e., Vampire(Space).

   How can we derive that? We don't have any premise that connects vacuums and vampires.

   Let me re-read: The premises say:

     Plungers suck.  --> Plunger(x) -> Sucks(x)
     Vacuums suck.   --> Vacuum(x) -> Sucks(x)
     Vampires suck.  --> Vampire(x) -> Sucks(x)
     Space is a vacuum. --> Vacuum(Space)
     A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck. --> 
         We can have: ∃x, Duster(x) ∧ HouseholdAppliance(x) ∧ ¬Sucks(x), but actually it says "A duster" meaning one exists? Or is it about a specific known duster?

   Alternatively, if we interpret "A duster" as introducing a specific object, then we can say:

         axiom Duster : obj
         axiom HouseholdAppliance : obj → Prop
         axiom T5_household : HouseholdAppliance Duster
         axiom T5_no_suck : ¬ Sucks Duster

   But note: we also have that this duster is a duster? We haven't defined a predicate for being a duster. Alternatively, we might think of "duster" as the name of one object? Then we don't need a predicate.

   However, the problem doesn't require the proof, only the formalization. So we can formalize as:

        constant Duster : obj
        axiom HouseholdAppliance (x : obj) : Prop
        axiom T5 : HouseholdAppliance Duster ∧ ¬ Sucks Duster

   But wait: the premise says "A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck." It doesn't specify that every duster is like that? So we take it as there exists at least one thing that is a duster and a household appliance and that doesn't suck? 
   However, note that the English phrasing for introducing an example is often interpreted existentially. But to be safe, we can introduce a constant for a particular duster.

   However, the conclusion doesn't mention the duster, so we might not need it. But we are required to formalize all premises.

   There is more: the property "suck" is applied to various things. We note that:

        Plungers, vacuums, and vampires all suck, but the duster doesn't.

   But note: space is a vacuum -> so it sucks. And vampires suck. But that doesn't mean that if something sucks then it is a vampire.

   We don't have any premise that says the converse.

   Therefore, we cannot conclude that space is a vampire? 

   However, we are just formalizing the premises and the conclusion. The validity of the reasoning is not our concern. We just create the context in Lean.

   So we define:

     obj : Type
     Suck : obj → Prop   (or we can use the verb: Sucks)

     For the categories: we can have unary predicates: Plunger, Vacuum, Vampire, HouseholdAppliance.

   We also have a specific constant for "Space".

   Premise 5: we are introducing a specific object: Duster (which is a household appliance and does not suck). We note that the premise doesn't say that Duster is the only duster? But we don't have a predicate for duster at all. So we interpret "A duster" as introducing a particular object named Duster.

   Alternatively, we might interpret it as: there exists an object which is a duster and a household appliance and doesn't suck. We don't need a separate category for duster? But note: the premise says "a duster", which introduces the concept of a duster. We don't know if we need to refer to it again? The conclusion doesn't involve it.

   How about:

      We don't have a predicate for being a duster? Then we can ignore that part and just say: we have an object called Duster that is a household appliance and doesn't suck.

   Alternatively, we could introduce a predicate `Duster`? But the premise does not require to use the predicate afterward. So we can do either. I think the minimal way is to have a constant for the duster and capture the two properties: being a household appliance and not sucking.

   So:

        axiom obj : Type
        axiom Sucks : obj → Prop
        -- We need predicates for: Plunger, Vacuum, Vampire, and HouseholdAppliance?
        axiom Plunger : obj → Prop
        axiom Vacuum : obj → Prop
        axiom Vampire : obj → Prop
        axiom HouseholdAppliance : obj → Prop

        -- Premise 1: Plungers suck -> every plunger sucks
        axiom P1 : ∀ x, Plunger x → Sucks x

        -- Premise 2: Vacuums suck
        axiom P2 : ∀ x, Vacuum x → Sucks x

        -- Premise 3: Vampires suck
        axiom P3 : ∀ x, Vampire x → Sucks x

        -- Space is a constant
        axiom Space : obj

        -- Premise 4: Space is a vacuum
        axiom P4 : Vacuum Space

        -- We introduce Duster as a constant
        axiom Duster : obj

        -- Premise 5: Duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck
        axiom P5a : HouseholdAppliance Duster
        axiom P5b : ¬ Sucks Duster

        -- Conclusion: Space is a vampire.
        theorem goal : Vampire Space := sorry

   But note: the conclusion is just about space being a vampire.

   However, the premise 5 says "A duster is ...", meaning one particular duster. We are not making any claim about all dusters. We don't even have a predicate for being a duster. So we don't need to say that Duster is a duster? The premise only says it's a household appliance that doesn't suck.

   Alternatively, we can avoid creating a constant for Duster and instead use an existential? But that might complicate the formalization for the purpose of having a constant. Since the duster is mentioned once, and we don't refer to it again, and the conclusion doesn't involve it, we can do:

        axiom exists_duster : ∃ x, HouseholdAppliance x ∧ ¬ Sucks x

   However, the problem says "A duster", which in natural deduction might be treated either as existential or as a witness. We'll choose:

      We introduce a constant `Duster` to represent that particular duster.

   BUT: the problem says "A duster is ...", and in logic, if it's an arbitrary one then we use a constant. However, our proof won't use the duster because the conclusion is about space and vampire, so it doesn't matter.

   Therefore, we go with the constant.

   Let's write the code accordingly.

   IMPORTANT: The problem says "Vacuums suck" and "Vampires suck" etc., which we have formalized as implications. The conclusion is that Space is a vampire. We are not proving it, so we just write `sorry`.

   However, note: we have not included the predicate "Plunger" in any other premise? And similarly, we have the constant Duster. We might not need the Plunger at all? But we are required to formalize every premise.

   Since the duster is required in premise 5, we have included it.

   Let's write the Lean code accordingly.

   We'll define:

     obj : Type
     Sucks : obj → Prop
     Plunger, Vacuum, Vampire, HouseholdAppliance : obj → Prop

   Then the premises.

   But wait: in premise 5, we have that the duster is a household appliance and doesn't suck. So we do have a constant Duster.

   Let's do it:

   Note: We are going to use the following:

      type `obj`
      predicates as above
      constants: Space and Duster

   Finally, the theorem statement: Vampire Space.

   Code:


=== RESPONSE ===
The formalization captures the logical structure of the premises and conclusion using Lean 4 axioms. Here's the reasoning:

1. Create a universe of objects with `obj` type
2. Define predicates:
   - `Sucks` for things that suck
   - `Plunger` for plungers
   - `Vacuum` for vacuums
   - `Vampire` for vampires
   - `HouseholdAppliance` for household appliances
3. Add constants:
   - `Space` for space
   - `Duster` for the duster object
4. Formalize premises:
   - All plungers/vacuums/vampires suck (universal implications)
   - Space is a vacuum
   - Duster is a nonsucking household appliance
5. State conclusion as theorem: Space is a vampire

======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and need to prove that Space is a vampire.
 The premises are:
  1. All plungers suck: ∀ x, Plunger x → Sucks x
  2. All vacuums suck: ∀ x, Vacuum x → Sucks x
  3. All vampires suck: ∀ x, Vampire x → Sucks x
  4. Space is a vacuum: Vacuum Space
  5. Duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck: HouseholdAppliance Duster ∧ ¬ Sucks Duster

 We are to prove: Vampire Space.

 However, note that we have no direct link between vacuums and vampires. We know that Space is a vacuum and vacuums suck, so Space sucks. But we also know that vampires suck, but that doesn't mean that everything that sucks is a vampire.

 Moreover, we have an example of Duster: it is a household appliance that doesn't suck. But that doesn't directly relate to Space.

 Let's see if we can prove Vampire Space.

 We have:
  space_vacuum : Vacuum Space
  vacuums_suck : ∀ x, Vacuum x → Sucks x

 So we can get: Sucks Space.

 Now, from vampires_suck: ∀ x, Vampire x → Sucks x, this says that if something is a vampire then it sucks, but it does not say that if something sucks then it is a vampire. This is a one-way implication.

 Therefore, we cannot conclude that Space is a vampire just because it sucks.

 In fact, we have other things that suck: plungers and vacuums. So Space being a vacuum and sucking does not make it a vampire.

 Moreover, we have the duster which is a household appliance that doesn't suck. But that doesn't contradict anything about Space.

 Therefore, the proof cannot be completed with the given premises.

 However, let me double-check: is there any other axiom that might connect? We have:
  plungers_suck, vacuums_suck, vampires_suck, and duster_appliance and duster_no_suck.

 There is no axiom that says that vacuums are vampires or anything of the sort.

 So the theorem "Space is a vampire" is not provable from the given premises.

 But wait: the problem says "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof". If we cannot prove it, then we must not provide a proof. However, note that the task says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry', your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof."

 If we cannot prove it, then we cannot replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term. Therefore, we must conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 However, the example provided in the instructions shows a straightforward proof. In this case, we have no evidence for Vampire Space.

 Therefore, we must answer Uncertain? But note: the problem says to replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term. If we cannot, then we must not pretend we can.

 But wait: perhaps we can use the fact that Duster doesn't suck to show that Space is not a plunger or something? But that doesn't help.

 Alternatively, is there a contradiction? Let's see:

 We have:
   Sucks Space (from vacuums_suck and space_vacuum)
   Also, we have ¬ Sucks Duster.

 But that doesn't lead to a contradiction because Space and Duster are different.

 So I think the theorem is not provable.

 However, note that the problem says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 We are to say whether the theorem is true, false, or uncertain? But actually, the question is: is the conclusion true given the premises? 

 But in logic, we are only concerned with provability. Since we cannot prove it, and we cannot disprove it (because we don't have any axiom that says vacuums are not vampires, for example), then the answer is Uncertain.

 However, let me try to disprove it? We don't have any axiom that says that Space is not a vampire. So we cannot disprove it either.

 Therefore, the status is uncertain.

 But the problem asks for a proof term. Since we cannot provide one, we must leave it as sorry? But that would not complete the task.

 Alternatively, we might try to use classical logic? But the problem doesn't specify.

 However, note: the premises are consistent with Space being a vampire and also consistent with Space not being a vampire.

 For example, we can have a model where Space is a vacuum and sucks, and is also a vampire -> that satisfies all premises? 
   Premise 4: Vacuum Space -> holds.
   Premise 2: vacuums_suck -> Sucks Space -> holds.
   Premise 3: vampires_suck -> if Space is a vampire then it sucks -> holds because we have Sucks Space.
   Premise 1: plungers_suck -> doesn't involve Space.
   Premise 5: holds for Duster.

 So one model: Space is both a vacuum and a vampire -> then the theorem holds.

 Another model: Space is a vacuum and not a vampire -> then we have Sucks Space (from vacuum) and we don't have Vampire Space. But we don't have any axiom that says that vacuums are vampires. So this model is also consistent.

 Therefore, the theorem is not entailed by the premises.

 So we cannot prove it.

 Therefore, we must not replace the sorry with a proof. But the task says: "replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". If we don't have one, then we cannot complete the task.

 However, note that the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'", meaning that the axioms are validated and the theorem is to be proven. But in this case, the theorem is not provable.

 Therefore, we must conclude that the theorem is not provable and hence we cannot provide a proof.

 But the problem does not say that the theorem is necessarily true. It might be that the theorem is false or unprovable.

 Since we are a theorem prover and we are to provide a proof, and we cannot, we must indicate that.

 However, the instructions say: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 So we can output the code with the 'sorry' still there? But that would not be replacing it.

 Alternatively, we might use a classical proof by contradiction? But let's see:

 Assume ¬ Vampire Space.

 We have Sucks Space (by vacuums_suck Space space_vacuum).

 Now, we know that vampires_suck says that if something is a vampire then it sucks, but we don't have the converse.

 We also know that Duster doesn't suck. But that doesn't help.

 There is no contradiction in assuming ¬ Vampire Space.

 Therefore, we cannot prove it by contradiction either.

 So I think we must leave it as sorry and answer Uncertain.

 But the problem says: "replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". We don't have one.

 Therefore, we must break the rules? Or perhaps we can use an axiom that we don't have? No.

 Alternatively, we might try to prove it by using the fact that Space sucks and then ... but we have no rule that says "if something sucks then it is a vampire". In fact, we have multiple reasons for sucking: plunger, vacuum, vampire.

 So without additional axioms, we cannot prove it.

 Given the above, I will output the same code with the sorry still in place and then answer Uncertain.

 However, note: the problem says "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof". Since we don't have a proof, we cannot replace it.

 Therefore, I must state that I cannot provide a proof.

 But the problem does not give an alternative. So I will output the code without changing the sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 Alternatively, if we are allowed to use classical reasoning and the law of excluded middle, we might try:

   have s : Sucks Space := vacuums_suck Space space_vacuum
   classical
   cases (em (Vampire Space)) with
   | in h => exact h
   | in nh => ... but then we have no contradiction

 So that doesn't help.

 Therefore, I conclude that the proof is not possible.

 So my output will be:

<lean>
... the same code ...
theorem space_vampire : Vampire Space := sorry
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

 However, note that the problem says "replace 'sorry'", so if I leave it as sorry, I haven't replaced it. Therefore, I must provide an answer that replaces it with a proof if I can, and if I cannot, then I must indicate that.

 But the problem does not specify what to do in such a case.

 Since I cannot prove it, I will leave it as sorry and mark Uncertain.

 Alternatively, perhaps I can try to use the fact that Duster doesn't suck to show that Space must be a vampire? But how?

 We know that Space sucks. We know that Duster does not suck. We know that vampires suck, but that doesn't force Space to be a vampire.

 Therefore, I stick with Uncertain.

 However, let me see if there is a way to derive a contradiction if Space is not a vampire? We don't have any negative information about vampires or vacuums.

 So I think it's impossible.

 Final decision: We output the same code with sorry and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

 But note: the problem says "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof". Since we don't have a proof, we cannot replace it. Therefore, we must leave it as sorry.

 However, the problem expects a replacement. So perhaps we can use a tactic block that fails? But that would not be valid.

 Alternatively, we can use `by admit`? But that is not a valid proof.

 We are forced to leave it as sorry.

 Given the constraints, I will output the code as is and then answer Uncertain.

 But note: the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", meaning the axioms are consistent and the theorem is to be proven. Since it's not provable, we must not pretend it is.

 Therefore, I will output:

ANSWER: Uncertain

 However, I feel that this is not satisfactory because we haven't replaced the sorry.

 But I see no alternative.

 Alternatively, we might try to prove it using the fact that Space sucks and then by the definition of vampires? But we don't have such a definition.

 Or we might try to use the duster to show that Space is not a plunger? But that doesn't help.

 Let me try to see if we can prove that Space is not a plunger? We have no information about that.

 So I think it's hopeless.

 Therefore, I output the above.


=== RESPONSE ===
The theorem `space_vampire` cannot be proven from the given premises. The premises establish that:
1. Space is a vacuum (`space_vacuum`)
2. All vacuums suck (`vacuums_suck`), so Space sucks
3. All vampires suck (`vampires_suck`), but this does **not** imply that everything that sucks is a vampire
4. Duster is a counterexample of something that doesn't suck (`duster_no_suck`), but this provides no information about Space

There is no premise linking vacuums to vampires or any other logical connection that would force Space to be a vampire. Space could be a vampire, but this is not deducible from the axioms. Therefore, the proof remains `sorry`.
