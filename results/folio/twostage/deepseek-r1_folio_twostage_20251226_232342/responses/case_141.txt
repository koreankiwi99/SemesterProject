STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion.

 Premises:
 1. If a film is appropriate for all ages, then children can watch it without parental guidance.
 2. If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, then children cannot watch it without parental guidance.
 3. If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for all ages.
 4. All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
 5. All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.
 6. “Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is a film.
 7. “Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages.

 Conclusion:
 “Hachi: A dog's Tale” either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the "Frozen" series, 
    or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the "Frozen" series.

 We note that the conclusion is a disjunction of two parts:
   (A) It contains excessive erotic and violent content AND is in the Frozen series.
   (B) It neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is in the Frozen series.

 However, note that the second part is equivalent to:
   (not contains excessive) and (not in Frozen series)

 Steps:

 1. We introduce a type for films.
 2. We introduce predicates or constants as needed.

 We need:
   - A type for films: `axiom Film : Type`
   - Define constants:
        `axiom Hachi : Film`   (for “Hachi: A dog’s Tale”)
   - We also note the Frozen series: we can have a predicate `IsFrozenSeriesFilm : Film → Prop`

 Alternatively, we might have a set of films that are in the Frozen series. We can do:

   `axiom FrozenSeriesFilm : Film → Prop`

 3. Predicates:
      - `AppropriateForAllAges : Film → Prop`
      - `ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance : Film → Prop`   [we can also say: without parental guidance]
      - `ContainsExcessive : Film → Prop`   [meaning: contains excessive erotic and violent content]
      - `IsRatedGeneralAudience : Film → Prop`
      - `IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated : Film → Prop`

 4. Premises as axioms:

   Premise 1: ∀ f : Film, AppropriateForAllAges f → ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance f
   Premise 2: ∀ f : Film, ContainsExcessive f → ¬ ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance f
        Note: "children cannot watch without" is the negation of "children can watch without"
        So we write: ContainsExcessive f → not (ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance f)

        Alternatively, we might define a predicate for requiring guidance and state equivalence? 
        But premise 2 directly says: if excessive then they cannot watch without guidance, meaning they require guidance.

        Since we have defined `ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance`, then the opposite is `¬ ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance`.

   Premise 3: ∀ f : Film, IsRatedGeneralAudience f → AppropriateForAllAges f
   Premise 4: ∀ f : Film, IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated f → IsRatedGeneralAudience f
   Premise 5: ∀ f : Film, FrozenSeriesFilm f → IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated f
        Note: "All movies in the Frozen series" are defined by `FrozenSeriesFilm`

   Premise 6: Hachi is a film. (But we have a constant `Hachi : Film`, so we don't need an axiom for that.)

   Premise 7: IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi

 5. Conclusion:

      (ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ FrozenSeriesFilm Hachi) ∨ 
      (¬ ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ ¬ FrozenSeriesFilm Hachi)

 However, note: the conclusion says
        "either contains excessive and is in Frozen series, OR neither contains excessive nor is in Frozen series"

     That is: (A ∧ B) ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬B)   [which is the XOR? But note: XOR is (A ∧ ¬B) ∨ (¬A ∧ B), which is different]

     What we have is actually: (A ∧ B) ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬B) is equivalent to A ↔ B.

     But wait, the conclusion is stated as a disjunction of two cases.

     Alternatively, we could note that the two cases are disjoint and we must have one of them.

 Formalize:

      (ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ FrozenSeriesFilm Hachi) ∨ 
      (¬ ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ ¬ FrozenSeriesFilm Hachi)

 But note: the second part is "neither A nor B", which is (¬A ∧ ¬B).

 However, the problem does not state that one must hold? But the conclusion is: "either ... or ...".

 Implementation:

   We'll define:
      axiom Film : Type
      axiom Hachi : Film

      -- Predicates
      axiom AppropriateForAllAges : Film → Prop
      axiom ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance : Film → Prop
      axiom ContainsExcessive : Film → Prop
      axiom IsRatedGeneralAudience : Film → Prop
      axiom IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated : Film → Prop
      axiom FrozenSeriesFilm : Film → Prop

   Then the premises:

      axiom P1 : ∀ f : Film, AppropriateForAllAges f → ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance f
      axiom P2 : ∀ f : Film, ContainsExcessive f → ¬ ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance f
      axiom P3 : ∀ f : Film, IsRatedGeneralAudience f → AppropriateForAllAges f
      axiom P4 : ∀ f : Film, IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated f → IsRatedGeneralAudience f
      axiom P5 : ∀ f : Film, FrozenSeriesFilm f → IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated f
      -- Premise 6 is already covered by having `Hachi : Film`.
      axiom P7 : IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi

   The theorem:

      theorem goal : 
        (ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ FrozenSeriesFilm Hachi) ∨ 
        (¬ ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ ¬ FrozenSeriesFilm Hachi) := sorry

 However, note that the conclusion is about Hachi specifically.

 Let's check the conclusion: 
        “Hachi: A dog's Tale” either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the "Frozen" series, 
        or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the "Frozen" series.

 So our formalization of the conclusion is exactly:

        (ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ FrozenSeriesFilm Hachi) ∨ 
        (¬ ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ ¬ FrozenSeriesFilm Hachi)

 But note: the problem says "contains excessive erotic and violent content" -> that's our `ContainsExcessive`
            and "is a film in the Frozen series" -> `FrozenSeriesFilm Hachi`

 Therefore, we write the theorem accordingly.

 However, observe that the premises do not necessarily entail the conclusion? 
 But we are not proving it, just formalizing.

 Let's code accordingly.

 IMPORTANT: We are using `Film` as a type, and then predicates on `Film`. Also, we have a specific film `Hachi`.

 Let's write the code.

Here is the Lean 4 formalization of the given premises and conclusion:

<lean>
axiom Film : Type

-- Predicates and specific film
axiom ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance : Film → Prop
axiom AppropriateForAllAges : Film → Prop
axiom ContainsExcessive : Film → Prop
axiom IsRatedGeneralAudience : Film → Prop

axiom Hachi : Film

1. `Film` is defined as the base type
2. All predicates explicitly operate on `Film` objects
3. `Hachi` is declared as a specific `Film`
4. Premises 1-5 are universally quantified implications
5. Premise 7 uses disjunction for "family-friendly animated OR appropriate for all ages"
6. The conclusion captures the XOR-like structure with:
   - Left disjunct: Excessive content AND Frozen film
   - Right disjunct: Neither excessive NOR Frozen
7. All type declarations are explicit and syntax follows Lean 4 conventions


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given the following axioms and a theorem to prove.

We have:
  P1: ∀ f, AppropriateForAllAges f → ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance f
  P2: ∀ f, ContainsExcessive f → ¬ ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance f
  P3: ∀ f, IsRatedGeneralAudience f → AppropriateForAllAges f
  P4: ∀ f, IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated f → IsRatedGeneralAudience f
  P5: ∀ f, IsFrozenSeriesFilm f → IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated f
  P7: IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi

We need to prove:
  (ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi) ∨ 
  (¬ ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ ¬ IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi)

Note: The theorem is essentially saying that either Hachi is both ContainsExcessive and IsFrozenSeriesFilm, 
or it is neither.

We can try to use case analysis on P7 and also on the two possibilities for ContainsExcessive Hachi.

However, note that we do not have any direct information about Hachi being in the Frozen series or containing excessive content.

Let's think about the implications:

From P5 and P4, P3, P1, we have that if a film is in the Frozen series, then it is FamilyFriendlyAnimated, then RatedGeneralAudience, then AppropriateForAllAges, then ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance.

Also, from P2, if it contains excessive content, then it is not ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance.

Therefore, if a film is in the Frozen series AND contains excessive content, we get a contradiction: 
  ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi (from the chain) and not ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi (from P2).

So, it is impossible for Hachi to be both in the Frozen series and contain excessive content.

But note: our goal is to show a disjunction: either (ContainsExcessive and IsFrozenSeriesFilm) OR (neither). 
Since the first leads to a contradiction, we might think the second must hold? However, we don't know that one of these must be the case.

We have P7 which tells us that Hachi is either IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated or AppropriateForAllAges.

But note: 
- If we assume Hachi is IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated, then by P4 and P3 and P1, we get ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi.
- Similarly, if AppropriateForAllAges, then by P1 also ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi.

So in either case of P7, we have ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi.

Therefore, by P2, we have that Hachi does NOT contain excessive content.

So we have ¬ ContainsExcessive Hachi.

But what about IsFrozenSeriesFilm? We don't know yet.

We know that if it were in the Frozen series (IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi), then by P5 we have IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi, which we already have from one branch of P7? But wait, we don't know which branch holds, but we know that in either branch we have ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance, so we're safe from contradiction only because we already know ¬ContainsExcessive.

But note: we don't have any information that forces Hachi to be in the Frozen series or not. The problem is that we have no axiom that says that a film must be either in the Frozen series or not. Similarly for ContainsExcessive.

However, the goal is to prove:
  (ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi) ∨ (¬ ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ ¬ IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi)

We have shown that ¬ ContainsExcessive Hachi must hold. So we are halfway. We now need to also show either:
  ¬ IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi OR (ContainsExcessive ∧ IsFrozenSeriesFilm) but the latter is false.

But we don't know anything about IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi. So we cannot determine whether it is true or false.

Therefore, the theorem as stated might not be provable? 

But wait, let me reexamine:

We have P7: IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi.

If we have IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi, then by P4, P3, P1 we get ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi, and hence by P2 ¬ContainsExcessive Hachi.

Similarly for AppropriateForAllAges Hachi.

So indeed we have ¬ContainsExcessive Hachi.

Now, what about IsFrozenSeriesFilm? We don't have any information. The theorem says that we must have either both ContainsExcessive and IsFrozenSeriesFilm or neither. But we know ¬ContainsExcessive, so we need the second part: ¬ContainsExcessive and ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm. However, we don't know that ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm holds. 

But we also have the first disjunct: (ContainsExcessive and IsFrozenSeriesFilm) which is false because of ¬ContainsExcessive. So the goal becomes:

  False ∨ (¬ContainsExcessive ∧ ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm)

Which is equivalent to: ¬ContainsExcessive ∧ ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm.

But we cannot prove ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm because we don't have any information that precludes Hachi from being in the Frozen series.

Therefore, the theorem goal is not necessarily true? 

Wait a minute: but we have the disjunction in P7. And we have not used the fact that if Hachi is in the Frozen series then it must be FamilyFriendlyAnimated (by P5). But note: we don't have an axiom that says that a film that is FamilyFriendlyAnimated must be in the Frozen series. So being FamilyFriendlyAnimated doesn't imply being in the Frozen series.

Similarly, a film that is AppropriateForAllAges might or might not be in the Frozen series.

So we cannot conclude ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm.

Therefore, we can only prove ¬ContainsExcessive Hachi. But we cannot prove anything about IsFrozenSeriesFilm.

Thus, the theorem as stated is not provable? 

But let me see what we can do: we are required to have either:

Case 1: ContainsExcessive Hachi and IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi -> which we have shown is impossible.

Case 2: ¬ContainsExcessive Hachi and ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi.

But we cannot prove ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi.

So we cannot prove the goal.

But wait, perhaps the intended reasoning is to show that IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi must be false? Why?

Alternatively, note that P7 tells us that Hachi is either FamilyFriendlyAnimated or AppropriateForAllAges. In either case, we can use the chain of implications to get to ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance, and then by P2 we get ¬ContainsExcessive. However, that's all.

So we cannot force ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm. Therefore, it seems the theorem goal is actually false? How could it be false?

The goal is false only if there is a possibility of having ¬ContainsExcessive Hachi and IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi. That would break the second disjunct and the first disjunct would be false. Therefore, the disjunction would be false.

But note: the goal is only about Hachi. And in the context of the axioms, we can have a film that is FamilyFriendlyAnimated and in the Frozen series? Yes, that's consistent. So if Hachi were in the Frozen series, and we know it's not ContainsExcessive (as we have proven that), then we would have ¬ContainsExcessive and IsFrozenSeriesFilm. But the second disjunct requires ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm. So the goal would not hold.

Therefore, the theorem as stated is not provable? Yet the task says it's validated from Stage 1. Or is there a mistake?

Let me reassess the axioms:

We have no axiom that forces a FamilyFriendlyAnimated film to be in the Frozen series. So Hachi could be FamilyFriendlyAnimated but not in the Frozen series.

Alternatively, it could be in the Frozen series.

Thus, we cannot know about IsFrozenSeriesFilm.

But perhaps there is a way to derive ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm? I don't see one.

Therefore, the theorem goal is not provable. But the problem says to replace 'sorry' with a proof. Without additional axioms, we cannot.

However, note that the theorem might be requiring a different conclusion. Maybe we are misunderstanding.

Another idea: by the law of excluded middle, we know that IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi is either true or false. Similarly for ContainsExcessive. So we can do case analysis on IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi and on ContainsExcessive Hachi. But:

We know ContainsExcessive Hachi leads to a contradiction? Why? 

If ContainsExcessive Hachi, then by P2 we have ¬ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi. But from P7 and the chains, we have ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi. Therefore, ContainsExcessive Hachi leads to contradiction. So we must have ¬ContainsExcessive Hachi.

Now, what about IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi? We will do a case split:

If IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi is true, then we have to form the second disjunct we cannot because the second disjunct requires ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm. So we would have to use the first disjunct, but that requires ContainsExcessive which is false. Therefore, we get a contradiction? In this case:

If IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi and ¬ContainsExcessive, then we are trying to prove the theorem: 
  We need either (ContainsExcessive ∧ IsFrozenSeriesFilm) or (¬ContainsExcessive ∧ ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm). 
The first is false. The second requires ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm which we don't have. So we cannot prove the goal in the case IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi.

But we cannot avoid this case because we don't know whether IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi holds or not.

However, we also have the possibility that IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi is false. Then we have ¬ContainsExcessive (which we have) and ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm, so the second disjunct holds.

So the theorem holds if Hachi is not in the Frozen series, but not if it is.

But we have no information to rule out IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi. Therefore, we cannot prove the theorem unconditionally.

But the problem asks for the complete code with a proof. This suggests that perhaps we are missing something.

Let me read the theorem again:

theorem goal : 
    (ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi) ∨ 
    (¬ ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ ¬ IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi) 

This is equivalent to:
  ¬ (¬ (ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi) ∧ ¬ (¬ ContainsExcessive Hachi ∧ ¬ IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi))

But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, it is also equivalent to:
  (ContainsExcessive Hachi ↔ IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi)

But that doesn't seem to hold either.

Given the above, we must conclude that the theorem is false. But the problem says we are to replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term. Without additional information we cannot.

But wait, I think there might be a hidden contradiction: if IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi, then by P5, IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi. And by P4, IsRatedGeneralAudience, and so on, leading to ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance. And we already have ¬ContainsExcessive. There is no contradiction here. It is perfectly consistent for a film to be in the Frozen series and not contain excessive content.

Therefore, we cannot prove that it must not be in the Frozen series.

Given this, how can we prove the disjunction? We can't.

Thus, I suspect that the intended formalization of the conclusion was different. But as it stands, we cannot prove it.

But the problem states: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

In this case, I think we need to say Uncertain? Or False? The theorem itself is not provable from the axioms.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that by P7 we know that Hachi is either FamilyFriendlyAnimated or AppropriateForAllAges, and we derive ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance and then ¬ContainsExcessive. But then we cannot conclude anything about the Frozen series.

So how should we answer? The theorem goal is not always true? But we are in a fixed model: we have the film Hachi and the axioms. In every model satisfying the axioms, we have ¬ContainsExcessive Hachi. But the goal requires additionally that either Hachi is in the Frozen series and has excessive content (which is false) or it is not in the Frozen series and does not have excessive content. The latter requires that it is not in the Frozen series. However, there might be a model where Hachi is in the Frozen series and not having excessive content, which satisfies the axioms but not the goal because then we would need the second disjunct (¬ContainsExcessive and ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm) to hold, but it doesn't because IsFrozenSeriesFilm is true. Therefore, the goal does not hold in that model.

To have the goal hold in all models, we would need an additional axiom:

Maybe we are missing an axiom? The initial setup might have intended that Frozen series films are the only family friendly animated ones? But we don't have that.

Given the current axioms, the goal is not universally true. The theorem is not provable.

But the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions". So if it's validated, then either the proof exists or the theorem is provable.

Perhaps I made a mistake: 
  P7 is: IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi.

And from P5, if Hachi is in the Frozen series then it is FamilyFriendlyAnimated. But we have not used the possibility that if it is FamilyFriendlyAnimated, then ? How does that force the Frozen series?

Another avenue: we have only one film, Hachi. But we have universal quantifiers. However, the axioms do not force anything about Hachi being in the Frozen series.

Perhaps the intended proof is to show that it is not possible for Hachi to be in the Frozen series because then it would be FamilyFriendlyAnimated and by the chain we get ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance, and then if we assume ContainsExcessive we get a contradiction. But we don't have to assume ContainsExcessive. We already have that it is not ContainsExcessive.

So the only issue is that we need to show that it must not be in the Frozen series. I see no such axiom.

After rethinking, I recall that in the initial description there might be a missed axiom. But the problem states this is the validated code from Stage 1.

In the code, there is no P6. And there's a note on P7? 

But let's work with what we have.

However, I see now: the theorem is about Hachi. And if we cannot prove whether it is in the Frozen series or not, then the goal disjunction may not hold.

But the problem expects a proof? 

Alternatively, it is possible that since we have no way to prove IsFrozenSeriesFilm, and no way to disprove it, we have to consider both cases.

In Lean, we can do a case analysis on IsFrozenSeriesFilm by classical reasoning. Let's try:

We have already shown ¬ContainsExcessive Hachi.

Now, by classical.em (IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi), we have two cases:

Case 1: IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi
  Then we have the first disjunct: ContainsExcessive and IsFrozenSeriesFilm.
  But we have ¬ContainsExcessive, so we can discharge this by False elimination. HOWEVER: to form the disjunction we can only use one branch. In this case, the first disjunct is not provable. But the goal is a disjunction: if we are in this case, the goal does not hold.

Case 2: ¬IsFrozenいろfilm Hachi
  Then we have the second disjunct: not ContainsExcessive and not IsFrozenSeriesFilm, which is true.

But in case 1, we cannot prove the goal. Therefore, we cannot unconditionally prove.

But wait: in case 1, we have:
  ContainsExcessive and IsFrozenSeriesFilm -> but we have ¬ContainsExcessive, so that's false.
  So the first disjunct is false.
  The second disjunct requires ¬ContainsExcessive and ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm, but IsFrozenSeriesFilm is true so it's false.

So the entire disjunction is false.

So that case is a problem.

 However, we have not obtained a contradiction in case 1. In case 1 we only have:
   ¬ContainsExcessive (which is not contradictory by itself) and IsFrozenSeriesFilm (which might be true).

Therefore, case 1 is possible and the goal does not hold in case 1.

Hence, the goal is not a tautology.

But the only hope: perhaps we can derive that IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi is false? How?

Let me review what we have for Hachi:

We have IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi.

Now, if we had an additional axiom that, for instance, the Frozen series films are a subset of the family friendly animated films, which we do (P5 gives IsFrozenSeriesFilm f -> IsFamilyFriendlyAnimated f). But the converse is missing.

There's no axiom saying that if Hachi is FamilyFriendlyAnimated, then it must be in the Frozen series. So it could be independently family friendly animated.

So film Hachi is either:
  - Family friendly animated (but not necessarily Frozen series) then we have ChildrenCanWatch and then not excessive.
  - or AppropriateForAllAges, then we have ChildrenCanWatch and then not excessive.

And Frozen series is a subset of family friendly animated, but there may be family friendly animated films that are not Frozen series.

Therefore, our only way out is if we can prove that Hachi is not family friendly animated? But no, P7 says it is either family friendly animated or appropriate for all ages.

Perhaps there is an inconsistency in the film Hachi being family friendly animated and the Frozen series film not being the case. Looku 


After more reflection, I see. We cannot. So the theorem goal as stated is not provable. Therefore, the answer is Uncertain? Or rather, we should report that we can for the code we have. 

Given the time, we must write a proof that only proves what we can. What did we prove? We can prove that ¬ContainsExcessive Hachi, and then the goal reduces to requiring ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi. But since we cannot prove that, the entire goal cannot be proven. So in Lean, we can do:

Or.inr (And.intro ?ам мялни)

? where we have theAnd of not ContainsExcessive and not IsFrozenSeriesFilm. For that we need both. We have not ContainsExcessive, but we don't have not IsFrozenSeriesFilm.

Perhaps use classical logic. In classical logic, we </with>


=== RESPONSE ===
The theorem stated in the goal is not provable with the given axioms. The axioms allow for scenarios where `Hachi` is either in the Frozen series or not, while consistently satisfying all premises. Specifically:

- The `P7` axiom allows `Hachi` to be family-friendly animated OR appropriate for all ages.
- Both cases lead to `ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance` (via implications `P5→P4→P3→P1` or `P3→P1`), which by `P2` implies `¬ContainsExcessive Hachi`.
- However, there is no axiom forcing `IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi` to be true or false. Thus:
  - If `IsFrozenSeriesFilm Hachi` is true, the theorem's second disjunct (`¬ContainsExcessive ∧ ¬IsFrozenSeriesFilm`) fails.
  - The first disjunct (`ContainsExcessive ∧ IsFrozenSeriesFilm`) also fails because `ContainsExcessive Hachi` is false.
- The absence of axioms relating to `IsFrozenSeriesFilm` beyond the `P5` implication prevents resolution.

Therefore, a complete proof cannot be constructed. Here is the code with the best-effort proof and a placeholder comment explaining the issue:
