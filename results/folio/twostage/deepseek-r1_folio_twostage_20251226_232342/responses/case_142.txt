STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are only formalizing the logical structure, so we need to define the types and predicates.
 Steps:
 1. Identify the types: We have animals. We also have specific animals: Heck cattle and aurochs.
    However, note that Heck cattle and aurochs are kinds of animals. We can have:
      - A type for animals: `Animal`
      - Heck cattle and aurochs are specific subsets? We can use predicates.

 2. Predicates and relations:
    - `BreedingBack` : This is a form of artificial selection. We can define:
        `ArtificialSelection` : something that is done to animals? Or we can think of it as a property of the breeding process.
    But note: the premise says "Breeding back is a form of artificial selection". So we might have:
        `BreedingBack` is a property of a process? But then we are talking about animals being bred back.

  Let me re-read the premises:

   Premises:
   - Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.
     This seems to define breeding back. We can take:
        `BreedingBack` as a predicate on animals? Because it says "breeding of domestic animals", and then we have that Heck cattle were bred back.

   - Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs.
        So: There exist Heck cattle that were bred back and they resemble aurochs.

   - Heck cattle are animals. (We can have a predicate `HeckCattle` on animals)
   - Aurochs are animals. (Similarly, predicate `Aurochs` on animals? But note: aurochs are extinct, and we are talking about resembling aurochs. Also, the last premise: "Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals".)

  However, note: the conclusion is about Heck cattle being artificially selected.

  Let us break down:

   We have:
     "Breeding back" is a form of artificial selection. So if an animal is bred back, then it is artificially selected.

   So:
     ∀ x (BreedingBack(x) → ArtificiallySelected(x))

   But note: in the second premise, it says "Heck cattle were bred back". We might interpret that as: there exists a Heck cattle that was bred back? But it says "bred back" in a general way? Or as a breed?

   However, the conclusion states: "Some Heck cattle are artificially selected."

   So we need to show: ∃ x : Animal, HeckCattle(x) ∧ ArtificiallySelected(x)

  How do we get there?

   From the second premise: "Heck cattle were bred back" -> we can interpret as: all Heck cattle were bred back? Or some? The premise is about the breed being created by breeding back. But the conclusion says "some", so we don't necessarily need all.

   Looking at the text: it says "Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs." This is describing the origin of the breed. However, it does not necessarily say that every individual Heck cattle is bred back? Or maybe the breed as a whole?

   But note: the next premise says "Heck cattle are animals", and the last premise says "Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals".

   However, we are not forced to interpret the second premise as applying to every individual. We can take it as: there is at least one Heck cattle that was bred back? But the breed was created by breeding back, so we can assume that the Heck cattle we are talking about are the result of this process? But note, the conclusion only requires some.

   Let us try to represent:

    Define:
      `Animal : Type`
      `heck_cattle : Animal`? But we have multiple Heck cattle. So better to use predicates.

   We define:
      `HeckCattle : Animal → Prop`
      `Aurochs : Animal → Prop`   # but note: aurochs are extinct, so we might not have any living ones? But the premise says "resemble the aurochs", meaning they look like the extinct aurochs.

   Also, we have:
      `BreedingBack : Animal → Prop`   # meaning the animal was produced by breeding back?
      `ArtificiallySelected : Animal → Prop`

   But note the first premise: "Breeding back is a form of artificial selection". So it is a form (a subtype) of artificial selection? That leads to:

      `axiom A1 : ∀ a : Animal, BreedingBack a → ArtificiallySelected a`

   Now, the second premise: "Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs."

    We can break into two parts?
      - They were bred back: so we want to say that Heck cattle were produced by breeding back.
      - They were bred to resemble the aurochs: so they resemble aurochs.

    How to model "resemble"? Let's have:
      `Resemble : Animal → Animal → Prop`
        meaning: the first animal resembles the second.

    But note: aurochs are extinct, so we might not have any specific aurochs animal? But we can still have a predicate for aurochs and then we can say: the Heck cattle resemble aurochs in general? Or perhaps: there exists an aurochs that they resemble? But the premise is "resemble the aurochs" meaning the species.

    Alternatively, we can model: the property of resembling the aurochs as a unary predicate? Example: `ResemblesAurochs : Animal → Prop`

    Since the premise says "resemble the aurochs" and aurochs are a kind, we can use the latter.

    So we can have:

      `ResemblesAurochs : Animal → Prop`

    Then the second premise: we can interpret as: every Heck cattle was bred back? Or at least some? And that they resemble aurochs? Or that the breeding process was intended to produce animals that resemble aurochs? But the conclusion only requires existence.

    The key: we need to get that there is at least one Heck cattle that is artificially selected.

    Let us assume that the second premise implies that there is at least one Heck cattle (because the breed exists) and that it was bred back? Or we can take it as: for every Heck cattle, it was produced by breeding back? However, the premise does not specify "all", so we have to be cautious. But in logic, if we say "Heck cattle were bred back", we often mean the breed as a whole, hence every individual of the breed? But note that in biological contexts, it might mean the breeding program produced the breed. In any case, to get the conclusion, we only need one.

    However, the problem states: "Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s" — it is describing the origin. We don't know if every individual since then counts. So to be safe, we can interpret: there exists at least one Heck cattle that was bred back?

    But then note the last premise: "Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals." -> This also seems to be existential.

    So let's restate the premises:

      P1: Breeding back is a form of artificial selection. -> hence if an animal is subject to breeding back, then it is artificially selected.

      P2: Heck cattle were bred back -> meaning: there exists a Heck cattle that was bred back? OR we can introduce a specific animal? But we don't have names. So:

            ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h

      P3: Heck cattle are animals: we don't need an axiom because this is typing? Our predicate `HeckCattle` is on `Animal`, so that's fine.

      P4: Aurochs are animals: similarly.

      P5: Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals:

            ∃ a : Animal, BreedingBack a ∧ ∃ e : Animal, (Extinct e ∧ Resemble a e)

    But the conclusion is: Some Heck cattle are artificially selected.

            ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ ArtificiallySelected h

    So how do we get the conclusion:

        From P2, we have an Heck cattle, say h, that was bred back: `HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h`
        By P1, because `BreedingBack h` we have `ArtificiallySelected h`
        Therefore, `HeckCattle h ∧ ArtificiallySelected h`

    So we need P2 to be existential.

    However, we must also consider the "resemble" part? The conclusion does not require resemblance. So we can ignore that for the conclusion? But note, P2 also says that these Heck cattle were bred to resemble aurochs. We don't use that for the conclusion. So we don't need an axiom relating to the resemblance for the conclusion.

    But wait: the last premise? We aren't using it. And it says "Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals." We don't need that to conclude the desired conclusion. So we can omit it? Or should we include it?

    The instruction is: formalize the premises and the conclusion.

    So include all premises? But note the last premise is not used in the deduction for the conclusion? But we are only formalizing, so we have to include every premise.

    Now, for the last premise: we can break it down. It says:

        Some animals that are bred back resemble extinct animals.

        So: ∃ a : Animal, BreedingBack a ∧ (∃ e : Animal, Extinct e ∧ Resemble a e)

    We are introducing `Extinct` as a predicate? But note: the premise says "extinct animals", so we can form the set of extinct animals.

    However, we also have aurochs. We don't know if aurochs are extinct? But that is common knowledge? The problem states that we are formalizing what's given. The given premises do not say aurochs are extinct? But they are an extinct animal? Actually, the premise says: "resemble the aurochs" and then later "extinct animals". We don't have an explicit premise that aurochs are extinct.

    But we don't need that for the conclusion. So we can define:

        `Extinct : Animal → Prop`

    and then we have the last premise as:

        ∃ a : Animal, BreedingBack a ∧ ∃ e : Animal, Extinct e ∧ Resemble a e

    However, note: the second premise already says that Heck cattle (and in particular the bred back ones) resemble aurochs. But it does not say that aurochs are extinct. So we cannot link the two.

    We are required to formalize, so we'll include the premises as given.

    Let's write:

      Premise 1: ∀ a : Animal, BreedingBack a → ArtificiallySelected a

      Premise 2: ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h   [but note: the premise also says they resemble aurochs. We must include that?]

    Wait, the second premise has two parts: bred back and resemble aurochs. We cannot ignore the resemblance. So we can split Premise 2:

      Part A: ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h
      Part B: and also they resemble aurochs: but for which animal? Actually, the same animal. So:

          ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h ∧ ResemblesAurochs h

    But note: we have to model "resemble the aurochs". Since aurochs are a kind of animal, we could also interpret as: the animal h resembles every aurochs? Or some aurochs? But the premise is vague. However, in the last premise it uses the same structure: "resemble extinct animals", meaning there exists an extinct animal that they resemble.

    So for consistency, we can model resemblance as a binary relation: `Resemble : Animal → Animal → Prop`.

    Then we can say for Premise 2: not only we have an animal h that is Heck cattle and was bred back, but also: there exists an aurochs animal such that h resembles that aurochs? But we don't have any aurochs animal specified. And we also don't know that aurochs are animals? We have the premise: "Aurochs are animals", meaning we can have animals that are aurochs.

    So:

        Predicate `Aurochs : Animal → Prop`

        Then: ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h ∧ (∃ au : Animal, Aurochs au ∧ Resemble h au)

    But note: we might also need to say that aurochs are extinct? It is not stated. However, the last premise says "resemble extinct animals", so for the last premise we have:

        ∃ a : Animal, BreedingBack a ∧ (∃ e : Animal, Extinct e ∧ Resemble a e)

    Now, we have to be careful: we have two premises that use resemblance. We might use `Resemble` as binary.

    So we define:

      `Resemble : Animal → Animal → Prop`

    Then:

      Premise 2: ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h ∧ (∃ au : Animal, Aurochs au ∧ Resemble h au)

      Last Premise: ∃ a : Animal, BreedingBack a ∧ (∃ e : Animal, Extinct e ∧ Resemble a e)

    And we have:

      Premise 1: ∀ a : Animal, BreedingBack a → ArtificiallySelected a

    And the conclusion: ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ ArtificiallySelected h

    We also have explicit premises for:
      "Heck cattle are animals" -> Actually, we are using `HeckCattle` as a predicate on `Animal`, so implicitly any object satisfying `HeckCattle` is an animal. No need for an axiom.

      Similarly for Aurochs.

    But note: the last premise also requires extinct animals. We have defined `Extinct` as a predicate on `Animal`.

    We now need axiom declarations for all these predicates and types.

    Let's write:

        axiom Animal : Type

        -- Predicates:
        axiom HeckCattle : Animal → Prop
        axiom Aurochs : Animal → Prop
        axiom BreedingBack : Animal → Prop
        axiom ArtificiallySelected : Animal → Prop
        axiom Extinct : Animal → Prop
        axiom Resemble : Animal → Animal → Prop

        -- Premise 1: Breeding back is a form of artificial selection
        axiom P1 : ∀ a : Animal, BreedingBack a → ArtificiallySelected a

        -- Premise 2: Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs.
        axiom P2 : ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h ∧ (∃ au : Animal, Aurochs au ∧ Resemble h au)

        -- Premise 3: Heck cattle are animals -> is implicit, we don't need an axiom.

        -- Premise 4: Aurochs are animals -> implicit.

        -- Premise 5: Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals.
        axiom P5 : ∃ a : Animal, BreedingBack a ∧ (∃ e : Animal, Extinct e ∧ Resemble a e)

        -- Conclusion: Some Heck cattle are artificially selected.
        theorem goal : ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ ArtificiallySelected h := sorry

    But note: from P2 we have an animal h that is Heck cattle and bred back. Then by P1 (applied to h) we get ArtificiallySelected h. So we can prove the goal. However, we are not proving, just defining the theorem.

    However, we have a problem: the theorem is an existence statement. We are using `sorry` as placeholder.

    But note: if we don't require the resemblance part, then the second premise gives an animal h that is Heck cattle and bred back, so we have `HeckCattle h` and `BreedingBack h` and then we get `ArtificiallySelected h` by P1.

    However, in P2 we have the extra existential about resembling an aurochs. That doesn't affect the existence of h that is Heck cattle and bred back. So P2 would be enough without the last premise? But in formalization, we include the entire premise.

    But wait: the problem says "Premises: ..." and we have to include all. So we are including P5 even though not needed for this conclusion.

    So let's code accordingly.

    However, note: we don't use the fact that aurochs might be extinct? The last premise says "resemble extinct animals", but we don't require aurochs to be extinct necessarily? It might be that in P2 they resemble aurochs, and in P5 we have a separate fact about some bred back animals resembling an extinct animal (possibly not the same). But the problem does not say aurochs are extinct. So we cannot assume.

    So, we'll leave as above.

    But there's one more issue: the theorem name? We used `goal`.

    We are done.

    However, note: the example used `T1` and `R1`. We can use more descriptive names? Or just `P1`, `P2`, etc.

    Let's use `P1`, `P2`, `P5` for premises 1,2, and 5. Premises 3 and 4 are implicit.

    IMPORTANT: We must not forget the last premise.

    Let me list the premises again:

      Premises:
        P1: Breeding back is a form of artificial selection -> ∀ a, BreedingBack a → ArtificiallySelected a
        P2: Heck cattle were bred back ... -> ∃ h, HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h ∧ (∃ au, Aurochs au ∧ Resemble h au)
        P5: Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals -> ∃ a, BreedingBack a ∧ ∃ e, Extinct e ∧ Resemble a e

    Note: the problem says "Premises:" and then lists five sentences. We are treating the first as P1, the second as P2, and the fifth as P5. What about the third and fourth? They are just stating that Heck cattle and aurochs are animals, which we get by `HeckCattle : Animal → Prop` so no axiom needed? So we skip.

    So:

      We define Animal as a type.
      We define the predicates: HeckCattle, Aurochs, BreedingBack, ArtificiallySelected, Extinct, Resemble.
      Then axioms: P1, P2, P5.

    And then the theorem.

    Code accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the given premises and conclusion, the logical structure is formalized using Lean 4 axioms and a theorem declaration. The key elements are:

1. Define `Animal` as the base type
2. Define predicates:
   - `HeckCattle` for Heck cattle
   - `Aurochs` for aurochs
   - `BreedingBack` for animals produced by breeding back
   - `ArtificiallySelected` for artificially selected animals
   - `Extinct` for extinct animals
   - `Resemble` for resemblance relation
3. Formalize premises as axioms:
   - Breeding back implies artificial selection (P1)
   - Existential: Heck cattle bred back to resemble aurochs (P2)
   - Existential: Some bred-back animals resemble extinct animals (P5)
4. Declare theorem for conclusion (using `sorry`)

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type

axiom HeckCattle : Animal → Prop
axiom Aurochs : Animal → Prop
axiom BreedingBack : Animal → Prop
axiom ArtificiallySelected : Animal → Prop
axiom Extinct : Animal → Prop
axiom Resemble : Animal → Animal → Prop

-- Breeding back is a form of artificial selection
axiom P1 : ∀ a : Animal, BreedingBack a → ArtificiallySelected a

-- Heck cattle were bred back to resemble aurochs
axiom P2 : ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h ∧ (∃ au : Animal, Aurochs au ∧ Resemble h au)

-- Some bred-back animals resemble extinct animals
axiom P5 : ∃ a : Animal, BreedingBack a ∧ (∃ e : Animal, Extinct e ∧ Resemble a e)

-- Conclusion: Some Heck cattle are artificially selected
theorem goal : ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ ArtificiallySelected h := sorry
</lean>

Note: 
- Premises 3 and 4 (Heck cattle/aurochs are animals) are implicit in type signatures
- `P2` captures both breeding back and resemblance premises
- `P5` is included for completeness though not needed for conclusion
- Theorem uses `sorry` as placeholder per requirements


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and a theorem `goal` to prove: `∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ ArtificiallySelected h`

From the axioms, we have:

P1: `∀ a : Animal, BreedingBack a → ArtificiallySelected a`
  This says that if an animal is bred back, then it is artificially selected.

P2: `∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h ∧ (∃ au : Animal, Aurochs au ∧ Resemble h au)`
  This states that there exists an animal `h` that is a Heck cattle, and it is bred back, and it resembles some aurochs.

P5: `∃ a : Animal, BreedingBack a ∧ (∃ e : Animal, Extinct e ∧ Resemble a e)`
  This states that there exists an animal `a` that is bred back and resembles some extinct animal.

We are to prove that there exists a Heck cattle that is artificially selected.

Notice that from P2, we have an animal `h` that is a Heck cattle and that is bred back. Then, by P1, since `h` is bred back, it is artificially selected. Therefore, we can take the same `h` that we get from P2 and show that it is both Heck cattle and artificially selected.

Proof outline:
1. Obtain `h` from P2 (which has type `Animal`) such that `HeckCattle h`, `BreedingBack h`, and some other properties.
2. Since `h` is `BreedingBack`, we apply `P1` to `h` to get `ArtificiallySelected h`.
3. Therefore, we have `HeckCattle h` and `ArtificiallySelected h`, so we can use `h` as the witness for the existential.

Let's write the proof in Lean.

We can do it with a term that uses the exists-elimination from P2 and then constructs the required existential.

But note: in Lean, we can use `Exists.elim` or use the `match` statement. However, since we are not allowed to modify the theorem statement, we must replace the `sorry` with a proof.

Alternatively, we can use the `have` tactic in a proof by tactics? But the requirement is to provide a complete proof term. We can also write a proof term without tactics.

However, the problem says: "Use 'by' followed by tactics (no 'begin...end')". So we are allowed to use a tactic block.

But note: the example they provided was a term without tactics. But the format requirement says "Use 'by' followed by tactics", so we can use a tactic proof.

Let me see the requirements:

- Use only Lean 4 syntax.
- Use 'fun x => ...' (not λ)
- Use 'by' followed by tactics (so we can write a tactic proof)

Therefore, we can write:

`theorem goal : ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ ArtificiallySelected h := by ...`

Steps in the tactic:
1. From P2, we have `h` such that `HeckCattle h` and `BreedingBack h`.
2. Apply P1 to `h` and the proof of `BreedingBack h` to get `ArtificiallySelected h`.
3. Then, we have `HeckCattle h ∧ ArtificiallySelected h` for this `h`.
4. Use this `h` as the witness for the existential.

But note: P2 is an existential. So we can use `obtain` or `cases` to get the witness.

In Lean tactics, we can write:

```lean
  cases P2 with | intro h h_properties =>
    have HeckCattle_h : HeckCattle h := h_properties.left
    have BreedingBack_h : BreedingBack h := h_properties.right.left
    have ArtificiallySelected_h := P1 h BreedingBack_h
    exists h
    exact ⟨HeckCattle_h, ArtificiallySelected_h⟩
```

Alternatively, we can use:

```lean
  obtain ⟨h, HeckCattle_h, BreedingBack_h, _⟩ := P2
  have ArtificiallySelected_h := P1 h BreedingBack_h
  exists h
  exact ⟨HeckCattle_h, ArtificiallySelected_h⟩
```

But note: the `P2` also has another existential in the last component, but we don't need it. So we can ignore it.

Alternatively, we can use a more direct term:

Or we can write:

`Exists.elim P2 (fun h ⟨hH, hB, _⟩ => Exists.intro h ⟨hH, P1 h hB⟩)`

But the requirement is to use `by` followed by tactics, so we must use tactics.

Actually, we can also write a term without tactics if we wish, but the problem says to use `by` and tactics.

Therefore, we write:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type

axiom HeckCattle : Animal → Prop
axiom Aurochs : Animal → Prop
axiom BreedingBack : Animal → Prop
axiom ArtificiallySelected : Animal → Prop
axiom Extinct : Animal → Prop
axiom Resemble : Animal → Animal → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ a : Animal, BreedingBack a → ArtificiallySelected a

axiom P2 : ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h ∧ (∃ au : Animal, Aurochs au ∧ Resemble h au)

axiom P5 : ∃ a : Animal, BreedingBack a ∧ (∃ e : Animal, Extinct e ∧ Resemble a e)

theorem goal : ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ ArtificiallySelected h := by
  obtain ⟨h, h_heck, h_breeding, _⟩ := P2
  apply Exists.intro h
  constructor
  . exact h_heck
  . exact P1 h h_breeding
</lean>

But note: the `constructor` breaks down the conjunction. We can also do:

`exact ⟨h_heck, P1 h h_breeding⟩`

So:

<lean>
theorem goal : ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ ArtificiallySelected h := by
  obtain ⟨h, h_heck, h_breeding, _⟩ := P2
  exact ⟨h, h_heck, P1 h h_breeding⟩
</lean>

Alternatively, we can also do without `obtain` and use `match` in a term, but since we are using tactics the above is acceptable.

But note: the problem says to use the complete code. We'll write it accordingly.

After providing the code, we must answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain

In this case, we have successfully proved the theorem. So the answer is True.

But note: the theorem asks for "Some Heck cattle are artificially selected", and we proved that the Heck cattle `h` we get from P2 is artificially selected by P1. So it is true.

However, note that the code does not modify the axioms or theorem statement.

Therefore, the complete answer:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type

axiom HeckCattle : Animal → Prop
axiom Aurochs : Animal → Prop
axiom BreedingBack : Animal → Prop
axiom ArtificiallySelected : Animal → Prop
axiom Extinct : Animal → Prop
axiom Resemble : Animal → Animal → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ a : Animal, BreedingBack a → ArtificiallySelected a

axiom P2 : ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h ∧ (∃ au : Animal, Aurochs au ∧ Resemble h au)

axiom P5 : ∃ a : Animal, BreedingBack a ∧ (∃ e : Animal, Extinct e ∧ Resemble a e)

theorem goal : ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ ArtificiallySelected h := by
  obtain ⟨h, hHeck, hBreeding, _⟩ := P2
  exact ⟨h, hHeck, P1 h hBreeding⟩
</lean>

ANSWER: True

However, note that the problem says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain". We are not to interpret the truth of the statement in the real world, but in the context of the given axioms, the theorem is provable. So we answer "True" meaning that the theorem is true given the axioms.

But note: the original problem statement in Stage 1 might have been about validating the reasoning. However, here we are told to replace the sorry and then answer. The question does not specify what the answer is for, but the example didn't have such an answer. Only in the instruction it says to provide ANSWER.

Looking at the instructions: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

Given that we have proven it, we say True.

There is one point: the theorem uses `HeckCattle h` and `ArtificiallySelected h`, and we proved it from the axioms. However, note that the axiom P5 is not used at all. But that doesn't affect the proof: we don't need P5 to prove the conclusion. So the proof is valid without P5.

Therefore, we are confident.


=== RESPONSE ===
To prove `∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ ArtificiallySelected h`, we use the provided axioms:

1. **P1** states that any breeding back animal is artificially selected.
2. **P2** guarantees the existence of a Heck cattle that underwent breeding back.

Using **P2**, we obtain a witness animal `h` that is both Heck cattle (`HeckCattle h`) and bred back (`BreedingBack h`). Applying **P1** to `h` with its breeding back property, we get `ArtificiallySelected h`. Thus, `h` satisfies both `HeckCattle h` and `ArtificiallySelected h`.

Here's the complete valid Lean proof:

<lean>

axiom HeckCattle : Animal → Prop
axiom Aurochs : Animal → Prop
axiom BreedingBack : Animal → Prop
axiom ArtificiallySelected : Animal → Prop
axiom Extinct : Animal → Prop
axiom Resemble : Animal → Animal → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ a : Animal, BreedingBack a → ArtificiallySelected a

axiom P2 : ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ BreedingBack h ∧ (∃ au : Animal, Aurochs au ∧ Resemble h au)

axiom P5 : ∃ a : Animal, BreedingBack a ∧ (∃ e : Animal, Extinct e ∧ Resemble a e)

theorem goal : ∃ h : Animal, HeckCattle h ∧ ArtificiallySelected h := by
  obtain ⟨h, hHeck, hBreeding, _⟩ := P2
  exact ⟨h, hHeck, P1 h hBreeding⟩
</lean>

ANSWER: True
