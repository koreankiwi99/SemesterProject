STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given two premises and a conclusion.
 Premise 1: All squares are four-sided.
   This means: for every x, if x is a square then x is four-sided.
 Premise 2: All four-sided things are shapes.
   This means: for every x, if x is four-sided then x is a shape.

 Conclusion: All squares are shapes.
   This means: for every x, if x is a square then x is a shape.

 We need to define:
   - a type for the objects (let's call it `obj`)
   - predicates: `Square`, `FourSided`, `Shape` (each taking an `obj` and returning a `Prop`)

 Then we state the axioms:
   - `T1`: ∀ x, Square x → FourSided x
   - `T2`: ∀ x, FourSided x → Shape x

 And the theorem we want (the conclusion) is:
   `goal`: ∀ x, Square x → Shape x

 We'll use `sorry` as the proof in the theorem.

 IMPORTANT: We are not proving, just setting up the structure.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion provided, here's the Lean 4 formalization:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Square : obj → Prop
axiom FourSided : obj → Prop
axiom Shape : obj → Prop

axiom AllSquaresFourSided : ∀ x : obj, Square x → FourSided x
axiom AllFourSidedShapes : ∀ x : obj, FourSided x → Shape x

theorem AllSquaresShapes : ∀ x : obj, Square x → Shape x := sorry
</lean>

Explanation:
1. `obj` represents the type of all objects
2. Predicates defined:
   - `Square x` for "x is a square"
   - `FourSided x` for "x is four-sided"
   - `Shape x` for "x is a shape"
3. Axioms formalize the premises:
   - `AllSquaresFourSided`: ∀x, Square x → FourSided x (all squares are four-sided)
   - `AllFourSidedShapes`: ∀x, FourSided x → Shape x (all four-sided things are shapes)
4. Theorem `AllSquaresShapes` formalizes the conclusion: ∀x, Square x → Shape x (all squares are shapes), using `sorry` as the unproven placeholder

This directly translates the logical structure while maintaining the universal quantifiers and implications from the original statements.

STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given axioms:
  AllSquaresFourSided: ∀ x, Square x → FourSided x
  AllFourSidedShapes: ∀ x, FourSided x → Shape x

We want to prove:
  ∀ x, Square x → Shape x

Proof:
  Fix an arbitrary x. Assume we have (h1 : Square x).
  Then by AllSquaresFourSided x h1, we get FourSided x.
  Then by AllFourSidedShapes x (that proof), we get Shape x.

So the proof term is: fun x => fun hSq : Square x => AllFourSidedShapes x (AllSquaresFourSided x hSq)

Alternatively, we can use a more point-free style? But the direct way is clear.

Let's write the complete code accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
The task is to prove `AllSquaresShapes` using the given axioms. The proof involves chaining the two axioms: for any object `x`, if it is a square, then by `AllSquaresFourSided` it is four-sided, and then by `AllFourSidedShapes` it is a shape.

Here is the complete Lean code with the proof:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Square : obj → Prop
axiom FourSided : obj → Prop
axiom Shape : obj → Prop

axiom AllSquaresFourSided : ∀ x : obj, Square x → FourSided x
axiom AllFourSidedShapes : ∀ x : obj, FourSided x → Shape x

theorem AllSquaresShapes : ∀ x : obj, Square x → Shape x := 
  fun x => fun hSq => AllFourSidedShapes x (AllSquaresFourSided x hSq)
</lean>

ANSWER: True
