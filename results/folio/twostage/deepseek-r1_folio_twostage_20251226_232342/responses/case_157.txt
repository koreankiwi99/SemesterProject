STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the given premises and the conclusion about James.

 First, we need a type for the students. Let's define `Student` as a type.
 We'll have James as a constant of type `Student`.

 Now, let's define the predicates:
 1. "currently work in the library": We'll call `WorksInLibrary : Student → Prop`
 2. "from the computer science department": `IsFromCS : Student → Prop`
 3. "have a part-time job offered by the university": `HasUniJob : Student → Prop`
 4. "taking the database course": `TakesDatabase : Student → Prop`
 5. "taking a class with Professor David": `TakesClassWithDavid : Student → Prop`
 6. "working in the lab": `WorksInLab : Student → Prop`

 Premises:
 P1: None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department.
     This means: For any student, if they work in the library then they are NOT from CS.
     So: ∀ s, WorksInLibrary s → ¬ IsFromCS s

 P2: All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library.
     ∀ s, HasUniJob s → WorksInLibrary s

 P3: All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department.
     ∀ s, TakesDatabase s → IsFromCS s

 P4: All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course.
     ∀ s, TakesClassWithDavid s → TakesDatabase s

 P5: All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.
     ∀ s, WorksInLab s → TakesClassWithDavid s

 P6: James is a student working in the lab.
     WorksInLab James

 P7: James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.
     This is a bit tricky. The statement says: James doesn't work in the lab OR have a part-time job.
     But note: we already know from P6 that James works in the lab. So this premise seems contradictory?
     However, let's read carefully: "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job" meaning:
        ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)
     But wait, P6 says he works in the lab, so the disjunction (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James) is true because the first part is true.
     Then P7 says the negation of that, which would be false. This is a contradiction.

     Alternatively, the premise might be intended as: James does not work in the lab AND does not have a part-time job? 
     But the word "or" in English in negative sentences often means neither. However, the exact logical form is:
        "James doesn't (work in the lab or have a part-time job)"  -> ¬(A ∨ B)

     But note: P6 says he works in the lab. So we have:
        A is true (by P6) → A ∨ B is true → ¬(A ∨ B) is false.

     This suggests inconsistency. However, the problem states this as a premise. We must formalize as given.

     Alternatively, the premise might be misstated? But we are to formalize as given.

     So: axiom P7 : ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

 Conclusion: James does not have a part-time job offered by the university.
     We want to show: ¬ HasUniJob James

 However, note that from P6 we have WorksInLab James. Then by P5, he takes a class with David; then by P4, he takes database; then by P3, he is from CS.
 Then by P1, if he worked in the library, he would not be from CS. But we don't have that he works in the library? 
 But we have P2: if he had a university job then he would work in the library. 

 But the conclusion is about not having the job.

 However, note the contradiction: 
   P6: WorksInLab James → so by P5, P4, P3: IsFromCS James.
   Now, P7: ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James) 
        → since WorksInLab James is true (by P6), then (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James) is true, so P7 is false.

 This means the premises are inconsistent. But our task is only to formalize.

 We'll formalize exactly as stated.

 Steps:

  1. Define `Student` as a type.
  2. Introduce James: `axiom James : Student`
  3. Define the predicates as above.
  4. State the axioms P1 to P7.

 Then the conclusion we want to prove is: ¬ HasUniJob James.

 However, note that the conclusion is actually given as "James does not have a part-time job", so we formalize that as the goal.

 But note: the premises include P7 which already says that James does not have the job? Actually, P7 says he doesn't have the job OR doesn't work in the lab? But we know he works in the lab, so it forces that he doesn't have the job? 

 However, let's break down P7:
   ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James) 
   is equivalent to: ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James.

 But we have WorksInLab James from P6, so we get a contradiction. 

 But the problem asks to formalize the conclusion: James does not have a part-time job.

 Since P7 already implies ¬ HasUniJob James (because it implies both negations), we might not need to prove it? However, we are to state the theorem.

 We'll state the theorem as: ¬ HasUniJob James.

 However, note that the premises are inconsistent. But that's okay because we are not proving, just formalizing.

 So:

  axiom Student : Type
  axiom James : Student

  axiom WorksInLibrary : Student → Prop
  axiom IsFromCS : Student → Prop
  axiom HasUniJob : Student → Prop
  axiom TakesDatabase : Student → Prop
  axiom TakesClassWithDavid : Student → Prop
  axiom WorksInLab : Student → Prop

  axiom P1 : ∀ s : Student, WorksInLibrary s → ¬ IsFromCS s
  axiom P2 : ∀ s : Student, HasUniJob s → WorksInLibrary s
  axiom P3 : ∀ s : Student, TakesDatabase s → IsFromCS s
  axiom P4 : ∀ s : Student, TakesClassWithDavid s → TakesDatabase s
  axiom P5 : ∀ s : Student, WorksInLab s → TakesClassWithDavid s
  axiom P6 : WorksInLab James
  axiom P7 : ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

  theorem goal : ¬ HasUniJob James := sorry

 But wait, we can derive a contradiction from P6 and P7? 
   P7 says: ¬(WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)
   But P6 says WorksInLab James, so the disjunction is true, hence P7 is false.

 This means the premises are inconsistent. In an inconsistent system, anything is provable. 
 However, we are only formalizing, so we write the goal as stated.

 Alternatively, note that the conclusion is exactly one of the conjuncts from P7? 
   Since P7 is equivalent to ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James, then we can get the second conjunct.

 But in Lean, we can prove ¬ HasUniJob James from P7 by:
   have h : ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James := by ...   [from the equivalence of ¬(A∨B) and ¬A∧¬B]
   then exact h.2

 However, we are not proving, so we just write `sorry`.

 But note: the problem says "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job" is given as a premise. 
 And we are to conclude that James does not have the job. 

 Actually, the conclusion is exactly the second part of the conjunction we get from P7.

 However, we don't have an axiom that breaks down P7. So we must use P7 as is.

 We can state the goal as ¬ HasUniJob James and use `sorry`.

 Alternatively, we could break P7 into two parts? But the premise is given as a disjunction in the negative.

 Since the problem states the premise as a single disjunction, we leave it as is.

 But note: the theorem goal is a direct consequence of P7 and P6? 
   Because P7: ¬(A∨B) implies ¬B (even without ¬A, because if we assume B then A∨B is true, contradiction). 
   Specifically: 
        assume hB: HasUniJob James,
        then A∨B is true (because A is true by P6), 
        but P7 says ¬(A∨B), contradiction.

 So we can prove ¬ HasUniJob James from P6 and P7.

 However, we are not required to prove, so we just write `sorry`.

 Important: We are only formalizing.

 Let's write the code accordingly.

Explanation:
- We declare `Student` as a type representing all students
- Predicates correspond to properties:
  - `WorksInLibrary`: currently works in the library
  - `FromCS`: from computer science department
  - `HasUniJob`: has university part-time job
  - `TakesDatabase`: taking database course
  - `TakesClassWithDavid`: taking class with Prof. David
  - `WorksInLab`: works in the lab
- `James` is a specific student constant
- Premises P1-P7 directly translate the given statements
- The theorem `goal` formalizes the conclusion that James does not have a university part-time job
- `sorry` is used as a placeholder for the proof


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and we need to prove that James does not have a university job (¬ HasUniJob James).

Let me outline the steps:

1. We have axiom P6: WorksInLab James.
2. From P5: ∀ s, WorksInLab s → TakesClassWithDavid s. So applying to James, we get: WorksInLab James → TakesClassWithDavid James. Since we have P6, we get TakesClassWithDavid James.
3. From P4: ∀ s, TakesClassWithDavid s → TakesDatabase s. So we get TakesDatabase James.
4. From P3: ∀ s, TakesDatabase s → FromCS s. So we get FromCS James.
5. Now, we also have P1: ∀ s, WorksInLibrary s → ¬ FromCS s. This is equivalent to: if a student works in the library, then they are not from CS.
6. We have P2: ∀ s, HasUniJob s → WorksInLibrary s. So if James has a university job, then he works in the library.

But note: we have FromCS James (step 4). If we assume that James has a university job (HasUniJob James), then by P2 he would work in the library (WorksInLibrary James). Then by P1, we would get ¬ FromCS James. This contradicts FromCS James.

Therefore, we must have ¬ HasUniJob James.

However, we also have P7: ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James). This is equivalent to: ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James.

But wait: we have P6: WorksInLab James. So P7 says that it is not the case that (WorksInLab James OR HasUniJob James). Since WorksInLab James is true, the disjunction is true, so P7 is asserting a falsehood. This means that the set of axioms is inconsistent.

But note: the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", meaning we have to take the axioms as given. However, P6 and P7 together lead to a contradiction because:
- P6: WorksInLab James
- P7: ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)  => This is equivalent to: ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James.

So P7 asserts ¬ WorksInLab James, but we have P6: WorksInLab James. Therefore, the axioms are inconsistent.

In an inconsistent system, we can prove anything. In particular, we can prove ¬ HasUniJob James.

But note: the theorem is exactly ¬ HasUniJob James. So we can prove it by noting the inconsistency.

However, let me see: we can use P7 to directly get ¬ HasUniJob James? Because P7 says: ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James) which is equivalent to (¬ WorksInLab James) ∧ (¬ HasUniJob James). So we can extract the second part.

But wait: we also have P6 which says WorksInLab James. So we have a contradiction. In Lean, if we have a contradiction, we can use `False.elim` or something. However, we can also use the fact that from P7 we get ¬ HasUniJob James directly.

Specifically, P7 is equivalent to: ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James. So we can use `And.right` to get ¬ HasUniJob James.

But note: in Lean, we can write `P7` as a hypothesis that is a negation of a disjunction. We can break it down.

Actually, we can use:
  have h : ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James := by
    exact Iff.mp (not_or ..) P7

But note: Lean has a theorem `not_or` that says: ¬ (p ∨ q) ↔ ¬ p ∧ ¬ q. So we can use `not_or.mp P7` to get a proof of ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James.

Then we can take the right part: `And.right (not_or.mp P7)`

But wait: we also have P6: WorksInLab James. So we have a contradiction between P6 and the left part of the above. However, we don't need to use P6 at all? Because the right part already gives ¬ HasUniJob James.

So we can prove the theorem by: `(not_or.mp P7).right`

But note: the theorem is exactly the right part of the conjunction we get from P7.

Alternatively, we can write: `(Iff.mp not_or P7).right`

But let me check: we have `P7 : ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)`. We can use `not_or.mp P7` to get `¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James`. Then we take the second component.

So the proof term is: `(not_or.mp P7).right`

But note: we have to make sure that `not_or` is available. Actually, `not_or` is in the standard library. However, in this code we are only using axioms and no imports. But note: the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", and we are allowed to use the core Lean.

But wait: we are not importing anything. However, `not_or` is a standard theorem from `Mathlib`? Actually, no: `not_or` is in the core Lean? Let me recall: in Lean 4, we have `Classical.not_or` if we open `Classical`. But by default, we are in classical logic? Actually, the problem does not specify.

Alternatively, we can avoid using `not_or` by using the fact that if we have a proof of ¬ (p ∨ q) and we want ¬ q, we can do:

  fun hq => P7 (Or.inr hq)

But wait: the theorem goal is ¬ HasUniJob James, which is a negation. So we can write:

  fun h : HasUniJob James => P7 (Or.inr h)

But wait: P7 is ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James). If we have h : HasUniJob James, then we can form Or.inr h : WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James. Then P7 applied to that gives false. However, that is not the entire proof because we are constructing a function that takes h and produces false? Actually, that is exactly the definition of ¬ HasUniJob James.

So we can write:

  fun h : HasUniJob James => P7 (Or.inr h)

But note: we also have P6: WorksInLab James. So we could also use Or.inl P6 to get the disjunction. However, we don't need to because we are only using the disjunction with the right component.

But wait: the above proof term only uses P7? It does not use P6. However, P7 says that neither is true. So if we assume HasUniJob James, then we get a contradiction with P7 because we can form the disjunction with the right.

So the proof is:

  theorem goal : ¬ HasUniJob James := fun h => P7 (Or.inr h)

But note: we have P6 which says WorksInLab James, so we could also form Or.inl P6. However, we don't need it for this proof.

Alternatively, we could use:

  by
    intro h
    apply P7
    exact Or.inr h

But the problem says we can use tactics with `by`. However, the example used a term. We can do either.

But note: the example used a term. So let me stick to a term.

However, we must note: P7 is exactly the negation of the disjunction. So if we assume HasUniJob James, then we have WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James by Or.inr h, and then P7 gives a contradiction.

So the proof term is: `fun h => P7 (Or.inr h)`

But wait: what about the left part? We have P6 which is WorksInLab James, so we could also have done `P7 (Or.inl P6)`. That would also give false. But that would prove False, and then we could eliminate to get anything, including ¬ HasUniJob James. But that is more steps.

So the direct way is to use the assumption h and form the disjunction with the right.

Therefore, we can write:

  theorem goal : ¬ HasUniJob James := fun h => P7 (Or.inr h)

But note: we have not used P1-P5 at all. Why? Because P7 alone (with the definition of negation and disjunction) is enough to prove ¬ HasUniJob James.

However, the problem states P6: WorksInLab James. Why do we have P6? Because if we didn't have P6, then P7 would still give ¬ HasUniJob James. But we have P6 and P7 together which are inconsistent. But that doesn't matter: we can still prove the theorem.

But wait: the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions". It might be that the axioms are inconsistent, but we are only asked to replace the sorry.

So we can provide:

  theorem goal : ¬ HasUniJob James := fun h => P7 (Or.inr h)

Alternatively, we could use:

  theorem goal : ¬ HasUniJob James := (not_or.mp P7).right

But if we don't want to rely on `not_or` (which might require importing something, but actually `not_or` is in `Lean`'s core as `Classical.not_or`? Or maybe we can use it without import? Actually, in the current Lean 4, `not_or` is available in the root namespace? Let me check: I think it is available as `not_or` if we are in classical logic. But by default, Lean 4 is classical.

However, to be safe, the first proof does not require any extra lemmas.

So I'll go with: `fun h => P7 (Or.inr h)`

But note: we have to write it in the code.

Complete code:

</lean>

But wait: what about the other premises? We didn't use P1-P5 and P6. Is that acceptable? Yes, because the proof only requires P7. The other axioms are not needed for this particular proof.

However, note that P7 already directly implies ¬ HasUniJob James. So we are done.

But let me double-check: P7 says that neither WorksInLab James nor HasUniJob James is true. So if we assume HasUniJob James, then we have one of the disjuncts, so P7 would be contradicted. Therefore, the function we wrote is a valid proof.

So the answer is True? But the question after the code is to provide ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain.

But note: the theorem is proven, so True.

However, we must note that the axioms are inconsistent because P6 says WorksInLab James and P7 says ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ ...) which implies ¬ WorksInLab James. So we have a contradiction. But that doesn't change the fact that we can prove the theorem.

Therefore, we output the code and then ANSWER: True.

But wait: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain". The answer here is about the truth of the conclusion? But in the context of the axioms, the conclusion is provable. So True.

Alternatively, if the question is about the logical status: the conclusion is true in the context of the axioms? Yes, because we proved it.

So I'll say True.


=== RESPONSE ===
The proof relies solely on axiom `P7`, which states that it is not the case that James works in the lab or has a university job. To prove `¬ HasUniJob James`, we assume `HasUniJob James` and derive a contradiction with `P7` by showing that `HasUniJob James` implies `WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James` via the disjunction introduction rule `Or.inr`.
