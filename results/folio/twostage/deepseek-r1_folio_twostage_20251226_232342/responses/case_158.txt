STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion about students.
 We need to define objects and properties.

 Steps:
 1. We have students, so we'll have a type for students.
 2. We have properties:
    - Currently working in the library (call it `WorksInLibrary`)
    - From computer science department (`IsFromCS`)
    - Has a part-time job offered by the university (`HasUniJob`)
    - Taking the database course (`TakesDatabase`)
    - Taking a class with Professor David (`TakesClassWithDavid`)
    - Working in the lab (`WorksInLab`)
 3. We have a specific student: James (`James`)

 Premises:
  P1: None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department.
      ∀ s, WorksInLibrary s → ¬ IsFromCS s

  P2: All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library.
      ∀ s, HasUniJob s → WorksInLibrary s

  P3: All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department.
      ∀ s, TakesDatabase s → IsFromCS s

  P4: All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course.
      ∀ s, TakesClassWithDavid s → TakesDatabase s

  P5: All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.
      ∀ s, WorksInLab s → TakesClassWithDavid s

  P6: James is a student working in the lab.
      WorksInLab James

  P7: James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.
      ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

 However, note that P6 says James works in the lab, but P7 says James doesn't work in the lab OR have a part-time job.
 This seems contradictory? But let's read carefully: P7 says "James doesn't work in the lab OR have a part-time job" meaning that he does not work in the lab AND does not have the job? Actually, no: the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of negations. So P7 actually says: ¬WorksInLab James ∧ ¬HasUniJob James.

 But wait: P6 says WorksInLab James. So we have a contradiction? However, note that the problem says "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job" — this is ambiguous. In natural language, it might be interpreted as: James does not (work in the lab) and James does not (have a part-time job). But the word "or" in the negation might be confusing.

 Actually, the premise is: "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university." 
 This is a negation of a disjunction? Or is it two separate negations? In logic, we interpret this as: 
   ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

 But note: if we break down the English, it might be intended as: 
   James does not work in the lab, and James does not have a part-time job.

 So we can write:
   ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James

 However, the problem says "James doesn't work in the lab OR have a part-time job", which is exactly the negation of the disjunction. But note that in English, sometimes "or" in the negative can be interpreted as "and" (De Morgan). So we'll formalize as:

   ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

 But then note: P6 says James works in the lab, so the disjunction (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James) is true because of the first part. Therefore, P7 would be false? This is a contradiction.

 Alternatively, the problem might have a typo? Or perhaps we misread.

 Let me read again: "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university."

 If we interpret it as: James does not work in the lab, and James does not have a part-time job, then we write:

   ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James

 But then P6 says WorksInLab James, so ¬ WorksInLab James is false, making the whole conjunction false. Again contradiction.

 However, note that the problem states: "James is a student working in the lab." and then says "James doesn't work in the lab or ...". This is contradictory.

 But wait: the problem says "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job" — meaning that he does not do at least one of them? Actually, no: the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of negations. So if we interpret the sentence as the negation of the disjunction, then it means he does neither.

 Given that, we have:
   P6: WorksInLab James
   P7: ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)   → which implies ¬ WorksInLab James and ¬ HasUniJob James.

 So we have WorksInLab James and ¬ WorksInLab James → contradiction.

 Therefore, the problem might have intended to say something else? Or perhaps we are misreading.

 Let me check the exact words: "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university."

 But note: the premise P6 says James works in the lab. So if we take P7 as written, we get a contradiction.

 However, the conclusion is about James taking the database course or having a part-time job.

 How can we resolve this?

 Alternative interpretation: the word "or" in P7 might be a typo? Or perhaps it's meant to be "and"? But the problem says "or".

 Another possibility: the premise P7 is actually saying that James does not have a part-time job? And the part about the lab is not negated? But the sentence structure: "doesn't work in the lab or ..." suggests that the negation applies to both.

 Given the confusion, let me look at the conclusion: "James either takes the database course or has a part-time job offered by the university."

 And note that we have P5: All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David -> then P4: taking a class with David implies taking database -> then P3: taking database implies from CS.

 But P1: if someone works in the library, they are not from CS. And P2: if someone has a university job, they work in the library.

 Now, James is working in the lab (P6). So by P5, he takes a class with David -> by P4, he takes database -> by P3, he is from CS.

 Now, if James had a university job, then by P2 he would work in the library, and by P1 he would not be from CS. But we just deduced he is from CS. So he cannot have a university job? 

 Therefore, the premise P7 might be intended to say that James does not have a part-time job? And the part about the lab is not negated? But the sentence says "doesn't work in the lab or ...", which includes the lab.

 Alternatively, note that P6 says James works in the lab, so if P7 says he doesn't work in the lab, that's a contradiction. Therefore, we must interpret P7 as:

   James does not have a part-time job offered by the university.

 and ignore the "doesn't work in the lab" part? But that's not what the sentence says.

 How about: the premise P7 is "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job" meaning that it is not true that James works in the lab OR has a part-time job? Then we have:

   ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

 But P6 says WorksInLab James, so the disjunction is true, hence P7 is false. Contradiction.

 Therefore, I suspect there might be a typo in the problem. Perhaps P7 was meant to say:

   James doesn't have a part-time job offered by the university.

 without mentioning the lab? Or perhaps:

   James doesn't work in the library or have a part-time job? 

 But note: the problem says "lab", not library.

 Given the confusion, let me compare with the conclusion: the conclusion is that James either takes the database course or has a part-time job.

 We know James takes the database course (from the chain: lab -> class with David -> database). So the conclusion is true regardless of the part-time job? But then why mention the part-time job?

 Also, note that if James had a part-time job, then he would work in the library (P2) and then not be from CS (P1). But we also deduced he is from CS (from the chain). So he cannot have a part-time job.

 Therefore, the conclusion "James either takes the database course or has a part-time job" is true because he takes the database course? So the "or" is satisfied by the first part.

 Now, what about P7? If we drop the lab part and interpret P7 as only about the job, then we have:

   ¬ HasUniJob James

 and we can ignore the lab part because we already know he works in the lab.

 But the problem explicitly says: "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job". So we cannot ignore the lab part.

 Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant:

   James doesn't work in the library (not lab) or have a part-time job.

 But the problem says "lab".

 Given the ambiguity, I will formalize the problem as stated, including the contradiction.

 We'll define:
   obj : Type   (but we have students, so maybe we call the type `Student`? But the example used `obj`)

 However, the example used `obj` and then a constant for the cat. We have one specific student: James.

 So let's do:

   axiom Student : Type
   axiom James : Student

   axiom WorksInLibrary : Student → Prop
   axiom IsFromCS : Student → Prop
   axiom HasUniJob : Student → Prop
   axiom TakesDatabase : Student → Prop
   axiom TakesClassWithDavid : Student → Prop
   axiom WorksInLab : Student → Prop

 Premises:

   P1: ∀ s, WorksInLibrary s → ¬ IsFromCS s
   P2: ∀ s, HasUniJob s → WorksInLibrary s
   P3: ∀ s, TakesDatabase s → IsFromCS s
   P4: ∀ s, TakesClassWithDavid s → TakesDatabase s
   P5: ∀ s, WorksInLab s → TakesClassWithDavid s
   P6: WorksInLab James
   P7: ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

 But note: P6 and P7 together lead to a contradiction. However, we are only formalizing, not proving.

 The conclusion to formalize: 
   TakesDatabase James ∨ HasUniJob James

 So we'll write the theorem:

   theorem goal : TakesDatabase James ∨ HasUniJob James := sorry

 But note: with the contradiction, we can prove anything. However, the problem asks only to formalize.

 Alternatively, if we interpret P7 as two separate statements:

   ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James

 Then we have:

   P7a: ¬ WorksInLab James
   P7b: ¬ HasUniJob James

 But then P6 and P7a are contradictory.

 Since the problem says "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job", and in logic we interpret the negation of a disjunction as the conjunction of the negations, we'll stick to:

   P7: ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

 But note: in Lean, we can write it as:

   axiom P7 : ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

 However, we can also write it using `∧` by De Morgan:

   ¬ (A ∨ B) is equivalent to ¬A ∧ ¬B

 So we could break it into two axioms? But the problem states one premise.

 We'll do:

   axiom P7 : ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

 But note: we are going to get a contradiction immediately from P6 and P7.

 However, the problem is given as is, so we formalize accordingly.

 Let's write the code accordingly.

 IMPORTANT: We are not proving, so we just write the axioms and the theorem.

 Steps:

   We'll have:
     axiom Student : Type
     axiom James : Student
     ... properties ...

   Then the premises.

   Then the theorem: goal : TakesDatabase James ∨ HasUniJob James

 But note: we have a chain that shows TakesDatabase James:

     P6: WorksInLab James
     P5: ∀ s, WorksInLab s → TakesClassWithDavid s   => TakesClassWithDavid James
     P4: ∀ s, TakesClassWithDavid s → TakesDatabase s => TakesDatabase James

 So we know TakesDatabase James, so the disjunction is true.

 However, the presence of P7 leads to a contradiction, but that doesn't affect the formalization.

 So we proceed.

 Code:

<lean>
axiom Student : Type

axiom James : Student

axiom WorksInLibrary : Student → Prop
axiom IsFromCS : Student → Prop
axiom HasUniJob : Student → Prop
axiom TakesDatabase : Student → Prop
axiom TakesClassWithDavid : Student → Prop
axiom WorksInLab : Student → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ s : Student, WorksInLibrary s → ¬ IsFromCS s
axiom P2 : ∀ s : Student, HasUniJob s → WorksInLibrary s
axiom P3 : ∀ s : Student, TakesDatabase s → IsFromCS s
axiom P4 : ∀ s : Student, TakesClassWithDavid s → TakesDatabase s
axiom P5 : ∀ s : Student, WorksInLab s → TakesClassWithDavid s
axiom P6 : WorksInLab James
axiom P7 : ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

theorem goal : TakesDatabase James ∨ HasUniJob James := sorry
</lean>

But note: the conclusion is an OR, and we have TakesDatabase James (from the chain) so the left side is true. However, the problem includes P7 which leads to a contradiction. But again, we are formalizing the problem as stated.

Alternatively, if we break P7 using De Morgan, we can write:

   axiom P7 : ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James

But then we have:

   P7_left : ¬ WorksInLab James
   P7_right : ¬ HasUniJob James

But then P6 and P7_left are contradictory. However, the problem says "James doesn't work in the lab or ...", so the conjunction is the correct interpretation of the negation of the disjunction.

But note: the problem says "James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job" — meaning that it is not the case that he works in the lab OR he has the job. So we can write it either way.

In Lean, we can write it as a disjunction being false, or as the conjunction of negations. They are equivalent.

I'll write it as a disjunction for clarity.

But note: if we write it as a disjunction, then we can derive the two parts by De Morgan in Lean. So it's fine.

We'll stick with the disjunction version.

However, the problem might have intended to say that James does not have a part-time job? And the lab part was a mistake? But we must follow the text.

So the formalization above is as per the problem.

Let me write it.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion provided, here is the Lean 4 formalization:

<lean>
axiom Student : Type

axiom James : Student

axiom WorksInLibrary : Student → Prop
axiom IsFromCS : Student → Prop
axiom HasUniJob : Student → Prop
axiom TakesDatabase : Student → Prop
axiom TakesClassWithDavid : Student → Prop
axiom WorksInLab : Student → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ s : Student, WorksInLibrary s → ¬ IsFromCS s
axiom P2 : ∀ s : Student, HasUniJob s → WorksInLibrary s
axiom P3 : ∀ s : Student, TakesDatabase s → IsFromCS s
axiom P4 : ∀ s : Student, TakesClassWithDavid s → TakesDatabase s
axiom P5 : ∀ s : Student, WorksInLab s → TakesClassWithDavid s
axiom P6 : WorksInLab James
axiom P7 : ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

theorem goal : TakesDatabase James ∨ HasUniJob James := sorry
</lean>

Explanation:
- `Student` is the type of all students
- `James` is a specific student
- Properties are defined as predicates on students:
  - `WorksInLibrary`: currently works in the library
  - `IsFromCS`: from computer science department
  - `HasUniJob`: has university-offered part-time job
  - `TakesDatabase`: enrolled in database course
  - `TakesClassWithDavid`: taking a class with Prof. David
  - `WorksInLab`: works in the lab
- Premises P1-P7 directly correspond to the given statements
- The conclusion `goal` formalizes "James either takes database course or has university job" as a disjunction
- `sorry` is used as a placeholder for the proof


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and a theorem to prove. The theorem is:
  TakesDatabase James ∨ HasUniJob James

We have axiom P7: ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)
This is equivalent to: ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James

But we also have P6: WorksInLab James, which contradicts the first part of P7.

Therefore, we have a contradiction. Since we have a contradiction, we can prove anything, including the disjunction.

However, let's break it down:

From P6: WorksInLab James
From P7: ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James) 
  which is equivalent to: ¬ WorksInLab James ∧ ¬ HasUniJob James

So we have both WorksInLab James and ¬ WorksInLab James. This is a contradiction.

In Lean, we can use this contradiction to prove the goal by explosion.

But note: the goal is an OR. We don't have either of the two disjuncts directly, but we have a contradiction.

We can use `False.elim` on the contradiction to prove the goal.

How do we get the contradiction?

Let me denote:
  H7: ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

We know P6: WorksInLab James.

So we can form: 
  H_left: WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James   (by Or.inl P6)

But H7 says that this is false. So we have a direct contradiction: H7 H_left.

Therefore, we can prove the goal by:

  False.elim (P7 (Or.inl P6))

But wait, let's check:

  P7 is applied to (Or.inl P6) which is of type (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James), and P7 says that this is false, so we get False.

Then we eliminate that false to prove anything, including the goal.

However, note that the goal is exactly the same as the disjunction that P7 denies? Actually, no: the goal is (TakesDatabase James ∨ HasUniJob James), while P7 denies (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James). They are different.

But wait: we have a contradiction from P6 and P7. So we can still prove anything.

But let me see: we have P6 and P7. From P7, we can derive:
  ¬ WorksInLab James   (by the and part of the negation of OR)

Specifically, we can prove:

  have h : ¬ WorksInLab James := fun h => P7 (Or.inl h)

But wait, actually:

  P7: ¬ (A ∨ B) is equivalent to ¬A ∧ ¬B.

We can define:

  lemma not_or : ¬ (A ∨ B) ↔ ¬A ∧ ¬B := ...

But we don't have that lemma. We can prove it in Lean, but we are not allowed to add new lemmas? We are only to replace the sorry.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that P7 applied to an OR introduction of P6 leads to false.

But note: the goal is not the same as the OR that P7 denies. So we cannot directly use the OR that P7 denies to prove the goal? Actually, we don't need to: we have a contradiction, and from false we can prove anything.

So the proof term can be:

  False.elim (P7 (Or.inl P6))

But wait, let me write it step by step:

  We have P6: WorksInLab James.
  Then we form: Or.inl P6 : WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James.
  Then we apply P7 to that term: P7 (Or.inl P6) : False.

  Then we use False.elim to prove the goal: False.elim (P7 (Or.inl P6)) : TakesDatabase James ∨ HasUniJob James.

So the proof term is: False.elim (P7 (Or.inl P6))

But note: the goal is an OR. We don't actually need to use the rest of the axioms? Because we already have a contradiction.

So we can ignore P1 to P5? Yes, because we have a contradiction from P6 and P7.

Therefore, the entire proof is:

theorem goal : TakesDatabase James ∨ HasUniJob James := False.elim (P7 (Or.inl P6))

But wait, let me check the types:

  P7 : ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)
  Or.inl P6 : WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James

So indeed, P7 (Or.inl P6) is of type False.

Now, we write the complete code.

IMPORTANT: We must not change the axioms or the theorem statement.

So the complete code is:

<lean>
axiom Student : Type

axiom James : Student

axiom WorksInLibrary : Student → Prop
axiom IsFromCS : Student → Prop
axiom HasUniJob : Student → Prop
axiom TakesDatabase : Student → Prop
axiom TakesClassWithDavid : Student → Prop
axiom WorksInLab : Student → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ s : Student, WorksInLibrary s → ¬ IsFromCS s
axiom P2 : ∀ s : Student, HasUniJob s → WorksInLibrary s
axiom P3 : ∀ s : Student, TakesDatabase s → IsFromCS s
axiom P4 : ∀ s : Student, TakesClassWithDavid s → TakesDatabase s
axiom P5 : ∀ s : Student, WorksInLab s → TakesClassWithDavid s
axiom P6 : WorksInLab James
axiom P7 : ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

theorem goal : TakesDatabase James ∨ HasUniJob James := False.elim (P7 (Or.inl P6))
</lean>

But note: we are using `Or.inl` which is from the standard library. Since we are not importing anything, we might need to use the fully qualified name? Actually, in Lean 4, the `Or` type is in the core, and `Or.inl` is available without import.

Alternatively, we can write `False.elim (P7 (.inl P6))` but that is the same.

However, let me check: the expression `Or.inl P6` is of type `WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James`, which is exactly the type that P7 expects.

Therefore, the proof is valid.

But wait: is there a mistake? Because P7 says that the disjunction is false, but we are constructing it and then getting a contradiction. Then we use that contradiction to prove the goal. Since the goal is an arbitrary proposition, this is valid.

So the answer is that the theorem is provable (True).

But note: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

We are proving the theorem, so it is True.

However, let me see if there is an alternative proof that uses the other axioms? Actually, we don't need them because we already have a contradiction. So we are done.

Therefore, we output the code and then ANSWER: True.

But note: the problem says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", and we are using the axioms P6 and P7 to get a contradiction. So it's correct.

One might argue: but the goal is about TakesDatabase or HasUniJob, and we are proving it by contradiction without using the other axioms. That is perfectly valid.

So the complete answer is:

<lean>
axiom Student : Type

axiom James : Student

axiom WorksInLibrary : Student → Prop
axiom IsFromCS : Student → Prop
axiom HasUniJob : Student → Prop
axiom TakesDatabase : Student → Prop
axiom TakesClassWithDavid : Student → Prop
axiom WorksInLab : Student → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ s : Student, WorksInLibrary s → ¬ IsFromCS s
axiom P2 : ∀ s : Student, HasUniJob s → WorksInLibrary s
axiom P3 : ∀ s : Student, TakesDatabase s → IsFromCS s
axiom P4 : ∀ s : Student, TakesClassWithDavid s → TakesDatabase s
axiom P5 : ∀ s : Student, WorksInLab s → TakesClassWithDavid s
axiom P6 : WorksInLab James
axiom P7 : ¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)

theorem goal : TakesDatabase James ∨ HasUniJob James := False.elim (P7 (Or.inl P6))
</lean>

ANSWER: True


=== RESPONSE ===
The axioms P6 and P7 lead to a contradiction:
- P6 states `WorksInLab James`
- P7 states `¬ (WorksInLab James ∨ HasUniJob James)`, which implies `¬ WorksInLab James`
This contradiction allows proving any goal, including `TakesDatabase James ∨ HasUniJob James`.

Here is the complete Lean code with the proof:
