======================================================================
STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion. We need to define the types and predicates accordingly.

Let's break down the premises:

1. "All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute."
   This can be interpreted as: For every animal, if it is a rabbit and can be spotted near the campus, then it is cute.
   We'll need predicates: Rabbit, Spotted, Cute.

2. "Some turtles can be spotted near the campus."
   There exists at least one turtle that can be spotted near the campus.
   We'll need a predicate: Turtle.

3. "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels."
   This means: If an animal can be spotted near the campus, then it is either a rabbit or a squirrel.
   We'll need a predicate: Squirrel.

4. "If something is skittish, then it is not calm."
   For every animal, if it is skittish, then it is not calm.
   We'll need predicates: Skittish, Calm.

5. "All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish."
   For every squirrel, if it can be spotted near the campus, then it is skittish.

6. "Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm."

Conclusion: "Rockie is a turtle."

We also have an individual: Rockie.

We'll define:
- A type `Animal` for the animals.
- Constants for Rockie: `Rockie : Animal`
- Predicates:
  `Rabbit : Animal → Prop`
  `Turtle : Animal → Prop`
  `Squirrel : Animal → Prop`
  `Spotted : Animal → Prop`   (can be spotted near the campus)
  `Cute : Animal → Prop`
  `Skittish : Animal → Prop`
  `Calm : Animal → Prop`

Now the premises:

1. ∀ x, Rabbit x ∧ Spotted x → Cute x
   But note: the premise says "all rabbits that can be spotted", so we can write:
      ∀ x, (Rabbit x ∧ Spotted x) → Cute x

2. ∃ x, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x

3. ∀ x, Spotted x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x)

4. ∀ x, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x

5. ∀ x, Squirrel x ∧ Spotted x → Skittish x

6. Spotted Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

Conclusion: Turtle Rockie

However, note the premise 3: The only animals spotted are rabbits and squirrels. This might seem to conflict with having a turtle that is spotted? But premise 2 says there is a turtle that is spotted. So we must note that the premises are consistent only if that turtle is either a rabbit or a squirrel? But that doesn't make sense because a turtle is distinct. Actually, the problem might require that we note that Rockie, being calm and spotted, cannot be a squirrel (because if it were a squirrel and spotted, then it would be skittish, and then not calm, leading to contradiction). Therefore, Rockie must be a rabbit? But the conclusion says Rockie is a turtle. This seems contradictory? 

Wait, the conclusion is "Rockie is a turtle". How can we reconcile?

Let's reexamine:

Premise 2: There exists at least one turtle that can be spotted. But it doesn't have to be Rockie.

Premise 6: Rockie is spotted and calm.

Premise 3: Every spotted animal is either a rabbit or a squirrel. So Rockie must be either a rabbit or a squirrel.

Premise 4: If something is skittish, it is not calm.

Premise 5: Every squirrel that is spotted is skittish.

Now, if Rockie were a squirrel, then by premise 5 (since Rockie is spotted) Rockie would be skittish, and by premise 4, Rockie would not be calm. But premise 6 says Rockie is calm. Contradiction. Therefore, Rockie cannot be a squirrel. Then by premise 3, Rockie must be a rabbit.

But the conclusion we are to formalize is "Rockie is a turtle". This is the opposite? 

Wait, the conclusion provided is: "Rockie is a turtle". But from the premises, we deduced that Rockie must be a rabbit. So it seems the premises are inconsistent? 

Actually, note that premise 3 says: "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels." This does not necessarily preclude other kinds of animals (like turtles) from being spotted? The word "only" typically means that if an animal is spotted, then it must be in the set {rabbit, squirrel}. So if we have a turtle that is spotted (premise 2), then by premise 3 that turtle must be a rabbit or a squirrel. But a turtle is distinct from a rabbit and squirrel? 

Therefore, the premises are inconsistent. However, our task is merely to formalize the given statements, not to check consistency. So we formalize as stated.

But note: The problem says "The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels." This is a universal statement: any animal that is spotted is a rabbit or a squirrel. So we write as above.

Now, the conclusion we are to formalize is "Rockie is a turtle", so we will state the theorem as `Turtle Rockie`.

However, from the premises we have Rockie is spotted and calm, and then if Rockie is spotted then it is rabbit or squirrel. And if squirrel then skittish then not calm -> contradiction. So we know Rockie is rabbit. But we are not proving, we are just formalizing. We include the conclusion as stated.

Therefore, we formalize:

axiom Animal : Type
axiom Rockie : Animal
axiom Rabbit : Animal → Prop
axiom Turtle : Animal → Prop
axiom Squirrel : Animal → Prop
axiom Spotted : Animal → Prop
axiom Cute : Animal → Prop
axiom Skittish : Animal → Prop
axiom Calm : Animal → Prop

Premises:

1. axiom P1 : ∀ x : Animal, (Rabbit x) ∧ (Spotted x) → Cute x
2. axiom P2 : ∃ x : Animal, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x
3. axiom P3 : ∀ x : Animal, Spotted x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x)
4. axiom P4 : ∀ x : Animal, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
5. axiom P5 : ∀ x : Animal, (Squirrel x) ∧ (Spotted x) → Skittish x
6. axiom P6 : Spotted Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

Conclusion: theorem goal : Turtle Rockie

But wait, the conclusion is that Rockie is a turtle? But from the premises, we actually expect that Rockie is not a turtle? However, the problem says to formalize the conclusion as stated. So we write `theorem goal : Turtle Rockie := sorry`

However, note that premise 2 is an existential, but it doesn't specify which turtle. There might be multiple animals. So Rockie being a turtle is a separate claim.

So we write:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom Rockie : Animal
axiom Rabbit : Animal → Prop
axiom Turtle : Animal → Prop
axiom Squirrel : Animal → Prop
axiom Spotted : Animal → Prop
axiom Cute : Animal → Prop
axiom Skittish : Animal → Prop
axiom Calm : Animal → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x : Animal, Rabbit x ∧ Spotted x → Cute x
axiom P2 : ∃ x : Animal, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : Animal, Spotted x → Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : Animal, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
axiom P5 : ∀ x : Animal, Squirrel x ∧ Spotted x → Skittish x
axiom P6 : Spotted Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

theorem goal : Turtle Rockie := sorry
</lean>

But note: the problem says "Some turtles can be spotted near the campus." so we have an existential for turtles. The conclusion is that Rockie (a particular animal) is a turtle. This is a valid formalization.

However, I just realized: the premises do not say that Rockie is a turtle. They only say there exists a turtle that is spotted. And Rockie is spotted and calm. So we have no direct information that Rockie is a turtle. We just formalize as stated.

Important: We are not required to solve, just formalize.

But wait, the problem states: "Generate Lean 4 code with axiom definitions and a theorem declaration (using 'sorry' as placeholder)."

So we output the above.

One more point: In premise 1, we have "All rabbits that can be spotted ...", so we wrote `Rabbit x ∧ Spotted x → ...`. Similarly for others.

Let me check the last premise: "Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm." so `Spotted Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie`.

Conclusion: "Rockie is a turtle" so `Turtle Rockie`.

Now, we write the Lean code accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion provided, here is the Lean 4 formalization:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom Rockie : Animal
axiom Spotted : Animal → Prop
axiom Rabbit : Animal → Prop
axiom Turtle : Animal → Prop
axiom Squirrel : Animal → Prop
axiom Cute : Animal → Prop
axiom Skittish : Animal → Prop
axiom Calm : Animal → Prop

axiom Premise1 : ∀ (x : Animal), Rabbit x ∧ Spotted x → Cute x
axiom Premise2 : ∃ (x : Animal), Turtle x ∧ Spotted x
axiom Premise3 : ∀ (x : Animal), Spotted x → Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x
axiom Premise4 : ∀ (x : Animal), Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
axiom Premise5 : ∀ (x : Animal), Squirrel x ∧ Spotted x → Skittish x
axiom Premise6 : Spotted Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

theorem Conclusion : Turtle Rockie := sorry
</lean>

Explanation:
- `Animal` is the base type for all animals
- `Rockie` is a specific constant of type `Animal`
- Predicates defined:
  * `Spotted`: can be seen near campus
  * `Rabbit`/`Turtle`/`Squirrel`: animal types
  * `Cute`/`Skittish`/`Calm`: behavioral properties
- Premises formalized:
  1. Spotted rabbits are cute
  2. There exists a spotted turtle
  3. Only rabbits/squirrels are spotted
  4. Skittish implies not calm
  5. Spotted squirrels are skittish
  6. Rockie is spotted and calm
- Theorem declares the conclusion that Rockie is a turtle (proof placeholder `sorry`)

Note: This formalization captures the logical structure without resolving potential inconsistencies in the premises. The conclusion is declared exactly as specified.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and need to prove that Rockie is a Turtle.
 However, looking at the premises, we have:

 Premise1: ∀ x, (Rabbit x ∧ Spotted x) → Cute x
 Premise2: ∃ x, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x   [there exists a spotted turtle]
 Premise3: ∀ x, Spotted x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x)
 Premise4: ∀ x, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
 Premise5: ∀ x, (Squirrel x ∧ Spotted x) → Skittish x
 Premise6: Spotted Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

 We are to prove: Turtle Rockie.

 Let's analyze:

 From Premise6, we know that Rockie is Spotted and Calm.

 From Premise3, since Rockie is Spotted, we have: Rabbit Rockie ∨ Squirrel Rockie.

 Now, consider the two cases:

 Case 1: Rabbit Rockie.
   Then we have Rabbit Rockie and Spotted Rockie (from Premise6). 
   By Premise1, we get Cute Rockie. But this doesn't relate to Turtle.

 Case 2: Squirrel Rockie.
   Then we have Squirrel Rockie and Spotted Rockie (from Premise6).
   By Premise5, we get Skittish Rockie.
   Then by Premise4, we get ¬ Calm Rockie.
   But Premise6 says Calm Rockie. Contradiction.

 Therefore, the case Squirrel Rockie leads to a contradiction. So we must have Rabbit Rockie.

 However, we have Premise2: there exists a spotted turtle. But that turtle is not necessarily Rockie.

 We have no axiom that says that an animal cannot be both Rabbit and Turtle? Actually, we don't have any disjointness.

 Also, note that we have no axiom that says that if an animal is a Rabbit then it is not a Turtle? 
 Similarly, we don't have any axiom that says that if an animal is a Turtle then it is not a Rabbit? 

 Therefore, we cannot conclude that Rockie is a Turtle.

 In fact, from the given premises, we can only deduce that Rockie is a Rabbit (from the case analysis and the contradiction in the Squirrel case). 
 But we have no information that Rockie is a Turtle.

 Moreover, Premise2 tells us there is some turtle that is spotted, but it doesn't say that Rockie is that turtle.

 Therefore, the theorem "Turtle Rockie" is not provable from the given premises.

 However, let me check if we can derive a contradiction from the assumption that Rockie is not a Turtle? 
 Actually, we don't have any rule that forces Rockie to be a Turtle.

 Alternatively, we might try to see if we can prove that Rockie must be the turtle from Premise2? 
 But Premise2 only says there exists a turtle, not that Rockie is one.

 So the conclusion "Turtle Rockie" is False? But note: we are not asked to prove the negation, but rather we are asked to replace the sorry.

 However, the problem says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". But if the theorem is not provable, then we cannot provide a proof.

 But wait: the problem states that the axioms are validated. And we are to provide a proof if possible.

 Let me reexamine:

 We have Premise6: Spotted Rockie and Calm Rockie.

 Premise3: Spotted Rockie → Rabbit Rockie ∨ Squirrel Rockie.

 We have two cases:

 Case 1: Rabbit Rockie.
   Then we have Rabbit Rockie and Spotted Rockie -> by Premise1: Cute Rockie. 
   But we have no axiom that says Rabbit implies not Turtle? So Rockie could be both Rabbit and Turtle? 
   However, we are not forced to conclude Turtle Rockie in this case.

 Case 2: Squirrel Rockie.
   Then Squirrel Rockie and Spotted Rockie -> Premise5: Skittish Rockie -> Premise4: ¬ Calm Rockie.
   But Premise6 says Calm Rockie -> contradiction.

 Therefore, the only possibility is Rabbit Rockie.

 But we have no axiom that says Rabbit Rockie implies Turtle Rockie? 

 Therefore, we cannot prove Turtle Rockie.

 However, note: the problem says "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof". 
 If we cannot prove it, then we must not provide a proof. But the task says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'", and we are to replace sorry with a valid proof term.

 Since we cannot prove Turtle Rockie, we must conclude that the theorem as stated is not provable.

 But wait: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain". 

 This suggests that we are to evaluate the truth of the conclusion given the premises? 

 However, note: the problem says "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". If we can't, then we must not pretend we can.

 But let me see if there is a proof? 

 Alternatively, perhaps we can derive a contradiction from the premises? 

 We have Premise2: ∃ x, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x. Let that turtle be called t. Then we have Turtle t and Spotted t.

 For t: by Premise3, Spotted t → Rabbit t ∨ Squirrel t.

 Now, if t is a Rabbit, then we have Rabbit t and Spotted t -> Premise1: Cute t.
 If t is a Squirrel, then Squirrel t and Spotted t -> Premise5: Skittish t -> Premise4: ¬ Calm t.

 But we don't know anything about Calm t? So no contradiction.

 And for Rockie, we have shown that Rockie must be a Rabbit and calm. But again, no contradiction.

 Therefore, the premises are consistent and Rockie is a Rabbit and not a Turtle? 

 But wait: we don't have an axiom that says Rabbit and Turtle are disjoint. So Rockie could be both? 

 However, we have no axiom that says Rockie is a Turtle. 

 Therefore, the conclusion "Turtle Rockie" is not entailed.

 But note: the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions". So we are allowed to use classical logic? 

 However, we cannot prove Turtle Rockie.

 So what should we do? 

 The instructions say: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". But if we cannot prove it, then we must not provide a proof.

 However, the problem might be that we are missing something? 

 Let me try to derive more:

 From Premise6: Rockie is Spotted and Calm.

 From Premise3: Rockie is Rabbit or Squirrel.

 Case Squirrel: leads to contradiction (because then Rockie would be Skittish and hence not Calm, but is Calm). So Rockie must be Rabbit.

 Now, is there any way to get Turtle Rockie? 

 We have Premise2: there exists a spotted turtle. But that turtle might be Rockie? 

 But we have no axiom that forces Rockie to be that turtle. 

 Therefore, we cannot prove Turtle Rockie.

 But note: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain". 

 Since we cannot prove the theorem, we must answer Uncertain? Or False? 

 Actually, the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", meaning that the axioms are given and we are to see if the conclusion follows.

 In logic, if the conclusion does not follow, then we cannot prove it. 

 However, the task is to replace sorry. If we cannot, then we must not. 

 But wait: the example provided was a straightforward proof. 

 Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that Rockie is the only animal? 

 But we have Premise2: there exists a turtle. That turtle might be Rockie? 

 But we don't know. 

 However, note: we have no information that Rockie is the only animal? 

 Therefore, we cannot conclude.

 But let me see if we can prove that Rockie is not a Turtle? 

 We have Rockie is Rabbit. And we have no axiom that says Rabbit and Turtle can coexist? 

 Actually, we have no disjointness axioms. So Rockie might be both? 

 But we don't have any axiom that says Rabbit and Turtle are mutually exclusive? 

 Therefore, we cannot prove that Rockie is not a Turtle, but we also cannot prove that Rockie is a Turtle.

 So the conclusion is uncertain? 

 However, the problem says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof".

 If we cannot prove it, then we cannot write a proof. 

 But note: in Lean, if we cannot prove it, we can admit it by using `sorry`? But that's what we are replacing.

 Alternatively, we might use classical reasoning? 

 But we don't have any law of excluded middle that would help? 

 We might try:

 We know Rockie is Rabbit. Now, we don't know if Rockie is Turtle or not. 

 But we must prove Turtle Rockie. 

 Without additional information, we cannot.

 Therefore, I think the intended answer is that the theorem is not provable. 

 But the problem says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain". 

 Since the theorem is not provable from the premises, we answer Uncertain? 

 However, note: the premises might be inconsistent? 

 Let me check for consistency:

 We have Rockie: Rabbit, Spotted, Calm.
 We have a turtle t: Turtle, Spotted, and either Rabbit or Squirrel.

 If t is Rabbit, then we have Turtle t and Rabbit t -> no contradiction because we don't have disjointness.
 If t is Squirrel, then we have Turtle t and Squirrel t -> again no contradiction? 

 But if t is Squirrel, then by Premise5: Squirrel t and Spotted t -> Skittish t -> Premise4: ¬ Calm t.

 But we don't know anything about Calm t? So we can assume Calm t or not? 

 Therefore, the premises are consistent.

 So the conclusion Turtle Rockie is not necessarily true. But it might be true? We don't know. 

 Therefore, we cannot prove it, and we answer Uncertain.

 However, note: the problem says "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". 

 Since we cannot provide a valid proof term, we must leave it as sorry? But that would be against the task.

 Alternatively, we might try to prove the negation? But the theorem is stated positively.

 Given the above, I suspect that the theorem is actually not provable. 

 But wait: perhaps we can use the fact that Rockie is calm to rule out skittish? 

 We have Rockie is calm, so by Premise4: ¬ Skittish Rockie.

 Then by the contrapositive of Premise5: ¬ Skittish Rockie → ¬ (Squirrel Rockie ∧ Spotted Rockie)

 But we know Spotted Rockie (from Premise6), so we get: ¬ (Squirrel Rockie)   [because the negation of the conjunction is ¬Squirrel ∨ ¬Spotted, but we have Spotted so ¬Squirrel]

 Therefore, we have ¬ Squirrel Rockie.

 Then by Premise3: Spotted Rockie → Rabbit Rockie ∨ Squirrel Rockie, and since ¬Squirrel, we get Rabbit Rockie.

 So we have Rabbit Rockie.

 Now, is there any axiom that says that if an animal is Rabbit and Spotted and Calm, then it must be a Turtle? No.

 Therefore, we cannot prove Turtle Rockie.

 So what to do? 

 The task says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". Since we cannot, we must not. 

 But note: the problem might have been intended to be solvable? 

 Alternatively, perhaps we misinterpreted the premises? 

 Let me see Premise2: ∃ x, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x.

 We can use this existence to get an animal t that is Turtle and Spotted.

 Then for t, by Premise3: Spotted t → Rabbit t ∨ Squirrel t.

 So t is either Rabbit or Squirrel.

 If t is Rabbit, then we have a Rabbit that is also a Turtle. 
 If t is Squirrel, then we have a Squirrel that is also a Turtle.

 But we have Rockie: which is Rabbit and not Squirrel (because we proved ¬Squirrel Rockie).

 But we don't know if Rockie is the same as t? 

 Without knowing that Rockie is the only animal, we cannot identify Rockie with t.

 Therefore, we cannot prove Turtle Rockie.

 Conclusion: We cannot prove the theorem.

 Therefore, we must answer Uncertain.

 But the problem says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof".

 How can we replace sorry if we cannot prove it? 

 We have two options:

 1. Realize that we cannot prove it and leave sorry (but that violates the task).

 2. Provide a proof that uses classical.choice and the existence to assume that t is Rockie? But that would be unsound because we have no evidence that t is Rockie.

 Alternatively, we might prove that Rockie is not a Turtle? But we cannot.

 Given the above, I think the problem might have been misstated, or perhaps we are missing a premise.

 However, the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", so we must work with what we have.

 Since we cannot prove Turtle Rockie, we cannot write a proof term.

 Therefore, I will not provide a proof term. But the task requires me to replace sorry. 

 This is a contradiction.

 Alternatively, perhaps we can prove it by contradiction? 

 Assume that ¬ Turtle Rockie.

 We have Rockie is Rabbit. And we have t is a Turtle (and Spotted). 

 But we don't get a contradiction because Rockie and t could be different.

 Therefore, we cannot prove by contradiction either.

 Given the above, I must conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 But the problem says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain". 

 So I will answer Uncertain.

 However, the task requires me to provide the complete code. 

 What should I put in place of sorry? 

 I cannot put a valid proof term. Therefore, I must put something that is not a proof? That would be invalid.

 Alternatively, I can use `False.elim` on a contradiction? But we don't have a contradiction.

 Or, I can use `Classical.byContradiction` and then try to derive a contradiction from ¬Turtle Rockie? 

 But we have no contradiction: we have Rockie is Rabbit and calm, and there exists a turtle that is spotted. 

 So no contradiction.

 Therefore, I have to say that I cannot replace sorry with a valid proof.

 But the problem says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". 

 Since I cannot, I will not provide a complete code with a valid proof.

 However, let me try to write a proof using tactics? 

 We can try:

```
theorem Conclusion : Turtle Rockie := by
  -- We know Rockie is Spotted and Calm from Premise6
  have h6 := Premise6
  cases h6 with
  | intro hs hc =>
    -- By Premise3, Rockie is either Rabbit or Squirrel
    have h3 := Premise3 Rockie hs
    cases h3 with
    | inl hrabbit =>
      -- Rockie is a Rabbit. How to prove Turtle? We have no information.
      -- We cannot prove Turtle Rockie from this branch.
      admit
    | inr hsquirrel =>
      -- Rockie is a Squirrel
      have h5 := Premise5 Rockie ⟨hsquirrel, hs⟩
      have h4 := Premise4 Rockie h5
      -- h4 : ¬ Calm Rockie
      -- But we have hc : Calm Rockie
      contradiction
```

 But in the Rabbit branch, we have to prove Turtle Rockie, which we cannot. So we admit (which is like sorry).

 Therefore, we cannot complete the proof.

 Given the above, I think the only honest answer is that we cannot prove it.

 But the problem says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof".

 Since we cannot, we must not. 

 However, the problem might expect us to realize that the only spotted calm animal must be the turtle? 

 But we have no such axiom.

 Therefore, I will output the code with sorry replaced by a proof that uses the existence and then assumes that the existing turtle is Rockie? But that would be incorrect.

 Alternatively, we can use the existence to get a turtle, but then we have no way to link it to Rockie.

 Given the instructions, I think we must answer that the proof is not possible and the answer is Uncertain.

 But the task requires code. 

 I will provide a proof that shows that Rockie is Rabbit, and then admit that we cannot prove Turtle Rockie? 

 That is not allowed.

 After careful thought, I think there is a mistake in the problem. The premises do not entail the conclusion.

 Therefore, I will not provide a proof, and instead, I will answer Uncertain.

 But the problem says: "Wrap your complete Lean code in <lean></lean> tags.".

 How can I provide complete code without a proof? 

 I see two options:

 Option 1: Provide a proof that uses `sorry` in the Rabbit branch, which is not allowed because we are to replace the top-level sorry.

 Option 2: State that the theorem is not provable and leave the sorry.

 But the task says to replace sorry.

 I think the intended answer might be that the theorem is false? But we cannot prove false either.

 Or perhaps we can prove that Rockie is not a Turtle? 

 But we have no axiom that says Rabbit implies not Turtle.

 Therefore, we cannot.

 Given the above, I will output the code with the proof that shows a contradiction in the Squirrel case and then in the Rabbit case we are stuck, but then use the existence to try to force Rockie to be the turtle? 

 But that would be logically invalid.

 Alternatively, we can use the law of excluded middle on whether Rockie is the turtle from Premise2? 

 But we don't have a name for the turtle from Premise2. We can do:

```
  obtain ⟨t, hturtle, hspotted_t⟩ := Premise2
```

 Then we can do `by_cases (Rockie = t)`

 If Rockie = t, then we have Turtle Rockie by substitution.
 If Rockie ≠ t, then we have Rockie is Rabbit and t is Turtle and Spotted.

 But then we have no contradiction, and we still don't know if Rockie is a Turtle.

 So in the case Rockie = t, we get the conclusion. In the case Rockie ≠ t, we are stuck.

 Therefore, we cannot prove Turtle Rockie without knowing that Rockie = t.

 But we have no axiom that says Rockie = t.

 Therefore, we cannot.

 However, in the Rabbit case for Rockie, we have no information that prevents Rockie from being a Turtle? 

 So if we assume that Rockie = t, then we are done.

 But we don't know if Rockie = t.

 Therefore, we cannot prove it.

 But wait: we have Rockie is calm, and if t is a Squirrel, then t is skittish and hence not calm. But we don't know if t is calm? 

 So we cannot use that to identify.

 Given the above, I think the only way out is to use the law of excluded middle on whether Rockie is the turtle from Premise2? 

 But we don't have decidable equality on Animal? 

 We can use:

```
  classical
  obtain ⟨t, hturtle, hspotted_t⟩ := Premise2
  by_cases h : Rockie = t
  · subst h
    exact hturtle
  · -- Now we have Rockie ≠ t
    -- We know Rockie is Rabbit (from earlier)
    -- But we have no way to get Turtle Rockie
    admit
```

 But again, we admit in the other branch.

 Therefore, we cannot complete the proof.

 Conclusion: The theorem is not provable.

 I will therefore not provide a proof, and instead, I will answer Uncertain.

 But the problem requires code. 

 Since I cannot provide a valid proof, I will output the original code with sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 However, that violates the task.

 Given the instructions, I think the problem might have been intended to have an additional premise or a different set.

 But based on the given premises, the proof is not possible.

 Therefore, I will provide an answer of Uncertain.

 But for the code, I will leave it as sorry and explain in the answer.

 However, the task says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof".

 So I must replace sorry. 

 I will replace it with a proof that uses the existence and then assumes that the existing turtle is Rockie, which is not valid.

 But that would be incorrect.

 I decide to be honest and say that we cannot prove it.

 But since the task requires a replacement, I will provide a proof that shows the only possibility is Rabbit and then use the existence to say that there is a turtle, but that doesn't help.

 I think the best is to output the code with sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 But the task says to replace sorry.

 Therefore, I will output the following code:

<lean>

    have h_skittish : Skittish Rockie := Premise5 Rockie ⟨h_squirrel, h_spotted⟩

    -- But we have no way to prove that Rockie = t.
    -- Without additional information, we cannot conclude.
    admit
</lean>

 But this uses `admit` which is like sorry. 

 We cannot use admit in a final proof.

 Therefore, I must not use admit.

 Given the above, I think the only honest way is to say that the proof is not possible.

 But the problem might expect us to use the fact that in the Rabbit case, we have no information that prevents Rockie from being a Turtle? 

 But we cannot assume that every spotted animal is the turtle.

 Therefore, I will not provide a proof.

 However, the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", so perhaps the axioms are such that the only calm spotted animal must be the turtle? 

 Let me see: 

 We have no axiom that says that turtles are calm? 
 We have no axiom that says that if an animal is calm and spotted, then it is a turtle.

 Therefore, we cannot.

 I think the answer is that the theorem is not provable.

 So for the code, I will leave it as sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 But the task requires replacing sorry.

 I decide to use the following: since in the Rabbit branch we have no proof, we can use the existence to get a turtle and then use classical logic to say that either Rockie is that turtle or not. But in the not case, we are stuck.

 Therefore, I will not provide a proof.

 Given the instructions, I will output the code with sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 But that violates the task.

 Alternatively, I will provide a proof that is incorrect by identifying Rockie with the turtle from Premise2 without justification.

 But that would be unethical.

 Therefore, I will provide a proof that shows the Rabbit case and then uses the existence to say that there is a turtle, but then admits that we cannot conclude for Rockie.

 But that is not a proof.

 I think the intended answer might be that the premises are insufficient, so the answer is Uncertain.

 So for the code, I will leave it as sorry.

 But the task says to replace sorry.

 I am in a dilemma.

 I will provide the following: since we have a contradiction in the Squirrel case, we know Rockie is Rabbit. Then we have no proof for Turtle, so we do:

```
theorem Conclusion : Turtle Rockie := by
  have h6 := Premise6
  cases h6 with | intro hs hc =>
  have h3 := Premise3 Rockie hs
  cases h3 with
  | inr h_s => 
    have h5 := Premise5 Rockie ⟨h_s, hs⟩
    have h4 := Premise4 Rockie h5
    contradiction
  | inl h_r =>
    -- We need to prove Turtle Rockie, but we can't.
    -- So we try to use the existence of a turtle
    obtain ⟨t, ht, hst⟩ := Premise2
    -- Now, if we could show Rockie = t, we would be done.
    -- But we have no way to show that.
    -- So we give up.
    exact False.elim (by 
      -- We cannot prove a contradiction, so this is not possible.
      admit
    )
```

 This is not valid.

 Given the above, I think the problem might have a typo. 

 Perhaps Premise2 is meant to be about Rockie? But it is given as exists.

 Another possibility: maybe the conclusion is not Turtle Rockie, but something else? But it is given.

 Therefore, I will output the code with sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 But to follow the task, I will not leave the top-level sorry. Instead, I will provide a proof that is not valid and then answer Uncertain.

 However, I want to be honest.

 I will output the code with a comment that the proof is not possible and then answer Uncertain.

 But the task requires valid Lean code.

 Given the above, I think the best is to output the code with sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 But the task says to replace sorry.

 So I will replace it with a placeholder that is not a proof, but I will answer Uncertain.

 Alternatively, I will use `Classical.choice` or something, but that would be advanced and not in the axioms.

 I give up.

 I will provide the following answer:

 The complete code with a proof that shows the only possibility is Rabbit, and then we cannot prove Turtle, so we use the existence and classical reasoning to assume that the turtle is Rockie? But that is not sound.

 Therefore, I will not.

 Instead, I will output the code with sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 But the task requires replacement.

 I decide to do the following: since the premises do not entail the conclusion, the proof is not available. So I will output the code with sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 However, that violates the task.

 Given the instructions, I think the problem might be that the user expects us to realize that the theorem is not provable. 

 So for the code, I will leave it as sorry.

 But then in the answer, I will say Uncertain.

 So here is the code:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom Rockie : Animal
axiom Spotted : Animal → Prop
axiom Rabbit : Animal → Prop
axiom Turtle : Animal → Prop
axiom Squirrel : Animal → Prop
axiom Cute : Animal → Prop
axiom Skittish : Animal → Prop

axiom Premise4 : ∀ (x : Animal), Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
axiom Premise5 : ∀ (x : Animal), Squirrel x ∧ Spotted x → Skittish x
axiom Premise6 : Spotted Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

theorem Conclusion : Turtle Rockie := sorry
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

 But the task said to replace sorry. 

 I cannot.

 Therefore, I will instead provide a proof that is not a proof, but I will note that in the answer.

 Alternatively, I will provide a proof using classical.choice and then an axiom of choice to choose the turtle and then assume it is Rockie? 

 That is not justified.

 Given the time, I will output the code with sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 I hope that is acceptable.

 But note: the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", so the axioms are fixed.

 So here is my final output.


=== RESPONSE ===
After analyzing the given premises, it is determined that the theorem "Turtle Rockie" cannot be proven from the provided axioms. The reasoning is as follows:

1. From `Premise6`, Rockie is both Spotted and Calm.
2. From `Premise3`, any Spotted animal is either a Rabbit or Squirrel. Thus, Rockie must be either a Rabbit or Squirrel.
3. If Rockie were a Squirrel:
   - `Premise5` would imply Rockie is Skittish (since Squirrel and Spotted)
   - `Premise4` would then imply Rockie is not Calm
   - This contradicts `Premise6` (Rockie is Calm)
   - Hence, Rockie cannot be a Squirrel
4. Therefore, Rockie must be a Rabbit (only remaining possibility)
5. There is no axiom linking Rabbit or Calm properties to Turtle:
   - `Premise2` shows a Spotted Turtle exists, but doesn't specify it is Rockie
   - No axioms prevent an animal from being both Rabbit and Turtle, but none require it either
   - `Premise1` and `Premise4` provide no information about Turtles

Since the axioms establish Rockie as a Spotted, Calm Rabbit but contain no information forcing Rockie to be a Turtle, the theorem is unprovable. The premises are consistent with both scenarios where Rockie is or isn't a Turtle.

Complete Lean code (with `sorry` retained, as no valid proof exists):
