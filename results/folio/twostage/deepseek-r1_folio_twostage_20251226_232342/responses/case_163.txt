STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion. We need to formalize the logical structure.

First, let's identify the types and predicates:

- We have "shows". So we can have a type `Show` for shows.
- There is a specific show "Breaking Bad".
- There are time slots: Monday at 8 pm. We can think of time slots as a type, but note that the premise says "Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday ...". We can model this by having a predicate for airing at a specific time? Alternatively, we can have a type `TimeSlot` and then a relation `AiringAt` between shows and time slots.

However, note that the conclusion is about Breaking Bad being on Monday at 8 pm. So we need to express that.

Alternatively, we can have:

- A type `Show`
- A specific constant `breakingBad : Show`
- We have a predicate for a show airing at a particular time? But note the premise says "Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday". We can interpret this as: there exists a show that airs on Monday at 8 pm and that show gives out roses on TV.

But note: the premise does not say that every show airing at that time gives roses, only that there is at least one.

So let's break down the premises:

Premise 1: "Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV."
  This is: ∃ (s : Show), AiringAt s monday8pm ∧ GivesRoses s

But note: we don't have a specific time slot, so we can define a specific time slot for Monday 8 pm? Or we can have a predicate for airing on Monday at 8 pm? Since the conclusion is about Breaking Bad airing at that same time, we can define a specific time slot? Actually, we can define:

  axiom Monday8pm : TimeSlot   -- or we can avoid introducing TimeSlot and just have a predicate `AiringOnMonday8pm : Show → Prop`

But let me see: the conclusion is "Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm", which would be `AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad`.

Alternatively, we can have:

  axiom TimeSlot : Type
  axiom monday8pm : TimeSlot
  axiom AiringAt : Show → TimeSlot → Prop

Then premise 1: ∃ s, AiringAt s monday8pm ∧ GivesRoses s

Premise 2: "If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor."
  ∀ s, GivesRoses s → IsBachelorEpisode s

But note: The Bachelor is a show? Or is it a series? We can have:
  axiom TheBachelor : Show   -- but wait, The Bachelor is a series and an episode is a specific show? We might need to distinguish between series and episodes? However, the problem says "the show is an episode of The Bachelor". So we can have:

  We can have a predicate `IsBachelorEpisode : Show → Prop`

Premise 3: "The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people."
  This is about The Bachelor. But note: The Bachelor is a series? How do we relate the series to its episodes? The premise says "The Bachelor portrays ...", meaning the show The Bachelor. But then we have episodes? Actually, each episode of The Bachelor is a show? And the premise says that The Bachelor (the series) portrays the lives of real people. But then premise 4 says "All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows." So we need to assign the property to the show (which is an episode) or to the series?

But note: premise 3 says "The Bachelor portrays ...". So we can have:

  axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop

But then we have TheBachelor as a specific show? However, The Bachelor is a series and each episode is a show? The problem says "the show" (meaning an episode) is an episode of The Bachelor. So we can assume that TheBachelor is a specific show? Actually, we can have:

  axiom TheBachelor : Show   -- representing the series? But then an episode is a different show? This might be messy.

Alternatively, we can think that each episode is a show, and The Bachelor is a property of an episode? That is, we have a predicate `IsBachelorEpisode` and then we can say that every episode that is an episode of The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people? But premise 3 says "The Bachelor portrays ...", which we interpret as: every episode of The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people? Or that the series as a whole does? Since the conclusion is about Breaking Bad, which is a show (and not an episode of The Bachelor), we can avoid the series and just think of shows.

But note: premise 3 says "The Bachelor portrays ...". We can take TheBachelor as a constant and then have:

  axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
  axiom T3 : PortraysRealPeople TheBachelor   -- but wait, TheBachelor is a show? Then premise 4 says "All shows portraying ...", so if TheBachelor portrays, then it is a reality TV show? But then Breaking Bad is a show and is not a reality TV show.

But then note: premise 2 says that if a show gives roses, then it is an episode of The Bachelor. But we don't have a constant for The Bachelor? We have a predicate `IsBachelorEpisode`? Then how do we relate `IsBachelorEpisode` to `PortraysRealPeople`? We don't have a direct link.

Alternatively, we can interpret premise 3 as: every episode of The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people? That is:

  ∀ s, IsBachelorEpisode s → PortraysRealPeople s

But the premise says "The Bachelor portrays ...", which might be interpreted as the entire series, but logically we can take it as every episode.

I think that is more consistent.

So:

Premise 3: ∀ s, IsBachelorEpisode s → PortraysRealPeople s

Premise 4: ∀ s, PortraysRealPeople s → RealityTV s

Premise 5: BreakingBad is a show: we have a constant `breakingBad : Show`

Premise 6: BreakingBad is not a reality TV show: ¬ RealityTV breakingBad

Conclusion: Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm: AiringAt breakingBad monday8pm

But wait: the conclusion is that Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm. However, from the premises we have that there exists some show at Monday 8 pm that gives roses and hence is a Bachelor episode and hence portrays real people and hence is reality TV. And Breaking Bad is not reality TV, so Breaking Bad cannot be that show? But that doesn't necessarily mean Breaking Bad is not airing at that time? Actually, the conclusion is that Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm? That doesn't follow.

Wait, let me reread the problem:

Premises:
1. Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.
2. If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
3. The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people. [interpreted as: every episode of The Bachelor portrays real lives]
4. All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.
5. Breaking Bad is a show.
6. Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

Conclusion: Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm.

This conclusion does not logically follow? Actually, the premises tell us that there is a reality TV show (because it gives roses, hence Bachelor, hence portrays real lives, hence reality TV) airing at Monday 8 pm. And Breaking Bad is not reality TV. But that does not imply that Breaking Bad airs at Monday 8 pm? It could be that Breaking Bad airs at that time or not? The conclusion is asserting that it does air at that time? That seems unsupported.

But wait: maybe the intended logic is that Breaking Bad must be airing at that time because it is not reality TV? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the conclusion is that Breaking Bad is NOT on Monday at 8 pm? But the problem says "Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm".

I think there might be a mistake in the problem? Or in my interpretation.

But note: the problem says "Conclusion to formalize: Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm."

So regardless of whether it is valid, we formalize the given.

So we have:

- There exists a show at Monday 8 pm that is reality TV (because it gives roses -> Bachelor -> portrays real -> reality TV).
- Breaking Bad is not reality TV.

But that doesn't say anything about when Breaking Bad airs.

However, perhaps the intended argument is that Breaking Bad cannot be the show that airs at Monday 8 pm? But that would lead to ¬ (breakingBad = that show) but not necessarily that Breaking Bad airs at Monday 8 pm? It could be that Breaking Bad airs at Monday 8 pm and is not that show? Or it could be that Breaking Bad doesn't air at that time.

But the conclusion is asserting that Breaking Bad airs at that time? That doesn't follow.

But note: the problem says "Conclusion to formalize", so we just formalize what is given.

So we'll define:

- Type `Show`
- Constant `breakingBad : Show`
- Predicate `AiringAt : Show → TimeSlot → Prop` and a specific time slot `monday8pm : TimeSlot`
- Predicate `GivesRoses : Show → Prop`
- Predicate `IsBachelorEpisode : Show → Prop`
- Predicate `PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop`
- Predicate `RealityTV : Show → Prop`

Premises:

1. ∃ s : Show, AiringAt s monday8pm ∧ GivesRoses s
2. ∀ s, GivesRoses s → IsBachelorEpisode s
3. ∀ s, IsBachelorEpisode s → PortraysRealPeople s
4. ∀ s, PortraysRealPeople s → RealityTV s
5. (Breaking Bad is a show) is already captured by the constant `breakingBad`
6. ¬ RealityTV breakingBad

Conclusion: AiringAt breakingBad monday8pm

But wait, the conclusion is that Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm? That is `AiringAt breakingBad monday8pm`.

However, note that the premises do not entail this. But we are only formalizing, not proving.

So we write:

<lean>
axiom Show : Type
axiom TimeSlot : Type
axiom monday8pm : TimeSlot
axiom breakingBad : Show
axiom AiringAt : Show → TimeSlot → Prop
axiom GivesRoses : Show → Prop
axiom IsBachelorEpisode : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
axiom RealityTV : Show → Prop

axiom P1 : ∃ s : Show, AiringAt s monday8pm ∧ GivesRoses s
axiom P2 : ∀ s : Show, GivesRoses s → IsBachelorEpisode s
axiom P3 : ∀ s : Show, IsBachelorEpisode s → PortraysRealPeople s
axiom P4 : ∀ s : Show, PortraysRealPeople s → RealityTV s
axiom P6 : ¬ RealityTV breakingBad

theorem goal : AiringAt breakingBad monday8pm := sorry
</lean>

But wait, the premise 5 is just that Breaking Bad is a show, which we have by the constant. So we don't need an axiom for that.

However, note: the conclusion is `AiringAt breakingBad monday8pm`, which is a proposition.

But the premises do not support this conclusion? Actually, the argument might be that Breaking Bad must be airing at that time because it is not reality TV? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted premise 1? It says "Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV." This does not say that every show at that time does so. So Breaking Bad could be airing at that time without giving roses? And without being reality TV? So the conclusion is not forced.

But again, we are just formalizing.

Alternatively, maybe the intended conclusion is that Breaking Bad is NOT airing at that time? But the problem states: "Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm."

So we'll stick to the above.

But note: the problem says "Breaking Bad is a show" and "Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show", so we have:

  axiom breakingBad : Show
  axiom P6 : ¬ RealityTV breakingBad

And the conclusion: `AiringAt breakingBad monday8pm`

So we write the code accordingly.

However, we might avoid introducing `TimeSlot` and just have a predicate for the specific time? Since the only time mentioned is Monday at 8 pm.

We can do:

  axiom AiringOnMonday8pm : Show → Prop

Then premise 1: ∃ s, AiringOnMonday8pm s ∧ GivesRoses s

Conclusion: AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad

This simplifies the formalization.

So let's do that:

<lean>
axiom Show : Type
axiom breakingBad : Show
axiom AiringOnMonday8pm : Show → Prop
axiom GivesRoses : Show → Prop
axiom IsBachelorEpisode : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
axiom RealityTV : Show → Prop

axiom P1 : ∃ s : Show, AiringOnMonday8pm s ∧ GivesRoses s
axiom P2 : ∀ s : Show, GivesRoses s → IsBachelorEpisode s
axiom P3 : ∀ s : Show, IsBachelorEpisode s → PortraysRealPeople s
axiom P4 : ∀ s : Show, PortraysRealPeople s → RealityTV s
axiom P6 : ¬ RealityTV breakingBad

theorem goal : AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad := sorry
</lean>

This is simpler.

So we'll go with this.


=== RESPONSE ===
The premises describe shows, a specific time slot (Monday at 8 pm), and properties like giving roses, being an episode of The Bachelor, portraying real lives, and being reality TV. Breaking Bad is introduced as a show that is not reality TV. The conclusion claims Breaking Bad airs at Monday 8 pm.

Formalization:
- `Show` as the type of shows
- `breakingBad` as a specific show
- Predicates for properties:
  - `AiringOnMonday8pm`: show airs at Monday 8 pm
  - `GivesRoses`: show gives out roses on TV
  - `IsBachelorEpisode`: show is an episode of The Bachelor
  - `PortraysRealPeople`: show portrays lives of real people
  - `RealityTV`: show is a reality TV show
- Premises as axioms:
  - P1: Some show airing Monday at 8 pm gives roses
  - P2: Shows giving roses are Bachelor episodes
  - P3: Bachelor episodes portray real people
  - P4: Shows portraying real people are reality TV
  - P6: Breaking Bad is not reality TV
- Theorem: Breaking Bad airs Monday at 8 pm (using `sorry`)

</lean>


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given:
  P1: There exists a show s that is airing on Monday 8pm and gives roses.
  P2: Any show that gives roses is a Bachelor episode.
  P3: Any Bachelor episode portrays real people.
  P4: Any show that portrays real people is a reality TV show.
  P6: breakingBad is not a reality TV show.

We want to prove: AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad

However, note that we have P6 that says breakingBad is not a reality TV show.

Let us try to see if we can get a contradiction if we assume that breakingBad is airing on Monday 8pm.

But note: the theorem to prove is that breakingBad is airing on Monday 8pm. However, from the axioms, we have:

  Suppose s0 is the show that P1 gives us: AiringOnMonday8pm s0 and GivesRoses s0.
  Then by P2: IsBachelorEpisode s0.
  Then by P3: PortraysRealPeople s0.
  Then by P4: RealityTV s0.

Now, if breakingBad were also airing on Monday 8pm, then we might try to apply the same chain to breakingBad? But note:

  There is no axiom that says that a show that airs on Monday 8pm must be the same as any other show.

Moreover, we have P6: ¬ RealityTV breakingBad.

But from the chain, we have that s0 is a reality TV show. However, breakingBad might be a different show.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that breakingBad is airing on Monday 8pm.

In fact, let us see what we can conclude:

  We have that there exists a reality TV show (s0) that airs on Monday 8pm and is a Bachelor episode.

But breakingBad is not a reality TV show. There is no direct link from the existence of one show that airs on Monday 8pm to another show.

Therefore, the theorem goal as stated (that breakingBad is airing on Monday 8pm) is likely false because we know that breakingBad is not reality TV, and if it were airing on Monday 8pm then by the chain (via the roses, etc.) it would have to be reality TV (if we assume that breakingBad has the property AiringOnMonday8pm and then we add that if it airs on Monday 8pm then it gives roses? But we don't have that). 

Wait, note that P1 says that there exists a show that airs on Monday 8pm and gives roses. But it does not say that every show that airs on Monday 8pm gives roses. Similarly, we don't have any axiom that says that the properties are exclusive to one show.

So if breakingBad were airing on Monday 8pm, then we would have:
  AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad
But we cannot chain to a contradiction because we don't know that breakingBad also gives roses.

In fact, without the information that breakingBad gives roses, we cannot apply P2 to breakingBad.

Therefore, we cannot prove that breakingBad is airing on Monday 8pm. Moreover, we have no positive evidence that breakingBad is airing on Monday 8pm, and we do have that breakingBad is not reality TV.

But note: the chain of reasoning from P1 does not lead to breakingBad. So the theorem goal is actually false? Or unprovable?

Given the axioms, we can prove that there exists a reality TV show that airs on Monday 8pm. But we cannot prove that breakingBad is that show. In fact, we can prove that breakingBad is not that show? Not necessarily: there could be multiple shows. However, note that we have:

  P1: ∃ s, AiringOnMonday8pm s ∧ GivesRoses s

But we are told nothing about breakingBad regarding AiringOnMonday8pm.

So we don't have evidence that breakingBad is airing on Monday 8pm. And we have no axiom that forces that if one show has a property then another must.

Therefore, the theorem goal is false? Actually, the theorem goal is the statement that breakingBad has the property AiringOnMonday8pm. We have no evidence in the axioms that breakingBad has that property. Moreover, we have:

  The show that exists by P1 has the property, and we don't know if breakingBad is that show.

But note that P6 tells us breakingBad is not reality TV. The chain for the show from P1 leads to it being reality TV. Therefore, if breakingBad were that show, then we would have RealityTV breakingBad, which contradicts P6. Therefore, breakingBad cannot be the show that exists by P1. Therefore, breakingBad is not the show that is airing on Monday 8pm and gives roses.

But does that mean that breakingBad might not be airing on Monday 8pm? It doesn't force breakingBad to not be airing on Monday 8pm, because there might be multiple shows that air on Monday 8pm. The existence of one does not preclude others.

So we cannot prove that breakingBad is airing on Monday 8pm, and we also cannot prove that it isn't? The axioms are consistent with breakingBad airing on Monday 8pm and without.

However, note: if breakingBad were airing on Monday 8pm, then we would have AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad. But we don't have any axiom that says that if a show airs on Monday 8pm then it gives roses. Therefore, we cannot chain from AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad to a contradiction.

Thus, the theorem goal is unprovable from the axioms. But the theorem goal states that breakingBad is airing on Monday 8pm. Since we cannot prove it, and we have no axiom forcing it, we should not be able to prove it.

However, note that we have to replace the sorry. We must check if the statement is provable or not. Since we cannot prove it, we might try to prove the negation? But that requires knowing that breakingBad does not air on Monday 8pm, which is also not given.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the theorem goal is false in the context of the axioms? Actually, we can prove that breakingBad is not the show that is described in P1. But that doesn't mean breakingBad doesn't air on Monday 8pm.

Wait: suppose we assume that breakingBad airs on Monday 8pm. Then we have AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad. But we do not have that breakingBad gives roses. So we cannot use P2 for breakingBad. Therefore, we cannot get a contradiction.

Therefore, the statement goal is not forced by the axioms, and we have no way to prove it.

But let me look at the axioms again:

  P1: ∃ s, AiringOnMonday8pm s ∧ GivesRoses s
        -> There is at least one show that airs on Monday 8pm and gives roses.

  P2: Every show that gives roses is a Bachelor episode.

  P3: Every Bachelor episode portrays real people.

  P4: Every show that portrays real people is reality TV.

  P6: breakingBad is not reality TV.

We know that from P1 we get a particular show s0 that airs on Monday 8pm and gives roses. Then we know that s0 is reality TV.

But for breakingBad, we don't have any link to this chain unless we assume that breakingBad has one of the properties. So if we assume AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad, we cannot proceed to get RealityTV breakingBad without also having GivesRoses breakingBad. And that we don't have.

Therefore, there is no proof of goal: AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad.

But the problem asks us to replace the sorry. We cannot prove it. So what do we do? We realize that the theorem goal is actually false? But in the example, the proof term was provided when it was provable.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reasoning. Is it possible that from the axioms we can prove that breakingBad is not airing on Monday 8pm? That would mean we could prove the negation of goal? But let's see:

  If breakingBad were airing on Monday 8pm, then we have AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad.
  Now, does that imply that breakingBad gives roses? Not according to the axioms. P1 only says there is at least one show that does. It doesn't say that every show that airs on Monday 8pm gives roses.

Therefore, from AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad we can conclude nothing more.

But note: we also have P2 only talks about shows that give roses. So breakingBad, even if it airs on Monday 8pm, doesn't get caught.

Therefore, the axioms are consistent with breakingBad airing on Monday 8pm and not being reality TV. For example, breakingBad might be a fictional show that airs on Monday 8pm but doesn't give roses.

So we have two possibilities:

Possibility 1: breakingBad does not air on Monday 8pm.
Possibility 2: breakingBad does air on Monday 8pm, but does not give roses (so it's not a Bachelor episode, doesn't portray real people, and hence isn't reality TV).

Since both are consistent with the axioms, the theorem goal (that breakingBad airs on Monday 8pm) is not provable, and we also cannot prove its negation.

However, the task is to provide a valid proof term. Without further axioms, we cannot prove goal.

But note: we cannot leave sorry. How is this handled? We must decide: is the theorem provably false? Or are we missing that the axioms force breakingBad to not be airing on Monday 8pm?

Wait, what if we consider the chain only applies to the show that gives roses? And breakingBad is not that show? But that doesn't mean breakingBad cannot have AiringOnMonday8pm.

Therefore, the statement of the theorem is not provable. However, in our Lean code, we have to provide a proof. Since we cannot, we must conclude that the theorem is false? Or which option?

But note: we are not allowed to change the theorem statement. We have to either prove it or if not possible, then we must note that in the ANSWER.

The problem says: After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain.

So the answer we will give is Uncertain? Or False?

But let me try to see if we can prove the negation.

We have P6: ¬ RealityTV breakingBad.

We also can prove from P1, P2, P3, P4 that there exists a reality TV show that airs on Monday 8pm.

But we cannot say anything about breakingBad. The axioms do not relate breakingBad to Monday 8pm.

Therefore, the theorem goal (that breakingBad airs on Monday 8pm) is not provable. But that does not make it false. It is merely unprovable.

However, in a classical logic setting, we might try to prove by contradiction. Let's try:

  To prove goal: we want to prove AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad.
  We don't have any direct way.

Alternative: we might try to use the axiom P1? We can get a witness s that airs on Monday 8pm and gives roses. Then we can prove that s is reality TV. But we cannot connect that to breakingBad.

Therefore, there is no proof. So we must leave it unproven? But the task is to replace sorry by a proof term. Without a proof, we cannot.

But what if the theorem is actually false in the minimal model? Can we build a countermodel?

Yes: consider:

  Show = {s0, breakingBad}
  AiringOnMonday8pm: {s0}   [only s0]
  GivesRoses: {s0}
  RealityTV: {s0}
  breakingBad is not in RealityTV, so P6 holds.

In this model, breakingBad does not have AiringOnMonday8pm.

Therefore, the theorem goal is actually false: we can have a model where breakingBad does not air on Monday 8pm. And the axioms do not force it to be true.

Moreover, note that if we had an axiom that said that there is only one show that airs on Monday 8pm, then we would have a contradiction: because then s0 and breakingBad would be the same, but s0 is realityTV and breakingBad is not. But we don't have such an axiom.

Therefore, the theorem goal is not provable and moreover, we can construct a model where the axioms hold and the goal fails. Hence, the goal is not a logical consequence. That means that the theorem is false in the context of the axioms? Or that it is disprovable?

We can try to prove the negation of the goal: ¬ AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad.

Let's try:

  We have P6: ¬ RealityTV breakingBad.

  How to connect? We cannot.

Wait, we can. Let me try to show that if breakingBad were airing on Monday 8pm, then it would give roses? But we don't have that. The only show that we know that airs on Monday 8pm and gives roses is s0, but there might be others? Or none? Actually, P1 doesn't force uniqueness.

In fact, in my countermodel, we have that breakingBad does not air on Monday 8pm. But the axioms do not force that. They also allow breakingBad to air on Monday 8pm and not give roses.

So the negation of goal is also not provable.

But since there exists a model where goal is false (like the one I constructed) and a model where goal is true (for example: the same as above but also set AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad to be true, and note that breakingBad doesn't give roses so it doesn't go through the chain and RealityTV breakingBad remains false, which is consistent with P6), the goal is then independent of the axioms.

Therefore the answer is Uncertain.

But the problem says: You are a theorem prover. Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry', your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof.

If the theorem is not provable, we cannot provide a proof term. But note that the problem says "a valid proof term". In this case, there is none.

So what should we do? 

We must conclude that we cannot find a proof. But the task is to replace sorry with a proof term. If we cannot, then we must fail. But the instructions require to "Provide the COMPLETE code with proof".

Wait, perhaps I see a different approach.

Maybe we can prove that breakingBad does not air on Monday 8pm? Then we have a contradiction with the goal. But note the goal is to prove that it does, so if we prove it doesn't then we have a contradiction with what? The goal statement is positive.

But we are trying to prove goal, which is the positive statement.

So actually, if we assume that our goal is to prove a false statement, then we can use classic Lean to prove anything from contradiction. But we have a contradiction already? Let me see:

Is there a contradiction in the axioms? The axioms do not seem to form a contradiction:

  We have: there exists a reality TV show (s0) and breakingBad which is not reality TV. 

That is consistent.

Therefore, the attempt to prove goal fails.

So what do we do? We must provide a proof. Since there is no direct proof and we cannot find one, we have to admit defeat? But the instructions are clear: replace the sorry.

Therefore, I suspect that the theorem is actually false, and we are expected to notice that and perhaps prove something else? Or maybe I missed something.

Alternative attempt:
  From the chain, we know that any show that gives roses is a reality TV show.
  Now, if breakingBad were the show that airs on Monday 8pm and gives roses, then we would get a contradiction with P6.
  Therefore, breakingBad is not that show. But that doesn't say anything about the airing on Monday 8pm of breakingBad.

  Now, suppose breakingBad also airs on Monday 8pm. Then we would have two shows that air on Monday 8pm: s0 and breakingBad. That is allowed.

  However, if there were an additional axiom that says that only one show can air on Monday 8pm, then we would have that breakingBad = s0, which leads to a contradiction because then breakingBad would have to be reality TV. But we don't have that axiom.

  Therefore, goal is not provable.

After careful analysis, it is not provable. And since in the minimal model (with at least two shows) goal is false (as in s0 airs on Monday 8pm and breakingBad does not), then the theorem goal is a false statement. But then how do we respond?

 The answer is: we cannot provide a proof because it is not true. But the task is to provide the code. 

However, note that the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", meaning the axioms are consistent? And the theorem

But I think the best course of action is to provide a proof of the negation, effectively changing the goal to its negation. But we are not allowed to change the theorem statement.

If we try to prove the goal, we cannot.

Or can we? Perhaps with classical logic and an excluded middle on AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad? But in Lean, by default we have classical logic. So we can do:

  by_contra h
  ...

 then what? We'll assume ¬ AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad and it doesn't lead to a contradiction.

 We know breakingBad is not reality TV, but we don't see how that helps.

 Therefore, we have to conclude that the theorem cannot be proven as stated.

But let's look at the Example given: in the example, the goal was provable.

In this case, it is not.

Given that, after careful analysis, we decide that the theorem is not provable. Therefore, we must leave sorry and return the code unchanged? But that goes against the instructions.

 Alternatively, are there.


=== RESPONSE ===
The theorem `goal : AiringOnMonday8pm breakingBad` is not provable from the given axioms. Despite analyzing the premises, no valid proof was found or constructed. The axioms imply the existence of a show airing on Monday at 8 pm that gives roses, which is a Bachelor episode, portrays real people, and is therefore reality TV. However, `breakingBad` is explicitly not reality TV by `P6`. There is no chain of reasoning connecting `AiringOnMonday8pm` to `breakingBad` or contradicting the absence of this property. Hence, the complete code remains unchanged except for the unresolved `sorry`.
