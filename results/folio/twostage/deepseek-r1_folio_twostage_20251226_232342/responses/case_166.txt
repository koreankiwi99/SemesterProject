STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given:
  Premises:
    Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician.
    Heinrich Schmidt was also a member of the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag.

  Conclusion: Heinrich Schmidt was German or Russian or both.

However, note that the premises do not explicitly state that Heinrich Schmidt was German or Russian. 
But the first premise says "Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician". This implies that he was German.

But the conclusion is about being German or Russian or both. Since we know he was German, we can conclude the disjunction.

However, in the formalization, we must represent the entities and properties.

Let's break down:

We have an individual: Heinrich Schmidt.

We have properties:
  - being a German politician: but note, we can break this down? 
    Actually, the premise says "Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician". This can be interpreted as:
        He was German and he was a politician.

  But the conclusion is only about nationalities: German or Russian.

We do not need to model "politician" for the conclusion? However, we have another premise: 
  He was a member of the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag.

But note: the conclusion does not mention these memberships. So for the conclusion, we might only need:

  We know from the first premise: he was German.
  And we want to prove: German or Russian (or both).

Since we know he is German, then "German or Russian" is true.

So in the formalization:

  We can have:
    a constant for Heinrich Schmidt: `HeinrichSchmidt`
    a predicate `German : obj → Prop`
    a predicate `Russian : obj → Prop`

  Premise 1: Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician.
    This might be broken into:
        Politician(HeinrichSchmidt) and German(HeinrichSchmidt)

  However, note the conclusion does not require the politician part. So we can just extract the German part.

  Alternatively, we can model:
      We are not required to prove the entire context, but only the conclusion.

  But to be precise, let's model the premises as they are:

  Premise 1: HeinrichSchmidt is German and HeinrichSchmidt is a politician.
  Premise 2: HeinrichSchmidt is a member of the Prussian State Parliament and HeinrichSchmidt is a member of the Nazi Reichstag.

  However, the conclusion only requires the German part.

  Therefore, we can define:

    axiom obj : Type
    axiom HeinrichSchmidt : obj
    axiom German : obj → Prop
    axiom Russian : obj → Prop
    axiom Politician : obj → Prop
    axiom PrussianMember : obj → Prop
    axiom ReichstagMember : obj → Prop

    axiom P1 : German HeinrichSchmidt ∧ Politician HeinrichSchmidt
    axiom P2 : PrussianMember HeinrichSchmidt ∧ ReichstagMember HeinrichSchmidt

  And the goal is:
      theorem goal : German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt := ...

  But note: since we have `P1` which says `German HeinrichSchmidt`, we can prove the goal by the left disjunct.

  However, we are not proving, we are formalizing. We just need the types.

  But note: the conclusion says "German or Russian or both". In logic, "or both" is automatically included in the disjunction.

  So we just need to declare:

      theorem goal : German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt := sorry

  However, we must declare all the premises as axioms. But note: the conclusion does not require the other properties (politician, PrussianMember, ReichstagMember). But we are given the premises so we must represent them.

  But note: the problem does not say that we have to use all premises? Actually, we must represent the premises as given.

  However, the conclusion only uses "German", but to have a complete formalization, we include all the premises.

  Alternatively, we might consider that the conclusion only uses the German part. But the problem says "Premises" and we are to formalize the entire problem.

  So we'll include:

    obj : Type
    HeinrichSchmidt : obj
    German, Russian, Politician, PrussianMember, ReichstagMember : obj → Prop
    And then the two premises (conjunctions) and the goal.

  But note: the first premise says "was a German politician" which we interpret as (German h and Politician h).

  However, is there an alternative? Sometimes "German politician" might be a compound predicate. But in logic, it's standard to break it.

  Therefore, we write:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : obj
axiom German : obj → Prop
axiom Russian : obj → Prop
axiom Politician : obj → Prop
axiom PrussianMember : obj → Prop
axiom ReichstagMember : obj → Prop

-- Premise: Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician.
axiom P1 : German HeinrichSchmidt ∧ Politician HeinrichSchmidt

-- Premise: Heinrich Schmidt was a member of the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag.
axiom P2 : PrussianMember HeinrichSchmidt ∧ ReichstagMember HeinrichSchmidt

-- Conclusion: Heinrich Schmidt was German or Russian or both.
theorem goal : German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt := sorry
</lean>


=== RESPONSE ===
This problem involves representing the premises about Heinrich Schmidt and the logical conclusion regarding his nationality. The key points are:

1. We have an individual: Heinrich Schmidt
2. Premise 1 states he was a German politician(which implies he was German)
3. Premise 2 states he held two political positions
4. The conclusion asserts he was German or Russian (or both)

The formalization:
- Declare basic type `obj` for individuals
- Constant `HeinrichSchmidt` represents the person
- Predicates for properties: `German`, `Russian`, `Politician`, plus two for the political positions
- Premises are represented as conjunctions
- Conclusion is a disjunction about nationality

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : obj
axiom German : obj → Prop
axiom Russian : obj → Prop
axiom Politician : obj → Prop
axiom PrussianMember : obj → Prop
axiom ReichstagMember : obj → Prop

-- Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician
axiom P1 : German HeinrichSchmidt ∧ Politician HeinrichSchmidt

-- Heinrich Schmidt was member of Prussian State Parliament and Nazi Reichstag
axiom P2 : PrussianMember HeinrichSchmidt ∧ ReichstagMember HeinrichSchmidt

-- Conclusion: Heinrich Schmidt was German or Russian (or both)
theorem goal : German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt := sorry
</lean>

STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given:
  P1: German HeinrichSchmidt ∧ Politician HeinrichSchmidt
  P2: PrussianMember HeinrichSchmidt ∧ ReichstagMember HeinrichSchmidt

We are to prove: German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt

Looking at P1, we have that German HeinrichSchmidt is true (by the left part of the conjunction).
Therefore, we can prove the goal by using the left disjunct (German HeinrichSchmidt).

We don't need to use P2 at all.

The proof term can be constructed by:
  Or.inl (and_left of P1)

In Lean:
  We have `P1 : German HeinrichSchmidt ∧ Politician HeinrichSchmidt`
  We can get the left part by `P1.left` or `P1.1`
  Then we use `Or.inl` to prove `German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt` because we have a proof of the left disjunct.

So the proof term is: `Or.inl P1.left`

Alternatively: `Or.inl (And.left P1)`

We don't have any axioms about Russian, so we cannot prove that he is Russian, but we don't need to because we are proving an OR and we have the left part.

Therefore, the goal is provable.

Complete code:


=== RESPONSE ===
<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : obj
axiom German : obj → Prop
axiom Russian : obj → Prop
axiom Politician : obj → Prop
axiom PrussianMember : obj → Prop
axiom ReichstagMember : obj → Prop

-- Heinrich Schmidt was a German politician
axiom P1 : German HeinrichSchmidt ∧ Politician HeinrichSchmidt

-- Heinrich Schmidt was member of Prussian State Parliament and Nazi Reichstag
axiom P2 : PrussianMember HeinrichSchmidt ∧ ReichstagMember HeinrichSchmidt

-- Conclusion: Heinrich Schmidt was German or Russian (or both)
theorem goal : German HeinrichSchmidt ∨ Russian HeinrichSchmidt := 
  Or.inl P1.left
</lean>

The proof uses the left conjunct `German HeinrichSchmidt` from axiom P1 and applies the `Or.inl` constructor to prove the disjunction. The axiom P2 is irrelevant to this conclusion.

ANSWER: True
