STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion to formalize.

 Premises:
 1. If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate.
    Translation: ∀ x, DeadlyDisease x → LowSurvivalRate x

 2. Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
    Translation: ∀ x, SevereCancer x → DeadlyDisease x

 3. Bile duct cancer is a severe form of cancer.
    We interpret: BileDuctCancer is a type of SevereCancer? But note that it says "severe form cancer", meaning it is a severe cancer.
    So: ∀ x, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x

 4. All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
    Translation: ∀ x, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x

 5. Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
    This is about a specific disease (or type of disease) "Mild flu". We can represent MildFlu as a constant? But note, it might be a property of an individual?
    Alternatively, we might have:
        axiom MildFlu : obj
        axiom LowSurvivalRate : obj → Prop
        axiom T5 : LowSurvivalRate MildFlu

 6. Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.
    Translation: ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer)

 Conclusion: Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer.
    Translation: SevereCancer ColorectalCancer

 However, note: we are going to have multiple objects? Let me see the structure.

 Approach:
  We have specific diseases: Cholangiocarcinoma, ColorectalCancer, and MildFlu. And we have BileDuctCancer as a property? But note: "bile duct cancer" is a type, so it's a property? 
  However, in the context, we might have:
      - Cholangiocarcinoma is a kind of bile duct cancer -> so Cholangiocarcinoma is an object that has the property BileDuctCancer?
      But note: "All Cholangiocarcinoma" implies that Cholangiocarcinoma is a set of things? Or we can treat it as a singular type? The problem does not specify if we are talking about types or instances.

  In the given example, they used a constant for "Cat". So we are going to use constants for specific diseases and predicates for properties.

  We define:
    - obj : Type   (the type of diseases? or the type of individuals having diseases? The problem is about diseases as types? But wait: "severe cancers" are a type of disease? 
      but colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer? So perhaps we are talking about types? Alternatively, we can have a domain of "disease types".

  Given the context, it might be simpler to have a domain of disease types.

  Let obj be the type of disease types.

  Predicates:
    - DeadlyDisease : obj → Prop
    - LowSurvivalRate : obj → Prop   (meaning the disease type has a low survival rate)
    - SevereCancer : obj → Prop
    - BileDuctCancer : obj → Prop
    - Cholangiocarcinoma : obj → Prop? But wait: the premise says "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer" which suggests that Cholangiocarcinoma might be a set of instances? 
      However, the conclusion is about types: "Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer". And "Mild flu" is treated as a type.

  Alternatively, we can think of obj as the set of disease names. Then:
    - We have specific disease names: Cholangiocarcinoma, ColorectalCancer, MildFlu. 
    - And then we have properties of these disease types.

  But note: the third premise: "Bile duct cancer is a severe form of cancer" - here "Bile duct cancer" is a type, but we can represent it as a constant? Or as a predicate? 
  Actually, if we have multiple bile duct cancers? The problem does not specify. 

  Rethink: The premise "All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer" suggests that Cholangiocarcinoma is a subtype of bile duct cancer. But we are using a first-order logic without sets? 
  We are using unary predicates.

  Let me reframe: We are going to have:
    - Cholangiocarcinoma, ColorectalCancer, MildFlu: these are specific disease types (constants of type obj).
    - Then we have predicates:
        DeadlyDisease : obj → Prop   [for each disease type, it is a deadly disease?]
        LowSurvivalRate : obj → Prop
        SevereCancer : obj → Prop
        BileDuctCancer : obj → Prop   [which is true for a disease type if it is a bile duct cancer?]

  Premise 5 seems to be about a disease type: "Mild flu comes with a low survival rate", so we have MildFlu : obj, and we assume LowSurvivalRate MildFlu.

  Premise 6: about ColorectalCancer: ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer)

  Premise 3: "Bile duct cancer is a severe form of cancer": we interpret this as: if something is a bile duct cancer, then it is a severe cancer.
        ∀ x, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x

  But note, we have a contradiction? Wait, that would imply that bile duct cancers are severe, so then cholangiocarcinoma (which is a bile duct cancer) would be severe. Then by (2) and (1) it would be deadly and have a low survival rate.

  However, the conclusion is about colorectal cancer: we want to show that colorectal cancer is a severe cancer.

  How to get there? We have an extra premise: colorectal cancer is not both bile duct and having low survival rate.

  Also note: we have mild flu with low survival rate. But mild flu is not a deadly disease (by premise 1, if it were deadly then it would have low survival rate? but we already have low survival rate for mild flu. But the premises do not say that mild flu is deadly? They say if deadly then low survival, but not the converse.

  However, we cannot deduce that mild flu is deadly because we only have one direction.

  Now, the plan for the conclusion: we wish to show that colorectal cancer is severe. But we know that if it were bile duct cancer then it would be severe (by premise 3). But we don't know if it is bile duct cancer.

  Alternatively, we can use the last premise: colorectal cancer is not both (bile duct cancer and low survival rate). 

  We might also note that from (1) and (2) and (3): 
      If something is bile duct cancer, then it is severe cancer (3), hence deadly disease (2), hence has low survival rate (1). So bile duct cancer implies low survival rate.

  Therefore, if colorectal cancer were bile duct cancer, then it would have low survival rate. But then it would be both (bile duct cancer and low survival rate). However, premise 6 says it is not both. Therefore, it cannot be bile duct cancer? That doesn't lead us to the conclusion.

  Actually, we want to prove that colorectal cancer is severe cancer. But how?

  We have to look for a different chain.

  The problem says: formalize the logical structure, not to prove. So we just write the axioms.

  But note: we must represent the conclusion as a theorem.

  Proposed:

    axiom obj : Type
    -- Some constants:
    axiom Cholangiocarcinoma : obj
    axiom ColorectalCancer : obj
    axiom MildFlu : obj

    -- Predicates:
    axiom DeadlyDisease : obj → Prop
    axiom LowSurvivalRate : obj → Prop
    axiom SevereCancer : obj → Prop
    axiom BileDuctCancer : obj → Prop

    -- Premise 1: If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate.
    axiom P1 : ∀ x, DeadlyDisease x → LowSurvivalRate x

    -- Premise 2: Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
    axiom P2 : ∀ x, SevereCancer x → DeadlyDisease x

    -- Premise 3: Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. (Meaning: if a disease is a bile duct cancer, then it is a severe cancer)
    axiom P3 : ∀ x, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x

    -- Premise 4: All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
    -- Note: we have a constant Cholangiocarcinoma. But "All" suggests that we might have multiple instances? 
    -- However, the problem does not indicate that we are talking about multiple instances of the disease. It is about disease types. 
    -- So the premise should be understood as: the disease type Cholangiocarcinoma is a bile duct cancer.
    -- Hence: BileDuctCancer Cholangiocarcinoma
    axiom P4 : BileDuctCancer Cholangiocarcinoma

    -- Premise 5: Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
    axiom P5 : LowSurvivalRate MildFlu

    -- Premise 6: Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.
    axiom P6 : ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer)

    -- Conclusion: Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer.
    theorem goal : SevereCancer ColorectalCancer := sorry

  But wait, the conclusion is "Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer", which we formalize as SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.

  However, note that the way we set up, we have a constant for each disease type. So for Cholangiocarcinoma, we have an object and we state it has the property BileDuctCancer.

  This seems consistent.

  Why did we choose to represent Cholangiocarcinoma as a constant? Because the premise says "All Cholangiocarcinoma" - but in the context of disease types, we are interpreting "Cholangiocarcinoma" as a single disease type. Similarly, "bile duct cancer" is a property that a disease type might have.

  But note: in the example, they used a constant for "cat". So we are following the same pattern.

  We can think of obj as the type of disease types. Then Cholangiocarcinoma, ColorectalCancer, and MildFlu are disease types. And we are making propositions about these disease types.

  However, we must be cautious: what about other diseases? The use of quantifiers (∀) in premises 1,2,3 suggests that we are talking about an entire universe of disease types. 

  So our formalization uses:
    - A type `obj` for disease types.
    - Constants for specific disease types.
    - Predicates on disease types.

  We do not need a separate predicate for being a cancer? Because the problem only talks about cancers in the context of severity? We have a predicate for severe cancer.

  But note: mild flu is not a cancer, so it wouldn't fall under the predicate SevereCancer? Which is fine.

  So let's code accordingly.

  However, note the conclusion: we must state that ColorectalCancer is a severe cancer: SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.

  We are not asked to prove, so the theorem is stated and the proof is "sorry".

  But we must check: does the above set of axioms typecheck? We have:
    P1: ∀ x : obj, DeadlyDisease x → LowSurvivalRate x
    P2: ∀ x : obj, SevereCancer x → DeadlyDisease x
    P3: ∀ x : obj, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x
    P4: BileDuctCancer Cholangiocarcinoma  [with Cholangiocarcinoma:obj]
    P5: LowSurvivalRate MildFlu [with MildFlu:obj]
    P6: ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer)

  This should be fine.

  Let's write the code accordingly.

======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and need to prove `SevereCancer ColorectalCancer`.
 Let's analyze the given premises:

 P1: ∀ x, DeadlyDisease x → LowSurvivalRate x
 P2: ∀ x, SevereCancer x → DeadlyDisease x
 P3: ∀ x, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x
 P4: BileDuctCancer Cholangiocarcinoma
 P5: LowSurvivalRate MildFlu
 P6: ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer)

 We are to prove: SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.

 We don't have a direct way to show SevereCancer ColorectalCancer. However, note that we have P3 which says that bile duct cancers are severe cancers.
 But we also have P6 that says colorectal cancer is NOT both bile duct cancer and having low survival rate.

 How can we use P6? We might try to show that if we had SevereCancer ColorectalCancer, then we get a contradiction?
 But note: the goal is to show SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.

 Alternatively, we might try to show that if we assume ¬ SevereCancer ColorectalCancer, then we might derive a contradiction?

 However, let's see what we can derive:

 From P2 and P1, we know that if we have SevereCancer x, then DeadlyDisease x and hence LowSurvivalRate x.

 But note: we are not forced to have SevereCancer ColorectalCancer. There is no premise that directly forces it.

 Also, note that we have P5: LowSurvivalRate MildFlu, but that doesn't directly relate to ColorectalCancer.

 P6 says that it is not the case that (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer AND LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer).

 Now, if we could show that ColorectalCancer has low survival rate, then by P6 we would have that it cannot be bile duct cancer.
 But then, from P3, bile duct cancer implies severe cancer, but the absence of bile duct cancer doesn't tell us anything about severe cancer? 
 Actually, P3 does not force all severe cancers to be bile duct cancers. There could be other severe cancers.

 Also, if we assume that SevereCancer ColorectalCancer holds, then we get:
   By P2: DeadlyDisease ColorectalCancer
   By P1: LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer

 Then P6 says: ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer)
 Since we have LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer, we must have that ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer.

 However, note that we don't have any premise that says that severe cancer must be bile duct cancer. 
 In fact, P3 only says that bile duct cancer is a severe cancer, not the other way around.

 So the fact that ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer is consistent with SevereCancer ColorectalCancer? 
 We have no premise that forces every severe cancer to be bile duct cancer.

 Therefore, we have not reached a contradiction. In fact, we have:
   SevereCancer ColorectalCancer → LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer → ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer

 But this implication does not contradict any premise? 

 What if we try to prove the goal by contradiction? 
 Assume ¬ SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.

 Then what? We don't have any way to derive a contradiction with this assumption because:
   - We don't have any premise that directly says something about colorectal cancer having low survival rate or not.
   - We know MildFlu has low survival rate, but that doesn't relate to colorectal cancer.

 Therefore, we cannot derive a contradiction from ¬ SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.

 Moreover, note that P6 tells us that we cannot have both BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer and LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer.
 But if ColorectalCancer is not severe, then we don't have any premise that forces it to have low survival rate? 

 Actually, we have no premises that say anything about the survival rate of colorectal cancer at all.

 So we have to conclude that the goal is not provable.

 However, let me try to think if there is a proof.

 We have:
   P4: BileDuctCancer Cholangiocarcinoma
   Then by P3: SevereCancer Cholangiocarcinoma
   Then by P2: DeadlyDisease Cholangiocarcinoma
   Then by P1: LowSurvivalRate Cholangiocarcinoma

 But that doesn't tell us anything about ColorectalCancer.

 Also, we have P5: LowSurvivalRate MildFlu, but again, no connection.

 Therefore, we don't have enough evidence to prove that ColorectalCancer is a severe cancer.

 So the answer should be Uncertain? But note the instructions: we are to provide a proof term. However, we have shown that the theorem is not provable.

 But wait, perhaps we are missing something. Let me consider the meaning of P6.

 P6: ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer)

 This means that either ColorectalCancer is not bile duct cancer or it does not have low survival rate (or both).

 Now, if we could show that ColorectalCancer has low survival rate, then by P6 it would follow that it is not bile duct cancer. 
 But that doesn't help us to show that it is severe cancer.

 Conversely, if we could show that it is bile duct cancer, then by P6 it wouldn't have low survival rate. 
 But if it is bile duct cancer, then by P3 it would be severe cancer, so then we could use P2 and P1 to get that it has low survival rate, which would be a contradiction.

 However, we don't have that ColorectalCancer is bile duct cancer? We don't have any premise saying that.

 Actually, we have P4 only for Cholangiocarcinoma.

 So to get a contradiction we would need to assume that ColorectalCancer is bile duct cancer? But that would give:

   Assume BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer.
   Then by P3: SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.
   Then by P2: DeadlyDisease ColorectalCancer.
   Then by P1: LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer.
   But then we have BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer and LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer, which is exactly the negation of P6.

 Therefore, we have shown that the assumption BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer leads to a contradiction.

 So we have ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer.

 But now, we still haven't shown that it is severe cancer.

 Alternatively, note that we have no way to derive SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.

 Therefore, we must say that the theorem cannot be proven? But wait, the goal is to prove SevereCancer ColorectalCancer, and we are stuck.

 Alternatively, let me try to see the original problem. It says "Colorectal cancer cannot be both bile duct cancer and have low survival rate". 
 But that doesn't tell us that it is not bile duct cancer? It only tells us that it cannot be both. It might be bile duct cancer but then it must not have low survival rate. 
 But if it is bile duct cancer, then we have to have severe cancer (by P3), then deadly (by P2), then low survival rate (by P1) - that's a contradiction.

 Therefore, we have proven that ColorectalCancer cannot be bile duct cancer: ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer.

 Now, is there a way to get from ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer to anything about severe cancer? 
 We don't have any premise that says if a cancer is severe then it must be bile duct cancer. In fact, there could be severe cancers that are not bile duct.

 So with the given premises, we cannot prove that ColorectalCancer is severe cancer.

 Thus, the theorem goal cannot be proven. We must answer Uncertain.

 However, note that the problem asks: Provide the complete code with a valid proof. But we found that the theorem is not provable.

 But wait, in Lean, if we cannot prove the theorem, then we can't replace the sorry. So we must leave the answer as Uncertain.

 However, let me read the instructions again: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry', your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof."

 It says "validated" axioms. And we are to replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term. 

 Since we have concluded that the theorem is not provable, we must have made an error in our reasoning.

 Let me reexamine with the idea of proof by contradiction.

 We want to prove: SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.

 We assume the negation: ¬ SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.

 Now, can we derive a contradiction?

 What do we know? 
   We have the premise P6: ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer)

 And we know that if we had BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer, then by P3 we get SevereCancer ColorectalCancer (but that's our goal, so we don't have it) and then by P2 and P1 we get LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer, which would violate P6.

 But we don't have BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer.

 But wait, what if we define:
   Let A = BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer
   Let B = LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer
   We have ¬ (A ∧ B) → A → ¬ B.

 But note: if we had A, then we would get B (as above), and then A ∧ B which is a contradiction. 
 Therefore, we have proven ¬ A (i.e., ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer).

 However, as above, that does not seem to help.

 Alternatively, what if we use the fact that we have no premise that forces colorectal cancer to have low survival rate? 
 If colorectal cancer does not have low survival rate, then P6 is satisfied (since one of the conjuncts is false) and we don't have any contradiction.

 So there is no contradiction with the assumption that ¬ SevereCancer ColorectalCancer? 

 Therefore, we do not have a proof of SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.

 Now, the problem says: After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain

 Since the theorem is not provable, we must choose Uncertain.

 But note: what if there is a proof we are missing?

 Another thought: we have P5: LowSurvivalRate MildFlu, and P1 and P2 and P3 also apply to MildFlu? 
 We are not told that MildFlu is a deadly disease? P1 says that if it is a deadly disease then it has low survival rate. 
 But P5 says it has low survival rate. So by P1, if we assume DeadlyDisease MildFlu then we are fine, but we don't have to, because deadliness may not be the only cause of low survival rate.

 So we cannot infer that MildFlu is deadly.

 In summary, we cannot prove the goal.

 Therefore, we must leave the theorem with `sorry` and mark Uncertain.

 However, the instructions say: provide the complete code with a valid proof. 
 Since we cannot provide a valid proof, we have to provide the same code with `sorry` and mark Uncertain? 

 But that doesn't seem to match the example. 

 Alternatively, we might try to prove that it is not necessarily true? But the theorem is stated as a goal.

 Alternatively, we can prove that we can have a countermodel? But that's outside of Lean.

 The task is to replace sorry with a proof term. Since we found the theorem unprovable, we cannot.

 After rethinking, we note: We can actually prove the goal by contradiction. But how?

 Let me assume that we do:

   theorem goal : SevereCancer ColorectalCancer := by
     ...

   We want to use P6.

   If we could show that LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer is true, then by P6 we would have to have that BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer is false.

   But wait, we don't have a proof of LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer.

   Alternatively, we can try to show that if we assume ¬ SevereCancer ColorectalCancer, then we can derive a contradiction? 
   Let me try:

     Assume h: ¬ SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.

     We have P3: BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x. 
     So for ColorectalCancer: BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer → SevereCancer ColorectalCancer.
     By contrapositive: ¬ SevereCancer ColorectalCancer → ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer.
     So we get ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer.

     Now, also, we are not forced to have LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer? We don't have any premise that gives it.

     But now, P6 says: ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer)

     Which is equivalent to: ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∨ ¬ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer.

     We have just derived ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer, so this disjunction holds.

     Therefore, there is no contradiction. The assumption h: ¬ SevereCancer ColorectalCancer is consistent.

     So we don't have a contradiction.

     Thus, no proof by contradiction.

   Alternatively, we can try to show that colorectal cancer must have low survival rate? 
   How? We only know that deadly diseases have low survival rate, and severe cancers are deadly. 
   But for colorectal cancer to be deadly, it has to be severe cancer (by P2). But that's circular.

   Therefore, we cannot prove the goal.

 So we conclude Uncertain.

 However, there is one more possibility: the argument by assuming that ColorectalCancer is bile duct cancer leads to a contradiction, but that only shows that it is not bile duct cancer. 
 And then we have no further constraints.

 However, the goal is to show it is severe cancer. We have examples of severe cancer: cholangiocarcinoma. 
 But colorectal cancer is different.

 So the final answer is uncertain.

 Therefore, we output the same code but with `sorry` (since we can't replace it) and answer Uncertain.

 But the instruction says to replace `sorry` with a valid proof term. Since we cannot, we must leave it as `sorry` and answer Uncertain.

 Alternatively, note that the problem might be underspecified and the theorem might be false. We are not to declare it false; we are to provide a proof if possible, else recognize that we can't.

 IMPORTANT: The instruction says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", so we assume the axioms are consistent.

 Let me build a model in which the axioms hold but goal is false:

   obj : Type := {Cholangiocarcinoma, ColorectalCancer, MildFlu}

   Let's interpret the predicates:

      DeadlyDisease: 
         - Cholangiocarcinoma is deadly (from the chain: bile duct cancer -> severe cancer -> deadly, and we have it via P4, P3, P2)
         - MildFlu: note we have P5: LowSurvivalRate MildFlu, but does that come from deadliness? Not necessarily. So we can set DeadlyDisease MildFlu to be false (and that's okay by P1: because P1 only says if deadly then low survival rate, but if MildFlu has low survival rate without being deadly, that's fine).

      LowSurvivalRate: 
          - Cholangiocarcinoma: true (by the chain)
          - MildFlu: true (P5)
          - ColorectalCancer: we can choose? since no premise says anything.

      BileDuctCancer:
          - Cholangiocarcinoma: true (P4)
          - ColorectalCancer: false (we choose) so that the goal (SevereCancer ColorectalCancer) becomes false? or true? 

      SevereCancer:
          - Cholangiocarcinoma: true (by P3 and P4)
          - ColorectalCancer: we are going to set to false.
          - MildFlu: we don't need to set if it's not a cancer? but the predicates are defined for all x.

      However, note the axioms:
          P3: ∀ x, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x -> holds because BileDuctCancer is only true for Cholangiocarcinoma and then SevereCancer is true for that one.
          P4: holds
          P5: holds
          P6: We must have ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer)
               Since we set BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer = false, then the conjunction is false, so ¬ (...) is true.

      Now, for ColorectalCancer: 
          Since we set SevereCancer ColorectalCancer to false, we must check P2 and P1:
          P2: SevereCancer ColorectalCancer → DeadlyDisease ColorectalCancer -> holds because if false implies anything -> true.
          P1: DeadlyDisease ColorectalCancer → LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer: 
              If we set DeadlyDisease ColorectalCancer to false (which we can, since ColorectalCancer is not severe by our assignment, we are free to set DeadlyDisease as we wish for non-severe cancers) then this holds.

      We set:
          DeadlyDisease: 
             Cholangiocarcinoma: true
             MildFlu: false (because we don't have any premise forcing it to be deadly, and it's not a cancer according to our interpretation? but note, we have no axiom that says only cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal cancer and mild flu are distinct in terms of predicates; they are all constants. So for MildFlu, it has low survival rate but is not necessarily deadly.)

      Also, we set for ColorectalCancer:
          DeadlyDisease ColorectalCancer: false (which is consistent with SevereCancer being false by P2: since P2 only says if severe then deadly, not the converse).

      Then P1: 
          For Cholangiocarcinoma: DeadlyDisease -> true => must set LowSurvivalRate to true -> already set.
          For ColorectalCancer: DeadlyDisease = false -> no constraint on LowSurvivalRate. So we can set LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer arbitrarily: 
              We set it to false (or true) whichever we wish? 
              But note P6: we only need that it is not the case that (bile duct cancer and low survival rate). Since bile duct cancer is false for ColorectalCancer, we are free to set low survival rate to either. 
              We set it to false to make it simpler.

      Now, the goal: SevereCancer ColorectalCancer is false in this model.

      And all axioms hold: 
          P1: 
             Cholangiocarcinoma: DeadlyDisease true -> LowSurvivalRate true: holds.
             ColorectalCancer: DeadlyDisease false -> ... (holds because false implies anything)
             MildFlu: DeadlyDisease false -> ... holds.
          P2: 
             Cholangiocarcinoma: SevereCancer true -> DeadlyDisease true: holds.
             ColorectalCancer: SevereCancer false -> ... holds.
             MildFlu: we set SevereCancer MildFlu to? we haven't set. We have to set: 
                 Since we have no axioms about MildFlu being a cancer, we set SevereCancer MildFlu to false, and DeadlyDisease MildFlu to false -> then holds.
          P3: 
             Only Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer and has severe cancer -> holds.
             ColorectalCancer: bile duct cancer is false -> holds.
             MildFlu: bile duct cancer false -> holds.
          P4: holds.
          P5: LowSurvivalRate MildFlu: we set it to true -> holds but note we set LowSurvivalRate MildFlu=true.
          P6: ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer): 
               Since BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer is false, the and is false, so true.

      This model satisfies all axioms and has SevereCancer ColorectalCancer = false.

      Therefore, the theorem is not valid.

      Hence the theorem is false? 

      But what if we can also have a model in which SevereCancer ColorectalCancer is true?
      We can try:

        Set:
            BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer: true? But then by P3: SevereCancer ColorectalCancer -> true, then by P2: DeadlyDisease true, then by P1: LowSurvivalRate true.
            Then we have BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer and LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer -> but P6 says this is false. Contradiction.

        So if we try to set SevereCancer ColorectalCancer to true, we get a contradiction.

      Therefore, in all models, SevereCancer ColorectalCancer must be false? 

      Then the theorem goal is actually false.

      How did we miss this?

      We have:
        If we assume SevereCancer ColorectalCancer, then:
          By P2: DeadlyDisease ColorectalCancer
          By P1: LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer
          By P3: from SevereCancer we cannot get BileDuctCancer (because P3 only goes one way: bile duct -> severe) so we need not have bile duct.
          But wait, we only get LowSurvivalRate.

          However, P6: ¬(BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer)

          Since we have LowSurvivalRate, P6 forces that we do not have BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer.

          That's acceptable. There is no contradiction: we have SevereCancer ColorectalCancer, LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer, and ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer.

          So it is consistent.

      But now, in the earlier model we built, we set SevereCancer ColorectalCancer to false and achieved the axioms.

      And in a model where we set SevereCancer ColorectalCancer to true? 
        We also set LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer to true (by P1 and P2) and BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer to false (because if we set it to true, then by P6 we would have a problem: P6 says not both, but if it's true then we have both -> contradiction).
        So then we set BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer to false.
        Then the axioms:
          P3: for ColorectalCancer: false implies true -> holds.
          P4, P5: same.
          P6: Since BileDuctCancer is false, the conjunction is false, so holds.

        So we can have both models:
          Model 1: SevereCancer ColorectalCancer = false, with BileDuctCancer=false and LowSurvivalRate=false.
          Model 2: SevereCancer ColorectalCancer = true, with BileDuctCancer=false and LowSurvivalRate=true.

        Therefore, it is not determined by the axioms.

      Thus, the theorem is not provable: we cannot conclude that ColorectalCancer is severe cancer.

      And in fact, it might not be.

      But note: the problem states "Conclusion: Colorectal cancer is a severe cancer", and we are to see if that follows.

      Since we have a model where it is true and a model where it is false, we cannot conclude.

      Therefore, the answer is Uncertain.

      In Lean, we cannot provide a proof term because the theorem is not a theorem of the given axioms.

      But then how we output? We output the code with `sorry` and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

      However, the instructions say "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof". 
      Since we don't have a proof, we must leave sorry.

      But wait: after this logical analysis, we see that the goal is not a theorem. Therefore, the code as given with `sorry` is what we have.

 OUTPUT:

   We return the same code with `sorry` and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

 Let me double-check by attempting to prove the goal in Lean.

   We try:

   theorem goal : SevereCancer ColorectalCancer := by
     -- We know that if we had bile duct cancer for colorectal, we would get a contradiction.
     have h : ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer := by
       intro h1
       have : SevereCancer ColorectalCancer := P3 ColorectalCancer h1
       have : DeadlyDisease ColorectalCancer := P2 ColorectalCancer this
       have : LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer := P1 ColorectalCancer this
       exact P6 (And.intro h1 this)
     -- now we have ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer, but that doesn't help us.
     -- no further steps to get SevereCancer.

   We're stuck.

   We could try:

     apply P2   -- no, because we don't have DeadlyDisease for ColorectalCancer
     apply P3   -- no, because we don't have bile duct cancer

   So we remain stuck.

   Therefore, we leave the theorem as `sorry`.

   And answer: Uncertain.

 But note: the axiom P2 is for x, and we have SevereCancer x → DeadlyDisease x. We need SevereCancer to get DeadlyDisease, not the other way around.

 Therefore, we output:

axiom obj : Type

-- Constants for disease types
axiom Cholangiocarcinoma : obj
axiom ColorectalCancer : obj
axiom MildFlu : obj

-- Predicates for disease properties
axiom DeadlyDisease : obj → Prop

axiom P6 : ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer)

-- Conclusion: Colorectal cancer is a severe cancer
theorem goal : SevereCancer ColorectalCancer := sorry
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

 But wait, the instruction says not to modify the axioms or theorem statement. Indeed, we are not. We are leaving the proof as `sorry`.

 Alternatively, we might try to prove it by contradiction on the entire goal.

   theorem goal : SevereCancer ColorectalCancer := by
     by_contra h         -- h: ¬ SevereCancer ColorectalCancer
     ... 

   But we also have the other contradiction route we applied to the bile duct part. 

   We can show that h leads to?
     We can only show that bile duct cancer is not true for colorectal cancer? but not a full contradiction.

   So:

     have h_not_severe : ¬ SevereCancer ColorectalCancer := sorry -- (we assume this)
     -- Now, from h_not_severe, to get a contradiction we would need some premise that forces colorectal cancer to be severe? 
     -- We don't have that.

   No contradiction. 

   The only route to a contradiction is to assume the opposite of our goal, and then derive a contradiction. 
   But if we assume the goal holds, we get:

     have h_low : LowSurvivalRate ColorectalCancer := by 
        apply P1
        apply P2
        exact goal   -- but we are trying to prove goal! So we are not allowed to use it.

   Therefore, there is no apparent way to derive a contradiction.

   So we must remain with sorry.

Final decision: leave the theorem with `sorry` and ANSWER: Uncertain.


=== RESPONSE ===
The given axioms do not provide sufficient information to prove that ColorectalCancer is a severe cancer. Specifically:
- The premises establish logical relationships for Cholangiocarcinoma and MildFlu, but not for ColorectalCancer
- Premise 6 rules out ColorectalCancer being both bile duct cancer and having low survival rate, but does not force it to be either
- No chain of inference connects ColorectalCancer to the severe cancer property

The theorem is unprovable from the given premises.
