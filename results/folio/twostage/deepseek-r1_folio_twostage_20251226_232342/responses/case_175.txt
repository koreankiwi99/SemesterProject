STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given three premises and a conclusion. However, note that the conclusion is about "the world championships", which does not appear in the premises. So we have to introduce it.

 Let's break down:

 Premises:
 1. The summer Olympic games is a sporting event.
    We'll need:
      - a type for sporting events? Or we can have a predicate: SportingEvent : obj -> Prop
      - an object for the summer Olympic games: SummerOlympics : obj

    So: SportingEvent SummerOlympics

 2. The last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo.
    This seems to be saying that the last summer Olympic games took place in Tokyo.
    We need:
      - a relation or function for location? Let's define: HeldIn : obj -> obj -> Prop
        (meaning: an event was held in a place)
      - Tokyo : obj

    So: HeldIn SummerOlympics Tokyo

 3. The United States won the most medals in Tokyo.
    This might be a bit ambiguous. We can interpret as: In the event held in Tokyo, the United States won the most medals.
    But note: the event in Tokyo in the context is the summer Olympic games.

    However, the conclusion is about the world championships, so we must also introduce the world championships.

    We need:
      - an object for the United States: UnitedStates : obj
      - a relation for winning the most medals at an event: WonMostMedals : obj -> obj -> Prop
        meaning: (a country, an event)

    Since the event is the one held in Tokyo, and we know that the summer Olympic games was held in Tokyo, but note there might be multiple events? 
    However, the premise says "in Tokyo", but we have the event that was held in Tokyo? Actually, the premise says "the last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo", so we have one event: SummerOlympics.

    But we are also going to have the world championships.

    So: WonMostMedals UnitedStates SummerOlympics   [because the event in Tokyo is the summer Olympic games]

 Conclusion:
    The world championships is a sporting event.

    So: SportingEvent WorldChampionships

 We must introduce:
   - WorldChampionships : obj

 Therefore, the code:

 Steps:
   - Define the type `obj` for objects.
   - Define the constants: SummerOlympics, Tokyo, UnitedStates, WorldChampionships (all : obj)
   - Define the predicates: SportingEvent, HeldIn, WonMostMedals (all taking obj as argument, and for HeldIn and WonMostMedals, they take two objs)

 However, note: HeldIn takes two objects: the first is an event, the second is a location.
 WonMostMedals: the first is a country (we assume countries are objects) and the second is an event.

 But what about "in Tokyo" in the third premise? The premise says: "The United States won the most medals in Tokyo"

 We have two interpretations:
   (a) In the context of the event that took place in Tokyo (which is the summer Olympics), the US won the most medals.
   (b) The winning happened in the location Tokyo? But that doesn't make as much sense because the winning is with respect to the event.

 We'll go with (a): the event is the summer Olympics. So we don't need to reference Tokyo again in the winning relation? 

 But note the premise says "in Tokyo", so we have to make a decision.

 Actually, the problem states: "The United States won the most medals in Tokyo." 
 This can be parsed as: won the most medals (in Tokyo) [at the event that was held in Tokyo]. But we already know the event (the summer Olympics) was held in Tokyo.

 However, to be safe, we can represent the third premise without linking to the event by name? But we have already defined that the summer Olympics was held in Tokyo. 
 And the third premise does not say "the summer Olympics", it says "in Tokyo". That might lead us to have a different representation: that there was an event in Tokyo (which we know is the summer Olympics, but maybe the logic should capture the event that was held in Tokyo?).

 But note: the conclusion is about the world championships, so we don't have any other events.

 Alternative representation for the third premise:

   Let E be any event that is held in Tokyo? But the premise says "the last summer Olympic games" was the one in Tokyo, so it is specific.

 However, the problem does not state that the summer Olympic games is the only event held in Tokyo? But that's the only one we know.

 Given the conclusion is about a different event (world championships) and we don't have any other information, we will stick to the direct representation:

   The third premise: The United States won the most medals at the summer Olympic games? But the premise says "in Tokyo", but we know that the summer Olympic games was the one held in Tokyo. 

   We can interpret: the event that we are talking about (the summer Olympics) is where the US won the most medals.

 Therefore: WonMostMedals UnitedStates SummerOlympics.

 But let us compare: if we had multiple events in Tokyo, we might need more? However, the problem doesn't mention any other event.

 Since the conclusion is about the world championships and not about Tokyo or medals, we can keep it simple.

 So:

   axioms:
     obj : Type
     SummerOlympics : obj
     Tokyo : obj
     UnitedStates : obj
     WorldChampionships : obj

     SportingEvent : obj -> Prop
     HeldIn : obj -> obj -> Prop   (first arg: event, second arg: location)
     WonMostMedals : obj -> obj -> Prop   (first arg: country, second arg: event)

   Premise 1: SportingEvent SummerOlympics
   Premise 2: HeldIn SummerOlympics Tokyo
   Premise 3: WonMostMedals UnitedStates SummerOlympics

   Conclusion: SportingEvent WorldChampionships

 However, note: the conclusion is about "the world championships", which we have introduced. But the axioms do not connect the world championships to the premises in any way? 
 The conclusion is independent? So we must also have an axiom that the world championships is a sporting event? 

 But wait: the problem is to translate the given premises and the conclusion. The premises do not say anything about the world championships? 
 Then how can we prove that the world championships is a sporting event? We don't have any information about the world championships.

 The user might want to see the structure. We are only formalizing the logical structure.

 Therefore, we write:

   axiom SportingEvent_SummerOlympics : SportingEvent SummerOlympics
   axiom HeldIn_Tokyo : HeldIn SummerOlympics Tokyo
   axiom WonMostMedals_USA : WonMostMedals UnitedStates SummerOlympics

   theorem goal : SportingEvent WorldChampionships := sorry

 This will be the structure.

 However, note: the problem says "Conclusion to formalize: The world championships is a sporting event."

 But the premises do not mention the world championships. So the conclusion is not provable from the premises? That's fine: our job is only to formalize the statements.

 IMPORTANT: We are not expected to correct the argument, just translate.

 But wait: the premises talk about the summer Olympic games and Tokyo, and the conclusion is about the world championships? There seems to be no connection. 
 However, we are just formalizing the given natural language statements.

 One more point: the third premise is "The United States won the most medals in Tokyo", and we interpreted as at the summer Olympic games. 
 What if we interpret it as in the location Tokyo? Then we might need something like:

   axiom WonMostMedalsIn : obj -> obj -> Prop   (country and location)

 But then the premise would be: WonMostMedalsIn UnitedStates Tokyo.

 However, the natural language says "in Tokyo", but it might be ambiguous. But note the context: the event in Tokyo is the summer Olympics, and the winning of medals is typically at an event.

 We'll stick with the event-based interpretation. But it would still be valid to use a location-based winning if we want to express that the winning occurred at that location? 

 However, the conclusion is about the world championships, so either way the medals part is not used in the conclusion. 

 Given the ambiguity, let's look at the example provided in the instructions: they did not use a location but used direct objects. 

 How about we avoid introducing unnecessary complexity? The problem says to formalize the logical structure. So we can do:

   Option 1: WonMostMedals at the event that was held in Tokyo? Then we have to link via the event. But we know the event: SummerOlympics.

   So we can have:

     axiom WonMostMedals_USA : WonMostMedals UnitedStates SummerOlympics

   or

   Option 2: use a ternary relation? That might be overkill.

   I think Option 1 is acceptable.

 Final code:


=== RESPONSE ===
The premises and conclusion are translated into Lean 4 axioms and a theorem. Note that the conclusion about the "world championships" has no logical connection to the premises about the "summer Olympic games", but the formalization reflects exactly the given statements.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type

-- Objects
axiom SummerOlympics : obj
axiom Tokyo : obj
axiom UnitedStates : obj
axiom WorldChampionships : obj

-- Predicates
axiom SportingEvent : obj → Prop
axiom HeldIn : obj → obj → Prop
axiom WonMostMedals : obj → obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom summer_olympics_is_event : SportingEvent SummerOlympics
axiom last_olympics_in_tokyo : HeldIn SummerOlympics Tokyo
axiom us_won_in_tokyo : WonMostMedals UnitedStates SummerOlympics

-- Conclusion (to formalize)
theorem world_championships_event : SportingEvent WorldChampionships := sorry
</lean>

Key points:
1. `summer_olympics_is_event` formalizes "The summer Olympic games is a sporting event"
2. `last_olympics_in_tokyo` formalizes "The last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo"
3. `us_won_in_tokyo` formalizes "The United States won the most medals in Tokyo" (interpreted as winning at the Tokyo Olympics)
4. `world_championships_event` formalizes the conclusion

Note: The theorem is unprovable from the axioms since the conclusion mentions `WorldChampionships` while the premises only discuss `SummerOlympics`. This reflects the natural language argument's structure.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given the following axioms:

axiom obj : Type
axiom SummerOlympics : obj
axiom Tokyo : obj
axiom UnitedStates : obj
axiom WorldChampionships : obj

axiom SportingEvent : obj → Prop
axiom HeldIn : obj → obj → Prop
axiom WonMostMedals : obj → obj → Prop

axiom summer_olympics_is_event : SportingEvent SummerOlympics
axiom last_olympics_in_tokyo : HeldIn SummerOlympics Tokyo
axiom us_won_in_tokyo : WonMostMedals UnitedStates SummerOlympics

We are to prove: SportingEvent WorldChampionships

Looking at the premises, we have:
- `summer_olympics_is_event` : `SummerOlympics` is a sporting event.
- `last_olympics_in_tokyo` : `SummerOlympics` was held in `Tokyo`.
- `us_won_in_tokyo` : `UnitedStates` won the most medals at `SummerOlympics`.

Notice that there is no direct link that mentions `WorldChampionships`. The theorem claims that `WorldChampionships` is a sporting event, but we have no axiom that states anything about `WorldChampionships`.

Therefore, we cannot prove `SportingEvent WorldChampionships` from the given axioms.

Answer: Uncertain (since we lack information about WorldChampionships)

However, let's double-check if any of the axioms might imply something about `WorldChampionships`? None of the axioms mention `WorldChampionships`. The predicate `WonMostMedals` relates two objects, but we only have one instance (UnitedStates and SummerOlympics). Similarly, `HeldIn` relates SummerOlympics and Tokyo.

Thus, the theorem is not provable from the given premises.

But note: the problem says to provide the complete code. Since the theorem is not provable, we cannot replace the `sorry` with a valid proof term. However, the instructions say: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry', your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof." But if the theorem is unprovable, we have a problem.

Wait, the instruction says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

In the example, we only had to provide the proof when there was one. Here, we cannot. But note: the problem also says "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." If we cannot, then we must acknowledge that.

However, the task is based on the premises we have. Since there is no information about WorldChampionships, the theorem cannot be proven. Therefore, we leave the `sorry`? But that is not what the instruction says. The instruction says to replace `sorry` with a valid proof term.

But what if the intended meaning of the problem is that we should notice that the theorem is not provable? Then we must answer "Uncertain".

But note the formatting: We must provide the complete code. We cannot change the theorem statement or axioms. We cannot prove it, so we must leave it as `sorry`? But that would not be replacing it with a valid proof.

Alternatively, we might try to use an axiom that we have, but there is none about WorldChampionships.

Therefore, we must conclude that the theorem is unprovable and answer "Uncertain".

But let's reexamine: The premises only state facts about SummerOlympics. The conclusion is about WorldChampionships. Without any axiom that relates to WorldChampionships, we cannot prove it.

However, note that the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions". It is possible that the axioms are intended to be sufficient? But as given, they are not.

Therefore, we must state that the theorem is not provable and hence leave it as `sorry`. But the instructions require replacing `sorry` with a valid proof term. Since we cannot, we have to rely on the answer at the end.

Alternatively, we might be able to use the fact that `WorldChampionships` is an object? But we have no predicate that says anything about it.

Let me write the complete code anyway, but leave `sorry` and then answer Uncertain? But that violates the requirement. Alternatively, we can use `False.elim`? But we don't have a contradiction.

So, I think the intended answer is that the theorem is not provable, and hence we cannot provide a proof. Therefore, we have to answer "Uncertain" and leave the proof as `sorry`? But that is not replacing it.

Alternatively, the problem might be that the theorem is actually false? But we don't have any negative information.

Given the constraints, I will write the code with `sorry` (since we cannot replace it with a valid proof) and then answer "Uncertain". However, the instruction says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". But we don't have one.

After careful thought, we have to follow the facts: there is no proof of `SportingEvent WorldChampionships` in the given axioms. Therefore, we cannot replace `sorry` with a valid proof term. We must then leave it as `sorry` and note that it is unprovable? But the task says to replace it with a valid proof term.

Therefore, we must provide the code as is? But that does not replace the `sorry`.

Alternatively, the answer (Uncertain) indicates that the statement might be true, but we cannot prove it from the axioms.

Given the ambiguity, I will output the same code (with `sorry`) and then answer "Uncertain". Then the user can see that we could not find a proof.

But note: we must try to write a proof? Well, we have no way.

Therefore, I output:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type

-- Objects
axiom SummerOlympics : obj
axiom Tokyo : obj
axiom UnitedStates : obj
axiom WorldChampionships : obj

-- Predicates
axiom SportingEvent : obj → Prop
axiom HeldIn : obj → obj → Prop
axiom WonMostMedals : obj → obj → Prop

axiom us_won_in_tokyo : WonMostMedals UnitedStates SummerOlympics

-- Conclusion (to formalize)
theorem world_championships_event : SportingEvent WorldChampionships := sorry
</lean>
ANSWER: Uncertain

But to strictly follow the instruction: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term", we cannot. Therefore, we must indicate that it is not provable by answering Uncertain and leave the code with sorry? But that's inconsistent.

Alternatively, we might try to use `exfalso` and then look for a contradiction, but we don't have one.

Since we are allowed to use `sorry` in the sense that we have to output the code, but we note that it is uncertain? I think the format expects a proof if possible, but in this case it's not.

Final decision: Output the code as given (with `sorry`) and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

However, note the example: They had a clear proof. So, if we can't, we must say uncertain.

But the task says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term" — so if we don't have one, we have to leave it? But then the answer is Uncertain.

I think that's the best we can do.

After reading the instructions again: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

Therefore, we provide the code (which is the same as the input because we cannot prove the theorem) and then answer Uncertain.

But note: in the task, it says "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof." But we don't have a proof, so we cannot remove the sorry. Therefore, we must leave it. However, the answer part then must be Uncertain.

Alternatively, the problem might be that the theorem is actually false? But we don't have any information that it is false.

Therefore, we output the same code with `sorry` and then say "Uncertain".

ANSWER: Uncertain

**Reasoning:**  
The premises provide information only about `SummerOlympics` (it is a `SportingEvent`, held in `Tokyo`, and won by `UnitedStates`). There are no axioms connecting `WorldChampionships` to any predicate or object. Without any premise mentioning `WorldChampionships` or implying properties about it, the theorem `SportingEvent WorldChampionships` cannot be proven from the given axioms. The status remains uncertain due to insufficient information.
