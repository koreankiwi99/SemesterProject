STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion. We need to formalize the logical structure in Lean 4.

Steps:
1. Identify the types and predicates we need.
2. Declare the necessary types and objects.
3. Translate each premise into an axiom.
4. Formalize the conclusion as a theorem with `sorry`.

Premises:

P1: All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute.
   Translation: ∀x, (Rabbit x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x) → Cute x

P2: Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
   Translation: ∃x, Turtle x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x

P3: The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
   Translation: ∀x, SpottedNearCampus x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x)

P4: If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
   Translation: ∀x, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x

P5: All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
   Translation: ∀x, (Squirrel x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x) → Skittish x

P6: Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
   Translation: SpottedNearCampus Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

Conclusion: Rockie is a turtle or cute.
   Translation: Turtle Rockie ∨ Cute Rockie

We need to declare:
- A type for animals (let's call it `Animal`)
- Constants: Rockie : Animal
- Predicates:
  Rabbit : Animal → Prop
  Turtle : Animal → Prop
  Squirrel : Animal → Prop
  SpottedNearCampus : Animal → Prop
  Cute : Animal → Prop
  Skittish : Animal → Prop
  Calm : Animal → Prop

Now, let's write the axioms:

axiom P1 : ∀ x : Animal, Rabbit x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x → Cute x
axiom P2 : ∃ x : Animal, Turtle x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : Animal, SpottedNearCampus x → Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : Animal, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
axiom P5 : ∀ x : Animal, Squirrel x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x → Skittish x
axiom P6 : SpottedNearCampus Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

Theorem: Turtle Rockie ∨ Cute Rockie

Note: We are not proving, so we use `sorry`.

Let's write the Lean code accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion provided, here is the Lean 4 formalization:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom Rockie : Animal

axiom SpottedNearCampus : Animal → Prop
axiom Rabbit : Animal → Prop
axiom Turtle : Animal → Prop
axiom Squirrel : Animal → Prop
axiom Cute : Animal → Prop
axiom Skittish : Animal → Prop
axiom Calm : Animal → Prop

-- All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute
axiom P1 : ∀ x : Animal, Rabbit x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x → Cute x

-- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus
axiom P2 : ∃ x : Animal, Turtle x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x

-- The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels
axiom P3 : ∀ x : Animal, SpottedNearCampus x → Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x

-- If something is skittish, then it is not calm
axiom P4 : ∀ x : Animal, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x

-- All squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish
axiom P5 : ∀ x : Animal, Squirrel x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x → Skittish x

-- Rockie can be spotted near the campus and is calm
axiom P6 : SpottedNearCampus Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

-- Conclusion: Rockie is a turtle or cute
theorem conclusion : Turtle Rockie ∨ Cute Rockie := sorry
</lean>

Key elements:
1. Declared `Animal` as the base type
2. Added predicates for all properties mentioned (spotted, rabbit, turtle, etc.)
3. Formalized each premise as a separate axiom:
   - P1: Rabbit ∧ Spotted → Cute
   - P2: Existence of spotted turtles
   - P3: Spotted animals are only rabbits/squirrels
   - P4: Skittish implies not calm
   - P5: Squirrel ∧ Spotted → Skittish
   - P6: Rockie is spotted and calm
4. Formalized conclusion as disjunction (turtle or cute)


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and need to prove that Rockie is either a turtle or cute.
 The key axioms are:
   P6: Rockie is spotted near campus and calm.
   P3: The only animals spotted near campus are rabbits or squirrels.
   P1: All rabbits spotted near campus are cute.
   P5: All squirrels spotted near campus are skittish.
   P4: If something is skittish, then it is not calm.

 Since Rockie is spotted near campus (by P6), by P3, Rockie is either a rabbit or a squirrel.

 We consider two cases:
   Case 1: Rockie is a rabbit.
        Then we have Rabbit Rockie and SpottedNearCampus Rockie, so by P1, Cute Rockie.
        Hence, Turtle Rockie ∨ Cute Rockie holds (because Cute Rockie is true).

   Case 2: Rockie is a squirrel.
        Then we have Squirrel Rockie and SpottedNearCampus Rockie, so by P5, Skittish Rockie.
        Then by P4, we have ¬ Calm Rockie. But P6 says Calm Rockie. This is a contradiction.

 Therefore, in the second case we get a contradiction. So Rockie cannot be a squirrel? 
 But wait, we have a contradiction, so we can derive anything in that case? Actually, we don't need to derive anything because we have a contradiction.

 However, note that we are in a classical setting? But Lean is constructive? Actually, we can use the principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet) and then use the law of excluded middle? But note: we don't have excluded middle explicitly.

 Alternatively, we can do a proof by cases on the disjunction from P3. In the rabbit case we get cute. In the squirrel case we get a contradiction. So we can use the fact that from a contradiction we can prove anything, including the goal.

 But note: the goal is Turtle Rockie ∨ Cute Rockie. In the squirrel case we have a contradiction, so we can prove the goal by contradiction (using `False.elim`).

 However, we don't have a direct way to prove Turtle Rockie? So we must rely on the disjunction.

 Alternatively, we can use the fact that from a contradiction we can prove any disjunction? Yes, because we can prove anything.

 But note: we have two cases. In the rabbit case we have Cute Rockie, which proves the disjunction. In the squirrel case we have a contradiction, which we can use to prove the disjunction (since from false, anything follows).

 So the plan:
   We have h : Rabbit Rockie ∨ Squirrel Rockie (from P3 and P6).
   We do cases on h.
   Case 1: Rabbit Rockie. Then we apply P1 to get Cute Rockie. Then we use Or.inr to get Turtle Rockie ∨ Cute Rockie.
   Case 2: Squirrel Rockie.
        From P5 and P6 (which gives SpottedNearCampus Rockie) we get Skittish Rockie.
        Then by P4 we get ¬ Calm Rockie, i.e., Calm Rockie → False.
        But P6 also gives Calm Rockie, so we get False.
        Then we use False.elim to prove anything, in particular Turtle Rockie ∨ Cute Rockie.

 However, note that we don't have a proof of Turtle Rockie? But we don't need it because we are proving the disjunction by the right disjunct in the first case and by contradiction in the second.

 But wait: the disjunction in the goal is inclusive. We don't require both, so either way we are covered.

 Let's write the proof in Lean.

 Steps:
   Let h6 := P6, which is a pair: h6_left : SpottedNearCampus Rockie and h6_right : Calm Rockie.
   Use P3 Rockie h6_left to get: h3 : Rabbit Rockie ∨ Squirrel Rockie.
   Then do cases on h3.

   Case 1: hr : Rabbit Rockie.
        We need to show Cute Rockie: by P1 Rockie, we need to show Rabbit Rockie ∧ SpottedNearCampus Rockie.
        We have hr and h6_left, so we can form the conjunction: ⟨hr, h6_left⟩.
        Then P1 Rockie (⟨hr, h6_left⟩) gives Cute Rockie.
        Then we use Or.inr to get the disjunction.

   Case 2: hs : Squirrel Rockie.
        We have h5 : ∀ x, Squirrel x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x → Skittish x.
        Apply h5 to Rockie: we need Squirrel Rockie ∧ SpottedNearCampus Rockie -> Skittish Rockie.
        We have hs and h6_left, so we form the conjunction: ⟨hs, h6_left⟩, then we get Skittish Rockie.
        Now, P4 Rockie says: Skittish Rockie → ¬ Calm Rockie, i.e., Calm Rockie → False.
        We have h4 : Skittish Rockie (from above) and h6_right : Calm Rockie, so we get False.
        Then we use False.elim to prove the goal (since from False, anything follows).

 Therefore, we can write:

   theorem conclusion : Turtle Rockie ∨ Cute Rockie :=
     let h6 := P6
     have h_spotted : SpottedNearCampus Rockie := h6.left
     have h_calm : Calm Rockie := h6.right
     have h_rabbit_or_squirrel : Rabbit Rockie ∨ Squirrel Rockie := P3 Rockie h_spotted
     Or.elim h_rabbit_or_squirrel
       (fun hr : Rabbit Rockie =>
         have : Rabbit Rockie ∧ SpottedNearCampus Rockie := ⟨hr, h_spotted⟩
         have : Cute Rockie := P1 Rockie this
         Or.inr this
       )
       (fun hs : Squirrel Rockie =>
         have : Squirrel Rockie ∧ SpottedNearCampus Rockie := ⟨hs, h_spotted⟩
         have : Skittish Rockie := P5 Rockie this
         have : ¬ Calm Rockie := P4 Rockie this
         have : False := this h_calm
         False.elim this (Turtle Rockie ∨ Cute Rockie)
       )

 However, note that in the second branch, we have to provide the goal explicitly to False.elim? Actually, False.elim takes a proof of False and then can produce any term. So we can write:

         False.elim (this h_calm)

 But note: `this h_calm` is already a proof of False? Actually, `this` is of type ¬ Calm Rockie, which is Calm Rockie → False. Then we apply it to h_calm to get False.

 Alternatively, we can write:

         have not_calm : ¬ Calm Rockie := P4 Rockie (P5 Rockie ⟨hs, h_spotted⟩)
         not_calm h_calm   -- this is of type False

 Then we do False.elim on that.

 But note: we can also use the `absurd` tactic? However, the problem says to use proof terms or `by` tactics. Since we are allowed to use `by` followed by tactics, we can also write a tactic proof.

 However, the example provided used a term proof. But the problem says: "Use 'by' followed by tactics (no 'begin...end')" OR we can use a term proof? Actually, the example used a term proof.

 Since the problem says "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term", we can use either a term or a tactic proof? But note: the example was a term proof.

 But the instruction says: "Use 'by' followed by tactics" meaning that if we use tactics we must use `by ...`. Alternatively, we can write a term without `by`.

 However, the problem says: "Use only Lean 4 syntax" and "Use 'fun x => ...' NOT 'λ x, ...'".

 We can write a term proof as above, but note that the above term proof is a bit long. Alternatively, we can write:

   Or.elim (P3 Rockie P6.left)
     (fun hr => Or.inr (P1 Rockie ⟨hr, P6.left⟩))
     (fun hs => False.elim (P4 Rockie (P5 Rockie ⟨hs, P6.left⟩) P6.right))

 Explanation:
   In the second branch: 
        P5 Rockie ⟨hs, P6.left⟩ : Skittish Rockie
        P4 Rockie (that) : ¬ Calm Rockie, i.e., Calm Rockie → False
        Then we apply that to P6.right (which is Calm Rockie) to get False.

 So the entire proof term can be:

   Or.elim (P3 Rockie P6.left) 
        (fun hr => Or.inr (P1 Rockie (And.intro hr P6.left)))
        (fun hs => False.elim (P4 Rockie (P5 Rockie (And.intro hs P6.left)) P6.right))

 But note: we can write `⟨hr, P6.left⟩` instead of `And.intro hr P6.left`.

 Alternatively, we can use `by` tactics? The problem allows either. Since the term is a bit nested, let me write a tactic proof for clarity.

 But note: the problem says "Use 'by' followed by tactics" meaning that if we use tactics we must write `by ...`. We can do:

   theorem conclusion : Turtle Rockie ∨ Cute Rockie := by
     have hSpotted := P6.left
     have hCalm := P6.right
     have hRabbitOrSquirrel := P3 Rockie hSpotted
     cases hRabbitOrSquirrel with
     | inl hr =>
         -- Rockie is a rabbit
         apply Or.inr
         exact P1 Rockie ⟨hr, hSpotted⟩
     | inr hs =>
         -- Rockie is a squirrel
         have hSkittish : Skittish Rockie := P5 Rockie ⟨hs, hSpotted⟩
         have hNotCalm : ¬ Calm Rockie := P4 Rockie hSkittish
         contradiction   -- because hNotCalm hCalm would be a contradiction, and `contradiction` can close the goal.

 Alternatively, we can write `exact False.elim (hNotCalm hCalm)` in the last step.

 But note: the `contradiction` tactic will work because we have hCalm and hNotCalm.

 However, we are required to write the complete code. Let me choose the term proof for brevity? But the term proof is:

   Or.elim (P3 Rockie P6.left)
     (fun hr => Or.inr (P1 Rockie ⟨hr, P6.left⟩))
     (fun hs => False.elim (P4 Rockie (P5 Rockie ⟨hs, P6.left⟩) P6.right))

 But note: we can also use the fact that P6 is a conjunction. We can write:

   let ⟨hSpotted, hCalm⟩ := P6

 However, in a term we can pattern match? Actually, we can do:

   match P6 with
   | ⟨hSpotted, hCalm⟩ => 
        ... 

 But that might be longer. Alternatively, we can use projections: P6.1 and P6.2.

 So:

   Or.elim (P3 Rockie P6.1)
     (fun hr => Or.inr (P1 Rockie ⟨hr, P6.1⟩))
     (fun hs => False.elim (P4 Rockie (P5 Rockie ⟨hs, P6.1⟩) P6.2))

 This is concise.

 Let me write the entire code accordingly.

 IMPORTANT: We must not change the axioms or the theorem statement.

 Therefore, we replace the `sorry` with the above term.

 Code:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom Rockie : Animal

axiom SpottedNearCampus : Animal → Prop
axiom Rabbit : Animal → Prop
axiom Turtle : Animal → Prop
axiom Squirrel : Animal → Prop
axiom Cute : Animal → Prop
axiom Skittish : Animal → Prop
axiom Calm : Animal → Prop

-- All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute
axiom P1 : ∀ x : Animal, Rabbit x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x → Cute x

-- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus
axiom P2 : ∃ x : Animal, Turtle x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x

-- The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels
axiom P3 : ∀ x : Animal, SpottedNearCampus x → Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x

-- If something is skittish, then it is not calm
axiom P4 : ∀ x : Animal, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x

-- All squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish
axiom P5 : ∀ x : Animal, Squirrel x ∧ SpottedNearCampus x → Skittish x

-- Rockie can be spotted near the campus and is calm
axiom P6 : SpottedNearCampus Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

-- Conclusion: Rockie is a turtle or cute
theorem conclusion : Turtle Rockie ∨ Cute Rockie := 
  Or.elim (P3 Rockie P6.1)
    (fun hr => Or.inr (P1 Rockie ⟨hr, P6.1⟩))
    (fun hs => False.elim (P4 Rockie (P5 Rockie ⟨hs, P6.1⟩) P6.2))
</lean>

After the code, we must provide: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain.

But note: the theorem is proven, so the answer is True? However, the question is about the conclusion: "Rockie is a turtle or cute". We have proven it, so it is true.

But wait: we did not use P2 at all? P2 says there exists some turtle spotted near campus, but we didn't use it. And indeed, we didn't need it. So the conclusion holds without P2.

Therefore, the answer is True.

But note: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

We are to say whether the conclusion is true? Actually, the task is to prove the theorem, and we did. So the conclusion is true.

However, the context is: we are given a set of axioms and we are proving the conclusion. So the answer is True.

But note: the answer "True" here means that the conclusion follows from the axioms? Exactly.

So we write:

ANSWER: True


=== RESPONSE ===
The proof uses the axioms to derive the conclusion by case analysis. Since Rockie is spotted near campus (from P6), by P3, Rockie must be either a rabbit or a squirrel. 

- If Rockie is a rabbit, then by P1 (which requires both Rabbit and SpottedNearCampus), Rockie is cute. Thus, the disjunction holds via `Or.inr`.
- If Rockie is a squirrel, then by P5, Rockie is skittish. By P4, skittish implies not calm, but P6 states Rockie is calm, leading to a contradiction (`False`). From false, anything follows (`False.elim`), proving the disjunction.

P2 is unused but irrelevant to the proof.
