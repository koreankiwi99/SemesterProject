STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the following premises and conclusion.

Premises:
1. A podcast is not a novel.
   - We interpret this as: No podcast is a novel. So we can have:
        axiom P1 : ∀ x, Podcast x → ¬ Novel x

2. If a person is born in an American City, the person is American.
   - We need to define:
        axiom AmericanCity : obj → Prop   (for cities)
        axiom BornIn : obj → obj → Prop   (person, city)
        axiom American : obj → Prop
   Then: ∀ p, (∃ c, AmericanCity c ∧ BornIn p c) → American p
   But note: the premise says "born in American City", so we can have:
        axiom P2 : ∀ (p : obj) (c : obj), AmericanCity c → BornIn p c → American p
   However, note that "born in American City" might imply that the city is an American city.

3. If a book is a novel and it is written by a person, then the person is a novel writer.
   - We need:
        axiom Book : obj → Prop
        axiom Novel : obj → Prop
        axiom WrittenBy : obj → obj → Prop   (book, person)
        axiom NovelWriter : obj → Prop        (person)
   Then: ∀ (b : obj) (p : obj), Book b → Novel b → WrittenBy b p → NovelWriter p

4. Dani Shapiro is an American writer.
   - We take:
        constant DaniShapiro : obj
        axiom American : obj → Prop
        axiom Writer : obj → Prop
        axiom T4 : American DaniShapiro ∧ Writer DaniShapiro

5. Family History is written by Dani Shapiro.
   - Constant: FamilyHistory : obj
        axiom T5 : WrittenBy FamilyHistory DaniShapiro

6. Family History is a novel written in 2003.
   - We interpret: It is a novel and it was written in 2003. But the year 2003 is not used in the conclusion, so we can ignore the year.
        axiom T6 : Novel FamilyHistory

7. Dani Shapiro created a podcast called Family Secrets.
   - We need:
        constant FamilySecrets : obj
        axiom Podcast : obj → Prop
        axiom Created : obj → obj → Prop   (person, podcast)
        axiom T7a : Created DaniShapiro FamilySecrets
        axiom T7b : Podcast FamilySecrets

8. Boston is an American city.
   - constant Boston : obj
        axiom T8 : AmericanCity Boston

Conclusion: Dani Shapiro is a novel writer.
   - We want: NovelWriter DaniShapiro

But note: from premise 3, we have that if a book is a novel and written by a person, then the person is a novel writer.
We have that FamilyHistory is a novel (by T6) and written by DaniShapiro (by T5). However, we also need to know that FamilyHistory is a book? 
But premise 3 applies to books. So we are missing that FamilyHistory is a book.

Looking at the context: We are told that "Family History is a novel written in 2003". It is implied that it is a book? 
But note: in logic, we cannot assume. The premises do not explicitly state that novels are books? 

However, let's reexamine the premise: "If a book is a novel and it is written by a person, then the person is a novel writer."
This suggests that the novel in question must be a book. So we must treat FamilyHistory as a book? But we are not told that explicitly.

Alternatively, we might interpret that "a book that is a novel" is redundant? Actually, in the premise, it says "if a book is a novel", meaning that the object is both a book and a novel. Therefore, we must know that FamilyHistory is a book.

But premise 6 says "Family History is a novel written in 2003" — it does not say it is a book. However, in common sense, novels are books. But our logical system doesn't have that as an axiom.

This is a problem. But note: the problem states we are to formalize without proving. We might just need to have the correct types and axioms.

Alternatively, we can adjust: perhaps the concept of "novel" already implies it's a book? But the problem has a separate premise that a podcast is not a novel, which might not be about books. So let's not assume.

We must have an axiom that says FamilyHistory is a book? But the premise does not state that.

Looking back at the problem: premise 3 says "if a book is a novel and ...", so we are only allowed to use that rule on books. But we are not told whether FamilyHistory is a book. This might be an issue in the logical derivation but we are only translating.

We have two options:
  a) We assume that the novel "Family History" is a book. But that is not stated.
  b) We interpret premise 6 to include that it is a book? Or note that the context uses "book" in premise 3 and "novel" in premise 6, but without connecting novels to books.

However, in the conclusion, we wish to show that Dani Shapiro is a novel writer. We have:
  - She wrote a novel (FamilyHistory). But we need to know that it is a book? Because the rule says: if a book is a novel ... then the writer is a novel writer.

Given the ambiguity, we have to follow the premises. Since premise 6 does not say FamilyHistory is a book, we cannot use premise 3 unless we have an additional axiom. But the problem doesn't say that every novel is a book.

But note: the problem also says that Dani Shapiro created a podcast. We are told that a podcast is not a novel (so podcasts are distinct from novels). However, we don't have a direct contradiction.

We are only formalizing the given premises. Therefore, we have to hope that the missing piece (that FamilyHistory is a book) is assumed? Alternatively, we can introduce an axiom for that? But the premises don't say.

Alternatively, perhaps we don't need that? We have that Dani Shapiro is a writer and wrote a novel, and by common sense that makes her a novel writer? But our rule says for a book that is a novel. So we are stuck.

What to do? In the formalization, we should represent what is given. We are given that FamilyHistory is a novel. But we are not told it is a book. Therefore, we cannot use the premise 3 directly.

But wait: the conclusion is "Dani Shapiro is a novel writer". How else might we get that? The premise doesn't give another way. 

Therefore, to be faithful, we must formalize the given information without adding extra axioms. We will have:
  - We will declare an axiom that FamilyHistory is a book? But that's not given.

Alternatively, we can interpret that in premise 3, when we apply it to FamilyHistory, we require that FamilyHistory is a book. But since we want to conclude that DaniShapiro is a novel writer, we must have an additional axiom that every novel is a book? Or that in particular FamilyHistory is a book? That's not stated.

But note: the premises say "Dani Shapiro is an American writer" and that she wrote a novel. Also, she created a podcast. The premise about podcasts not being novels is given to distinguish podcasts and novels.

Given the complexity, and that we are not required to prove, we might proceed by introducing a constant for FamilyHistory and axiomatizing that it is a Book? But wait: the premise 6 says "Family History is a novel written in 2003". It does not say it's a book. But in the context, it is a novel, and typically novels are books. However, the problem does state that the podcast is not a novel, which implies that novels and podcasts are different, but does not say that novels are books.

We are in a tough spot. Let's try to see the entire argument:

We are to conclude: Dani Shapiro is a novel writer.

The only way to get novel writer is by premise 3: if a book is a novel and written by a person, then that person is a novel writer.

We know FamilyHistory is written by DaniShapiro and is a novel. We require that FamilyHistory is a book. But we are not told that. Therefore, without the additional assumption, we cannot. 

But perhaps we are missing a premise? The problem states only these premises.

Another perspective: the word "book" in premise 3 might be interpreted as a general term for a written work, and a novel is a type of written work. So we might assume that every novel is a book. But the premise does not state that.

To be safe, we will not add an axiom that every novel is a book. Instead, we will add:

  axiom Book_FamilyHistory : Book FamilyHistory

because without it, we cannot use premise 3. But the premise 6 does not state it.

Alternatively, the problem might have intended that a novel is a book? That would be a typical interpretation.

Given that this is a translation task, I think we are expected to represent the information as given. Therefore, we note that the premise 6 only says that FamilyHistory is a novel, not that it is a book.

Therefore, in the formalization, we must have FamilyHistory being a novel, but we do not have it being a book. Hence, we cannot use premise 3 to get that DaniShapiro is a novel writer? But then the conclusion would not follow. However, we are only formalizing the logical structure without proving. Therefore, we declare the axioms as stated and then the theorem goal.

But we must also note: the premise 3 requires a book. So in the formalization, we need the premise that FamilyHistory is a book? Or we are missing that in the premises? We are not given.

Therefore, we have a gap. However, in the original text, "Family History is a novel written in 2003" — this implies it is a book? Maybe. But in logic, we try to be precise.

Let me read again: Premise 6: "Family History is a novel written in 2003." — This does not explicitly say it is a book. But in many contexts, a novel is a kind of book.

But to be safe and to match the required conclusion, I think we must add an axiom that every novel is a book? Alternatively, we can do without it by having the given that FamilyHistory is a book. However, the premise does not say that.

Alternatively, the problem might be that "book" is a category that includes novels? We can add an axiom:

  axiom novel_is_book : ∀ x, Novel x → Book x

But that is not given in the premises.

Given the instruction to only formalize the given premises, we cannot add this. Therefore, we will have to represent the given axioms without filling the gap. This means our theorem goal will be:

  theorem goal : NovelWriter DaniShapiro := sorry   -- but we don't have the proof, so it's okay

However, we need an axiom to connect FamilyHistory to being a book? Not in the premises.

But wait, we have Dani Shapiro as a writer, and she wrote a novel, but that doesn't by the given rules make her a novel writer? Only if she wrote a book that is a novel. 

So we have two options:

  1. Assume that the problem intended that "novel" implies "book", and therefore we add the axiom (as it is standard) that every novel is a book? But then the problem doesn't state that.

  2. Or, we note that the premise "Family History is a novel" must be taken at face value and we do not know it is a book. Therefore, the theorem is not provable from the given premises? But our task is to formalize, not to prove.

Therefore, we will formalize the given information without the additional connecting axiom. We'll have:

  constant FamilyHistory : obj
  axiom T6 : Novel FamilyHistory

but we do not have that FamilyHistory is a book.

In the theorem, we are left with an unprovable goal? But our job is to formalize the premises and the conclusion.

We will stick to the given premises. We will not add any axiom that every novel is a book. We will also not add that FamilyHistory is a book because we are not told.

Therefore, in the formalization, we have:

  - DaniShapiro wrote FamilyHistory (T5) and FamilyHistory is a novel (T6). 
  - We also have that DaniShapiro wrote the podcast FamilySecrets (T7a) and that it is a podcast (T7b) and we know that no podcast is a novel (P1). But that doesn't help directly.

We do not have the necessary fact to use premise 3.

But note: the conclusion is stated, so we will write the theorem goal. However, the axioms as given do not provide that FamilyHistory is a book. Therefore, in the proof (which we are not doing) we would not be able to close the goal. But we are only to formalize.

So the plan:

  We introduce the types and predicates as needed.

  Objects: obj (like Boston, DaniShapiro, FamilyHistory, FamilySecrets)
  Predicates: 
      AmericanCity (for cities)
      BornIn (person -> city -> Prop) -- note: we have cities as objects
      American (person)
      Book (object)
      Novel (object)
      WrittenBy (book -> person -> Prop) -- note: written by relates a written work (which could be a book or a podcast) to a person? But wait, premise 5 says "Family History is written by Dani Shapiro", so we need WrittenBy to also apply to podcasts? 

But premise 3 says: "if a book is a novel and it is written by a person, then the person is a novel writer". So we have a relation WrittenBy for books. But what about podcasts? They are written by someone? Probably, but the premise doesn't say.

We are told that Family History (which is a novel) is written by Dani Shapiro, so we have:

      WrittenBy FamilyHistory DaniShapiro

But also, Dani Shapiro created a podcast called Family Secrets. Note: we have a "created" relation. Does that imply authorship? Not necessarily. And also, the premise that a podcast is not a novel doesn't tell us about written works.

Given the above, we will define:

  We'll have constants: DaniShapiro, FamilyHistory, FamilySecrets, Boston.

  Types of objects: 
      obj : Type

  Predicates:
      Novel : obj → Prop
      Podcast : obj → Prop
      Book : obj → Prop    -- needed for premise 3?
      WrittenBy : obj → obj → Prop   -- relation between any object (a written work?) and a person? 
      Created : obj → obj → Prop     -- relation between a person and a podcast? But wait, we have WrittenBy and Created as distinct?

  However, note: for Family History, we use WrittenBy. For Family Secrets, we use Created. So we have:

      WrittenBy FamilyHistory DaniShapiro
      Created DaniShapiro FamilySecrets

  We might then have an axiom relating creating a podcast to writing? Probably not, because the premise doesn't. So we keep them separate.

  Also, we have:
      American : obj → Prop
      Writer : obj → Prop   -- from premise 4: "American writer" meaning American and Writer.

  And we need for premise 2:
      BornIn : obj → obj → Prop   -- person, city
      AmericanCity : obj → Prop   -- city

  Premise 8: Boston is an American city.

  NovelWriter : obj → Prop   -- applied to persons.

  Premise 1: ∀ x, Podcast x → ¬ Novel x

  Premise 3: ∀ b p, Book b → Novel b → WrittenBy b p → NovelWriter p

  We also have from premise 6 that FamilyHistory is a novel. But note, we are not told that it is a book. Therefore, we cannot apply premise 3 to get that DaniShapiro is a novel writer. But we are to formalize the goal as:

      theorem goal : NovelWriter DaniShapiro := sorry

  However, we might have another problem: we don't require FamilyHistory being a book? So the formalization is incomplete?

  We have two choices:

    Option 1: Add an axiom that FamilyHistory is a book. But it's not stated.

    Option 2: Leave it as is, and note that the formalization reflects the gap.

  Given our instructions, we are to formalize the given premises. Therefore, we choose Option 2.

But wait: perhaps the problem implies that a novel is a type of book? Without an explicit premise, we cannot assume that. Therefore, we formalize without it.

Therefore, we will have:

  axiom Book : obj → Prop   # to be used in premise 3
  # but we don't have an axiom saying that FamilyHistory is a book.

So we have:

  constant DaniShapiro     : obj
  constant FamilyHistory   : obj
  constant FamilySecrets   : obj
  constant Boston          : obj

  axiom Podcast           : obj → Prop
  axiom Novel            : obj → Prop
  axiom Book             : obj → Prop
  axiom WrittenBy        : obj → obj → Prop
  axiom Created          : obj → obj → Prop
  axiom AmericanCity     : obj → Prop
  axiom BornIn           : obj → obj → Prop
  axiom American         : obj → Prop
  axiom Writer           : obj → Prop
  axiom NovelWriter      : obj → Prop

  # Premise 1: A podcast is not a novel.
  axiom P1 : ∀ x, Podcast x → ¬ Novel x

  # Premise 2: If a person is born in American City, the person is American.
  # We interpret: for any person and any city that is an American city, if the person is born in that city then the person is American.
  axiom P2 : ∀ p c, AmericanCity c → BornIn p c → American p

  # Premise 3: If a book is a novel and it is written by a person, then the person is a novel writer.
  axiom P3 : ∀ b p, Book b → Novel b → WrittenBy b p → NovelWriter p

  # Premise 4: Dani Shapiro is an American writer.
  axiom P4 : American DaniShapiro ∧ Writer DaniShapiro

  # Premise 5: Family History is written by Dani Shapiro.
  axiom P5 : WrittenBy FamilyHistory DaniShapiro

  # Premise 6: Family History is a novel written in 2003. 
  # We ignore the year because it doesn't play a role in the conclusion.
  axiom P6 : Novel FamilyHistory

  # Premise 7: Dani Shapiro created a podcast called Family Secrets.
  # We have two parts: FamilySecrets is a podcast, and it was created by DaniShapiro.
  axiom P7a : Created DaniShapiro FamilySecrets
  axiom P7b : Podcast FamilySecrets

  # Premise 8: Boston is an American city.
  axiom P8 : AmericanCity Boston

  # Conclusion: Dani Shapiro is a novel writer.
  theorem goal : NovelWriter DaniShapiro := sorry

But note: we are missing an axiom for FamilyHistory being a book. Without it, we cannot apply P3. However, we have the obligation to formalize the given premises, and that premise is missing. Therefore, we leave it as is.

Alternatively, we might note that the problem states "Family History is a novel written in 2003", implying it is a book? And that is standard? But again, not explicit.

Given the problem statement, we must formalize without adding extra axioms. So we do not add that FamilyHistory is a book.

Therefore, the code as below.

Note: We do not have a relation between "Writer" and anything else. We also do not have anything about the relation between "Created" and "WrittenBy". And we do not have that novels are books.

This formalization reflects exactly the premises and the conclusion.

But note: in the premise 4, Dani Shapiro is a writer. And she wrote a novel. But that alone does not make her a novel writer by the given rule? Only if she wrote a book that is a novel.

So we are consistent.

Let's code accordingly.

One more thing: the type of BornIn? We have:
  BornIn (person : obj) (city : obj) : Prop

Similarly, WrittenBy (work : obj) (author : obj) : Prop.

We also have constants for the objects: DaniShapiro, FamilyHistory, FamilySecrets, Boston.

We'll now code.


=== RESPONSE ===
Below is the formalization of the given premises and conclusion in Lean 4. The code includes type declarations for objects, predicates, and all premises as axioms. The theorem at the end represents the conclusion to be proven, using `sorry` as a placeholder for the proof.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type

-- Constants for specific objects
axiom Podcast : obj → Prop
axiom Novel : obj → Prop
axiom Book : obj → Prop
axiom WrittenBy : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Created : obj → obj → Prop
axiom AmericanCity : obj → Prop
axiom BornIn : obj → obj → Prop
axiom American : obj → Prop
axiom Writer : obj → Prop
axiom NovelWriter : obj → Prop

axiom DaniShapiro : obj
axiom FamilyHistory : obj
axiom FamilySecrets : obj
axiom Boston : obj

-- Premise 1: No podcast is a novel
axiom P1 : ∀ x, Podcast x → ¬ Novel x

-- Premise 2: If born in an American city, then American
axiom P2 : ∀ (p c : obj), AmericanCity c → BornIn p c → American p

-- Premise 3: Writers of books that are novels are novel writers
axiom P3 : ∀ (b p : obj), Book b → Novel b → WrittenBy b p → NovelWriter p

-- Premise 4: Dani Shapiro is an American writer
axiom P4 : American DaniShapiro ∧ Writer DaniShapiro

-- Premise 5: Family History is written by Dani Shapiro
axiom P5 : WrittenBy FamilyHistory DaniShapiro

-- Premise 6: Family History is a novel (year 2003 ignored)
axiom P6 : Novel FamilyHistory

-- Premise 7: Dani Shapiro created the podcast "Family Secrets"
axiom P7a : Created DaniShapiro FamilySecrets
axiom P7b : Podcast FamilySecrets

-- Premise 8: Boston is an American city
axiom P8 : AmericanCity Boston

-- Conclusion: Dani Shapiro is a novel writer (to be proven)
theorem goal : NovelWriter DaniShapiro := sorry
</lean>

Note: Formalization fully reflects the premises:
- `FamilyHistory` is declared as a `Novel` but not as a `Book` (premise 6 omits book status).
- `WrittenBy` and `Created` are separate relations.
- `Book`, `Novel`, and `Podcast` are distinct predicates.
- Year `2003` is irrelevant for the conclusion and thus omitted.
- The theorem uses `sorry` since proving is not required.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and need to prove that DaniShapiro is a novel writer (NovelWriter DaniShapiro).

 Let's break down the premises:

 P1: No podcast is a novel. (∀ x, Podcast x → ¬ Novel x)
 P2: If a person is born in an American city, then that person is American.
 P3: If a book is a novel and is written by a person, then that person is a novel writer.
     (∀ (b p : obj), Book b → Novel b → WrittenBy b p → NovelWriter p)

 P4: DaniShapiro is American and is a writer.
 P5: FamilyHistory is written by DaniShapiro.
 P6: FamilyHistory is a novel.

 P7: Dani Shapiro created the podcast "Family Secrets", and FamilySecrets is a podcast.
 P8: Boston is an American city.

 We are to prove: NovelWriter DaniShapiro.

 How can we get that? Looking at P3, we see that if we have a book b that is a novel and written by DaniShapiro, then DaniShapiro is a novel writer.

 We are given that FamilyHistory is a novel (P6) and is written by DaniShapiro (P5). But we are missing that FamilyHistory is a book.

 However, note that in the premises, we have no direct statement that FamilyHistory is a book. But the conclusion requires that.

 Let me reexamine the premises: 
   We have no axiom that states that if something is a novel then it is a book. In fact, we have a separate constant for Book and Novel.

 The problem: We have FamilyHistory as a novel (P6) and written by DaniShapiro (P5), but P3 requires that the object be a book. 

 Is there any premise that connects novels to books? The premises do not state that every novel is a book.

 Therefore, we cannot use P3 to conclude that DaniShapiro is a novel writer because we don't know that FamilyHistory is a book.

 Moreover, we have:
   P1: Podcasts are not novels. 
   P7b tells us that FamilySecrets is a podcast. So by P1, FamilySecrets is not a novel.

 But that doesn't help with FamilyHistory.

 Also, note that even though we know DaniShapiro is a writer (from P4) and that she wrote FamilyHistory (which is a novel), without knowing that FamilyHistory is a book, we cannot apply P3.

 The problem: There is no axiom that says novels are books.

 Therefore, we cannot prove the goal.

 But let's check if there is an alternative approach? 

 The premises that mention Book are only in P3. We have no other premise that uses Book. And we have no premise that says that FamilyHistory is a book.

 Given the information, we have to conclude that the proof is impossible.

 However, note: The problem says "Writers of books that are novels are novel writers". It does not say that only books can be novels. So it is possible that there are novels that are not books? 

 Since we don't have the axiom that every novel is a book, we cannot use FamilyHistory in P3.

 We must therefore return the code with the proof replaced by a proof of False (if we see a contradiction?) or fail? 

 But note: the theorem goal is to prove NovelWriter DaniShapiro, and we see no way. However, is there a contradiction? 

 Let me see if we can derive a contradiction? 

 We are told:
   DaniShapiro created the podcast FamilySecrets. But we don't have an axiom that says that if you create a podcast then you wrote it? 
   The premises are separate: WrittenBy for FamilyHistory and Created for FamilySecrets. 

 So no contradiction.

 Therefore, the goal cannot be proved.

 But the problem asks to replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term. However, since we cannot prove it, we must admit that the attempt fails.

 However, wait: perhaps the problem expects us to use the available information and note the gap? But that's not how theorem proving in Lean works. Without the necessary fact, we cannot complete the proof.

 Since the problem states: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'", and we are to provide the proof, we must either prove it or fail.

 But note: we are not to modify the axioms. Therefore, we cannot add an axiom.

 Given the premises, we cannot prove NovelWriter DaniShapiro because we do not know that FamilyHistory is a book.

 Therefore, we must conclude that the proof is not possible and the formula is not provable.

 However, how does that match with the premises we have?

 Let me write the steps we can do:

   We have:
      Novel FamilyHistory                     [P6]
      WrittenBy FamilyHistory DaniShapiro     [P5]

   To use P3, we require:
      Book FamilyHistory

   But this is missing.

   What else? 
      We also know that DaniShapiro is a writer (from P4: American DaniShapiro ∧ Writer DaniShapiro). 
      So Writer DaniShapiro is given.

   But that doesn't help. 

   Additionally, we know about American and Boston, but that seems independent.

   We also know about FamilySecrets being a podcast and created by DaniShapiro, but again that doesn't give us anything about novels or books.

   So we cannot prove NovelWriter DaniShapiro.

 Therefore, we cannot complete the proof.

 But the instructions say: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." 

 If we cannot complete the proof, then the original claim that the goal is true might be false? But note: in logic, it is possible that the goal actually follows from the premises? 

 Let me think again about P3: 

     ∀ (b p : obj), Book b → Novel b → WrittenBy b p → NovelWriter p

   This can be read as: 
      If there exists a novel that is a book and written by p, then p is a novel writer.

   But note: we don't know if FamilyHistory is a book. However, is it possible that by the nature of the definitions we can assume it? The problem does not give that.

   Alternatively, maybe the fact that it is called "Family History" and written by a writer and a novel implies that it is a book? But that is not formalized.

   So without the premise that every novel is a book (or that FamilyHistory is a book), we cannot proceed.

 Since we are in a formal system, and we lack the necessary axiom, the proof cannot be completed.

 How to express that in Lean? Currently, we are stuck. Therefore, perhaps the intended proof was to assume that FamilyHistory is a book? But that assumption is not present.

 Given the problem statement, we must be honest: we cannot construct a proof.

 But note: in the example, if we had the necessary axioms, the proof was provided. In this case, the necessary axiom is missing.

 Therefore, I will have to report that we cannot prove the goal.

 However, the problem also says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 The answer in this case is that the conclusion cannot be proven (so it is false that the conclusion follows?) or "Uncertain" meaning under the given premises we cannot decide.

 According to the problem, we must wrap the complete code in <lean> tags. But we cannot complete the proof.

 What to do?

 We have two options:

 Option 1: Abort the proof by marking it as sorry. But the task is to replace sorry.

 Option 2: Attempt to see if there is a contradiction? But we don't have any.

 After careful thought, I see that we cannot prove the theorem. The correct answer is that the goal is not provable (so we return the code unchanged with sorry? But that's not allowed) — but the instruction says "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". 

 However, we don't have a valid proof term.

 Therefore, we must admit that the theorem cannot be proved. But note: in the problem, we are given "validated" axioms. The validation in Stage 1 must have passed? Then the problem expects a proof.

 But wait: what if we actually do not require that the object be a book? Look at P3: 

   P3: ∀ (b p : obj), Book b → Novel b → WrittenBy b p → NovelWriter p

   The variable b must be a book that is a novel. So without Book FamilyHistory, we cannot apply P3.

 I think there has been a premise missing. Therefore, we must answer that the theorem does not hold.

 However, note: we can use the fact that DaniShapiro is a writer and that she wrote a novel ... but that does not make her a novel writer by our definitions? The P3 rule is the only way to become a novel writer? 

 Without additional axioms, yes.

 Given the above, I will have to say that the goal is not provable. So we will leave the proof as sorry? That is not allowed. 

 Alternatively, we can create a false step: but that would be invalid.

 Therefore, I must conclude that the proof is impossible. So the answer is false? meaning the conclusion does not follow? 

 According to the format, after the code we must say True/False/Uncertain. The question is: can we prove the goal? We cannot, so the conclusion that the goal is provable is false? But the goal given is a theorem. 

 Actually, the problem asks for whether the conclusion (that Dani Shapiro is a novel writer) follows from the premises? 

 After analysis: not enough, because we are missing that FamilyHistory is a book.

 So the reasoning is that if the premises are true then the conclusion may still be false? For instance, FamilyHistory might be a novel that is not a book (e.g., a novella? or a manuscript that is not published as a book?) ... then the rule P3 would not apply.

 Therefore, we cannot conclude the goal.

 Hence, the answer is: the goal is not a logical consequence of the premises, and so we cannot prove it. 

 How to express this in the context of the problem? The instruction says: we are a theorem prover. We are to give a complete proof if we can. If we cannot, we must not make one up.

 But the problem is that this particular task fails.

 However, the user instruction: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'" — and we are to replace sorry. But we cannot prove it.

 Therefore, I decide to output the code with the use of `sorry` but then explain that we cannot? That is not acceptable. 

 Alternatively, is there a way we can prove it by assuming that the novel mentioned is a book? But the axioms do not state that.

 After all, I notice that the axiom P3 is about books that are also novels. So unless an object has both the properties of being a Book and a Novel, then the writer becomes a NovelWriter.

 We are only told that FamilyHistory is a Novel (by P6). We are not told that it is a Book.

 So we are stuck.

 Therefore, I must write the proof as: we cannot do it. So the answer after the code is "False", meaning the theorem as stated is not provable? But note: the problem might have intended that "novel" implies "book", but it is not stated.

 Actually, the answer format "True/False/Uncertain" is probably about the validity of the conclusion given the premises? 

 We are not asked to provide a truth value for the goal, but rather for the entire problem: does the goal follow? 

 So:

   True: if the conclusion logically follows
   False: if the conclusion does not follow
   Uncertain: if we cannot decide with the given information

 We can decide: the conclusion does not follow. Therefore, False.

 How to report the code? Since we cannot provide a proof, we must return the code with 'sorry'. But the instruction says to replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term. 

 We cannot, so we return the same code? But that violates the instruction.

 Alternatively, we try to provide a proof that uses an assumption that is not present? But that is not allowed.

 I think there might be a mistake in the premises. But as per the problem, we are to use only the given axioms.

 Therefore, I have to leave it as sorry, but I'll mark the answer as False.

 However, what if we try to derive a contradiction? We cannot.

 Given all this, I decide to output the code again, but with the proof not done (i.e., with sorry) and then answer False? But then I did not replace sorry.

 I am in a dilemma.

 Let me see if there is a creative way?

   We know that DaniShapiro is a writer (P4) and that she wrote FamilyHistory (P5) which is a novel (P6). 

   The rule for novel writers (P3) is only for books that are novels. We might consider that a novel is by definition a kind of book? But the problem does not state that.

   The only way to get NovelWriter is through P3. Therefore, without a book that is a novel by DaniShapiro, we cannot become NovelWriter.

   Since we have only one novel by her (FamilyHistory) and we are not told it is a book, we have no way.

   So the proof cannot be done.

 Therefore, I think the answer should be False meaning that the conclusion does not follow.

 But the problem says: "Provide the complete code with proof". Since I cannot provide a proof, I will leave sorry and then mark as False? That is inconsistent.

 Alternatively, we can try to prove it by applying P3 even if we don't have the book evidence? That would be a type error. For instance:

   theorem goal : NovelWriter DaniShapiro := P3 FamilyHistory DaniShapiro ?_ P6 P5

   but then we are missing the proof of 'Book FamilyHistory'. 

   And we have nothing to fill in for that.

 So we cannot even write a partial proof.

 Therefore, I feel that the only honest way is to return the code as is and then answer False.

 But the instruction says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." — and we don't have one.

 After re‐reading the premises: note that there is no axiom that states that novels are books. And in fact there is no statement that FamilyHistory is a book.

 Therefore, it is impossible. So we return:

   <lean>
   ... the same code ...
   theorem goal : NovelWriter DaniShapiro := sorry   -- we cannot replace sorry
   </lean>

   but that fails to replace.

 What if we try to use Classical.choice or something to "invent" the missing fact? But that would be invalid.

 Given the above, I have to admit failure.

 However, another thought: 
   Premises P5 and P6 are about FamilyHistory. We have no other object that is a novel and written by DaniShapiro.

   The only other object is FamilySecrets, but that is a podcast, not a novel (by P1 and P7b: Podcast FamilySecrets → ¬ Novel FamilySecrets). 

   Therefore, we have only one candidate but it is missing the Book property.

   Thus, we cannot conclude.

 The answer: False. The conclusion does not follow.

 But how to write that? We are unable to write a proof. Therefore, we leave the proof as sorry? That is not acceptable per the task.

 Alternatively, we can output an invalid proof? But that's not acceptable.

 Therefore, after careful thought, I decide to return the code and mark it as False. I will leave the term as sorry, because I have no other choice.

 However, the problem says: "CRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax." — and sorry is allowed for incomplete proof? But the task is to replace it.

 So the correct action is to abstain: we go with:

   <lean>
   ... same code ...

   theorem goal : NovelWriter DaniShapiro :=
   -- Attempt:
   -- We need Book FamilyHistory to apply P3 with FamilyHistory, DaniShapiro.
   -- Since we don't have it, we cannot complete.
   sorry
   </lean>

   But that is not a valid proof.

 Alternatively, we note that we can use a contradiction if we can prove that FamilyHistory is both a novel and not a novel? But we can't.

 I'm stuck.

 Finally, I will assume that the problem's validation in Stage 1 included the fact that we have a proof? or not.

 Since I cannot find a proof, I report that the goal is not provable, and output the code with sorry.

 But then: what is the answer to be placed at the end? "False"

 However, the instruction says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 For that, we put: ANSWER: False   meaning the desired conclusion cannot be proved (because it's not a logical consequence).

 Therefore:

   <lean>
   ... the given axioms ...
   theorem goal : NovelWriter DaniShapiro := sorry
   </lean>

   and then: ANSWER: False

 But wait, that means that the original task to replace sorry has not been done? 

 However, the instruction does not say what to do in unprovable cases. So we have to do our best.

 But note: the problem said "a theorem prover", so if the theorem is not valid, we don't have a proof.

 Therefore, that's the best we can do.

 But there is a third option: perhaps we are allowed to use `?` in place of a proof that we cannot do? That is, we can create a skeleton that explicitly says we need a proof of `Book FamilyHistory`?

   theorem goal : NovelWriter DaniShapiro := 
     P3 FamilyHistory DaniShapiro 
        (sorry)  -- Placeholder for proof that FamilyHistory is a book.
        P6 P5

   Then we have a partial proof? 

   But then, we're not allowed to leave sorry anywhere.

 Therefore, I cannot do that.

 I will, as a last resort, leave the 'sorry' in goal unchanged, because I cannot replace it with a complete proof. But then my code has sorry, so it's not a valid proof.

 The answer: False

 I think the problem statement is flawed. But that's not for me to decide.

 Given the above, I write:

   <lean>
   ... same axioms ...

   theorem goal : NovelWriter DaniShapiro := sorry   -- [unprovable without an axiom that FamilyHistory is a book]
   </lean>

   ANSWER: False

 However, the problem says not to modify the theorem statement or the axioms. My added comment might be a modification? So I leave it without comment.

 So final output:

   ANSWER: False

 But then, the user might expect a proof.

 I yield to the design.

 The answer False means that the goal does not follow from the premises.


=== RESPONSE ===
After analyzing the provided premises, the goal `NovelWriter DaniShapiro` cannot be proven. Here's why:

1. Premise 3 (`P3`) requires three conditions to prove someone is a novel writer:
   - `b` must be a book (`Book b`)
   - `b` is a novel (`Novel b`)
   - `b` is written by the person (`WrittenBy b p`)

2. We have `Novel FamilyHistory` (`P6`) and `WrittenBy FamilyHistory DaniShapiro` (`P5`), satisfying the last two conditions.

3. However, there is **no premise stating that novels are books**, nor any direct proof that `FamilyHistory` is a book (`Book FamilyHistory`).

4. Premises about podcasts (`P1`, `P7b`), American citizenship (`P2`, `P4`, `P8`), and creation of content (`P7a`) do not provide the missing book property.

Since the critical link between novels and books is missing from the axioms, the proof term cannot be constructed. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.
