STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are dealing with predicates and individuals.
 We have:
   - Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
     This translates to: There exists an x such that x is a professional basketball player and x is not an American national.
   - All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
   - If someone can do jump shots, then they leap straight into the air.
   - If someone leaps straight into the air, then they activate their leg muscles.
   - Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

 Conclusion: Yuri is not an American professional basketball player.

 We need to define:
   - A type for individuals (let's call it `obj` as in the example, but note we have a specific individual: Yuri).
   - Predicates:
        `ProfessionalBasketballPlayer : obj → Prop`
        `American : obj → Prop`   (meaning American national)
        `CanDoJumpShots : obj → Prop`
        `LeapStraightIntoAir : obj → Prop`
        `ActivateLegMuscles : obj → Prop`
   - Constant: `Yuri : obj`

 However, note: the conclusion says "Yuri is not an American professional basketball player", meaning:
        ¬ (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri)

 But note: from the premises we have that there exists a professional basketball player who is not American, but that doesn't directly affect Yuri.

 The argument will be:
   - By contradiction, assume Yuri is a professional basketball player and American? But note the conclusion does not require both.
   However, the conclusion says he is not an *American professional basketball player*. Let us read it as: It is not the case that Yuri is both a professional basketball player and American? 
   But actually, the problem does not say that. The problem is about "American professional basketball player", which might be intended as a term that combines both attributes.

   Alternatively, we might break it: Yuri is not a professional basketball player OR not American? But the conclusion is stated as a negative of being an American professional basketball player.

   We interpret the conclusion as: ¬ (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri)

   However, note that the premises do not require that American professional basketball players are a subset? We have some non-American professionals, but that doesn't say anything about Yuri.

   The key chain of reasoning:

   1. All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
   2. If someone can do jump shots, then they leap straight.
   3. If they leap straight, then they activate leg muscles.

   Therefore, if Yuri were a professional basketball player, then he would activate his leg muscles.

   But we are told that Yuri does not activate his leg muscles. Therefore, Yuri cannot be a professional basketball player.

   So actually, we get that Yuri is not a professional basketball player. Then, regardless of whether he is American, the conjunction (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri) is false.

   Therefore, the conclusion holds because the first part (being a professional basketball player) fails.

   However, note the conclusion says "Yuri is not an American professional basketball player", which we interpret as the negation of (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri and American Yuri). So it holds because the first conjunct fails.

   But note: we are not told that Yuri is American or not. We don't need to, because we already have that he isn't a professional.

   Therefore, we can formalize without having to use the first premise about some players not being American? Actually, the first premise might not be necessary for this argument about Yuri.

   However, the problem asks to formalize the given premises and the conclusion. So we must include all premises, even if not all are used in the proof.

   Now, on formalizing:

   Premises:

   P1: ∃ x, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x ∧ ¬ American x
   P2: ∀ x, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x → CanDoJumpShots x
   P3: ∀ x, CanDoJumpShots x → LeapStraightIntoAir x
   P4: ∀ x, LeapStraightIntoAir x → ActivateLegMuscles x
   P5: ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri

   Conclusion: ¬ (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri)

   However, note: the problem calls for the conclusion that Yuri is not an American professional basketball player. But in reality, we don't know if American is part of the problem? The chain of reasoning only gives that Yuri isn't a professional basketball player. But the conclusion is stated in a compounded way.

   But note: the problem says to formalize the conclusion as given: "Yuri is not an American professional basketball player".

   So we take that to mean: it is not the case that Yuri is both a professional basketball player and American.

   However, wait: what is an "American professional basketball player"? It could also be interpreted as a professional basketball player who is American. So the conclusion is: not (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri and American Yuri).

   This is safe.

   But note: with the reasoning chain we get that Yuri is not a professional basketball player, so the conjunction fails. However, if we had an additional step that American professional basketball players are professional basketball players? Obviously that holds.

   In Lean:

   We define:
     axiom obj : Type
     axiom Yuri : obj
     axiom ProfessionalBasketballPlayer : obj → Prop
     axiom American : obj → Prop
     axiom CanDoJumpShots : obj → Prop
     axiom LeapStraightIntoAir : obj → Prop
     axiom ActivateLegMuscles : obj → Prop

   Premises:
     axiom P1 : ∃ x, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x ∧ ¬ American x
     axiom P2 : ∀ x, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x → CanDoJumpShots x
     axiom P3 : ∀ x, CanDoJumpShots x → LeapStraightIntoAir x
     axiom P4 : ∀ x, LeapStraightIntoAir x → ActivateLegMuscles x
     axiom P5 : ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri

   Theorem:
     theorem goal : ¬ (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri) := ...   (and then we use `sorry`)

   However, note that the conclusion does not require the first premise (P1). But since the premise is provided, we include it.

   But wait: the premise P1 might be used in the proof? Actually, in the proof we have:

     We want to show: ¬ (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri)

     We can break this into: if we assume (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri), then we get a contradiction.

     How?
        From ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri and P2: CanDoJumpShots Yuri.
        Then P3: LeapStraightIntoAir Yuri.
        Then P4: ActivateLegMuscles Yuri.
        But P5: ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri -> contradiction.

     So we don't need P1 at all. The conclusion follows without it.

     But the problem says to formalize ALL the premises. So we include it.

   Therefore, we write:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Yuri : obj
axiom ProfessionalBasketballPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom American : obj → Prop
axiom CanDoJumpShots : obj → Prop
axiom LeapStraightIntoAir : obj → Prop
axiom ActivateLegMuscles : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∃ x, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x ∧ ¬ American x
axiom P2 : ∀ x, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x → CanDoJumpShots x
axiom P3 : ∀ x, CanDoJumpShots x → LeapStraightIntoAir x
axiom P4 : ∀ x, LeapStraightIntoAir x → ActivateLegMuscles x
axiom P5 : ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri

theorem goal : ¬ (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri) := sorry
</lean>


=== RESPONSE ===
<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Yuri : obj
axiom ProfessionalBasketballPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom American : obj → Prop
axiom CanDoJumpShots : obj → Prop
axiom LeapStraightIntoAir : obj → Prop
axiom ActivateLegMuscles : obj → Prop

axiom premise1 : ∃ x, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x ∧ ¬ American x
axiom premise2 : ∀ x, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x → CanDoJumpShots x
axiom premise3 : ∀ x, CanDoJumpShots x → LeapStraightIntoAir x
axiom premise4 : ∀ x, LeapStraightIntoAir x → ActivateLegMuscles x
axiom premise5 : ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri

theorem goal : ¬ (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri) := sorry
</lean>

Explanation of formalization:

1. Basic setup:
   - `obj` represents the type of individuals
   - `Yuri` is a specific individual constant

2. Predicates for player properties:
   - `ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x`: x is a pro basketball player
   - `American x`: x is an American national
   - `CanDoJumpShots x`: x can perform jump shots
   - `LeapStraightIntoAir x`: x leaps straight upward
   - `ActivateLegMuscles x`: x activates leg muscles

3. Premises:
   - `premise1`: Some players aren't American (∃ quantifier)
   - `premise2`: All players can do jump shots (universal quantifier →)
   - `premise3`: Jump shots imply leaping upward (universal →)
   - `premise4`: Leaping implies muscle activation (universal →)
   - `premise5`: Yuri doesn't activate leg muscles (¬)

4. Conclusion:
   - `goal`: Formalizes "Yuri isn't an American pro player" as negation of (player ∧ American)

Note: The theorem uses `sorry` as a placeholder for proof, maintaining consistent naming from premises. The chain of implications (player → jump → leap → activate) combined with premise5 will ultimately disprove Yuri being a basketball player, making the conjunction false.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and need to prove that Yuri is not both a ProfessionalBasketballPlayer and American.

 Steps:
 1. We have premise1: there exists some x that is a ProfessionalBasketballPlayer and not American.
    However, note that we are not forced to use this premise because we are proving a negation of a conjunction.

 2. We can instead assume the opposite: assume that (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri) holds, and then derive a contradiction.

 3. From the assumption, we have:
    - ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri
    - American Yuri

 4. Using premise2: 
    ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri → CanDoJumpShots Yuri
    So we get CanDoJumpShots Yuri.

 5. Using premise3:
    CanDoJumpShots Yuri → LeapStraightIntoAir Yuri
    So we get LeapStraightIntoAir Yuri.

 6. Using premise4:
    LeapStraightIntoAir Yuri → ActivateLegMuscles Yuri
    So we get ActivateLegMuscles Yuri.

 7. But premise5 says ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri.

 8. Therefore, we have ActivateLegMuscles Yuri and ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri, which is a contradiction.

 Hence, our assumption (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri) must be false.

 However, note that we did not use premise1. This is because we are only concerned with Yuri, and we have enough to derive a contradiction without it.

 Therefore, we can prove the theorem by assuming the conjunction and deriving a contradiction.

 Proof structure in Lean:

 We use `by` tactics mode.

 Let's write:

   theorem goal : ¬ (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri) :=
   by
     intro h  -- h is the assumption that (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri)
     let ⟨hP, hA⟩ := h  -- hP: ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri, hA: American Yuri (though hA is not used)

     -- Now we use the premises to derive ActivateLegMuscles Yuri
     have h1 := premise2 Yuri hP  -- CanDoJumpShots Yuri
     have h2 := premise3 Yuri h1  -- LeapStraightIntoAir Yuri
     have h3 := premise4 Yuri h2  -- ActivateLegMuscles Yuri

     -- But we know from premise5 that ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri
     exact premise5 h3

 However, note that we did not use the American part. This is okay because the contradiction arises from the chain of implications and premise5.

 Alternatively, we can write a term proof without tactics:

   theorem goal : ¬ (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri) :=
     fun h => 
       let hP := h.1
       let hA := h.2   -- unused
       premise5 (premise4 Yuri (premise3 Yuri (premise2 Yuri hP)))

 But note: the theorem does not require the American part to be used. We only need the ProfessionalBasketballPlayer part to derive the contradiction.

 However, the theorem is to prove that the conjunction is false. It might be that Yuri is American but not a ProfessionalBasketballPlayer? 
 But our proof shows that if he is a ProfessionalBasketballPlayer then we get a contradiction (regardless of being American). Therefore, the conjunction must be false.

 Since we have a complete proof without using premise1, we can ignore it.

 Therefore, we write:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Yuri : obj
axiom ProfessionalBasketballPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom American : obj → Prop
axiom CanDoJumpShots : obj → Prop
axiom LeapStraightIntoAir : obj → Prop
axiom ActivateLegMuscles : obj → Prop

axiom premise1 : ∃ x, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x ∧ ¬ American x
axiom premise2 : ∀ x, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x → CanDoJumpShots x
axiom premise3 : ∀ x, CanDoJumpShots x → LeapStraightIntoAir x
axiom premise4 : ∀ x, LeapStraightIntoAir x → ActivateLegMuscles x
axiom premise5 : ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri

theorem goal : ¬ (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri) := 
  fun h => 
    let hP := h.1
    let hA := h.2
    premise5 (premise4 Yuri (premise3 Yuri (premise2 Yuri hP)))
</lean>

But note: the above term proof uses `h.1` and `h.2` for the conjunction. Alternatively, we can use pattern matching in the lambda:

  fun ⟨hP, hA⟩ => premise5 (premise4 Yuri (premise3 Yuri (premise2 Yuri hP)))

However, in the requirement we are to use Lean 4 syntax and the example used `fun x => ...`. Also, pattern matching in the lambda is allowed.

But note: the example used tactics? Actually, the example used a term. We can use either.

I'll use the term proof with pattern matching.

But wait: the requirement says "Use 'fun x => ...'", and pattern matching in the lambda is a form of that.

Alternatively, we can write without pattern matching:

  fun h => premise5 (premise4 Yuri (premise3 Yuri (premise2 Yuri h.1)))

But let me check: `h.1` is the first projection of the conjunction.

However, note that the theorem statement is exactly as given.

But there is a caveat: we did not use premise1. Is that okay? Yes, because we have a proof without it.

However, note that premise1 might be necessary for the overall argument? Actually, in this proof we don't need it because we are focusing on Yuri and we have premise5 about Yuri.

But the problem is: we are proving that Yuri is not both a ProfessionalBasketballPlayer and American. We have shown that if he is a ProfessionalBasketballPlayer then we get a contradiction (because then ActivateLegMuscles Yuri would hold, contradicting premise5). Therefore, he cannot be a ProfessionalBasketballPlayer. Hence, the conjunction is false.

So the proof is valid.

Therefore, we output the complete code.

After the code, we are to provide an answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain.

But note: the task is to replace the sorry and provide the code. The question at the end is about the truth value of the theorem? Actually, the theorem is proven, so it is true.

But the instruction says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

In the context of the theorem, we have proven it, so ANSWER: True.

However, note that the theorem is a negation: ¬ (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri). And we have proven it. So the statement is true.

But the answer we are to give is about the theorem's truth? Since we proved it, it is true.

Alternatively, the answer might be about the original claim? But the theorem is the goal.

So we say ANSWER: True.

But note: the problem says "Provide the complete code with proof" and then "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain".

We'll write:

ANSWER: True

However, let me double-check: is there any doubt? The proof does not use premise1, but that is okay because we don't need it. The other premises are sufficient to show that if Yuri is a ProfessionalBasketballPlayer then we get a contradiction. Therefore, the conjunction must be false.

So the theorem is true.
