STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the following:

Premises:
1. Jane does not like any animals that bark.
   Translation: For all x, if x is an animal that barks, then Jane does not like x.

2. All dogs are animals that bark.
   Translation: For all x, if x is a dog, then x is an animal that barks.

3. Jane likes all animals that jump.
   Translation: For all x, if x is an animal that jumps, then Jane likes x.

4. If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
   Translation: For all x (if x is an animal, then: if x has legs then x jumps)

   But note: the premise is about animals. We can make the domain about animals or have a type for animals.
   We'll have a type for animals? Actually, the problem says "KiKi is an animal", so let's have a type `Animal`.

   Alternatively, we can have a type `U` (universe) and then have predicates:
     - `Animal : U → Prop`
     - `Barks : U → Prop`
   But note the premises say "animals that bark", so we can use:

   However, the problem says: "All dogs are animals that bark." meaning dogs are a subtype of animals? We can do:

   Alternatively, we can have two types: one for animals and one for everything? But the premises talk about animals and dogs.

   Let's set:
     - We'll have a type `Ani` for animals. Then dogs are a subset of animals? Or we can have a predicate `Dog : Ani → Prop`?

   However, the premises mix animals and dogs. Also, Jane's likes are about animals (that bark, that jump). And KiKi is an animal.

   We can do:

     `axiom Animal : Type`   -- the type of animals

   Then:
     - `JaneLike : Animal → Prop`   (Jane likes the animal)
     - `Barks : Animal → Prop`
     - `Jumps : Animal → Prop`
     - `HasLegs : Animal → Prop`
     - `Terricolous : Animal → Prop`

   And for dogs: since "all dogs are animals that bark", we can have:
     - `Dog : Animal → Prop`   -- which are the animals that are dogs

   Then the premises:

   1. ∀ (x : Animal), Barks x → ¬ JaneLike x
   2. ∀ (x : Animal), Dog x → Barks x
   3. ∀ (x : Animal), Jumps x → JaneLike x
   4. ∀ (x : Animal), HasLegs x → Jumps x
   5. ∀ (x : Animal), Terricolous x → HasLegs x
   6. There is a specific animal `KiKi : Animal`
   7. If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
        ¬ (Jumps KiKi) ∧ ¬ (HasLegs KiKi) → (Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi)

   But note: the last premise is a conditional about KiKi only, so we write it as:
        axiom P7 : ¬ (Jumps KiKi) ∧ ¬ (HasLegs KiKi) → Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi

   Actually, note: the premise says "If an animal has legs, then it jumps" — that's for all animals? The earlier premise 4. So we have:

        axiom T4 : ∀ x : Animal, HasLegs x → Jumps x

   Similarly for the others.

   Conclusion: Terricolous KiKi.

   However, note that the last premise is about KiKi only. But we have a universal premise about legs and jumps? We have both.

   We need to declare:

     Animal : Type

     KiKi : Animal

     Barks : Animal → Prop
     Jumps : Animal → Prop
     HasLegs : Animal → Prop
     Terricolous : Animal → Prop
     JaneLike : Animal → Prop
     Dog : Animal → Prop   (if we use it, but actually in premise 2 we use `Dog`)

   But note: In premise 1 and 3, Jane's likes are about animals (so we have JaneLike on Animal).

   Let's define the axioms:

     axiom T1 : ∀ x : Animal, Barks x → ¬ JaneLike x
     axiom T2 : ∀ x : Animal, Dog x → Barks x
     axiom T3 : ∀ x : Animal, Jumps x → JaneLike x
     axiom T4 : ∀ x : Animal, HasLegs x → Jumps x
     axiom T5 : ∀ x : Animal, Terricolous x → HasLegs x
     axiom T6 : Animal   (we have KiKi? Let's call it KiKi: but we need to declare it as a constant of type Animal)

     We declare:
        constant KiKi : Animal

     Then the last premise:
        T7 : ¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi → Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi

   But note: the premise says "KiKi is an animal" — that's given by the type.

   Conclusion: 
        theorem goal : Terricolous KiKi

   However, note that the last premise (T7) is a conditional that we can use. But we are not proving, we are just formalizing.

   There's an issue: premise 2 (all dogs are animals that bark) might not be used? But we formalize anyway.

   We are not proving, so we just write the axioms and the goal.

   But note: the problem does not mention any specific dog, so we don't use `Dog` in the conclusion. We just formalize it because it's given.

   Let's write the code accordingly.

   However, wait: the conclusion is only about KiKi being terricolous. We have KiKi and the predicates.

   We'll write:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom KiKi : Animal
axiom Barks : Animal → Prop
axiom Jumps : Animal → Prop
axiom HasLegs : Animal → Prop
axiom Terricolous : Animal → Prop
axiom JaneLike : Animal → Prop
axiom Dog : Animal → Prop      -- we'll declare it because premise 2 uses it

axiom T1 : ∀ x : Animal, Barks x → ¬ (JaneLike x)
axiom T2 : ∀ x : Animal, Dog x → Barks x
axiom T3 : ∀ x : Animal, Jumps x → JaneLike x
axiom T4 : ∀ x : Animal, HasLegs x → Jumps x
axiom T5 : ∀ x : Animal, Terricolous x → HasLegs x
axiom T7 : ¬ (Jumps KiKi) ∧ ¬ (HasLegs KiKi) → Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi

theorem goal : Terricolous KiKi := sorry
</lean>

   But note: the premise about "KiKi is an animal" is captured by the type and the constant `KiKi : Animal`.

   However, we did not use the premise 5: "If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs." — that's T5 already.

   And the premise 4: "If an animal has legs, then it jumps" — that's T4.

   And the premise 6 (the last one) we wrote as T7.

   But note: the last premise says "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs." 
        -> (¬(Jumps KiKi) ∧ ¬(HasLegs KiKi)) → (Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi)

   We are done? Let me check.

   However, the premises also included:
        "Jane likes all animals that jump" -> T3
        "Jane does not like any animals that bark" -> T1
        "All dogs are animals that bark" -> T2

   The conclusion does not mention Jane or dogs. So why are they there? They are premises, so we formalize them.

   We are just formalizing without proving, so it's okay.

   But note: the conclusion is only about KiKi being terricolous. Our goal is the theorem `Terricolous KiKi`.

   Let me note: the problem says "Conclusion to formalize: KiKi is terricolous."

   So we write accordingly.

   However, I see: the premise "KiKi is an animal" is already included by the constant declaration.

   But what about "If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs" — we have T5: Terricolous → HasLegs.

   And "If an animal has legs, then it jumps" — we have T4: HasLegs → Jumps.

   And the last premise about KiKi is T7.

   This should be complete.

   BUT: wait, the premise "Jane likes all animals that jump" and "Jane does not like any that bark" might be used in a proof? But we are not required to prove, so just formalize.

   Let's write the code exactly as above.

   IMPORTANT: We have to use the formatting with <lean></lean> tags.

   However, note: the problem says "If an animal has legs, then it jumps." and "If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs." — these are universal. So we used universal quantifiers.

   The last premise is about KiKi only, so we write it as a single statement.

   We'll write:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom KiKi : Animal

axiom Barks : Animal → Prop
axiom Jumps : Animal → Prop
axiom HasLegs : Animal → Prop
axiom Terricolous : Animal → Prop
axiom JaneLike : Animal → Prop
axiom Dog : Animal → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x : Animal, Barks x → ¬ (JaneLike x)
axiom P2 : ∀ x : Animal, Dog x → Barks x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : Animal, Jumps x → JaneLike x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : Animal, HasLegs x → Jumps x
axiom P5 : ∀ x : Animal, Terricolous x → HasLegs x
axiom P6 : Animal  -- This is not an axiom, we already have KiKi. Wait, we have constant KiKi.
-- The premises: "KiKi is an animal" is covered by the type. The last premise is:
axiom P7 : ¬ (Jumps KiKi) ∧ ¬ (HasLegs KiKi) → (Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi)

theorem goal : Terricolous KiKi := sorry
</lean>

But note: the problem said:

  "Premises:
   ...
   KiKi is an animal.   -> we have constant KiKi: Animal
   If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.   -> P7

So we don't need an extra axiom for KiKi being an animal because we've already declared the type and the constant.

But wait: the problem says we have to formalize the premise "KiKi is an animal" as well? We did by having `KiKi : Animal`.

We don't need an additional axiom.

So the code above is complete.

However, let me check the names: I used P1 to P7, but in the example they used T1 and R1. That doesn't matter. We can use any name.

Alternatively, we can use the naming as in the example:

    T1, T2, ... for premises.

But the example used T1 and R1. But we'll do T1, T2, ... for all.

But note: in the example, the theorem was called `goal`. So we are doing:

    theorem goal : Terricolous KiKi := sorry

So we write:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom KiKi : Animal

axiom Barks : Animal → Prop
axiom Jumps : Animal → Prop
axiom HasLegs : Animal → Prop
axiom Terricolous : Animal → Prop
axiom JaneLike : Animal → Prop
axiom Dog : Animal → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x : Animal, Barks x → ¬ JaneLike x
axiom T2 : ∀ x : Animal, Dog x → Barks x
axiom T3 : ∀ x : Animal, Jumps x → JaneLike x
axiom T4 : ∀ x : Animal, HasLegs x → Jumps x
axiom T5 : ∀ x : Animal, Terricolous x → HasLegs x
axiom T7 : ¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi → Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi

theorem goal : Terricolous KiKi := sorry
</lean>

Note: We skipped T6? Because the premise "KiKi is an animal" is already declared (KiKi: Animal). So we don't have an axiom T6.

But the last premise is the 7th. So we call it T7.

Alternatively, we could have:

   premise 1: T1
   premise 2: T2
   premise 3: T3
   premise 4: T4
   premise 5: T5
   premise 6: We have two:
        - We don't have a separate axiom for KiKi beyond being an animal? 
        - The premise 6 is: "If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs." -> that's T6? But in the problem, they list it as the 7th? 

   The problem says:

        Premises:
        ...
        KiKi is an animal.   -> we don't need a separate axiom for this, it's a constant
        If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.   -> that's the 7th item.

   So we have 6 premises? But we listed:

        1. Jane does not like any animals that bark. -> T1
        2. All dogs are animals that bark. -> T2
        3. Jane likes all animals that jump. -> T3
        4. If an animal has legs, then it jumps. -> T4
        5. If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. -> T5
        6. KiKi is an animal. -> constant declaration
        7. If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then ... -> T7

   So we have 7 premises? But we only have T1 to T5 and T7? And the sixth is the constant.

   We can count the premises in the problem: 

        Premises:
        Jane does not like any animals that bark.  [1]
        All dogs are animals that bark. [2]
        Jane likes all animals that jump. [3]
        If an animal has legs, then it jumps. [4]
        If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. [5]
        KiKi is an animal. [6] -> but note: this is a declaration, not an axiom? 
        If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. [7]

   So we have 7 premises? But in logic, we have:

        [6] is just a constant of type Animal -> that's not an axiom? It's a constant. So we don't need an axiom for that.
        [7] is the only one that mentions KiKi specifically.

   Therefore, we have:

        5 universal axioms (T1 to T5), one constant (KiKi), and one specific axiom about KiKi (T7).

   So the code above is correct.

   However, note that the premise [6] ("KiKi is an animal") is already covered by the declaration `KiKi : Animal`.

   Thus, we write the code as above.


=== RESPONSE ===
Here is the Lean 4 formalization of the given premises and conclusion:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom KiKi : Animal
axiom Barks : Animal → Prop
axiom Jumps : Animal → Prop
axiom HasLegs : Animal → Prop
axiom Terricolous : Animal → Prop
axiom JaneLike : Animal → Prop
axiom Dog : Animal → Prop   -- Used in premise 2

-- Premise 1: Jane does not like any animals that bark
axiom P1 : ∀ x, Barks x → ¬ JaneLike x

-- Premise 2: All dogs are animals that bark
axiom P2 : ∀ x, Dog x → Barks x

-- Premise 3: Jane likes all animals that jump

axiom P7 : ¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi → Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi

-- Conclusion: KiKi is terricolous
theorem goal : Terricolous KiKi := sorry
</lean>

Explanation:
1. Created a type `Animal` for the domain of discourse
2. Declared `KiKi` as a specific animal
3. Defined predicates:
   - `Barks`: True for animals that bark
   - `Jumps`: True for animals that jump
   - `HasLegs`: True for animals with legs
   - `Terricolous`: True for terricolous animals
   - `JaneLike`: Jane likes the animal
   - `Dog`: True for dogs
4. Formalized each premise as an axiom:
   - P1: ∀x, Barks x → ¬JaneLike x
   - P2: ∀x, Dog x → Barks x
   - P3: ∀x, Jumps x → JaneLike x
   - P4: ∀x, HasLegs x → Jumps x
   - P5: ∀x, Terricolous x → HasLegs x
   - P7: KiKi-specific conditional (last premise)
5. Declared theorem `goal` stating `Terricolous KiKi` with `sorry` placeholder

Note: The premise "KiKi is an animal" is handled by the type declaration `KiKi : Animal`. All universal quantifications are over the type `Animal`.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and need to prove that KiKi is terricolous.
 The premises include:
   P1: Jane does not like any animals that bark.
   P2: All dogs bark.
   P3: Jane likes all animals that jump.
   P4: If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
   P5: If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.
   P7: For KiKi specifically: if KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, then KiKi is either terricolous or has legs.

 Note: The conclusion is `Terricolous KiKi`.

 We also note that we have an axiom `P7` that is specific to KiKi and has the form:
   ¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi → Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi

 However, observe that the consequent of P7 is a disjunction. We wish to prove `Terricolous KiKi`.

 Let us try to see if we can derive a contradiction from assuming the negation of the goal.

 Alternatively, we might try to use P7. But note that P7 requires the premise (¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi). 
 Do we have that? We don't know from the given axioms.

 Let us consider what we know about KiKi. We don't have any direct information about KiKi.

 However, note that we have no information that connects KiKi to being a dog or to barking, except through the general premises.

 How can we use the other premises? We have:

   P5: Terricolous x → HasLegs x
   P4: HasLegs x → Jumps x
   P3: Jumps x → JaneLike x
   P1: Barks x → ¬ JaneLike x

 Also, P2: Dog x → Barks x.

 But note: we don't have any information that KiKi is a dog or that KiKi barks.

 Without any information about KiKi, it seems we cannot apply these general premises to KiKi.

 Let us look at P7 again. It says:
   If KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, then KiKi is either terricolous or has legs.

 But note: the consequent includes "or has legs", but we are assuming in the antecedent that KiKi does not have legs? 
 Actually, the antecedent is (¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi). Then the consequent is (Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi). 
 Since we are assuming ¬ HasLegs KiKi, then the disjunction would force Terricolous KiKi.

 So if we can show (¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi), then by P7 and the fact that ¬ HasLegs KiKi, we get Terricolous KiKi.

 But wait: we don't know ¬ Jumps KiKi or ¬ HasLegs KiKi. In fact, we don't know anything about KiKi.

 How can we proceed? We must consider the possibility that the premises might not be sufficient.

 Alternatively, let us try to derive a contradiction if we assume that KiKi is not terricolous.

 However, note that we have no negative information about KiKi. 

 Let us try to see if we can show that KiKi must jump? Or must have legs? 

 We have no premises that force any animal to have legs or to jump.

 Therefore, it seems we cannot prove that KiKi is terricolous.

 But wait: what if we consider the JaneLike premises? We might be able to derive something about KiKi.

 However, without knowing whether KiKi barks or jumps, we cannot use P1 or P3.

 Since we have no information about KiKi, we must rely on P7. But P7 requires that we know ¬ Jumps KiKi and ¬ HasLegs KiKi.

 How can we get ¬ Jumps KiKi? We don't have it.

 Alternatively, we might try to show that KiKi cannot jump? How? 

 Suppose we assume that KiKi jumps. Then by P3, Jane likes KiKi. But if KiKi barks, then by P1, Jane does not like KiKi. 
 But we don't know if KiKi barks. 

 We also don't have any premise that says that if an animal jumps then it does not bark, or vice versa.

 Therefore, without additional information, we cannot prove that KiKi is terricolous.

 However, let us check the structure of P7. It says:
   If KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, then KiKi is either terricolous or has legs.

 But note: the consequent is an OR. We want Terricolous KiKi. We can only get that if we can show that the other disjunct (HasLegs KiKi) is false.

 But in the antecedent we are assuming ¬ HasLegs KiKi. So if we can establish the antecedent, then we get:
   Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi
   and since we have ¬ HasLegs KiKi (from the antecedent), we get Terricolous KiKi.

 So the proof would go:
   Step 1: Show ¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi.
   Step 2: Use P7 to get Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi.
   Step 3: Use the fact that ¬ HasLegs KiKi (from step 1) to eliminate the disjunction, leaving Terricolous KiKi.

 But how to show step 1? We don't have any direct information.

 Alternatively, we might try to show that the assumption that KiKi jumps leads to a contradiction? Or that the assumption that KiKi has legs leads to a contradiction? 

 However, we have no reason to believe that. 

 Therefore, it seems that the given premises are insufficient to prove that KiKi is terricolous.

 But wait: what if we try to prove by contradiction? Assume ¬ Terricolous KiKi.

 What do we know? We have P5: Terricolous KiKi → HasLegs KiKi. So by contrapositive, if ¬ HasLegs KiKi, then ¬ Terricolous KiKi. But that doesn't help.

 Alternatively, without P5, we don't have a direct link. 

 Actually, we have:
   P5: ∀ x, Terricolous x → HasLegs x
   So if we assume ¬ Terricolous KiKi, we don't get anything about HasLegs KiKi.

 Now, consider P4: HasLegs KiKi → Jumps KiKi.
   If we assume ¬ Jumps KiKi, then by contrapositive, ¬ HasLegs KiKi.

 But we don't know ¬ Jumps KiKi.

 Alternatively, we might try to show that KiKi does not jump? How?

 Suppose we assume that KiKi jumps. Then by P3, Jane likes KiKi. 
 Now, if we could show that KiKi barks, then by P1, Jane does not like KiKi, which is a contradiction.

 But we don't know if KiKi barks. 

 We have P2: Dog KiKi → Barks KiKi. But we don't know if KiKi is a dog.

 Therefore, we cannot get a contradiction from assuming KiKi jumps.

 Similarly, we cannot get a contradiction from assuming KiKi has legs.

 Thus, we have no way to establish the antecedent of P7.

 Given the above, we must conclude that the theorem cannot be proven from the given premises.

 However, note that the problem states that the axioms are validated. But in this case, the axioms might be consistent with both KiKi being terricolous and not.

 Therefore, we should output the code with a proof that uses classical reasoning? But note: Lean is classical by default.

 Alternatively, we might try to use the fact that we don't have any information to force KiKi to jump or have legs, so we cannot use P7.

 But wait: what if we consider the law of excluded middle? We can do case analysis on whether KiKi jumps or not, and similarly on whether KiKi has legs.

 Let me try:

   Consider: Jumps KiKi ∨ ¬ Jumps KiKi (by classical.em)
   Similarly: HasLegs KiKi ∨ ¬ HasLegs KiKi.

 However, without connections, we cannot derive the goal.

 Specifically, we want to use P7 which requires both ¬ Jumps and ¬ HasLegs. But if we are in the case where KiKi jumps, then we don't have ¬ Jumps, so P7 doesn't apply.

 And if we are in the case where KiKi has legs, then we don't have ¬ HasLegs.

 So the only case where P7 applies is when we have both ¬ Jumps and ¬ HasLegs. In that case, we get Terricolous KiKi.

 But what about the other cases?

   Case 1: Jumps KiKi. Then we don't know anything about Terricolous? We have no premise that says that if an animal jumps then it is terricolous? 
   Case 2: HasLegs KiKi. Similarly, we don't get anything about Terricolous.

 Therefore, we cannot prove Terricolous KiKi in the other cases.

 Hence, the proof is not possible.

 But wait: what if we use the other premises? For example, if KiKi jumps, then Jane likes KiKi. But that doesn't tell us about terricolous.

 Similarly, if KiKi has legs, then it jumps, and then Jane likes it. Again, no connection to terricolous.

 Therefore, we must conclude that the goal is not provable.

 However, the problem asks for a proof term. Since we cannot prove it, we might need to use classical reasoning and case analysis, but as argued, it doesn't work.

 Alternatively, we might have missed something.

 Let me reexamine P7: 
   P7: ¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi → Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi

 Notice that the consequent has "or HasLegs KiKi", but we are assuming ¬ HasLegs KiKi in the antecedent? Actually, the antecedent is ¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi, so the consequent is Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi. Since we have ¬ HasLegs KiKi (from the antecedent), we can actually derive Terricolous KiKi in that case.

 But the problem is: we cannot establish the antecedent.

 Now, what if we try to show that the negation of the antecedent leads to a contradiction? 

 The antecedent is (¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi). Its negation is: Jumps KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi.

 We want to prove Terricolous KiKi. We have no way to get that from Jumps KiKi or from HasLegs KiKi.

 Therefore, we are stuck.

 Given the above, I suspect that the theorem is not provable. However, the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", meaning the axioms are consistent? But we are to provide a proof if possible.

 But note: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 Since we cannot find a proof, we must output Uncertain? But wait, the task is to replace sorry with a valid proof term. If we cannot, then we must state that it is not provable? However, the instructions say to replace sorry with a proof.

 But note: the problem says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'", meaning that the theorem is intended to be provable? Or not?

 Alternatively, perhaps we missed a connection.

 Let me look again at the premises:

   P1: ∀ x, Barks x → ¬ JaneLike x
   P2: ∀ x, Dog x → Barks x
   P3: ∀ x, Jumps x → JaneLike x
   P4: ∀ x, HasLegs x → Jumps x
   P5: ∀ x, Terricolous x → HasLegs x

 And P7: for KiKi: ¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi → Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi

 Now, note that from P5 and P4, we have: Terricolous x → HasLegs x → Jumps x.

 So if KiKi is terricolous, then it has legs and jumps.

 But we are trying to prove that KiKi is terricolous. 

 Now, what if we assume that KiKi is not terricolous? Then we don't get anything.

 What if we consider the contrapositive of P5? 
   Contrapositive of P5: ∀ x, ¬ HasLegs x → ¬ Terricolous x.

 But that doesn't help because we want to prove Terricolous, not its negation.

 Now, consider P7 again. It says that if KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, then KiKi is either terricolous or has legs. But if it has legs, that contradicts the assumption of no legs? Actually, no: the consequent is an OR. So if we have the antecedent, then we get either terricolous or has legs. But the antecedent includes not having legs, so then we must have terricolous.

 Therefore, P7 is essentially saying: if KiKi does not jump and does not have legs, then KiKi is terricolous.

 But we still need to show that KiKi does not jump and does not have legs.

 How can we show that? We might try to show that if KiKi has legs, then we get a contradiction? Or if KiKi jumps, then we get a contradiction?

 Let's try:

   Suppose KiKi has legs. Then by P4, KiKi jumps. Then by P3, Jane likes KiKi.
   Now, if we can show that KiKi barks, then by P1, Jane does not like KiKi, which is a contradiction.

   But we don't know if KiKi barks. 

   However, we also have P2: if KiKi is a dog, then it barks. But we don't know if KiKi is a dog.

   Therefore, we cannot get a contradiction.

 Similarly, if KiKi jumps, then Jane likes KiKi. But again, without knowing if KiKi barks, we cannot get a contradiction.

 So we cannot force the antecedent of P7 by contradiction.

 Therefore, the proof is not possible.

 Given the above, I will output the code with a placeholder that uses classical logic to do case analysis, but note that it won't work. However, the problem requires a proof term.

 Alternatively, we might use `by_contra` and then try to derive a contradiction from the assumption that KiKi is not terricolous, but we don't see how.

 But wait: what if we consider the possibility that KiKi barks? 

   If KiKi barks, then by P1, Jane does not like KiKi.
   But if KiKi jumps, then by P3, Jane likes KiKi, which is a contradiction.

   Therefore, if KiKi barks, then it cannot jump.

   But if it cannot jump, then by P4, it cannot have legs (because if it had legs, it would jump).

   So if KiKi barks, then we have ¬ Jumps KiKi and ¬ HasLegs KiKi? Not necessarily: we only have that it doesn't jump, but we don't know about legs. 

   Actually, from barks we only get that it doesn't jump? No, we get that if it barks then it doesn't jump? Not exactly: we have that if it barks then Jane doesn't like it, and if it jumps then Jane likes it, so if it barks and jumps, we get a contradiction. So if it barks, then it cannot jump.

   Therefore, if KiKi barks, then ¬ Jumps KiKi.

   Now, what about legs? We have no direct link. But if we had that KiKi barks implies something about legs? We don't.

   However, we also have P2: if KiKi is a dog, then it barks. But we don't know if KiKi is a dog.

   Therefore, we cannot assume that KiKi barks.

 So we are back to square one.

 Given the above, I conclude that the theorem is not provable from the given premises.

 But the problem says "validated" axioms, meaning they are consistent? And the theorem might be false in some models.

 Therefore, we should answer Uncertain.

 However, the task is to replace 'sorry' with a proof. Since we cannot find a proof, we must use a tactic that fails? That is not acceptable.

 After rethinking, I notice that we have no premise that forces any animal to be either jumping or not, or to have legs or not. The only information about KiKi is in P7, which is conditional.

 Therefore, I will output a proof that uses classical case analysis on whether KiKi has legs or not, and on whether it jumps or not, and then in the case where it doesn't jump and doesn't have legs, we use P7 to get the goal. In the other cases, we try to derive the goal from other means, but we cannot.

 In fact, in the other cases, we have no way to prove `Terricolous KiKi`. Therefore, this approach will not work.

 Alternatively, we might try to show that the assumption that KiKi is not terricolous leads to a contradiction? 

   Assume ¬ Terricolous KiKi.

   We have P5: Terricolous KiKi → HasLegs KiKi, so by contrapositive, ¬ HasLegs KiKi → ¬ Terricolous KiKi, which is not helpful.

   Now, consider the law of excluded middle on HasLegs KiKi.

   Case 1: HasLegs KiKi.
        Then by P4, Jumps KiKi.
        Then by P3, JaneLike KiKi.
        Now, if KiKi barks, then by P1, not JaneLike KiKi, contradiction.
        So we must have ¬ Barks KiKi.
        But we have no premise that says that if an animal has legs then it barks? Or the opposite.

   Case 2: ¬ HasLegs KiKi.
        Then we have ¬ HasLegs KiKi.
        Now, what about jumps? We don't know.

        If we also had ¬ Jumps KiKi, then by P7 we would get Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi, and since ¬ HasLegs KiKi, we get Terricolous KiKi, which contradicts our assumption.

        But we don't have ¬ Jumps KiKi.

        So in this case, we have ¬ HasLegs KiKi and we don't know about jumps.

        If KiKi jumps, then we have no contradiction.

        If KiKi does not jump, then we have both ¬ Jumps and ¬ HasLegs, so by P7 we get Terricolous KiKi, contradiction.

        Therefore, in the case ¬ HasLegs KiKi, we must have that if KiKi jumps then we don't get a contradiction, and if it doesn't jump, we do.

        So to get a contradiction in this case, we need to force KiKi not to jump? We cannot.

   Therefore, we cannot get a contradiction in all cases.

 Given the above, I think the proof is not possible.

 However, the problem might expect us to use P7 and classical reasoning on the legs and jumps of KiKi.

 Let me try a different approach: use the law of excluded middle on `Terricolous KiKi` and also on `HasLegs KiKi` and `Jumps KiKi`, but it is messy.

 Alternatively, we can use:

   by_cases h1 : HasLegs KiKi
   by_cases h2 : Jumps KiKi

   But in none of the cases we get Terricolous KiKi, except when we have the condition for P7.

 But note: P7 requires both not jumps and not haslegs. In the case where we have not haslegs and not jumps, then we get Terricolous KiKi by P7 (as explained: because the disjunction and then the not haslegs).

 So in that case we have the goal.

 In the other cases, we don't have the goal. Therefore, we cannot prove it.

 Given the above, I must conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 However, the problem says "validated" axioms. Perhaps there is a model where the axioms hold but KiKi is not terricolous.

 For example, let me build a model:

   Let Animal be a type with one element: KiKi.
   Define:
     Barks KiKi = False
     Jumps KiKi = True
     HasLegs KiKi = True
     Terricolous KiKi = False
     JaneLike KiKi = True   (because Jumps is True)

   Check the premises:
     P1: ∀ x, Barks x → ¬ JaneLike x. Since Barks KiKi is False, this is vacuously true.
     P2: ∀ x, Dog x → Barks x. We haven't defined Dog. Let Dog KiKi = False, then P2 is vacuously true.
     P3: ∀ x, Jumps x → JaneLike x. We have Jumps KiKi = True and JaneLike KiKi = True, so true.
     P4: ∀ x, HasLegs x → Jumps x. HasLegs KiKi=True and Jumps KiKi=True, so true.
     P5: ∀ x, Terricolous x → HasLegs x. Terricolous KiKi=False, so vacuously true.
     P7: (¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi) → (Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi). 
          Here, ¬ Jumps KiKi = False, so the antecedent is False, so the implication is true.

   In this model, Terricolous KiKi is False.

   Therefore, the theorem is not true in all models.

   Hence, it is not provable.

   So the answer should be Uncertain? But note: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

   However, the task is to provide a proof. But since it is not provable, we cannot provide a proof.

   But the problem says "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". If we cannot, then we must not output a proof.

   Given the instructions, I think we are expected to realize that the proof is not possible and answer Uncertain.

   However, the example provided was a simple proof. This one is more complex and not provable.

   Therefore, I will output the code with a sorry and then answer Uncertain.

   But wait, the problem says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", which might mean that the axioms are consistent and the theorem is intended to be true? But our model shows it is not.

   Alternatively, perhaps I missed a premise. Let me count the premises: we have P1 to P5 and P7. The original problem might have more.

   But the given code only has these.

   Therefore, I will output:

   <lean>
   ... [the same axioms] ...
   theorem goal : Terricolous KiKi := by
     -- We cannot prove this, so we leave sorry
     sorry
   </lean>
   ANSWER: Uncertain

 However, the problem says to replace sorry with a proof. But if we cannot, then we must admit defeat.

 But note: the problem says "your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof". If we cannot, then we should not claim to have one.

 Given the above, I think the correct answer is that the theorem is not provable, so we output the code with sorry and answer Uncertain.

 But wait, the instructions say: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 The answer "Uncertain" means that we are not sure if the theorem is true or false given the axioms? But in this case, we know it is not entailed.

 However, the problem might expect us to realize that it is not provable and answer Uncertain.

 Alternatively, the problem might have a typo and there is a missing axiom.

 But based on the given code, we have to work.

 Therefore, I will output the code with sorry and answer Uncertain.

 However, let me double-check: is there any way to use the premises to force KiKi to be not jumping or not having legs? We don't see any.

 So:

   <lean>
   ... [copy the axioms] ...
   theorem goal : Terricolous KiKi := sorry   -- we cannot prove it
   </lean>
   ANSWER: Uncertain

 But the problem says "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term", and if we leave sorry, it is not replaced.

 We must replace it with something. We can try to use classical reasoning and case analysis, but it won't work.

 Alternatively, we can use:

   have h : ¬ (¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi) ∨ Terricolous KiKi := ?_

   But that is not helpful.

 Given the above, I decide to output a proof that uses classical reasoning and the law of excluded middle on `Terricolous KiKi`, and then in the positive case we are done, in the negative case we try to derive a contradiction but fail.

 But we can't derive a contradiction.

 Therefore, I will output a proof that uses `by_contra` and then gets stuck, but that is not a proof.

 Alternatively, we can use the following (incorrect) proof:

   apply P5
   ...

   But that doesn't work.

 After careful thought, I must admit that I cannot find a proof.

 So I will output the code with sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 But the instructions say to replace sorry with a proof. Since I cannot, I will leave sorry and answer Uncertain.

 However, the problem says "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof", so I must replace it.

 What if we try to use P7? We need to show the antecedent. We can't, but we can assume it by classical reasoning? No.

 Alternatively, we can do:

   by_cases h : ¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi
   . apply (Or.resolve_right (P7 h) h.right)   -- because P7 h gives Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi, and h.right is ¬ HasLegs KiKi, so we get Terricolous KiKi.
   . -- In this case, we have ¬ (¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi), which is equivalent to Jumps KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi.
     -- But we have no way to prove Terricolous KiKi from Jumps KiKi or HasLegs KiKi.
     -- So we get stuck.

 Therefore, the proof is not complete.

 Given the above, I will output:

   theorem goal : Terricolous KiKi := by
     by_cases h : ¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi
     . exact Or.resolve_right (P7 h) h.right
     . admit   -- or sorry, but we can't prove this branch

 But that is not a complete proof.

 Alternatively, we can try to show that in the second branch, the goal is also true? We can't.

 Therefore, I must conclude that the proof is not possible.

 Given the instructions, I think the intended answer might be that the theorem is not provable, so we answer Uncertain.

 So I will output the code with a sorry in the second branch, but that is not a valid proof.

 Alternatively, we can use:

   have h1 : Jumps KiKi ∨ ¬ Jumps KiKi := by apply Classical.em
   have h2 : HasLegs KiKi ∨ ¬ HasLegs KiKi := by apply Classical.em
   cases h1 with
   | inl hj => sorry   -- cannot prove Terricolous KiKi
   | inr hj =>
     cases h2 with
     | inl hl => sorry -- cannot prove Terricolous KiKi
     | inr hl =>
       have h : ¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi := by exact ⟨hj, hl⟩
       exact Or.resolve_right (P7 h) hl

   But in the first three cases we have sorry.

 So it's not a proof.

 Given the above, I think the only honest answer is that we cannot provide a proof.

 Therefore, I will output the code with the original sorry and answer Uncertain.

 But the problem says to replace sorry. We cannot, so we leave it as sorry.

 Final decision:

   <lean>
   ... [the given axioms] ...
   theorem goal : Terricolous KiKi := sorry
   </lean>
   ANSWER: Uncertain

 However, note that the problem says "validated" axioms, which might mean that the axioms are sufficient and the theorem is true, but we missed the proof.

 Let me try one more time:

   Perhaps from the premises, we can show that KiKi cannot bark? 

   If we assume that KiKi barks, then we get that it cannot jump (because if it jumps, Jane likes it, but if it barks, Jane doesn't like it, contradiction).

   Then by P4, if it doesn't jump, then it doesn't have legs (contrapositive).

   So if KiKi barks, then we have ¬ Jumps KiKi and ¬ HasLegs KiKi.

   Then by P7, we get Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi, and since ¬ HasLegs KiKi, we get Terricolous KiKi.

   Therefore, if KiKi barks, then Terricolous KiKi.

   Now, what if KiKi does not bark? We don't know.

   But we also have P2: if KiKi is a dog, then it barks. But we don't know if it is a dog.

   However, we can consider: Dog KiKi ∨ ¬ Dog KiKi.

   Case 1: Dog KiKi.
        Then by P2, Barks KiKi.
        Then by the above, Terricolous KiKi.

   Case 2: ¬ Dog KiKi.
        Then we have ¬ Dog KiKi, but that doesn't give us anything about barking? 
        We have no premise that says that if an animal is not a dog then it doesn't bark.

        So in this case, we don't know if KiKi barks.

        Therefore, we cannot conclude.

   So we have: if KiKi is a dog, then we get the goal. If not, we don't.

   Therefore, we need to know if KiKi is a dog.

   But we don't.

   So still not proved.

   Unless we can show that KiKi is a dog? We have no premise that says that.

   Therefore, the proof is still not complete.

   But note: we have no information about KiKi being a dog or not.

   So the answer is still uncertain.

 Given the above, I think the theorem is not provable.

 Therefore, I will output:

   <lean>
   axiom Animal : Type
   ... [rest of the axioms] ...
   theorem goal : Terricolous KiKi := sorry
   </lean>
   ANSWER: Uncertain

 But to at least try, we might output a proof that assumes KiKi barks or uses the dog condition, but it's not complete.

 Alternatively, we can use:

   have h_bark : Barks KiKi ∨ ¬ Barks KiKi := by apply Classical.em
   cases h_bark with
   | inl hb =>
     have no_jump : ¬ Jumps KiKi := by
       intro hj
       have jane_likes := P3 KiKi hj
       have jane_not_likes := P1 KiKi hb
       contradiction
     have no_legs : ¬ HasLegs KiKi := by
       intro hl
       have jump := P4 KiKi hl
       contradiction
     have h := P7 ⟨no_jump, no_legs⟩
     exact Or.resolve_right h no_legs
   | inr hb =>
     sorry   -- in this case, we cannot prove

   So again, we get stuck in the case where KiKi does not bark.

   In this case, we have no information to force the antecedent of P7.

   Therefore, we cannot prove.

   So I will output this partial proof and then answer Uncertain, but the proof has sorry.

   The problem does not allow sorry in the proof.

   Therefore, I must not output a proof with sorry.

   Given the instructions, I think the only option is to output the code with the original sorry.

   So:

   <lean>
   ... [axioms] ...
   theorem goal : Terricolous KiKi := sorry
   </lean>
   ANSWER: Uncertain

 This is the best we can do.


=== RESPONSE ===
The given axioms do not provide sufficient information to prove that KiKi is terricolous. The proof relies on establishing that KiKi does not jump and does not have legs to use axiom P7, but the premises do not force these conditions. Specifically:
- No axioms connect KiKi to barking or dog properties
- Jane's preferences don't constrain KiKi's physical attributes
- P7 requires ¬Jumps ∧ ¬HasLegs, but no premises enforce these
A countermodel exists where KiKi jumps/has legs but isn't terricolous, satisfying all axioms while falsifying the theorem.
