STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the given premises and the conclusion.
 The subject is "Beijing". We'll have a constant for Beijing.
 We'll have predicates for the properties mentioned.

 Premises:
 1. Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China.
    We can have: Capital (Beijing, PRC) [but note: we don't have PRC as an object?]
    Alternatively, we can have a unary predicate: IsCapitalPRC (Beijing)

 2. Beijing is the capital city of the world's most populous nation.
    Similarly: IsCapitalOfMostPopulousNation (Beijing)

 3. Beijing is located in Northern China.
    LocatedInNorthernChina (Beijing)

 4. Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics Games.
    Hosted2008SummerOlympics (Beijing)
    Hosted2008SummerParalympics (Beijing)

 5. Beijing has hosted the Summer and Winter Olympics and the Summer and Winter Paralympics.
    HostedSummerOlympics (Beijing)
    HostedWinterOlympics (Beijing)
    HostedSummerParalympics (Beijing) [already have for 2008? but this says generally?]
    HostedWinterParalympics (Beijing)

    However, note that premise 4 is specific to 2008, and premise 5 is more general? 
    But the problem says "has hosted", so we can interpret as:
    HostedSummerOlympics(Beijing) and HostedWinterOlympics(Beijing) and ... 

 6. Many of Beijing's 91 universities consistently rank among the best universities in the world.
    We can have: HasUniversitiesThatRankAmongBest (Beijing)

 Conclusion: Beijing is located in southern China.
    LocatedInSouthernChina (Beijing)

 However, note that premise 3 says "northern China", and the conclusion says "southern China". 
 We are not trying to prove the conclusion (we use sorry) but just formalize.

 We'll define:
   obj : Type
   Beijing : obj
   IsCapitalPRC : obj → Prop
   IsCapitalOfMostPopulousNation : obj → Prop
   LocatedInNorthernChina : obj → Prop
   Hosted2008SummerOlympics : obj → Prop
   Hosted2008SummerParalympics : obj → Prop
   HostedSummerOlympics : obj → Prop
   HostedWinterOlympics : obj → Prop
   HostedSummerParalympics : obj → Prop   [Note: we already have 2008, but this is general?]
   HostedWinterParalympics : obj → Prop
   HasUniversitiesThatRankAmongBest : obj → Prop

 And the conclusion: LocatedInSouthernChina : obj → Prop

 Then the premises become axioms about Beijing.

 But note: the fifth premise says "Summer and Winter Olympics and ... Paralympics", so we break it into four parts?
 Actually, the text says "has hosted the Summer and Winter Olympics and the Summer and Winter Paralympics", meaning:
   Summer Olympics, Winter Olympics, Summer Paralympics, Winter Paralympics.

 So we can have four separate predicates.

 However, note that the fourth premise already mentions 2008 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, so we don't necessarily need to duplicate.

 We'll define the predicates as needed.

 Let's write the Lean code accordingly.

======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms about Beijing, but the theorem we are to prove is that Beijing is located in southern China (LocatedSouthernChina Beijing). However, we also have an axiom T3 that states Beijing is located in Northern China (LocatedNorthernChina Beijing). There is no additional information provided that connects "Northern China" and "southern China" or that would allow us to derive a contradiction or an equivalence.

Looking at the axioms:

- T3: LocatedNorthernChina Beijing

And the theorem we are asked to prove:

- theorem goal : LocatedSouthernChina Beijing

There is no axiom stating that if something is located in Northern China then it is not in southern China, or vice versa. Similarly, there is no axiom that would directly relate these two predicates.

Moreover, we have a number of other axioms (about being the capital, hosting events, etc.) that do not seem relevant to the location in southern vs. northern.

Therefore, we cannot prove that Beijing is located in southern China because we have an explicit axiom stating it is in Northern China, and without further information, we cannot derive a contradiction or an equivalence.

However, note that the problem states: "Provide the complete code with a valid proof". Since we cannot prove the theorem from the given axioms, we must be cautious. The theorem as stated is actually false given the axioms because we have T3 (Northern) and the theorem asks for Southern, and we have no reason to believe that Northern and Southern are compatible or that Beijing is both.

But in logic, without an explicit contradiction, we cannot prove false things? Actually, we are trying to prove LocatedSouthernChina Beijing. We have LocatedNorthernChina Beijing. If we assume that Northern and Southern are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (which they are in reality), we are not given that as an axiom. So the system has no way of knowing that.

Therefore, the theorem goal as stated is not provable from the given axioms. And in fact, it is false if we interpret the predicates in the usual way, but the Lean system only knows the axioms we have.

Given that, we must conclude that the theorem cannot be proven. However, the problem says "replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". If we cannot provide a proof, then we cannot complete the task as asked. But note: the problem says "if we can't prove it, then we might need to see if we can refute it, but the task is to replace sorry".

But the instructions say: "your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof". If the theorem is not provable, then we cannot write a valid proof. However, note that the example provided a proof term when there was a clear path. In this case, we don't have one.

But wait: do we have any axioms that might imply LocatedSouthernChina Beijing? Looking again at the axioms:

- T1: CapitalPRC Beijing
- T2: CapitalMostPopulous Beijing
- T3: LocatedNorthernChina Beijing
- T4a: Hosted2008SummerOlympics Beijing
- T4b: Hosted2008SummerParalympics Beijing
- T5a: HostedSummerOlympics Beijing
- T5b: HostedWinterOlympics Beijing
- T5c: HostedSummerParalympics Beijing
- T5d: HostedWinterParalympics Beijing
- T6: HasTopUniversities Beijing

None of these axioms mention LocatedSouthernChina at all.

Therefore, we cannot prove LocatedSouthernChina Beijing.

But note: the theorem is in the context of the axioms. Since we have an axiom that says Beijing is in Northern China and we are trying to prove it is in Southern China, and without any other axioms connecting these, we cannot.

So, what to do? The problem says to replace sorry with a valid proof, but there is none. However, note that in Lean we can use the principle of explosion if we had a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in the axioms.

Alternatively, we might try to look for an axiom that directly states LocatedSouthernChina Beijing, but there is none.

Given the above, the only honest answer is that we cannot provide a proof.

But the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

We are to answer the truth value of the theorem? That would be False, because by the axiom T3, it's in the north and not in the south (if we assume they are disjoint, which is not stated, but in the context of the problem, we are to reason with the given axioms only). However, without the disjointness, we cannot say for certain. But in reality, we know that a city cannot be both in the north and the south? But again, the system doesn't have that.

Therefore, in the system, the statement LocatedSouthernChina Beijing is not provable, and the given axioms do not assert it. Moreover, we have an axiom asserting the opposite? Actually, LocatedNorthernChina Beijing is not necessarily the opposite. But without an axiom saying that if something is in Northern China then it is not in Southern China, we cannot derive a contradiction.

So strictly speaking, we don't have a proof of LocatedSouthernChina and we don't have a proof of not LocatedSouthernChina. The system is consistent either way. Therefore, we cannot prove the theorem.

But the task is to replace sorry with a proof. Since we cannot prove it, but also note: maybe the theorem is false and we can prove a negation? The theorem is stated positively.

Given the constraints, we cannot complete the task as intended? This is a problem.

But note: the "Uncertain" in the answer might be the key. We are to provide an answer of True/False/Uncertain. So we might say Uncertain because the axioms do not allow us to prove the theorem, and they don't contradict it? Actually, they do not contradict it because T3 (northern) and LocatedSouthernChina (southern) might coexist? That is, unless we have an axiom that says anything in Northern China is not in Southern China.

But we don't have such an axiom.

So without that, we have:

We know:
  LocatedNorthernChina Beijing

But LocatedSouthernChina Beijing might be true or false? 

In the real world, we know that "Northern China" and "Southern China" are disjoint, but the system does not know that. Because it is not an axiom.

Therefore, in this logical system, we cannot prove that Beijing is in southern China, and we cannot prove that it is not. So the theorem 'goal' is undecidable from the given axioms.

So the correct answer is Uncertain? But the problem says to provide the complete code with a valid proof. How can we write a proof when we are uncertain? We cannot.

We have to stick to the instructions: "if we can't prove it, we can't write a proof". Therefore, we must leave it as sorry? But the task is to remove sorry.

This is a conflict.

Perhaps I missed something in the axioms? Let me read again.

We have:
  axiom LocatedSouthernChina : obj → Prop

But there is no axiom of the form:
  ∀x, LocatedNorthernChina x → ¬ LocatedSouthernChina x

Or anything similar.

Therefore, we have no reason to believe that LocatedSouthernChina Beijing is false, but we also have no reason to believe it is true.

We are only given that it is in Northern China, and nothing else about the location.

So the theorem is unprovable from the given axioms.

Given that, we cannot complete the proof. However, the instructions are to "replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". Since we cannot, we must say that the theorem cannot be proven.

But the problem says "Provide the complete code with proof", so we are expected to write something. And then we must answer Uncertain.

However, in the Lean code, we cannot write an arbitrary proof. We must write a valid term. The only option is to leave it as sorry? But that is not allowed.

Alternatively, we can use a "by exact ?" but that still leaves a hole. Or we could use a tactic proof that uses `trivial` or `assumption`, but that won't work because no such assumption exists.

Wait, we can try to list the axioms that we have and see if they imply LocatedSouthernChina Beijing? They don't.

But what about using the other axioms? For example, we have that Beijing hosted the summer and winter Olympics, has top universities, is a capital, etc. But none of these predicates are connected to location.

So to proceed, we must admit defeat.

But note: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

We can write the Lean code with `sorry` (if we can't find a proof) and then answer Uncertain? But the problem says "replace sorry" so we cannot leave sorry.

Another idea: perhaps there's a typo? Or maybe we are supposed to realize that T3 says Northern China, but the theorem is about Southern China, and without a bridge between these, we can't. But we have to work within the given axioms.

Given the constraints, we must state that the theorem is not provable and answer Uncertain.

However, the problem says: "if we can't prove it, we might need to see if we can refute it", but refuting it would be proving the negation: ¬ LocatedSouthernChina Beijing. Do we have a proof of that? We don't, because we have T3 but that doesn't contradict LocatedSouthernChina without additional axioms.

Therefore, the conclusion is that we are Uncertain.

So we will write the complete code, but leave the theorem as sorry? But the task forbids that.

Alternatively, in Lean, if we don't have a proof, we might use the `admit` tactic, but that is equivalent to sorry.

I think the only honest way is to acknowledge that we cannot provide a proof.

But let's read the instructions again: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry', your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof."

If we cannot find one, then we must indicate that we cannot. However, the problem does not say what to do in such a case.

But note: in the example, the proof was straightforward. Here, it's impossible.

Given the above, it is impossible to prove, so we must answer Uncertain and in the Lean code we leave an informative sorry? But we are not allowed to change the statement.

Alternatively, we can try to use something from the context? For example, maybe the axiom T5b: HostedWinterOlympics Beijing. But does hosting winter Olympics imply being in the south? Not typically.

Perhaps the problem is that we have Beijing hosting winter Olympics and that requires snow, so southern China doesn't have snow? But that is not stated.

Therefore, we give up.

We output the same code but add `theorem goal : LocatedSouthernChina Beijing := by admit`? But `admit` is not a valid tactic in the open realm, and it's the same as sorry.

We are stuck.

Wait, maybe we can create a proof using false.elim? But to do that we need a proof of false. How do we get that?

We don't have one.

Alternatively, we can use `nomatch` or something, but again, no.

Given the above, I think we have to conclude that the theorem is unprovable. Therefore, in the Lean code, we leave sorry. But that does not complete the task. 

Alternatively, we can try to use the fact that Beijing hosted both summer and winter olympics and that might imply it has both warm and cold weather, which might imply it is in the north? But that is not an axiom.

Therefore, I propose the following: we leave the sorry in the theorem and then answer Uncertain. But the task says to replace sorry.

This is a dilemma.

After re-examining, none of the axioms have any implication for LocatedSouthernChina. So the only way to write a proof is to have an axiom that directly states it, or an inference rule that leads to it. But there is no such thing.

Therefore, the theorem goal is not provable from the given axioms.

We then answer Uncertain.

But how to format the Lean code? We must leave sorry.

But the problem says "replace sorry". So if we leave sorry, we haven't done the task.

Maybe we can add an axiom? But the problem says "Do NOT modify the axioms or theorem statement".

We are not allowed to change anything except replace sorry with a proof.

Given that no proof exists, we cannot do it.

Perhaps we can use classical logic to do a proof by contradiction? But even then, we have the axiom T3, and if we hypothesize ¬LocatedSouthernChina Beijing, we have no contradiction. Nor if we assume LocatedSouthernChina Beijing, we have no contradiction with T3 unless we know that LocatedNorthernChina x implies not LocatedSouthernChina x, which we don't.

So even in classical logic, we cannot derive a proof.

Therefore, we are forced to leave sorry and then answer Uncertain.

But violating the task is not allowed.

I see only one way: we must provide the code as is with sorry, and then answer Uncertain? But then we didn't replace sorry.

Alternatively, we can write an invalid proof, for example:
  theorem goal : LocatedSouthernChina Beijing := by assumption
But that won't compile because there is no such assumption.

Or:
  theorem goal : LocatedSouthernChina Beijing := T3
But T3 is of type LocatedNorthernChina Beijing, so it won't work.

So there is no valid proof term.

Given the above, I think the expected answer might be that the theorem is false, and answer False? But how to prove that?

To prove the negation, we would need to show that the assumptions imply ¬ LocatedSouthernChina Beijing.

We have T3: LocatedNorthernChina Beijing.

If we had an axiom:
  ∀ x, LocatedNorthernChina x → ¬ LocatedSouthernChina x

Then we could prove ¬ LocatedSouthernChina Beijing.

But we don't have that.

However, in the context of the problem, it is common knowledge that Northern China and Southern China are distinct. But as an AI, we must strictly adhere to the given axioms.

So without that axiom, we cannot prove the negation either.

Therefore, we must be Uncertain.

But the problem is only asking for the theorem "LocatedSouthernChina Beijing". Since we have no proof, we cannot வாதிடம்We are stuck.

Ultimately, the instructions say to replace sorry with a valid proof term. If we cannot, then we might have to write something like `False.elim (some_proof_of_false)` but there is no proof of false.

Therefore, it seems there is an error in the problem or in our understanding.

Let me double-check the axioms and the theorem:

The theorem is:
  theorem goal : LocatedSouthernChina Beijing

But in the premises, we have:

  axiom LocatedNorthernChina : obj → Prop
  axiom T3 : LocatedNorthernChina Beijing

And:
  axiom LocatedSouthernChina : obj → Prop

There's no connection between the two.

Moreover, the other axioms are about completely different properties.

Therefore, the only possible action is to fail.

Given that, we will still provide the code with sorry and then answer Uncertain. Although it doesn't replace sorry, we have no choice.

But note: the problem might expect a proof using one of the axioms that somehow implies southern location. For example, we have T5b: HostedWinterOlympics Beijing. In the real world, winter Olympics are typically hosted in snowy regions and southern China is not snowy? But this is not stated as an axiom.

Similarly, T6: HasTopUniversities Beijing - but that can be in any location.

There's no connection between these.

So in conclusion, I submit:

ANSWER: Uncertain

But the problem insists on replacing sorry. Since we have to, and there is no proof, we can define LocatedSouthernChina in a way that it is True for Beijing? But we are not allowed to modify the axioms or the theorem.

Alternatively, we can use `Classical.choice` or something, but that would require `open Classical` and then use `by triv` but it won't work because we have no proof.

Given the impossibility, I think the best is to state Uncertain and leave the code with sorry.

However, to adhere to the format, I choose to leave the sorry and wrap with explanation.

But the instruction says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof." Since there is no proof, we cannot.

Therefore, after careful analysis, it is impossible to provide a proof, so we output the code unchanged and answer Uncertain.

But perhaps the problem has a typo? If the theorem was LocatedNorthernChina Beijing, then we have T3. But it is not.

Another possibility: maybe one of the axioms is supposed to be LocatedSouthernChina? But looking at the names, T3 is named LocatedNorthern China Beijing.

Therefore, I submit:


=== RESPONSE ===
The given axioms provide various properties about Beijing, such as being the capital of the PRC, hosting Olympic events, having top universities, and being located in Northern China (T3). However, there are no axioms that establish a connection between these properties and the conclusion that Beijing is located in Southern China. In fact, axiom T3 directly states that Beijing is in Northern China, which typically contradicts Southern China geographically, but this contradiction is not explicitly stated as an axiom. Since there is no axiom that would allow deducing LocatedSouthernChina Beijing from the premises, and no inference rule linking these predicates, the theorem is unprovable from the given axioms. Therefore, the proof cannot be completed.
