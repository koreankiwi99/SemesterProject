--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing a conclusion about Beijing being the second largest Chinese city.
 However, note that the premises provided do not directly mention the population size or ranking of cities.
 Since we are only translating the logical structure, we must declare the necessary predicates and objects.

 Important: We are not proving the conclusion, just setting up the logical structure.

 Steps:
 1. Declare a type for objects (e.g., 'obj').
 2. Represent Beijing as a constant of type 'obj'.
 3. Based on the premises and conclusion, we may need:
    - A predicate for "is the capital of the People's Republic of China"
    - A predicate for "is the capital of the world's most populous nation"
    - A predicate for "is located in Northern China"
    - Predicates for hosting events, but note: the conclusion is about city size, so we might not need events.
    - However, the conclusion requires concepts of:
        * Being a Chinese city
        * Being the second largest

 4. We note that the premises do not directly contain the fact about being the second largest, but we are only formalizing the given.

 Since the conclusion is about the population ranking, we need:
   - A notion of Chinese cities (or simply cities, but restricted to China)
   - A comparison of size (by population) and the ranking.

 Approach for the conclusion:
   We can define:
      axiom ChineseCity : obj → Prop
      axiom PopulationSize : obj → ℕ   (if we want to assign a population number)
   OR
      We can define a binary relation for comparison, but ranking might require more.

 However, note: the conclusion says "the second largest" meaning there is exactly one city that is larger.

 We can do:
   axiom SecondLargestChineseCity : obj → Prop

 But then we can have:
   axiom C1 : SecondLargestChineseCity Beijing

 Which directly states the conclusion.

 However, the problem says "formalize the logical structure", meaning we must represent the premises and the conclusion.

 But observe: the premises do not mention anything about population, so we cannot derive the conclusion.
 Therefore, we have two options:
   a) Introduce the necessary predicates that are mentioned and for the conclusion we state it as an axiom? 
      But note: we are given premises and a conclusion to formalize. The conclusion must be the theorem.

   b) We must recognize that the premises may be incomplete, but we are only formalizing the logical structure.

 Since the conclusion is about population, and none of the premises provide information about population, we cannot derive it from the premises.

 We are only setting up the problem. So:

   We declare the relevant types and predicates.

   Since the premises do not relate to population, we might only need:
      - Beijing is a Chinese city? Actually, being the capital of China implies it is in China.

   But note: the premises say:
        "Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China" -> which implies it is in China.
        "Beijing is located in Northern China" -> also China.

   The conclusion requires:
        Being a Chinese city and being the second largest in population.

   However, because the premises do not provide any information about population or other cities, we cannot derive the conclusion.

   In the formalization, we are only required to have the theorem with the conclusion and the premises as axioms.

   We can have:

        axiom Beijing : obj
        axiom CapitalCityOfPRC : obj → Prop
        axiom obj : Type
        ... and other premises.

   Then we have the conclusion as a separate predicate:

        axiom SecondLargestChineseCity : obj → Prop

   And then our theorem is:

        theorem goal : SecondLargestChineseCity Beijing := sorry

   However, note: the premises are given, and they do not include the population fact. But the problem asks to formalize the premises and the conclusion.

   How do we represent the premises?

   We break down the premises:

     P1: "Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China"
        We can have: 
          axiom IsCapitalOfPRC : obj → Prop
          axiom P1 : IsCapitalOfPRC Beijing

     P2: "Beijing is the capital city of the world's most populous nation"
        This is similar: 
          axiom IsCapitalOfMostPopulousNation : obj → Prop
          axiom P2 : IsCapitalOfMostPopulousNation Beijing

        But note: we might interpret "most populous nation" as the same as the People's Republic of China? 
        However, without a connection, we leave it separate.

     P3: "Beijing is located in Northern China"
          axiom LocatedInNorthernChina : obj → Prop
          axiom P3 : LocatedInNorthernChina Beijing

     P4: "Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics Games"
          We can define hosting of events. But note: we don't have to model each event if we don't need it for the conclusion.
          Let's have a predicate for hosting the 2008 Summer Olympics and one for 2008 Summer Paralympics, or combine:
          axiom Hosted2008SummerOlympics : obj → Prop
          axiom Hosted2008SummerParalympics : obj → Prop
          Then: axiom P4a : Hosted2008SummerOlympics Beijing
                axiom P4b : Hosted2008SummerParalympics Beijing

        Alternatively, we can have a predicate for hosting an event and then an event type? But that might be overkill.

     P5: "Beijing has hosted the Summer and Winter Olympics and the Summer and Winter Paralympics"
          This is more general. We can break it down:
          axiom HostedSummerOlympics : obj → Prop
          axiom HostedWinterOlympics : obj → Prop
          axiom HostedSummerParalympics : obj → Prop
          axiom HostedWinterParalympics : obj → Prop
          Then: 
            axiom P5a : HostedSummerOlympics Beijing
            axiom P5b : HostedWinterOlympics Beijing
            axiom P5c : HostedSummerParalympics Beijing
            axiom P5d : HostedWinterParalympics Beijing

        But note: the premise says "the Summer and Winter Olympics and the Summer and Winter Paralympics", meaning all of them.

        Alternatively, we might have a single predicate for each combination? Actually, the text says "the Summer and Winter Olympics and the Summer and Winter Paralympics", so we are talking about four distinct events.

     P6: "Many of Beijing's 91 universities consistently rank among the best universities in the world"
          We can have:
            axiom NumberOfUniversities : obj → ℕ    -- to capture "91", but note: we don't need to model the exact number for the conclusion?
            axiom HasUniversity : obj → Prop   -- not necessary
          However, the key point is about the universities ranking. We can define:
            axiom HasWorldClassUniversities : obj → Prop
          Then: axiom P6 : HasWorldClassUniversities Beijing

   But note: the conclusion is about being the second largest Chinese city.

   Since the premises do not mention population, we cannot derive the conclusion from the premises. 
   Therefore, we are forced to declare the conclusion as an axiom? 

   However, in the example, the conclusion is the theorem. So we set it as:

        theorem goal : SecondLargestChineseCity Beijing := sorry

   But the premises are represented as axioms, and they are not used in the proof? Actually, they are not connected.

   We are not trying to prove the goal because we use sorry. We are only declaring the types.

   But the structure is:

        We have a bunch of axioms for premises and the goal is the conclusion.

   However, note: it might be that the user expects the premises to be used. But the problem says "formalize the logical structure", meaning represent every sentence as a logical statement.

   Since the conclusion is about something not mentioned in the premises, the theorem goal might not be provable from the premises, but that's not our concern.

   Therefore, we set:

        obj : Type
        Beijing : obj

        -- Premise 1
        axiom IsCapitalOfPRC : obj → Prop
        axiom P1 : IsCapitalOfPRC Beijing

        -- Premise 2
        axiom IsCapitalOfMostPopulousNation : obj → Prop
        axiom P2 : IsCapitalOfMostPopulousNation Beijing

        -- Premise 3
        axiom LocatedInNorthernChina : obj → Prop
        axiom P3 : LocatedInNorthernChina Beijing

        -- Premise 4: hosted 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics
        axiom Hosted2008SummerOlympics : obj → Prop
        axiom Hosted2008SummerParalympics : obj → Prop
        axiom P4a : Hosted2008SummerOlympics Beijing
        axiom P4b : Hosted2008SummerParalympics Beijing

        -- Premise 5: hosted all four
        axiom HostedSummerOlympics : obj → Prop
        axiom HostedWinterOlympics : obj → Prop
        axiom HostedSummerParalympics : obj → Prop
        axiom HostedWinterParalympics : obj → Prop
        axiom P5a : HostedSummerOlympics Beijing
        axiom P5b : HostedWinterOlympics Beijing
        axiom P5c : HostedSummerParalympics Beijing
        axiom P5d : HostedWinterParalympics Beijing

        -- Premise 6: has world-class universities
        axiom HasWorldClassUniversities : obj → Prop
        axiom P6 : HasWorldClassUniversities Beijing

        -- For the conclusion, we need a new predicate:
        axiom SecondLargestChineseCity : obj → Prop

        theorem goal : SecondLargestChineseCity Beijing := sorry

   However, note: we are not using the premises in the theorem. But that's okay because we are not proving anything.

   Alternatively, we might think that the premises imply that Beijing is a Chinese city? And being the second largest is a separate fact? 

   But we have not defined what it means to be a Chinese city. We could add:

        axiom ChineseCity : obj → Prop

   And we might state that Beijing is a Chinese city? How do we know? From the context? 

   Since the user asks to formalize the given premises, we don't have that. But note: being the capital of China and being in Northern China imply being a Chinese city. However, we don't have the connection as an axiom.

   We are not building a full model. We are just representing the statements.

   Therefore, we choose to not represent the intermediate steps.

   But to be more complete, we might add:

        -- We assume that being the capital of China implies being a Chinese city?
        -- However, we are not proving anything, so we leave it as is.

   We stick to the direct representation.

   However, there is an alternative: the conclusion is a statement of fact that we assume (or are told) is true? But the problem says "premises" and "conclusion to formalize". 

   We are only formalizing the statements.

   Therefore, the above should be acceptable.

   But note: the premises mention that Beijing is the capital of the PRC and located in China. That might imply it is a city? And we can define:

        axiom City : obj → Prop

   and then

        axiom P1_implies : ∀ x, IsCapitalOfPRC x → City x → ...   ... we don't need to do this.

   We are not connecting the dots.

   Therefore, we do:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Beijing : obj

-- Premises
axiom IsCapitalOfPRC : obj → Prop
axiom P1 : IsCapitalOfPRC Beijing

axiom IsCapitalOfMostPopulousNation : obj → Prop
axiom P2 : IsCapitalOfMostPopulousNation Beijing

axiom LocatedInNorthernChina : obj → Prop
axiom P3 : LocatedInNorthernChina Beijing

axiom Hosted2008SummerOlympics : obj → Prop
axiom Hosted2008SummerParalympics : obj → Prop
axiom P4a : Hosted2008SummerOlympics Beijing
axiom P4b : Hosted2008SummerParalympics Beijing

axiom HostedSummerOlympics : obj → Prop
axiom HostedWinterOlympics : obj → Prop
axiom HostedSummerParalympics : obj → Prop
axiom HostedWinterParalympics : obj → Prop
axiom P5a : HostedSummerOlympics Beijing
axiom P5b : HostedWinterOlympics Beijing
axiom P5c : HostedSummerParalympics Beijing
axiom P5d : HostedWinterParalympics Beijing

axiom HasWorldClassUniversities : obj → Prop
axiom P6 : HasWorldClassUniversities Beijing

-- Conclusion: Beijing is the second largest Chinese city
axiom SecondLargestChineseCity : obj → Prop

theorem goal : SecondLargestChineseCity Beijing := sorry
</lean>

However, note: the premise about 91 universities. We are representing it with a predicate about having world-class universities. But the number 91 is not captured. Should we?

   The premise says "Many of Beijing's 91 universities ...". We might want:

        axiom NumberOfUniversities : obj → ℕ
        axiom P6_pre : NumberOfUniversities Beijing = 91

        and then

        axiom P6 : ... the ranking ... 

   But the focus of the premise is that many rank among the best. We don't need the number 91 for the conclusion.

   Therefore, we can ignore the number and just say it has world-class universities.

   Alternatively, we can have:

        axiom HasUniversities : obj → Prop
        axiom Number : obj → ℕ
        axiom P6a : HasUniversities Beijing
        axiom P6b : Number Beijing = 91
        axiom P6c : ∀ x, HasUniversities x → ...  ... this might be too much.

   We decide to stick with a high-level predicate for the ranking.

   Given the above reasoning, we use the code above.

   However, note: we are using an axiom for the conclusion predicate. The theorem is the conclusion. But what if the premises imply it? They don't, but that's okay.

   We are just formalizing the statements.

   One more thing: the problem says "Conclusion to formalize: Beijing is the second largest Chinese city."

   So we are formalizing that as a theorem whose type is the conclusion.

   This is consistent.

   But note: in the example, they had the cat being blue and then being nice as a theorem that would be proven by the rule. Here, we don't have any rules that connect to the conclusion.

   We set the theorem with the conclusion and use sorry.

   Let's write the code accordingly.

axiom P6 : HasWorldClassUniversities Beijing

-- Conclusion predicate
axiom IsSecondLargestChineseCity : City → Prop

-- Formalized conclusion as theorem (unproven)
theorem beijing_second_largest : IsSecondLargestChineseCity Beijing := sorry
</lean>

Note: This formalization:
1. Declares all premises as independent axioms
2. Uses separate predicates for each distinct concept
3. Declares the conclusion as a separate predicate
4. Includes the conclusion as an unproven theorem (using `sorry`)
5. Doesn't attempt to derive the conclusion from premises since
   the provided information doesn't contain population data or city size comparisons


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given a set of premises (axioms) about Beijing, but none of them directly state that Beijing is the second largest city in China.
 The conclusion we are asked to prove is `IsSecondLargestChineseCity Beijing`.

 However, looking at the axioms:
   - We have facts about Beijing being the capital of PRC and of the most populous nation.
   - We have its location in Northern China.
   - We have that it hosted various Olympic events.
   - We have that it has world-class universities.

 None of these premises provide information about the population ranking of Chinese cities.

 Therefore, the theorem `beijing_second_largest` cannot be proven from the given premises.

 Since the proof is impossible (the premises do not entail the conclusion), we must mark the conclusion as unprovable.

 However, note that the task says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." But if we cannot prove it, then we cannot provide a proof term.

 But wait: the example provided in the instructions was straightforward because the premises directly supported the conclusion. Here, the premises are irrelevant to the conclusion.

 Therefore, we must conclude that the theorem is not provable from the given axioms.

 However, the instructions require that we output the complete code. We cannot change the theorem statement or the axioms. We must replace `sorry` with a proof term if we can, or else we must admit that we cannot.

 But note: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain".

 Since the proof is impossible, we have two options:
   Option 1: State that we cannot prove it and leave the theorem unproven (but the task says to replace `sorry`).
   Option 2: Realize that the theorem might be false? But the problem does not give any negative information.

 However, the problem does not provide any axioms about the second largest city. Therefore, we cannot prove it.

 But note: the problem says "Formalized conclusion as theorem (unproven)". So we are expected to try.

 Since we cannot prove it, we must output `sorry` again? But that is not a proof.

 Alternatively, we might try to use the fact that Beijing is the capital and that the capital is often the largest city? But that is not given. In fact, the second largest city is Shanghai, but that is not in the axioms.

 Therefore, the correct answer is that the theorem is unprovable.

 However, the task says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." We cannot do that because we don't have the necessary premises.

 So what should we do?

 We must be honest: the proof is impossible. Therefore, we cannot replace `sorry` with a valid proof term.

 But note: the problem says "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof." If we cannot prove it, then we cannot provide a proof.

 Therefore, we must leave it as `sorry`? But that would be the same as the input.

 Alternatively, we might use a tactic that fails? But that would cause an error.

 After careful thought, I think the intended answer is that the theorem is unprovable from the given premises. Therefore, we cannot provide a proof.

 However, the problem says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 We are to answer whether the conclusion (Beijing is the second largest Chinese city) is true, false, or uncertain.

 But note: the problem is not asking about the real world, but about the logical system we have.

 In the real world, Beijing is not the second largest city (Shanghai is larger, and Beijing is either the second or third? But actually, by urban population, Beijing is the second? However, we are not given real-world facts).

 In our logical system, we have no information about the population ranking. Therefore, we cannot prove it, and we also cannot disprove it (because we don't have any axioms that contradict it). So the answer is "Uncertain".

 Therefore, we will leave the theorem as `sorry` and then answer "Uncertain".

 But wait: the problem says to replace `sorry` with a valid proof term. We cannot do that. So we must leave it as `sorry`? That is the only valid thing to do.

 Alternatively, we might try to use an axiom that we don't have? But we are not allowed to add axioms.

 Therefore, we output the same code with `sorry` and then answer "Uncertain".

 However, the problem says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." We cannot, so we leave it as `sorry`.

 But note: the example replaced `sorry` with a proof term. Here we cannot.

 So the complete code is the same as the input? But that is not a proof.

 Alternatively, we might use a tactic that admits the goal? But that is the same as `sorry`.

 Therefore, we have no choice but to leave it as `sorry`.

 However, the problem says: "Provide the complete code with proof". We cannot provide a proof.

 So we must be honest: the proof is not possible.

 Therefore, we output the same code and then answer "Uncertain".

 But note: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 So we do:

<lean>
... (the same axioms) ...
theorem beijing_second_largest : IsSecondLargestChineseCity Beijing := sorry
</lean>
ANSWER: Uncertain

 However, the problem says "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". We cannot, so we leave it as `sorry`.

 But wait: the problem says "valid proof term". `sorry` is not a valid proof term; it is a placeholder.

 Therefore, we must not output `sorry` if we are to follow the instructions strictly.

 But we have no other option.

 Alternatively, we might try to prove it by contradiction? But we don't have any negative information.

 Or we might try to use the premises to deduce something about population? We don't have any.

 Therefore, I conclude that the task is impossible and we must indicate that.

 However, the problem says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof." Since we cannot, we must leave it as `sorry` and then explain in the answer.

 But the answer part is only for True/False/Uncertain.

 So we do:

<lean>

axiom IsSecondLargestChineseCity : City → Prop

theorem beijing_second_largest : IsSecondLargestChineseCity Beijing := sorry
</lean>
ANSWER: Uncertain

 However, note: the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions". We are not allowed to change them.

 Therefore, we have no other option.

 But wait: the problem says "theorem" and we are to prove it. We cannot, so we leave it unproven.

 Alternatively, we might try to argue that the premises imply the conclusion? But they don't.

 Therefore, the answer is "Uncertain" because the premises do not determine the population ranking.

 However, note: the problem says "conclusion predicate". We are not given any rule that links the premises to the conclusion.

 So we output as above.

</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

The provided axioms describe various properties of Beijing (being the capital of China, hosting Olympics, having universities, etc.), but none of them directly or indirectly establish Beijing's population ranking among Chinese cities. The conclusion about Beijing being the second largest Chinese city does not logically follow from the given premises. Without additional axioms connecting the provided properties to population size or city rankings, the theorem remains unprovable.
