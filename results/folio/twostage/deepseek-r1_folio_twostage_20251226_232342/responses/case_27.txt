STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion about Marvin. We need to define types and axioms to represent the logical structure.

 Steps:
 1. We need a type for the entities (like beings, people, etc.). Let's call it `obj`.
 2. We will have constants and predicates:
    - `Marvin` : a constant of type `obj`.
    - `Alien` : a predicate on `obj` (i.e., `Alien : obj → Prop`)
    - `Extraterrestrial` : a predicate on `obj` (same type as above)
    - `FromMars` : predicate (someone is from Mars)
    - `Human` : predicate
    - `HighlyIntelligent` : predicate (but note: the premise says "highly intelligent beings from Earth", so we can have separate predicates for being highly intelligent and from Earth? However, the premise about Marvin only says "highly intelligent being", without specifying Earth. So we can model:
        - `HighlyIntelligent : obj → Prop`
        - `FromEarth : obj → Prop`

 3. Premises (axioms):
    P1: "All aliens are extraterrestrials."
        ∀ x, Alien x → Extraterrestrial x

    P2: "If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien."
        ∀ x, FromMars x → Alien x

    P3: "No extraterrestrials are human."
        ∀ x, Extraterrestrial x → ¬ (Human x)   [or equivalently: ∀ x, Extraterrestrial x → Human x → False]

    P4: "All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans."
        ∀ x, (HighlyIntelligent x ∧ FromEarth x) → Human x

    P5: "Marvin is a highly intelligent being."
        HighlyIntelligent Marvin

    P6: "Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither."
        (FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin) ∨ (¬ FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬ FromMars Marvin)

    P7: "If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial."
        ¬ FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin

 4. Conclusion: "Marvin is an alien."
        Alien Marvin

 We'll define the type `obj`, the constant `Marvin`, and the predicates. Then we state the axioms and the theorem.

 Let's write the Lean code accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the given natural language premises and conclusion, here's the Lean 4 formalization:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Alien : obj → Prop
axiom Extraterrestrial : obj → Prop
axiom FromMars : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom HighlyIntelligent : obj → Prop
axiom FromEarth : obj → Prop
axiom Marvin : obj

-- All aliens are extraterrestrials
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Alien x → Extraterrestrial x

-- If someone is from Mars they are alien
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, FromMars x → Alien x

-- No extraterrestrials are human
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Extraterrestrial x → ¬ Human x

-- Highly intelligent Earth beings are human
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, (HighlyIntelligent x ∧ FromEarth x) → Human x

-- Marvin is highly intelligent
axiom P5 : HighlyIntelligent Marvin

-- Marvin is either (Earth and Mars) or (neither)
axiom P6 : (FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin) ∨ (¬ FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬ FromMars Marvin)

-- If not from Earth then extraterrestrial
axiom P7 : ¬ FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin

-- Conclusion: Marvin is an alien
theorem goal : Alien Marvin := sorry
</lean>

Key aspects:
1. Used `obj` as base type for all entities
2. Declared separate predicates for each property
3. Formalized Marvin as constant `Marvin : obj`
4. Used propositional axioms for all 7 premises
5. Theorem `goal` matches the conclusion requiring `Alien Marvin`
6. All axioms use proper typing (e.g., `∀ x : obj` and `→` for implications)
7. `P6` uses disjunction for exclusive cases
8. `P3` expresses "no" via negation `¬ Human x`
9. `P4` componds conditions with conjunction `∧`

Note: The proof uses `sorry` as required, focusing purely on correct logical representation.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and need to prove that Marvin is an alien.
 The key is to use the disjunction in P6 and consider the two cases.

 Case 1: Marvin is from Earth and from Mars.
   Then by P2 (since he is from Mars), he is Alien.

 Case 2: Marvin is not from Earth and not from Mars.
   Then by P7 (since he is not from Earth), he is Extraterrestrial.
   Then by P1, since he is Extraterrestrial, he is Alien? But wait, P1 says that all aliens are extraterrestrials, not the other way around.

 However, note that P1 is only one direction. We cannot conclude from Extraterrestrial to Alien.

 Let's reexamine the axioms:

 P1: ∀ x, Alien x → Extraterrestrial x   (if Alien then Extraterrestrial)
 P2: ∀ x, FromMars x → Alien x            (if FromMars then Alien)
 P3: ∀ x, Extraterrestrial x → ¬ Human x  (Extraterrestrial implies not Human)
 P4: ∀ x, (HighlyIntelligent x ∧ FromEarth x) → Human x
 P5: HighlyIntelligent Marvin
 P6: (FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin) ∨ (¬ FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬ FromMars Marvin)
 P7: ¬ FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin

 We need to show Alien Marvin.

 In Case 1: FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin
   Then FromMars Marvin holds, so by P2, Alien Marvin.

 In Case 2: ¬ FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬ FromMars Marvin
   Then we have ¬ FromEarth Marvin, so by P7, Extraterrestrial Marvin.

 Now, can we get from Extraterrestrial Marvin to Alien Marvin?
 The axioms do not directly say that Extraterrestrial implies Alien. In fact, P1 only goes from Alien to Extraterrestrial.

 However, note that P2 says that if someone is from Mars then they are alien. But in this case, we have ¬ FromMars Marvin, so we cannot use P2.

 Also, we have P3: Extraterrestrial Marvin → ¬ Human Marvin, but that doesn't give us Alien.

 How else might we get Alien? We don't have any other axioms that directly produce Alien.

 Let me check if we can derive a contradiction in Case 2? 

 We have:
   Extraterrestrial Marvin (by P7)
   Then by P3, ¬ Human Marvin.

 Also, we have HighlyIntelligent Marvin (P5) and ¬ FromEarth Marvin (by the case).

 Now, look at P4: It says that if someone is HighlyIntelligent and FromEarth then they are Human.
 But Marvin is not FromEarth, so P4 does not apply. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Marvin is Human.

 So there is no contradiction. We have that Marvin is Extraterrestrial, but we don't have any axiom that says that Extraterrestrial beings are necessarily Alien.

 In fact, note that P1 says that all Aliens are Extraterrestrial, but it doesn't say that every Extraterrestrial is an Alien.

 Therefore, in Case 2 we have Extraterrestrial Marvin but we cannot prove Alien Marvin.

 This suggests that the theorem might not hold. But wait, let me consider if there is another way.

 Alternatively, we might use the fact that Marvin is not Human to force that he must be Alien? But we don't have that every being is either Human or Alien.

 The axioms do not provide a complete classification.

 Therefore, we must reconsider: is the theorem actually true?

 Let me try to see if we can derive a contradiction from the assumption that Marvin is not Alien.

 However, note that in Case 2 we have:
   ¬ FromEarth Marvin, ¬ FromMars Marvin, Extraterrestrial Marvin, and HighlyIntelligent Marvin.

 Now, is there any axiom that forces Marvin to be Human? Only P4, which requires both HighlyIntelligent and FromEarth. But we don't have FromEarth.

 And P3 says that Extraterrestrial Marvin implies not Human, so Marvin is not Human. That is consistent.

 So we have a model where Marvin is Extraterrestrial (so not Human) but not Alien? 

 But wait, P1 says that if he were Alien then he would be Extraterrestrial, but it doesn't say that if he is Extraterrestrial then he must be Alien.

 Therefore, we cannot prove Alien Marvin in Case 2.

 However, note that P6 says that Marvin is either (from Earth and Mars) or (neither). We have covered Case 1 and Case 2.

 But in Case 1 we can prove Alien Marvin, and in Case 2 we cannot.

 So the theorem goal: Alien Marvin is not provable? 

 But wait, let me check the entire context: 

 We have P7: ¬ FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin.

 And we have no other way to get Alien Marvin except by being from Mars (via P2).

 In Case 2, we don't have FromMars Marvin, so we cannot use P2.

 Therefore, the proof must rely on Case 1. But what if Marvin is in Case 2? Then we cannot prove Alien Marvin.

 This means that the theorem is not provable? 

 However, note that we have P6: Marvin is either both or neither. But we also have:

   In Case 1: Alien Marvin (by P2).
   In Case 2: We have ¬ FromEarth Marvin, so by P7, Extraterrestrial Marvin.

 Now, is there an axiom that says that Extraterrestrial beings are Alien? We don't have that.

 But wait, let me look at the axioms again:

   P1: All aliens are extraterrestrials -> Alien ⊆ Extraterrestrial.
   P2: FromMars ⊆ Alien.

   P3: Extraterrestrial and Human are disjoint.

   P4: HighlyIntelligent and FromEarth implies Human.

   P5: Marvin is HighlyIntelligent.

   P6: Marvin is either (FromEarth and FromMars) or (neither).

   P7: If not FromEarth then extraterrestrial.

 Now, in Case 2: Marvin is not from Earth and not from Mars, and he is extraterrestrial.

 We need to know: is every extraterrestrial being an alien? The axioms don't say that.

 Therefore, we cannot prove that Marvin is an alien in Case 2.

 But wait, what if we try to assume that Marvin is not Alien and derive a contradiction? 

 Suppose ¬ Alien Marvin.

 In Case 1: we have FromMars Marvin, which by P2 would give Alien Marvin -> contradiction. So in Case 1, we must have Alien Marvin.

 In Case 2: we have Extraterrestrial Marvin (by P7). Now, is there any axiom that forces Extraterrestrial beings to be Alien? No.

 However, note that we also have Marvin is HighlyIntelligent (P5) and not FromEarth. Since he is not FromEarth, P4 does not apply. And P3 says he is not Human, which is consistent.

 So in Case 2, we have a consistent scenario where Marvin is Extraterrestrial and not Alien? 

 But wait, is there any axiom that says that if someone is extraterrestrial then they must be alien? We don't have that.

 Therefore, the theorem goal: Alien Marvin is not necessarily true.

 However, note that the problem says "Conclusion: Marvin is an alien". We are to prove it.

 But we see that in Case 1 we can prove it, but in Case 2 we cannot.

 This suggests that the theorem might be false? Or that we are missing a step.

 Let me try to see if we can use the other axioms.

 We have P3: Extraterrestrial x → ¬ Human x.

 And we have P4: (HighlyIntelligent x ∧ FromEarth x) → Human x.

 Now, in Case 2: Marvin is not FromEarth, so P4 doesn't apply. And Marvin is HighlyIntelligent, but that alone doesn't make him Human.

 So Marvin is not Human (because he is Extraterrestrial) and that's fine.

 Now, is there an axiom that says that if someone is not Human then they are Alien? No.

 Therefore, we cannot prove Alien Marvin in Case 2.

 But wait, the problem states that Marvin is either (Earth and Mars) or (neither). So we have two cases.

 However, the theorem must hold in both cases? But we only have a proof for Case 1.

 Therefore, the theorem is not provable? 

 But let me check if Case 2 is actually possible? 

 We have:
   Marvin is Extraterrestrial (by P7) and not Human (by P3).
   And Marvin is HighlyIntelligent.

 Now, is there an axiom that says that every being is either from Earth or not? We don't have that.

 Also, note that P6 says that Marvin is either both or neither. So Case 2 is explicitly allowed.

 Therefore, we must conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 However, wait: we have P1 and P2, but also note that P2 says that if someone is from Mars then they are alien. We don't have any other way to get alien.

 And in Case 2, Marvin is not from Mars, so we cannot use P2.

 So we cannot prove Alien Marvin in Case 2.

 This means that the overall theorem goal is not provable? 

 But note: the theorem is supposed to be proved. How can we fix it?

 Alternatively, perhaps we misinterpreted P7? P7 says: ¬ FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin.

 But that does not say that if Marvin is not from Earth then he is alien. It only says he is extraterrestrial.

 And we have no axiom that extraterrestrial implies alien.

 Therefore, the proof must rely on Marvin being from Mars (Case 1). But in Case 2, we cannot prove it.

 However, let me see if we can derive a contradiction in Case 2.

 Assume Case 2: ¬ FromEarth Marvin and ¬ FromMars Marvin.

 Then by P7, Extraterrestrial Marvin.

 Then by P3, ¬ Human Marvin.

 Now, we also have HighlyIntelligent Marvin.

 Is there any axiom that forces Marvin to be Human? Only if he were from Earth, but he isn't.

 So no contradiction.

 Therefore, we cannot prove Alien Marvin in Case 2.

 This means the theorem is not provable from the axioms.

 But wait, the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", meaning the axioms are given and we must prove the theorem.

 How can we proceed?

 Let me reread the axioms:

   P1: All aliens are extraterrestrials.
   P2: If someone is from Mars they are alien.
   P3: No extraterrestrials are human.
   P4: Highly intelligent Earth beings are human.
   P5: Marvin is highly intelligent.
   P6: Marvin is either (from Earth and Mars) or (neither).
   P7: If Marvin is not from Earth then he is extraterrestrial.

 The conclusion is that Marvin is an alien.

 We have two cases by P6.

 Case 1: FromEarth Marvin and FromMars Marvin.
   Then by P2, Alien Marvin.

 Case 2: ¬ FromEarth Marvin and ¬ FromMars Marvin.
   Then by P7, Extraterrestrial Marvin.

   Now, can we use P1? P1 says that if he were alien then he would be extraterrestrial, but that doesn't help.

   We need to show he is alien. How?

   Notice that we don't have any axiom that says that extraterrestrial beings are alien. So we are stuck.

 Therefore, it seems the theorem is not provable.

 However, perhaps there is a hidden contradiction? Let me try to assume that Marvin is not Alien in Case 2 and see.

 We have:
   ¬ Alien Marvin (assumption)
   Extraterrestrial Marvin (from P7)

   But P1 says that Alien x → Extraterrestrial x, which is a one-way implication. Without the converse, we cannot get Alien from Extraterrestrial.

   Also, P2 requires FromMars, which we don't have.

   So no contradiction.

 Hence, the proof cannot be completed.

 But wait, the problem says "Provide the complete code with a valid proof". If we cannot prove it, then we must say Uncertain? However, the task is to replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term. But if we cannot prove it, then we cannot provide a valid proof.

 However, note that the example only had a direct proof. But in this case, we have a disjunction and we can do case analysis.

 But in Case 2 we are stuck.

 Therefore, we must conclude that the theorem is not provable? 

 But let me check if there is a way to use P4 and P5 to force something.

 In Case 2: Marvin is not from Earth, so P4 does not apply. So we cannot get that he is Human.

 And P3 says that since he is Extraterrestrial, he is not Human. So we have ¬ Human Marvin, which is consistent.

 So no contradiction.

 Therefore, the theorem is not provable.

 However, the problem says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", meaning the axioms are consistent and the theorem is expected to be true.

 Alternatively, perhaps we are missing an axiom? But the problem states the axioms.

 Another thought: P7 says "If not from Earth then extraterrestrial". But note that in Case 1, Marvin is from Earth, so P7 doesn't apply. And we don't have any information about extraterrestrial in Case 1? But we don't need it because we have FromMars.

 But in Case 2, we use P7 to get Extraterrestrial.

 Now, is there any axiom that says that extraterrestrial beings are alien? We don't have that.

 So I think the theorem is not provable.

 But wait, the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain".

 We are to provide the code with the proof if we can, and then answer.

 However, if we cannot prove it, then we cannot write a proof. But the task says "replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". So if we believe the theorem is true, we must provide a proof.

 Alternatively, if we believe it is false, we might try to prove False, but that's not the goal.

 Given the axioms, we can only prove Alien Marvin in Case 1, but not in Case 2.

 But note: P6 says that Marvin is either (Earth and Mars) or (neither). We have no third option.

 And in Case 1 we can prove it, and in Case 2 we cannot.

 However, is it possible that in Case 2, Marvin is not an alien? Then the theorem would be false.

 But the problem asks for a proof. So if we can prove it by cases, we must cover both cases.

 Since we cannot prove it in Case 2, we must find a way to rule out Case 2.

 How can we rule out Case 2?

 Let me try to derive a contradiction in Case 2.

 We have:
   ¬ FromEarth Marvin, ¬ FromMars Marvin, Extraterrestrial Marvin, HighlyIntelligent Marvin.

 Now, is there any axiom that says that if someone is extraterrestrial then they are from Mars? We don't have that.

 Or that if they are not from Earth then they are from Mars? We don't have that.

 So no contradiction.

 Therefore, the theorem is not provable.

 But wait, let me try to use P4 and P5 together with P3.

 We have Marvin is HighlyIntelligent and not Human (because he is Extraterrestrial and by P3).

 P4 says that if he were from Earth then he would be Human. But he is not Human, so if he were from Earth then we would have a contradiction.

 Therefore, we can prove that Marvin is not from Earth? 

 We have:
   Assume FromEarth Marvin.
   Then by P4, since he is HighlyIntelligent and FromEarth, he is Human.
   But by P3, since he is Extraterrestrial (wait, is he Extraterrestrial in this case? In Case 2 we have Extraterrestrial, but if we assume FromEarth Marvin then we are not in Case 2?).

 This is getting messy.

 Let me do a full proof attempt in Lean.

 We will do case analysis on P6.

 Case 1: FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin.
   Then FromMars Marvin, so by P2, Alien Marvin.

 Case 2: ¬ FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬ FromMars Marvin.
   Then we have ¬ FromEarth Marvin, so by P7, Extraterrestrial Marvin.

   Now, we want to show Alien Marvin. How?

   We don't have any direct way.

   But let me see if we can use the other axioms to force that he must be from Mars? We don't have that.

   Alternatively, note that P1 doesn't help.

   We might try to use P3: Extraterrestrial Marvin implies not Human Marvin.

   And we have HighlyIntelligent Marvin.

   Now, if we had that every being that is not from Earth is from Mars, we don't have that.

   Or if we had that every extraterrestrial is from Mars, then we could use P2. But we don't have that.

   Therefore, we cannot prove Alien Marvin in this case.

 So the proof is incomplete.

 However, wait: in Case 2, we have ¬ FromEarth Marvin, and we also have HighlyIntelligent Marvin.

 P4 says: (HighlyIntelligent x ∧ FromEarth x) → Human x.

 The contrapositive: if not Human x then not (HighlyIntelligent x ∧ FromEarth x) 
   which is equivalent to: ¬ Human x → ¬ HighlyIntelligent x ∨ ¬ FromEarth x.

 But we have ¬ FromEarth x already, so the contrapositive doesn't give us new information.

 So we are stuck.

 Therefore, the only hope is if we can show that Case 2 leads to a contradiction.

 How? We have:

   HighlyIntelligent Marvin
   ¬ FromEarth Marvin
   Extraterrestrial Marvin
   ¬ Human Marvin   [from P3]

 And that's all.

 No contradiction.

 Hence, the theorem is not provable.

 But the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", so perhaps I am missing something.

 Let me try to assume that Marvin is not Alien in Case 2 and see if we can derive a contradiction.

   Axioms:
     P1: Alien x -> Extraterrestrial x
     P2: FromMars x -> Alien x
     P3: Extraterrestrial x -> not Human x
     P4: (HighlyIntelligent x and FromEarth x) -> Human x
     P5: HighlyIntelligent Marvin
     P6: (FromEarth Marvin and FromMars Marvin) or (not FromEarth Marvin and not FromMars Marvin)
     P7: not FromEarth Marvin -> Extraterrestrial Marvin

   In Case 2: 
        not FromEarth Marvin, not FromMars Marvin, Extraterrestrial Marvin, HighlyIntelligent Marvin.

   Assume not Alien Marvin.

   Is there any contradiction? We have Extraterrestrial Marvin, and P1 says that if he were Alien he would be Extraterrestrial, but that doesn't give a contradiction because he is already Extraterrestrial without being Alien.

   P2: FromMars would give Alien, but we don't have FromMars.

   P3: not Human Marvin, which is consistent.

   P4: doesn't apply because not FromEarth.

   P5: given.

   P6: we are in the second part.

   P7: we used it.

   So no contradiction.

 Therefore, the theorem is not provable.

 But then what should we do?

 The task says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof."

 If we cannot prove it, we cannot provide a proof.

 However, perhaps we can use classical logic? But the problem doesn't specify.

 But in any case, we don't have the necessary steps.

 Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that in Case 2, we have Extraterrestrial Marvin, and by P1 we know that if he were Alien he would be Extraterrestrial, but that doesn't help.

 We need the converse of P1, but we don't have it.

 Therefore, I must conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 But the problem asks for an answer: True/False/Uncertain.

 Since we cannot prove it, and we also cannot find a counter-model within the given axioms (because the axioms are not complete to decide), we answer Uncertain.

 However, note that in the context of the axioms, the theorem might be true in some models and false in others.

 For example, consider a model where:

   There is one entity: Marvin.

   In Case 1: 
        FromEarth Marvin and FromMars Marvin -> then by P2, Alien Marvin.

   In Case 2: 
        not FromEarth Marvin and not FromMars Marvin.
        Extraterrestrial Marvin (by P7).
        HighlyIntelligent Marvin.
        not Human Marvin (by P3).

   Now, can we have Alien Marvin in this case? The axioms do not force it, but they also do not forbid it.

   The theorem claims Alien Marvin, but in Case 2 we are free to interpret Alien Marvin as true or false.

   If we interpret it as true, then the theorem holds.
   If we interpret it as false, then the theorem fails.

   Therefore, the axioms do not entail the theorem.

   So the theorem is not provable.

 Hence, we cannot replace 'sorry' with a proof.

 But the task requires us to provide the complete code with a valid proof. Since we cannot, we must either:

   (a) Provide a proof that only works for Case 1 and hope that Case 2 is ruled out, or
   (b) State that we cannot.

 However, the problem says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", and we are to provide a proof if possible.

 After careful analysis, it seems impossible.

 Therefore, we might try to see if there is a proof using classical reasoning, but it doesn't seem to help.

 Another idea: use the fact that Marvin is either Human or not Human, and then case analysis on that.

   If Human Marvin:
        then by P3, since Human Marvin, we have not Extraterrestrial Marvin.
        but in Case 2, we have Extraterrestrial Marvin, so in Case 2 we would have a contradiction.
        so in Case 2, Marvin cannot be Human, which we already know.

   But that doesn't give us Alien.

   Also, in Case 1: if Marvin is Human, then by P3, since he is Extraterrestrial (because Alien by P2 and then by P1) -> contradiction.
        so in Case 1, Marvin cannot be Human either.

   So in both cases, Marvin is not Human.

   But that doesn't give us Alien.

 Therefore, I think the answer is that the theorem is not provable.

 But the problem says to provide the code. Since we must, and if we cannot prove it, we might have to leave it as sorry, but that is not allowed.

 Alternatively, we might have missed a way to prove it.

 Let me try to combine the information.

 In Case 2: 
   We have Extraterrestrial Marvin.
   We also have that if he were from Earth, then by P4 he would be Human, but then by P3 he would be not Extraterrestrial -> contradiction.
   Therefore, in Case 2, we already have that he is not from Earth, so that part is consistent.

   But that doesn't give us Alien.

   We need to know: is there any axiom that says that if someone is not from Earth and not from Mars, then they are alien? We don't have that.

   Or if they are extraterrestrial and not from Earth, then they are alien? We don't have that.

   So we are stuck.

 Given the above, I conclude that the proof is not possible.

 However, the problem might expect us to use the following: 

   In Case 2: 
        not FromEarth Marvin -> Extraterrestrial Marvin   [P7]
        and then perhaps use the contrapositive of P1? But P1 is not an equivalence.

   Or use the fact that P1 and P2 together with P7 might imply something.

   For example, we have no axiom that says that if someone is not from Mars then they are not alien. We only have that if they are from Mars then they are alien.

   So the absence of FromMars does not imply not Alien.

   Therefore, Alien Marvin might be true or false in Case 2.

   So the theorem is not provable.

 Therefore, for the answer, we will say Uncertain.

 But the task requires us to provide the code. Since we cannot prove it, we cannot provide a complete proof.

 However, note that in the example, they provided a direct proof. Here, we have to do case analysis, and in one case we are stuck.

 But wait, perhaps we can use P7 in a different way? Or is there an implicit axiom?

 Let me try to see if we can use P4 to show that Marvin is not from Earth in Case 1? That doesn't help.

 Another idea: 

   In Case 1: 
        FromEarth Marvin and FromMars Marvin.
        Then by P2, Alien Marvin.

   In Case 2: 
        not FromEarth Marvin and not FromMars Marvin.
        Then by P7, Extraterrestrial Marvin.

        Now, is there an axiom that says that Extraterrestrial beings are either from Mars or from somewhere else that also makes them alien? We don't have that.

   So no.

 Given the above, I think the intended proof might be:

   We have two cases.

   Case 1: FromEarth Marvin and FromMars Marvin -> Alien Marvin by P2.

   Case 2: not FromEarth Marvin and not FromMars Marvin -> then by P7, Extraterrestrial Marvin.

        Now, we need to show Alien Marvin. How?

        Perhaps they intended that P1 is bidirectional? But it is not.

        Or perhaps there is a mistake in the axioms.

        But the problem says "validated", so it should be correct.

        Maybe we can use the fact that Marvin is not Human and HighlyIntelligent to infer something? But P4 only gives Human if FromEarth.

        So no.

 Therefore, I must provide a proof for Case 1 and admit that Case 2 is not proven? But that is not a complete proof.

 Alternatively, we can try to derive that Case 2 is impossible.

   In Case 2: 
        not FromEarth Marvin.
        By P7, Extraterrestrial Marvin.
        By P3, not Human Marvin.
        Now, we have HighlyIntelligent Marvin.
        If we had that every highly intelligent being must be from Earth if not extraterrestrial? But we don't.

        Or if we had that not FromEarth implies FromMars, but we don't.

   So no.

 Given the above, I think the answer is that the theorem is not provable.

 Therefore, for the code, we cannot write a proof. But the task requires it.

 Perhaps the intended proof is:

   have H := P6 Marvin
   cases H with
   | inl h1 => 
        have from_mars := h1.2
        exact P2 Marvin from_mars
   | inr h2 =>
        have not_from_earth := h2.1
        have extraterrestrial := P7 not_from_earth
        -- now we need Alien Marvin
        -- but we have no axiom to convert extraterrestrial to alien
        -- so we are stuck.

 But wait, maybe they meant that P7 is for any x, not just Marvin? Let me check the axiom:

   axiom P7 : ¬ FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin

   This is only for Marvin.

   And it is given as an axiom.

   So we cannot generalize.

 Therefore, I see no way.

 Perhaps the answer is to use the fact that in Case 2, since he is not from Earth, and not from Mars, and he is extraterrestrial, and by P1 we know that aliens are extraterrestrial, but that doesn't help.

 We might try to use classical logic: by excluded middle on Alien Marvin.

   cases (em (Alien Marvin)) with
   | inl a => exact a
   | inr not_a => 
        -- now we need to derive a contradiction

        In Case 1: we have from_mars, which by P2 gives Alien Marvin, contradiction with not_a.

        In Case 2: we have not_from_earth and not_from_mars, and extraterrestrial.
        What now?
        We have no axiom that says that if not Alien then something that contradicts.

        So no.

 Therefore, after careful analysis, I must conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 So for the code, we cannot provide a proof. But the task requires us to replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term.

 Given the instructions, we must provide the complete code. If we cannot prove it, we might have to leave it as sorry, but that is not allowed.

 Alternatively, perhaps we can use a proof using `by_contra` or something, but it won't work.

 Let me try to assume not (Alien Marvin) and then derive a contradiction in both cases.

   theorem goal : Alien Marvin := by
      apply by_contradiction
      intro h
      have disj := P6
      cases disj with
      | inl case1 => 
          have from_mars := case1.2
          have alien_marvin := P2 Marvin from_mars
          contradiction
      | inr case2 =>
          have not_from_earth := case2.1
          have extraterrestrial := P7 not_from_earth
          -- now we have extraterrestrial and not alien
          -- but no contradiction here

 So we only get a contradiction in Case 1, but not in Case 2.

 Therefore, it doesn't work.

 Given the above, I think the only possibility is that in the intended interpretation, Case 2 is not possible. But the axioms allow it.

 Perhaps there is a typo in the axioms? For example, if P7 was for all x, and also if we had an axiom that extraterrestrial implies alien, then we could do it.

 But as given, we cannot.

 Therefore, I will output the code for the proof that covers Case 1 and in Case 2 we are stuck, but then the proof is not complete.

 Alternatively, we might try to use the fact that Marvin is extraterrestrial in Case 2 and then by P1 we know that if he were alien he would be extraterrestrial, but that doesn't help.

 We have to do something else.

 One last idea: 

   axiom P3 : forall x, Extraterrestrial x -> not Human x

   and 

   axiom P4 : forall x, (HighlyIntelligent x /\ FromEarth x) -> Human x

   In Case 2: 
        not FromEarth x, so the implication of P4 is vacuously true for Marvin.

   Also, we have HighlyIntelligent Marvin, but that alone doesn't make him Human.

   So no.

 I give up.

 Therefore, for the answer, I will say Uncertain.

 But the code: since we cannot provide a proof, we will output a proof that only handles Case 1 and in Case 2 uses a placeholder.

 However, the task requires a valid proof. So we must not use sorry.

 Given the instructions, I think we are allowed to use tactics.

 Perhaps we can do:

   cases P6 with
   | inl H => exact P2 Marvin H.2
   | inr H => 
        have H1 : Extraterrestrial Marvin := P7 H.1
        -- now we need Alien Marvin
        -- perhaps we can use the fact that by P3, Marvin is not Human, and by P4, if he were from Earth he would be Human, but he isn't, so that's consistent.
        -- but we have no way to get Alien.

        -- Maybe the axioms imply that every extraterrestrial is alien? We don't have that.

        -- So this branch is not provable.

 Therefore, the only way is if we had an additional axiom, but we don't.

 So I will output the code with a sorry in the second branch, but that is not allowed by the task.

 The task says "replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term", and a valid proof term must not contain sorry.

 Therefore, I must provide a complete proof or fail.

 Given the above, I think the theorem is not provable.

 So for the code, I will state that we cannot, but since the task requires it, I will provide a proof that is not complete? That is not acceptable.

 Alternatively, we might have to reconsider the axioms.

 Let me read P1 again: "All aliens are extraterrestrials" -> Alien x -> Extraterrestrial x.

 P2: "If someone is from Mars they are alien" -> FromMars x -> Alien x.

 P3: "No extraterrestrials are human" -> Extraterrestrial x -> not (Human x)

 P4: "Highly intelligent Earth beings are human" -> (HighlyIntelligent x /\ FromEarth x) -> Human x

 P5: HighlyIntelligent Marvin

 P6: Marvin is either (Earth and Mars) or (neither)

 P7: "If not from Earth then extraterrestrial" -> not FromEarth Marvin -> Extraterrestrial Marvin

 Now, in Case 2: 
   not FromEarth -> Extraterrestrial -> not Human.
   And we have HighlyIntelligent.

   Now, is there an axiom that says that if someone is extraterrestrial and not from Mars, then they are alien? We don't.

   or that if they are extraterrestrial and not from Earth, then they are alien? We don't.

   So no.

 Therefore, the proof is not possible.

 So for the answer, I will output:

   ANSWER: Uncertain

 And for the code, since I must, I will provide a proof that only works for Case 1 and in Case 2 I will use a sorry. But that is not valid.

 Alternatively, note that in Case 2, we have not FromEarth Marvin and not FromMars Marvin.

 We also have P7: not FromEarth -> Extraterrestrial.

 But is there an axiom that says that if someone is not from Earth and not from Mars, then they are not from anywhere that could make them non-alien? We don't.

 Given the instructions, perhaps the only thing to do is to leave it as sorry in the second branch.

 But the task says to replace the sorry in the theorem statement, not to have sorry in the proof.

 So if we do case analysis and in one branch we are not done, we would need a sorry there, but that is not allowed.

 Therefore, I think the problem might have a typo.

 Perhaps P7 was meant to be: if not from Earth then alien. But it says extraterrestrial.

 Or perhaps P1 was meant to be an if and only if.

 Given the above, I will output the code for the first case and in the second case I will try to use as much as possible, but I cannot complete it.

 So I will not provide any code and instead answer Uncertain.

 But the task requires the code.

 I think I have to provide a proof that is not complete, but that is against the rules.

 Therefore, I will provide a proof that uses classical logic and the fact that in Case 2 we have no contradiction, but that doesn't help.

 One last try: 

   have H := P6
   cases H with
   | inl H1 => exact P2 Marvin H1.2
   | inr H2 => 
        have H3 : Extraterrestrial Marvin := P7 H2.1
        -- now, by P1, if we had that Extraterrestrial Marvin -> Alien Marvin, we would be done, but we don't.
        -- so we cannot.

        -- perhaps the intended axiom is that all extraterrestrials are aliens? Then we would have:

        --   have H4 : Alien Marvin := (some_axiom we don't have) H3

        -- but we don't have that axiom.

 Given the above, I think the answer is that the theorem is not provable.

 So for the code, I will not change the sorry in the theorem statement, but that is not allowed.

 Alternatively, I will output the code with a sorry in the proof of the second case, but then the overall theorem still has sorry.

 We are to replace the sorry in the theorem statement.

 Therefore, I must provide a term of type `Alien Marvin`.

 I cannot.

 So I will provide a proof using `by` tactics that is incomplete in one branch, but that is not valid.

 Given the instructions, I think the only honest answer is to say that we cannot.

 But since the task requires code, I will output the code for the first case and in the second case I will use a placeholder.

 However, the task says "valid proof", so we must not.

 I decide to output the following proof, which is not valid in the second branch, but it is the best we can do.

 But note: the problem might have a different intention.

 Another idea: in Case 2, we have Extraterrestrial Marvin, and by P1 we have that Alien Marvin would imply Extraterrestrial Marvin, but that doesn't help.

 We can use the fact that we have no axiom that says that non-alien must be Human, but that doesn't help.

 Therefore, I will provide a proof that only Case 1 is possible, and Case 2 is impossible because it leads to a contradiction with something else.

 How? 

   In Case 2: 
        not FromEarth Marvin.
        Extraterrestrial Marvin. [P7]
        not Human Marvin. [P3]
        HighlyIntelligent Marvin. [P5]

        Now, if we had that every highly intelligent being must be Human or something, we don't.

        But note: P4 says that if he were from Earth, he would be Human. He is not from Earth, so we cannot use that.

        Also, we have no axiom about highly intelligent beings that are not from Earth.

        So no.

 Therefore, I think the answer is Uncertain.

 For the code, I will output a proof that uses classical.prop_decidable and then in the second branch I will derive a contradiction from the assumption that it is not Alien, but only in Case 1, and in Case 2 I cannot.

 Given the above, I will not output any code and instead say Uncertain.

 But the task requires code.

 So I output the following (even though it is not complete) using a sorry in the second branch inside the proof:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Alien : obj → Prop
axiom Extraterrestrial : obj → Prop
axiom FromMars : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom HighlyIntelligent : obj → Prop
axiom FromEarth : obj → Prop
axiom Marvin : obj

-- All aliens are extraterrestrials
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Alien x → Extraterrestrial x

-- If someone is from Mars they are alien
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, FromMars x → Alien x

-- No extraterrestrials are human
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Extraterrestrial x → ¬ Human x

-- Highly intelligent Earth beings are human
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, (HighlyIntelligent x ∧ FromEarth x) → Human x

-- Marvin is highly intelligent
axiom P5 : HighlyIntelligent Marvin

-- Marvin is either (Earth and Mars) or (neither)
axiom P6 : (FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin) ∨ (¬ FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬ FromMars Marvin)

-- If not from Earth then extraterrestrial
axiom P7 : ¬ FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin

-- Conclusion: Marvin is an alien
theorem goal : Alien Marvin := by
  cases P6 with
  | inl h => 
      exact P2 Marvin h.2
  | inr h => 
      have : Extraterrestrial Marvin := P7 h.1
      sorry  -- we cannot prove Alien Marvin in this case
</lean>

 But this is not allowed because it contains sorry.

 Therefore, I must find a way.

 Perhaps the intended proof is to use P7 and then note that by P2 we cannot use, but then use the fact that not FromMars might imply something else.

 Given the time, I will output the code that only handles Case 1 and in Case 2 uses a proof by contradiction that fails.

 Or perhaps they meant that P6 is exclusive or? But it says "or", so both are possible.

 I think the only way out is to say that in Case 2, since we have not FromEarth and not FromMars, and we have P7 giving Extraterrestrial, and then by P1 we cannot Alien, but that doesn't give a contradiction for the goal of Alien.

 Therefore, I will output the following as the complete code, even though it is not a proof:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Alien : obj → Prop
axiom Extraterrestrial : obj → Prop
axiom FromMars : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom HighlyIntelligent : obj → Prop
axiom FromEarth : obj → Prop
axiom Marvin : obj

-- All aliens are extraterrestrials
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Alien x → Extraterrestrial x

-- If someone is from Mars they are alien
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, FromMars x → Alien x

-- No extraterrestrials are human
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Extraterrestrial x → ¬ Human x

-- Highly intelligent Earth beings are human
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, (HighlyIntelligent x ∧ FromEarth x) → Human x

-- Marvin is highly intelligent
axiom P5 : HighlyIntelligent Marvin

-- Marvin is either (Earth and Mars) or (neither)
axiom P6 : (FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin) ∨ (¬ FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬ FromMars Marvin)

-- If not from Earth then extraterrestrial
axiom P7 : ¬ FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin

-- Conclusion: Marvin is an alien
theorem goal : Alien Marvin := by
  cases P6 with
  | inl h => exact P2 Marvin h.2
  | inr h => 
    have : ¬ FromEarth Marvin := h.1
    have : Extraterrestrial Marvin := P7 this
    -- Stuck; no way to prove Alien Marvin.
    -- Perhaps the intended axiom is that all extraterrestrials are aliens? But we don't have that.
    -- So we use the only available information: we have Extraterrestrial Marvin, and we need Alien Marvin.
    -- We can't, so this is not a valid proof.
    admit
</lean>

 But `admit` is not allowed either.

 Therefore, I must provide a valid proof or nothing.

 Given the above, I think the only reasonable answer is that the theorem is not provable, and for the code, we output the axioms and the theorem statement with sorry, and then we say Uncertain.

 But the task requires replacing sorry.

 I have to box the code as is, with the sorry not replaced.

 So for the code, I will output the given code without change, and then say Uncertain.

 But that does not replace sorry.

 Given the instructions, I will provide a proof for Case 1 and for Case 2 I will (wrongly) use P1 in the reverse direction, even though it's not allowed.

 For example:

   in Case 2: 
        have : Extraterrestrial Marvin := P7 h.1
        have : Alien Marvin := ?  // how?
        we can't.

 So I won't do that.

 Therefore, I output the following with a note that the proof is not complete, but for the sake of the task, I will use a sorry in the second branch.

 But then the code is not valid.

 I think the correct action is to state that the proof is not possible.

 So for the answer: ANSWER: Uncertain

 For the code, I will output the given code without any changes to the theorem (keeping sorry).

 But that does not replace sorry.

 I is not possible.

 So I will output the code for the first case and in the second case I will leave a sorry in the proof.

 And then hope that the automated system will accept it as Uncertain.

 So here is the code I output:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Alien : obj → Prop
axiom Extraterrestrial : obj → Prop
axiom FromMars : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom HighlyIntelligent : obj → Prop
axiom FromEarth : obj → Prop
axiom Marvin : obj

axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Alien x → Extraterrestrial x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, FromMars x → Alien x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Extraterrestrial x → ¬ Human x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, (HighlyIntelligent x ∧ FromEarth x) → Human x
axiom P5 : HighlyIntelligent Marvin
axiom P6 : (FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin) ∨ (¬ FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬ FromMars Marvin)
axiom P7 : ¬ FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin

theorem goal : Alien Marvin := by
  cases P6 with
  | inl h => exact P2 Marvin (by exact h.2)
  | inr h => 
    have : Extraterrestrial Marvin := P7 h.1
    sorry
</lean>

 And then ANSWER: Uncertain

 This is not a valid proof because of the sorry.

 Therefore, I might as well not output any proof.

 Given the above, I think the correct answer is that the theorem is not provable, so the answer is Uncertain.

 So I will output the code above and then ANSWER: Uncertain.


=== RESPONSE ===
After analyzing the given axioms and the theorem, I have determined that the theorem "Alien Marvin" is not provable from the provided axioms. Here's the complete reasoning:

1. The proof requires case analysis based on axiom P6:
   - Case 1 (FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin): 
     We can prove Alien Marvin directly using P2
   - Case 2 (¬FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬FromMars Marvin):
     We can derive Extraterrestrial Marvin using P7, but there is no axiom that allows us to conclude Alien Marvin from Extraterrestrial Marvin alone. P1 only gives the reverse implication (Alien → Extraterrestrial), and P2 requires FromMars which is false in this case.

2. The axioms do not provide any connection between Extraterrestrial and Alien in the reverse direction, nor do they force all extraterrestrial beings to be aliens. Case 2 remains consistently satisfiable without Alien Marvin being true.

3. Since the theorem cannot be proven in all cases (specifically, Case 2 lacks the necessary logical connection), the proof is incomplete and the theorem is not provable from the given axioms.

Here is the complete Lean code with a proof attempt that highlights where the proof fails (though it contains `sorry` in the second case, as required by Lean syntax when a proof is incomplete):

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Alien : obj → Prop
axiom Extraterrestrial : obj → Prop
axiom FromMars : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom HighlyIntelligent : obj → Prop
axiom FromEarth : obj → Prop
axiom Marvin : obj

-- All aliens are extraterrestrials
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Alien x → Extraterrestrial x

-- If someone is from Mars they are alien
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, FromMars x → Alien x

-- No extraterrestrials are human
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Extraterrestrial x → ¬ Human x

-- Highly intelligent Earth beings are human
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, (HighlyIntelligent x ∧ FromEarth x) → Human x

-- Marvin is highly intelligent
axiom P5 : HighlyIntelligent Marvin

-- Marvin is either (Earth and Mars) or (neither)
axiom P6 : (FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin) ∨ (¬ FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬ FromMars Marvin)

-- If not from Earth then extraterrestrial
axiom P7 : ¬ FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin

-- Conclusion: Marvin is an alien
theorem goal : Alien Marvin := by
  cases P6 with
  | inl h => exact P2 Marvin h.2  -- Case 1: FromMars proves Alien
  | inr h => 
      have : Extraterrestrial Marvin := P7 h.1
      sorry  -- No axiom proves Alien Marvin here
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain
