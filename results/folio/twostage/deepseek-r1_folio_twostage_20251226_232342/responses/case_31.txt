STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion about Djokovic.
 We'll model the domain as follows:

 Let the type of people be `obj`.
 We have predicates:
   - `AtMixer : obj → Prop`            (is at the mixer)
   - `GrandSlamChamp : obj → Prop`      (is a Grand Slam champion)
   - `OscarNominated : obj → Prop`      (is an Oscar-nominated actor)
   - `ProfessionalTennis : obj → Prop`  (is a professional tennis player)
   - `Celebrity : obj → Prop`           (is a celebrity)
   - `Athlete : obj → Prop`             (is an athlete)
   - `WellPaid : obj → Prop`            (is well paid)
   - `Famous : obj → Prop`              (is famous)
   - `LivesInTaxHaven : obj → Prop`    (lives in a tax haven)

 We have a constant for Djokovic: `Djokovic : obj`.

 Premises:
 1. "Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor."
    ∀ x, AtMixer x → (GrandSlamChamp x ∨ OscarNominated x)

 2. "Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player."
    ∀ x, AtMixer x → GrandSlamChamp x → ProfessionalTennis x

 3. "All Oscar-nominated actors at the mixer are celebrities."
    ∀ x, AtMixer x → OscarNominated x → Celebrity x

 4. "All professional tennis players at the mixer are athletes."
    ∀ x, AtMixer x → ProfessionalTennis x → Athlete x

 5. "If a person at the mixer is a celebrity, then they are well paid."
    ∀ x, AtMixer x → Celebrity x → WellPaid x

 6. "If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous."
    ∀ x, AtMixer x → Athlete x → Famous x

 7. "All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens."
    ∀ x, AtMixer x → WellPaid x → LivesInTaxHaven x

 8. "Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid."
    Note: This premise is a bit complex. It says two things:
      - Djokovic is at the mixer: AtMixer Djokovic.
      - And then a conditional: if Djokovic is both famous and an athlete, then he is well-paid.
        Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic → WellPaid Djokovic.

    However, note the wording: "Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid."
    This might be interpreted as:
        AtMixer Djokovic ∧ (Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic → WellPaid Djokovic)
    But actually, the colon might be separating two statements? The problem says "Djokovic is at the mixer" and then the rest.

    Alternatively, it might be that the conclusion of the conditional is being stated only in the context of the mixer?
    However, note that the conditional is specifically about Djokovic. Since we know Djokovic is at the mixer, we can write the conditional without the mixer context.

    So we break it into two axioms:
        axiom D_at_mixer : AtMixer Djokovic
        axiom D_cond : Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic → WellPaid Djokovic

 Conclusion:
   LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic

 We'll formalize accordingly.

 Note: There might be a longer chain of reasoning, but we are only to formalize the premises and the conclusion as a theorem without proof.

 Let's set up the axioms and the theorem.


=== RESPONSE ===
To formalize the given premises and conclusion in Lean 4, we define the necessary types, predicates, and axioms. The conclusion is declared as a theorem with a placeholder proof.

   - `GrandSlamChamp`, `OscarNominated`: Properties from premise 1
   - `ProfessionalTennis`, `Celebrity`: Intermediate properties (premises 2-3)
   - `Athlete`, `Famous`: Properties linked to professions (premises 4,6)
   - `WellPaid`, `LivesInTaxHaven`: Financial outcomes (premises 5,7)
3. **Constant**: `Djokovic` as a specific person
4. **Premises**:
   - Formalize each given statement as an axiom with precise quantifiers and implications
   - Premise 8 handles Djokovic's mixer attendance and conditional fact
5. **Theorem**: `djokovic_tax_haven` declares the conclusion that Djokovic lives in a tax haven, using `sorry` for the unproven placeholder.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a theorem to prove: LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic.

Let's analyze the premises:

Premise1: ∀ x, AtMixer x → (GrandSlamChamp x ∨ OscarNominated x)
Premise2: ∀ x, AtMixer x → GrandSlamChamp x → ProfessionalTennis x
Premise3: ∀ x, AtMixer x → OscarNominated x → Celebrity x
Premise4: ∀ x, AtMixer x → ProfessionalTennis x → Athlete x
Premise5: ∀ x, AtMixer x → Celebrity x → WellPaid x
Premise6: ∀ x, AtMixer x → Athlete x → Famous x
Premise7: ∀ x, AtMixer x → WellPaid x → LivesInTaxHaven x
Premise8: AtMixer Djokovic ∧ (Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic → WellPaid Djokovic)

We have Djokovic at the mixer (from Premise8). So we know:
  AtMixer Djokovic

Now, from Premise1 on Djokovic, we get:
  GrandSlamChamp Djokovic ∨ OscarNominated Djokovic

We need to show that Djokovic lives in a tax haven. By Premise7, we need WellPaid Djokovic (given that he is at the mixer). Therefore, we must show WellPaid Djokovic.

Looking at Premise8, we see that if Famous Djokovic and Athlete Djokovic, then WellPaid Djokovic. So we need to show Famous Djokovic and Athlete Djokovic.

Now, let's break down by cases from Premise1.

Case 1: GrandSlamChamp Djokovic
  - By Premise2: AtMixer Djokovic ∧ GrandSlamChamp Djokovic → ProfessionalTennis Djokovic
    So we get ProfessionalTennis Djokovic.
  - Then by Premise4: AtMixer Djokovic ∧ ProfessionalTennis Djokovic → Athlete Djokovic
    So we get Athlete Djokovic.
  - Then by Premise6: AtMixer Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic → Famous Djokovic
    So we get Famous Djokovic.
  - Now we have Famous Djokovic and Athlete Djokovic, so by Premise8 we get WellPaid Djokovic.

Case 2: OscarNominated Djokovic
  - By Premise3: AtMixer Djokovic ∧ OscarNominated Djokovic → Celebrity Djokovic
    So we get Celebrity Djokovic.
  - Then by Premise5: AtMixer Djokovic ∧ Celebrity Djokovic → WellPaid Djokovic
    So we get WellPaid Djokovic.

But note: in the second case, we don't need to show Famous and Athlete. However, we need to show that the two cases both lead to WellPaid Djokovic? Actually, in the second case we directly get WellPaid via Celebrity. But in the first case we also get WellPaid via the conditional in Premise8 (because we got Famous and Athlete). So both cases lead to WellPaid.

However, note that in the second case we don't necessarily have Famous and Athlete? But we don't need them because we get WellPaid via the celebrity path.

So in both cases we can show WellPaid Djokovic.

Then, once we have WellPaid Djokovic, we use Premise7 (with AtMixer Djokovic) to get LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic.

But wait, what about the second case? We get WellPaid through Celebrity. Then we are done for WellPaid.

So we can structure the proof:

1. We have AtMixer Djokovic (from Premise8).
2. We have the disjunction: GrandSlamChamp Djokovic ∨ OscarNominated Djokovic (from Premise1).
3. Case 1: GrandSlamChamp Djokovic
   - Then ProfessionalTennis Djokovic (Premise2)
   - Then Athlete Djokovic (Premise4)
   - Then Famous Djokovic (Premise6)
   - Then with Athlete Djokovic and Famous Djokovic, we use the second part of Premise8: (Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic → WellPaid Djokovic) to get WellPaid Djokovic.
4. Case 2: OscarNominated Djokovic
   - Then Celebrity Djokovic (Premise3)
   - Then WellPaid Djokovic (Premise5)
5. So in both cases we have WellPaid Djokovic.
6. Then by Premise7: we have LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic.

Therefore, we can write the proof in Lean by:

- Extracting AtMixer Djokovic from Premise8 (and the conditional part)
- Then doing cases on the disjunction from Premise1 for Djokovic.

Let h8 := Premise8, which is And AtMixer Djokovic (implication ...)
We can let:
  h_at : AtMixer Djokovic := Premise8.left
  h_cond : (Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic → WellPaid Djokovic) := Premise8.right

Then we have:
  disj := Premise1 Djokovic h_at : GrandSlamChamp Djokovic ∨ OscarNominated Djokovic

Then we do:
  cases disj with
  | inl gs => ... 
  | inr os => ...

In both branches we prove WellPaid Djokovic.

Then we apply Premise7 to Djokovic h_at and the proof of WellPaid Djokovic.

So in Lean code:

Note: We can use tactics in the proof.

But the problem says: use 'by' followed by tactics (no 'begin...end'). We can use the `cases` tactic.

Alternatively, we can write an explicit term, but it might be long. So we'll use a tactic mode proof.

Proof in tactic mode:

theorem djokovic_tax_haven : LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic := by
  -- Premise8 gives us that Djokovic is at the mixer and the conditional
  have hAt : AtMixer Djokovic := Premise8.left
  have hCond : Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic → WellPaid Djokovic := Premise8.right

  -- From Premise1 we get the disjunction
  have disj : GrandSlamChamp Djokovic ∨ OscarNominated Djokovic := Premise1 Djokovic hAt

  -- Case analysis on the disjunction
  cases disj with
  | inl gs => 
      -- Case 1: GrandSlamChamp
      have hTennis : ProfessionalTennis Djokovic := Premise2 Djokovic hAt gs
      have hAthlete : Athlete Djokovic := Premise4 Djokovic hAt hTennis
      have hFamous : Famous Djokovic := Premise6 Djokovic hAt hAthlete
      have hWellPaid : WellPaid Djokovic := hCond ⟨hFamous, hAthlete⟩
      exact Premise7 Djokovic hAt hWellPaid
  | inr os =>
      -- Case 2: OscarNominated
      have hCeleb : Celebrity Djokovic := Premise3 Djokovic hAt os
      have hWellPaid : WellPaid Djokovic := Premise5 Djokovic hAt hCeleb
      exact Premise7 Djokovic hAt hWellPaid

But note: we have to be careful. Actually the theorem statement is `LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic`, so we can finish by applying Premise7 in both cases as above.

Alternatively, we can also build the proof step by step and then apply Premise7 at the end.

But in the above, we are returning the proof term in each branch. We could also prove `WellPaid Djokovic` and then `LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic` in the main part.

But it's the same.

Let's write it without having to write the same last step twice:

theorem djokovic_tax_haven : LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic := by
  have hAt : AtMixer Djokovic := Premise8.left
  have hCond : Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic → WellPaid Djokovic := Premise8.right
  have disj := Premise1 Djokovic hAt
  have hWellPaid : WellPaid Djokovic := by
    cases disj with
    | inl gs => 
        have hTennis := Premise2 Djokovic hAt gs
        have hAthlete := Premise4 Djokovic hAt hTennis
        have hFamous := Premise6 Djokovic hAt hAthlete
        exact hCond ⟨hFamous, hAthlete⟩
    | inr os =>
        have hCeleb := Premise3 Djokovic hAt os
        exact Premise5 Djokovic hAt hCeleb
  exact Premise7 Djokovic hAt hWellPaid

But we are allowed to use tactics so either way.

Now, note: using `have` is fine.

But we can also avoid naming and chain with `match` (but `cases` is fine).

We'll write the proof accordingly.

Let me write the complete code.

IMPORTANT: We must not change the axioms or theorem statement. Only replace `sorry`.
