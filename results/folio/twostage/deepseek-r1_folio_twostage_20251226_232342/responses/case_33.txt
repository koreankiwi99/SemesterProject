STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the following premises and conclusion.

Premises:
1. Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE.
2. Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine.
3. Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile.
4. Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine.

Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.

We need to model:
- Objects: stables, wrestlers (or groups), WWE, etc.
- Properties: being a professional wrestling stable, being formed in WWE, leading a stable, including members (the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile), having a feud.

However, note that the conclusion only requires that Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.

We'll define:
- A type for stables. Let's call it `Stable`.
- A type for wrestlers or wrestling entities. Let's call it `Wrestler`.

But note: "Diamond Mine" is a stable. "Roderick Strong", "the Creed Brothers", and "Ivy Nile" are wrestlers (or groups? but note the problem says "includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile" - so they are members). Also, "Imperium" is probably another stable.

We might need:
- `axiom Stable : Type`
- `axiom Wrestler : Type`

But we also have individuals that are groups? Alternatively, we can have a type for any entity, but that might complicate.

Alternatively, we might model stables and individuals separately? Since the conclusion only cares about stables and who leads them, we can try:

Let's define:
- `obj` as the universe of discourse. It includes stables, wrestlers, and groups (like the Creed Brothers) and others.

But note: the premise "Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE" suggests that Diamond Mine is a stable. Then "Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine" suggests that Roderick Strong is a wrestler (or a leader) leading a stable.

We can do:

```
axiom obj : Type
axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom RoderickStrong : obj
axiom CreedBrothers : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj
axiom Imperium : obj

-- Properties and relations:

-- `IsProfessionalWrestlingStable x` : x is a professional wrestling stable.
axiom IsProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj → Prop

-- `FormedInWWE x` : x is formed in WWE. (But note: we don't have WWE? But the problem says "formed in WWE", so we might need to represent WWE too? Or we can skip it if not used in the conclusion.)

-- However, the conclusion does not require the WWE part, so we can ignore it in the conclusion. But we have to represent the premises. But note: the first premise says "Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE". We can break it as:
--   Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable AND Diamond Mine was formed in WWE.

-- But our conclusion only requires that Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable. We don't need the fact about formation? However, we do need to represent the premises for the logical structure.

-- Alternatively, we might model the first premise as two facts? But in the conclusion, we only need that Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable (to support that Roderick Strong leads such a stable).

-- We decide to model:
axiom T1 : IsProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
axiom T2 : FormedInWWE DiamondMine   -- even if not used in conclusion, we are formalizing the premises.

-- `Leads x y` : x leads stable y. (But note: the second premise: Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine.)
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop

axiom T3 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine

-- `Includes x y`: stable x includes member y.
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop

axiom T4 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
axiom T5 : Includes DiamondMine IvyNile

-- `HasFeudWith x y` : stable (or group?) x has feud with stable y.
axiom HasFeudWith : obj → obj → Prop

axiom T6 : HasFeudWith Imperium DiamondMine

-- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.
-- We need: There exists a stable (which is professional wrestling) that Roderick Strong leads.

-- But note: in the premises, we only know about Diamond Mine. So we can state the existence.

theorem goal : ∃ s : obj, IsProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := ...

However, note: the conclusion does not say "leads at least one", but from the context, we know that Diamond Mine is one. But the conclusion is "leads a professional wrestling stable" which exists. We can existentially quantify.

But is it accurate? The conclusion is just stating a property of Roderick Strong: that he leads some professional wrestling stable. We don't care which. We know Diamond Mine is one, so we can prove that.

Alternatively, we can define:

```
theorem goal : ∃ (s : obj), IsProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s
```

But note: not every object is a stable. We don't have a predicate for being a stable? We have `IsProfessionalWrestlingStable` which implies that the object is a stable? Probably.

Alternatively, we might also introduce a type for stables? Then we don't mix them with wrestlers? But the problem says that Diamond Mine is a stable, and also we have wrestlers. And the `Leads` relation: first argument is a wrestler (RoderickStrong) and second is a stable? But we have mixed in `obj`.

Another approach: separate types.

Let me try:

```
axiom Wrestler : Type
axiom Stable : Type

-- We have specific entities:

axiom DiamondMine : Stable
axiom RoderickStrong : Wrestler
axiom CreedBrothers : Wrestler   -- assuming they are a single entity? Or they are a tag team? But we can model them as a single entity for simplicity.
axiom IvyNile : Wrestler
axiom Imperium : Stable

-- Now properties:

-- A stable is naturally a professional wrestling stable? But the first premise says Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable. We can have a predicate if not all stables are professional wrestling stables? But the conclusion might require that the stable is professional wrestling.

-- Alternatively, we don't have a predicate for being a professional wrestling stable? Because in the context, all stables are professional wrestling? But the problem states it as a property.

-- So we'll have:
axiom IsProfessionalWrestlingStable : Stable → Prop

axiom T1 : IsProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
axiom FormedInWWE : Stable → Prop
axiom T2 : FormedInWWE DiamondMine

-- Leads: a wrestler leads a stable.
axiom Leads : Wrestler → Stable → Prop
axiom T3 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine

-- Includes: a stable includes a wrestler (or a group? But we are modeling CreedBrothers as a wrestler entity).
axiom Includes : Stable → Wrestler → Prop
axiom T4 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
axiom T5 : Includes DiamondMine IvyNile

-- Feud between stables? Or between any entities? The problem says "Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine". Imperium is a stable and Diamond Mine is a stable.
axiom HasFeudWith : Stable → Stable → Prop
axiom T6 : HasFeudWith Imperium DiamondMine

-- Now the conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable.
-- We can say: There exists a stable s that is a professional wrestling stable and Roderick Strong leads s.

theorem goal : ∃ (s : Stable), IsProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := ...

But note: we only know about DiamondMine, so we can use that in the proof (but we are not proving, just writing the theorem).

However, the problem only says "Imperium" and "Diamond Mine" are stables? But the conclusion is about Roderick Strong leading a stable. We know he leads DiamondMine, and DiamondMine is a professional wrestling stable.

So the theorem is:

theorem goal : ∃ (s : Stable), IsProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s

But wait: the conclusion doesn't say there exists, it just says "leads a ...", which is an existential. Alternatively, we could interpret that he leads at least one, which is existential.

Alternatively, we could have a predicate `LeadsAProfessionalWrestlingStable` for Roderick Strong? But the existential is more in line with the natural language.

Given the context, I'll choose the two-type approach (Wrestler and Stable) because it's more structured.

But note: the problem says "Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable", so we have a stable. Then "includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile". In this model, they are wrestlers, so we have the `Includes` relation from a stable to a wrestler.

However, the Creed Brothers are a tag team? But we are modeling them as a single wrestler entity? That might be acceptable.

Also, Imperium is another stable.

Now, what about the formation? We don't use it in the conclusion.

Let me write the Lean code accordingly.

But note: the example had only one type `obj`. We are using two. That is acceptable.

However, the user did not provide any types, so we are free to model.

Alternatively, we can do with one type if we have a predicate for being a stable and being a wrestler? But that might complicate the relations (like `Includes` must hold between a stable and a wrestler). Then we need to add type constraints? But Lean is a dependently typed language, we can do:

But in this case, I think the two-type approach is clearer.

But let me check: the conclusion only requires to express that Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable. The one-type approach would be simpler? Because we don't have to introduce quantification over a subtype (we are using a separate type for stable). But in the two-type approach, we are using `∃ (s : Stable), ...` which is fine.

I'll go with the two-type approach.

But note: the Lean environment must know `Stable` and `Wrestler` are types. We are not using `Type` for the specific entities? Actually, we are:

We are declaring:
`Wrestler : Type` -> this is the type of wrestlers, but then `RoderickStrong : Wrestler` is an instance? Correct.

Similarly, `Stable : Type` and `DiamondMine : Stable`.

Now, for the theorems, the goal is:

`theorem goal : ∃ (s : Stable), IsProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry`

But note: we have not defined `IsProfessionalWrestlingStable` for every stable? Only that we have it as a predicate. And we have evidence for `DiamondMine`.

Now, let me write the code:

<lean>
axiom Wrestler : Type
axiom Stable : Type

axiom DiamondMine : Stable
axiom RoderickStrong : Wrestler
axiom CreedBrothers : Wrestler
axiom IvyNile : Wrestler
axiom Imperium : Stable

axiom IsProfessionalWrestlingStable : Stable → Prop
axiom FormedInWWE : Stable → Prop
axiom Leads : Wrestler → Stable → Prop
axiom Includes : Stable → Wrestler → Prop
axiom HasFeudWith : Stable → Stable → Prop

axiom T1 : IsProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
axiom T2 : FormedInWWE DiamondMine
axiom T3 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
axiom T4 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
axiom T5 : Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom T6 : HasFeudWith Imperium DiamondMine

theorem goal : ∃ s : Stable, IsProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry
</lean>

This seems to capture the premises and the conclusion.

Note: we could have avoided the `FormedInWWE` if we didn't think it was necessary, but the premise explicitly says "formed in WWE", so we include it.

Also, the `HasFeudWith` relation is between stables? Yes, because we have `Imperium` and `DiamondMine` both as stables.

But note: what if we don't use `FormedInWWE` and `HasFeudWith` in the theorem? The theorem might still be provable? It just relies on `T1` and `T3`. So it's okay.

Alternatively, we could have used one universe `obj` to have a simpler type structure? The two-type approach is more structured and we can avoid having the need to say that DiamondMine is a stable (because it is of type `Stable`). But in the one-type approach, we would have:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom RoderickStrong : obj
axiom CreedBrothers : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj
axiom Imperium : obj

axiom IsProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj → Prop
axiom FormedInWWE : obj → Prop
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom HasFeudWith : obj → obj → Prop

axiom IsStable : obj → Prop
-- But then we need constraints? Like, DiamondMine is a stable? 

axiom stable_DiamondMine : IsStable DiamondMine
axiom stable_Imperium : IsStable Imperium

-- Also, we must specify that the first argument of `Leads` is a wrestler? But we don't have a predicate for wrestlers? We could, but it gets more messy.

-- Then the theorem becomes:
theorem goal : ∃ s : obj, IsStable s ∧ IsProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry

But now we have an extra predicate `IsStable` that we didn't have in the two-type approach. Also, we have to add that DiamondMine is a stable, which was implicit by the type in the two-type approach.

Given that, I think the two-type approach is cleaner.

But the example in the instruction used `obj` for everything. The instruction says to use the same style. However, it also says "correct TYPE declarations", and we are free to model as needed.

Alternatively, we might combine the two: have one universe `obj` and then use predicates for stable and wrestler? But that leads to more axioms.

I think the two-type approach is acceptable.

But note: the instruction in the beginning: "You are a logician that translates natural language premises and conclusions to Lean 4 axiom definitions." and the example used a single type `obj`. However, that example didn't require multiple disjoint sets.

Given the problem, we have two disjoint kinds: stables and wrestlers. We have relations that cross the two (like `Leads` and `Includes`). So having two types seems natural.

Alternatively, we can model everything as `obj` and not have any type constraints, but then we cannot enforce that `Includes` is only between a stable and a wrestler? But in the reasoning, we don't need to enforce type constraints? Because we just rely on the axioms we state.

And we have to state explicitly that DiamondMine is a stable? Well, the premise says it is a stable. But for the purpose of the conclusion, we might not even need the `IsStable` predicate? Because the property `IsProfessionalWrestlingStable` already implies that it is a stable? But we haven't defined that relation.

Actually, in the example, they didn't have to state that Cat is an object: it's statically known. Similarly, in our one-type approach, we could avoid a predicate `IsStable`? But then how do we know what is a stable? For the existential, we would be looking for any object that is a professional wrestling stable and leads. But note: we have no rule that says a professional wrestling stable must also be a stable? We haven't defined that. We might not need it.

However, in the one-type approach, we can write:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom RoderickStrong : obj
axiom CreedBrothers : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj
axiom Imperium : obj

axiom IsProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj → Prop
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
-- We skip the formation and feud because the conclusion doesn't require, but we must include the premises? Actually, the problem says to formalize all premises.

-- We cannot skip premises? We include all mentioned.

axiom FormedInWWE : obj → Prop
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom HasFeudWith : obj → obj → Prop

axiom P1 : IsProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
axiom P2 : FormedInWWE DiamondMine
axiom P3 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
-- For includes: we have two
axiom P4 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
axiom P5 : Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom P6 : HasFeudWith Imperium DiamondMine

theorem goal : ∃ s : obj, IsProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry
</lean>

In this one, we don't have `IsStable`. But then we don't enforce that only stables can be professional wrestling stables? But that is okay because in our premises we only have one stable and we are quantifying existentially over any object.

But note: how do we know that the stable in the existential is DiamondMine? Because we have a proof for `IsProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine` and `Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine`. So we can use `s = DiamondMine` in the proof (but we are not proving).

This is simpler and matches the example.

So I will choose the one-type approach to stick to the example.

Let me write the code accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion, I'll formalize the logical structure in Lean 4. The key elements are:

1. Diamond Mine as a professional wrestling stable
2. Roderick Strong's leadership role
3. The conclusion about Roderick Strong leading such a stable

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom RoderickStrong : obj
axiom CreedBrothers : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj
axiom Imperium : obj

axiom IsProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj → Prop
axiom FormedInWWE : obj → Prop
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom HasFeudWith : obj → obj → Prop

-- Premise: Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable formed in WWE
axiom P1 : IsProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
axiom P2 : FormedInWWE DiamondMine

-- Premise: Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine
axiom P3 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine

-- Premise: Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers and Ivy Nile
axiom P4 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
axiom P5 : Includes DiamondMine IvyNile

-- Premise: Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine
axiom P6 : HasFeudWith Imperium DiamondMine

-- Conclusion: Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable
theorem goal : ∃ (s : obj), IsProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s := sorry
</lean>

This formalization:
- Uses `obj` as the base type for all entities
- Declares specific individuals/stables as constants
- Defines necessary predicates (properties and relations)
- Formalizes each premise as an axiom
- Represents the conclusion as an existential claim using `sorry` as placeholder


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and need to prove the existence of a stable `s` such that `s` is a professional wrestling stable and Roderick Strong leads `s`.
 From the axioms, we know:
   - DiamondMine is a professional wrestling stable (P1)
   - Roderick Strong leads DiamondMine (P3)

 Therefore, we can use DiamondMine as the witness for the existential quantifier.

 Proof term: 
   We need to prove: ∃ (s : obj), IsProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s
   We choose s = DiamondMine and then we have:
      IsProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine (by P1) 
      and 
      Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine (by P3)

 So the proof term is: ⟨DiamondMine, P1, P3⟩

 However, note that the theorem states `∧`, so we need to provide two proofs: one for each conjunct.

 In Lean, we can write: exists DiamondMine, and then we have to prove the conjunction.
 We can do: ⟨DiamondMine, ⟨P1, P3⟩⟩ or more simply: ⟨DiamondMine, P1, P3⟩ because the existential quantifier in Lean is defined to take multiple arguments.

 But note: The theorem goal is:
   ∃ (s : obj), IsProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s

 The term for that is: 
   Exists.intro DiamondMine (And.intro P1 P3)

 We can use the shorthand: ⟨DiamondMine, P1, P3⟩

 However, to be precise: 
   The type of `⟨DiamondMine, P1, P3⟩` is:
      IsProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine ∧ Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
   which is exactly the body of the existential after substituting DiamondMine for s.

 Therefore, the entire proof is: ⟨DiamondMine, P1, P3⟩

 We write the complete code with the proof.


=== RESPONSE ===
To solve this, we need to prove the existence of a professional wrestling stable led by Roderick Strong using the provided axioms. Here's the complete solution:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom RoderickStrong : obj
axiom CreedBrothers : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj
axiom Imperium : obj

axiom IsProfessionalWrestlingStable : obj → Prop
axiom FormedInWWE : obj → Prop
axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom HasFeudWith : obj → obj → Prop

axiom P1 : IsProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine
axiom P2 : FormedInWWE DiamondMine
axiom P3 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
axiom P4 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
axiom P5 : Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom P6 : HasFeudWith Imperium DiamondMine

theorem goal : ∃ (s : obj), IsProfessionalWrestlingStable s ∧ Leads RoderickStrong s :=
  ⟨DiamondMine, P1, P3⟩
</lean>

**Proof Explanation:**
1. Axiom `P1` establishes that `DiamondMine` is a professional wrestling stable
2. Axiom `P3` proves that `RoderickStrong` leads `DiamondMine`
3. The existential constructor `⟨ ⟩` combines:
   - The witness `DiamondMine`
   - Proof of `IsProfessionalWrestlingStable DiamondMine` (via `P1`)
   - Proof of `Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine` (via `P3`)

ANSWER: **True**  
The proof demonstrates that Diamond Mine satisfies both conditions: it is a stable and is led by Roderick Strong.
