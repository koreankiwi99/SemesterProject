STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion to formalize.
 The domain seems to be about design styles or buildings that Max adores.
 We'll need to define objects (designs or styles) and properties.

 Let's break down the premises:

 1. "All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries."
    We can interpret: For every design style x that is by Zaha Hadid and that Max adores, x has interesting geometries.

 2. "No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries."
    This means: For every brutalist building x that Max adores, x does not have interesting geometries.

 3. "Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style."
    So: For every design style x that Max adores, it is either by Zaha Hadid or by Kelly Wearstler.

 4. "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative."
    For every design style x by Kelly Wearstler that Max adores, x is evocative.

 5. "All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy."
    Similarly: For every design style x by Kelly Wearstler that Max adores, x is dreamy.

 6. "If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative."
    Note: This says "a design by Max", so we might need to consider that Max can design too? But the conclusion is about a design by Max.

 However, note that the conclusion is: "A design by Max is a brutalist building."

 But wait: the premises talk about designs by Zaha Hadid and Kelly Wearstler, and also brutalist buildings. Now we have designs by Max.

 Let me re-read: "If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative."

 So we have designs by Max. And the conclusion is about a design by Max.

 How do we relate designs by Max to the other styles? The premises don't explicitly say that Max adores his own designs? But the condition in premise 6 is about a design by Max that he adores.

 The conclusion: "A design by Max is a brutalist building." 
 But note: the conclusion does not specify that Max adores it? However, the premises are mostly about what Max adores.

 We must be cautious: the conclusion might be intended to be about a design by Max that he adores? But the statement doesn't say that.

 However, looking at the premises, they all condition on Max adoring the design. The conclusion might be missing that condition? But the problem states: "A design by Max is a brutalist building."

 Since the problem is given as is, we'll formalize as stated.

 But note: without the condition of adoration, we cannot use the premises that require adoration. So perhaps the conclusion is about a design by Max that he adores? Or maybe we are to assume that Max adores his own design? The premises don't say.

 However, the problem says: "Conclusion to formalize: A design by Max is a brutalist building."

 We'll formalize the conclusion as: For every design by Max, it is a brutalist building? Or maybe we are to show that there exists one? But the statement is general.

 But the premises don't talk about designs by Max in general, only about those that he adores. So without adoration, we have no information.

 This suggests that the conclusion might be incomplete. However, we are to formalize exactly as given.

 Alternatively, the problem might be implying that we are considering designs that Max adores? But the conclusion does not say that.

 Let me see the entire problem again:

 Premises:
  1. All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
  2. No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
  3. Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.
  4. All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
  5. All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
  6. If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.

 Conclusion: A design by Max is a brutalist building.

 Without the adoration condition in the conclusion, we cannot use the premises. So I suspect the intended conclusion is: "A design by Max that he adores is a brutalist building." But the problem says: "A design by Max is a brutalist building."

 Since the problem is stated as is, we'll formalize the conclusion as: For every design by Max, it is a brutalist building? Or perhaps we are to show that a particular design by Max is brutalist? But the premises don't mention a specific design.

 Given the ambiguity, I will assume the conclusion is: Every design by Max is a brutalist building.

 However, note that premise 6 only talks about designs by Max that he adores. Without adoration, we have no information about designs by Max that he doesn't adore.

 Therefore, the conclusion as stated might not be provable. But we are only formalizing, not proving.

 We'll define:

 - `obj` : the type of objects (designs or styles? but note: we have buildings and designs, so perhaps we call them all objects? or we can have two types? The problem mixes styles and buildings and designs. To keep it simple, we'll use one type `obj` for all.)

 Properties and relations:

 - `DesignByMax : obj → Prop`   (to represent that an object is a design by Max)
 - `BrutalistBuilding : obj → Prop` (to represent that an object is a brutalist building)

 But note: the premises also talk about design styles by Zaha Hadid and Kelly Wearstler. So we need:

 - `ZahaHadidStyle : obj → Prop`
 - `KellyWearstlerStyle : obj → Prop`

 Also:

 - `Adores : obj → Prop`   (Max adores the object)
 - `InterestingGeometries : obj → Prop`
 - `Evocative : obj → Prop`
 - `Dreamy : obj → Prop`

 Now, premises:

 1. ∀ x : obj, (ZahaHadidStyle x ∧ Adores x) → InterestingGeometries x
 2. ∀ x : obj, (BrutalistBuilding x ∧ Adores x) → ¬ InterestingGeometries x
 3. ∀ x : obj, Adores x → (ZahaHadidStyle x ∨ KellyWearstlerStyle x)
 4. ∀ x : obj, (KellyWearstlerStyle x ∧ Adores x) → Evocative x
 5. ∀ x : obj, (KellyWearstlerStyle x ∧ Adores x) → Dreamy x
 6. ∀ x : obj, (DesignByMax x ∧ Adores x ∧ InterestingGeometries x) → (BrutalistBuilding x ∧ Evocative x)

 Conclusion: ∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x → BrutalistBuilding x

 However, note that the conclusion does not require adoration. But premise 6 requires adoration and interesting geometries to conclude brutalist and evocative.

 Without additional premises, we cannot conclude that every design by Max is brutalist. But again, we are only formalizing.

 So we write:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type

-- Properties of objects
axiom DesignByMax : obj → Prop
axiom BrutalistBuilding : obj → Prop
axiom ZahaHadidStyle : obj → Prop
axiom KellyWearstlerStyle : obj → Prop
axiom Adores : obj → Prop
axiom InterestingGeometries : obj → Prop
axiom Evocative : obj → Prop
axiom Dreamy : obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, (ZahaHadidStyle x ∧ Adores x) → InterestingGeometries x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, (BrutalistBuilding x ∧ Adores x) → ¬ InterestingGeometries x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Adores x → (ZahaHadidStyle x ∨ KellyWearstlerStyle x)
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, (KellyWearstlerStyle x ∧ Adores x) → Evocative x
axiom P5 : ∀ x : obj, (KellyWearstlerStyle x ∧ Adores x) → Dreamy x
axiom P6 : ∀ x : obj, (DesignByMax x ∧ Adores x ∧ InterestingGeometries x) → (BrutalistBuilding x ∧ Evocative x)

-- Conclusion: Every design by Max is a brutalist building.
theorem goal : ∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x → BrutalistBuilding x := sorry
</lean>

But wait: the conclusion is "A design by Max is a brutalist building." This could be interpreted as existential ("there exists") or universal. In logic puzzles, usually universal quantifiers are used for such statements. However, without context, we default to universal.

Alternatively, the problem might be about a particular design? But no specific design is mentioned.

Given the premises are all universal, we'll use universal for the conclusion.

However, note that the conclusion might not hold without the adoration condition. But we are formalizing as given.

Let me check the premises again: premise 6 says "If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then ...". So without adoration and without interesting geometries, we don't know.

But the conclusion is about every design by Max, regardless of adoration.

So we write the universal statement.

If the problem intended the conclusion to be about designs that Max adores, then we would have:

theorem goal : ∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x ∧ Adores x → BrutalistBuilding x

But the problem says: "A design by Max is a brutalist building." without mentioning adoration.

We'll stick to the literal interpretation.

However, note that the problem might be inconsistent. But that's not our concern.

We output the code accordingly.

======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and need to prove that for any x, if it is DesignByMax, then it is BrutalistBuilding.

 Let's denote:
   D x := DesignByMax x
   B x := BrutalistBuilding x
   Z x := ZahaHadidStyle x
   K x := KellyWearstlerStyle x
   A x := Adores x
   I x := InterestingGeometries x
   E x := Evocative x
   M x := Dreamy x   (though we don't use Dreamy in the conclusion, but we might in intermediate steps)

 Premises:
   P1: ∀x, (Z x ∧ A x) → I x
   P2: ∀x, (B x ∧ A x) → ¬ I x
   P3: ∀x, A x → (Z x ∨ K x)
   P4: ∀x, (K x ∧ A x) → E x
   P5: ∀x, (K x ∧ A x) → M x   (this one might not be needed for the conclusion)
   P6: ∀x, (D x ∧ A x ∧ I x) → (B x ∧ E x)

 The conclusion we want: ∀x, D x → B x.

 How to prove?
 Let x be arbitrary, and assume D x. We want to show B x.

 However, note that P6 requires both D x, A x, and I x to get B x and E x. But we don't know if A x and I x hold.

 We need to consider whether we can get A x? The premises do not force every object to be adored. So we must be careful.

 But note: The premises P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6 all have Adores as a condition. Without knowing Adores for x, we cannot directly apply P6.

 So how can we proceed?

 Let me assume that we are able to show that for any DesignByMax object, it must be adored? But the premises don't say that.

 Alternatively, we can try to derive a contradiction from the assumption that there exists a DesignByMax that is not BrutalistBuilding? But the theorem is stated as a universal.

 Actually, the theorem might not hold. Because if there is a DesignByMax object that is not adored (A x does not hold), then the premises could be satisfied without the object being BrutalistBuilding.

 Specifically, let's try to build a counterexample:

   Let x be an object that is DesignByMax, not adored, and not BrutalistBuilding.
   Then we don't trigger any of the premises because they all require Adores.

   Check the premises:
     P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6: all require A x for their antecedent, so if A x is false, these premises are trivially satisfied (as implications).

   So there is nothing forcing a DesignByMax object that is not adored to be BrutalistBuilding.

 Therefore, the conclusion might not be provable from the premises.

 However, note the theorem states: ∀x, DesignByMax x → BrutalistBuilding x.

 In a model where there is an object that is DesignByMax but not adored, then DesignByMax x holds but BrutalistBuilding x does not, so the implication fails.

 But wait, maybe we can show that a DesignByMax object must be adored? But the premises do not say that.

 So what is missing? We must check if the premises force a DesignByMax to be adored?

 The only premise that mentions DesignByMax is P6: it requires D x, A x, and I x to get B x and E x. Without A x, we cannot use P6.

 And there is no other axiom that says DesignByMax implies Adores.

 Therefore, the theorem as stated is not provable.

 But let me see: is there an argument that must hold? 

 Suppose we have an object x that is DesignByMax. 
 We need to show B x. 
 Since P6 requires A x and I x, we need to get A x. 

 How to get A x? The premises do not force a DesignByMax object to be adored.

 However, note that if we assume A x, then what? 

   By P3: A x implies Z x or K x.

   If Z x, then by P1 (since A x and Z x) we get I x. Then by P6 (D x, A x, I x present) we get B x and E x. So B x holds.

   If K x, then by P1 we cannot get I x? But note P1 requires Z x. So for K x, we don't get I x by P1. However, P2 says that if it were BrutalistBuilding and Adored, then it would not have I x, but we don't know if it is BrutalistBuilding at this point.

   Moreover, we don't have an axiom that says what happens for K x in terms of I x.

   But note: P6 again requires I x to get B x. How do we get I x for the K x case?

   We don't have any axiom that says K x leads to I x. In fact, from P4 and P5 we only get E x and M x.

   So in the K x case, we might not be able to get I x. Without I x, we cannot apply P6 to get B x.

   Therefore, even if we assume A x, the K x branch would be problematic.

   But note: P2 says that if the object is BrutalistBuilding and Adored, then it doesn't have interesting geometries. So if we were to get I x, that would contradict P2 in the case that we have BrutalistBuilding? But we are trying to show BrutalistBuilding.

   Actually, we are in a bind:

     In the ZahaHadidStyle branch: we get I x and then by P6 we get B x. Then by P2, if we have B x and A x, then ¬I x. So we would have I x and ¬I x: contradiction.

   So if we assume A x and then go into the ZahaHadidStyle branch, we get a contradiction.

   But wait, P2: (B x ∧ A x) → ¬I x. But in the ZahaHadidStyle branch we have I x and also B x and A x. Then we get both I x and ¬I x. This is a contradiction.

   Therefore, the ZahaHadidStyle branch leads to a contradiction. Then by P3 (A x implies Z x ∨ K x) we must be in the K x branch. Then we do not get I x? So we cannot use P6 to get the BrutalistBuilding.

   But without I x, we cannot use P6. And we have no other way to get BrutalistBuilding.

   Therefore, under the assumption A x, we get a contradiction? Or we get that we must be in the K x branch and then we cannot get I x so P6 fails? Hence we don't get B x.

   So under the assumption A x, we get either a contradiction (in the Z branch) or we don't get the required I x (in the K branch). Therefore, it is impossible for x to be adored? 

   That would imply that for a DesignByMax x, we must have that ¬ A x holds.

   But if ¬ A x, then we don't have an immediate contradiction, but we also don't get any requirement for B x.

   So we are still stuck: we have not shown that B x must hold.

   And in fact, we might have a model where there exists a DesignByMax that is not adored and not brutalist.

   But wait, what if we try to assume that Adores x holds? Then we get a contradiction (because both branches lead to problems?).

     1. The Z branch: leads to I x and then by P6 we get B x and E x. Then by P2, since B x and A x, we get ¬I x -> contradiction.
     2. The K branch: we get E x and M x, but then we don't have I x. Then we cannot apply P6 to get B x. We want to get B x? We have no other way. 

   But the goal is to get B x. In the K branch we have: K x and A x and D x. We don't have I x. So P6 does not apply. Therefore, we cannot get B x in that branch.

   Therefore, under the assumption A x, we either get a contradiction (in the Z branch) or get that we cannot obtain B x (in the K branch). So in the K branch we don't get a contradiction but we don't get B x either.

   So the assumption A x must be false? 

   But then we don't have any constraints on B x? So it can be false.

   Therefore, the theorem fails: we cannot prove that the DesignByMax object must be brutalist.

 After this analysis, we suspect that the theorem might not hold. But let me try to build a model that satisfies the premises but falsifies the goal.

 Counterexample:

   Let there be one object x.
   Let:
     DesignByMax x = true.
     BrutalistBuilding x = false.   (we want to falsify the conclusion)
     Adores x = false.

   Then we can arbitrarily set the others to false? But note P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6:

     P1: (Z x ∧ A x) → I x -> since A x is false, antecedent false -> true.
     P2: (B x ∧ A x) → ¬ I x -> since A x false, true.
     P3: A x → (Z x ∨ K x) -> antecedent false, true.
     P4: (K x ∧ A x) → E x -> true.
     P5: true.
     P6: (D x ∧ A x ∧ I x) → (B x ∧ E x) -> D x is true but A x is false, so antecedent false -> true.

   All premises are satisfied. And we have DesignByMax x true and BrutalistBuilding x false -> goal false.

   Hence, the theorem does not hold.

 But wait: perhaps we can show that for any DesignByMax object, we must have Adores x? Because without Adores x we have a counterexample, but if the premises force Adores x for DesignByMax, then we can proceed. However, the premises do not say that. 

 Therefore, the answer is that the theorem is false.

 However, note that the problem says: "Provide the complete code with a valid proof" but in this case we see that it's not provable. But the instructions also say: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 Since we found a counterexample, we must say False.

 But the task is to replace the 'sorry'. How?

   We cannot provide a valid proof because the theorem is false.

   However, the instructions say: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry', your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof term."

   But if it's false, we cannot.

   But note: the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions" meaning that the axioms are well-typed. But it doesn't say that the theorem is true.

   And the instruction says: "After your code, provide your answer: True/False/Uncertain"

   So we might output the code but with the proof term that we attempted? But if we try to prove it we might run into a problem.

   Alternatively, we could try to prove the negation? But the theorem is stated as ∀x, DesignByMax x → BrutalistBuilding x. We have a counterexample that there is an object (namely x) with DesignByMax and not BrutalistBuilding and all axioms satisfied.

   However, the problem does not say that we have to use the same axioms. We are only allowed to use the provided axioms.

   How do we justify that the theorem is unprovable? We cannot in Lean without the countermodel. But the instructions are to provide a proof term. 

   Since the theorem is not provable, we have to leave the sorry? But the task says to replace sorry with a proof.

   Alternatively, we might try to prove it and if we get stuck we use a classical argument? But the problem does not state that we have classical logic.

   Given the counterexample in our mind, we know the theorem is false. Therefore, we must answer that the theorem is false.

   But the code must have a proof? How do we proceed?

   I think we are allowed to output the code with a proof of False? Actually, that would be incorrect because the theorem is stated and we cannot prove it. 

   Alternatively, we might prove that it is unprovable? But that is a meta-statement.

   The problem says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." But if we believe the theorem is false, then we can provide a proof of the negation? But that requires a different type.

   Actually, the problem does not ask to prove the negation. It only says to replace sorry in the given theorem.

   But we cannot.

   Let's re-read the instructions: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry', your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof term."

   If we cannot, then we should not claim to have one.

   However, note that the example provided was a true theorem. So perhaps in this case, we must conclude that the theorem is true? But we found a counterexample.

   But wait! We might have missed something: the premises itself might force that any DesignByMax object must be adored? Let me check:

   There is no such premise.

   Therefore, we are forced to say that the theorem is false.

   How do we handle this? The instructions require a proof term. But if we cannot provide one, we must say that and mark as false.

   The format: After the code, we provide the answer: False.

   But for the code, we can leave it as sorry? But then we did not replace sorry.

   Alternatively, we can try to prove it by contradiction? That might not work.

   Perhaps we misunderstood the axioms?

   Let me try to use the axioms to show that a DesignByMax must be Brutalist only if it is adored and has interesting geometries. Without those, it might not be.

   But we don't have a way to force the necessary conditions.

   The only option: we prove an implication that if the object is adored, then we get a contradiction? Then we would have that DesignByMax objects are not adored? But that doesn't lead to the Building.

   Actually, we found that if we assume A x for a DesignByMax, we get in the ZahaHadidStyle branch a contradiction. So we get by the law of excluded middle that if A x holds then it must be KellyWearstlerStyle? But in the KellyWearstlerStyle branch we don't get I x, so we cannot use P6 to get B x.

   How do we get that the DesignByMax object must have interesting geometries? We don't.

   Therefore, it seems the theorem is invalid.

   In the problem statement, the context might be that we are only considering adored objects? But the theorem does not have that restriction.

   Consequently, we have to report that the theorem is false.

   How to answer?

   We output the code as is but with a comment that it failed? But the problem says to replace sorry.

   Alternatively, we might attempt to construct a proof and see where it fails? 

   Here is a possible attempt:

     Let x be arbitrary and assume DesignByMax x. We need to prove BrutalistBuilding x.
     We want to use P6, but we need to show Adores x and InterestingGeometries x.
     We don't have Adores x. So we try to prove false? 

   Without more, we cannot.

   Therefore, we conclude the theorem cannot be proven and hence is false.

   Final decision:

     We output the code with the sorry replaced by a proof that uses classical logic? But that doesn't help.

   Actually, we notice that we have a proof that leads to a contradiction if we assume Adores x? And then we might get that ¬ Adores x? But still doesn't give BrutalistBuilding.

   Alternatively, we prove an intermediate lemma that shows all DesignByMax objects are not adored? Then in particular, this x is not BrutalistBuilding? But again, we don't have that non-adored means not brutalist.

   However, we found a counterexample with a non-adored DesignByMax that is not brutalist. So we know the theorem is false.

   Therefore, we must answer with False.

   But just to be safe, let me try another counterexample where Adores x is true and see if the theorem holds? In that counterexample:

     x: 
        D x = true
        A x = true

     By P3, we have two cases:

        Case 1: ZahaHadidStyle x
          Then by P1: since Z x and A x, we have I x.
          Then by P6: D x, A x, I x → B x and E x -> so we get B x.

          But then we have B x and A x, so by P2: ¬ I x. But we have I x -> contradiction.

        Case 2: KellyWearstlerStyle x
          Then by P4 and P5: E x and M x.
          But we don't have I x? And we cannot get I x from K x? So P6 requires I x, but we don't have it. Therefore, we cannot apply P6.

          To get I x, we might note that there is no axiom providing I x from KellyWearstlerStyle. So we are not forced to have I x.

          Then we cannot get B x from P6.

     So in the case where A x is true, we either get a contradiction (case 1) or cannot prove B x (case 2).

     This suggests that there is no model where a DesignByMax object is adored? Because if it is adored and Zaha, we get a contradiction; if it is adored and Kelly, then we have DesignByMax and adored and Kelly but not InterestingGeometries? and then we cannot show BrutalistBuilding.

     Therefore, the only possibility is that no DesignByMax object is adored. There is no constraint that says DesignByMax implies adored? So we can have non-adored ones.

     Hence, our first counterexample (non-adored) is valid.

   So we conclude the theorem is not true.

 Output:

   We cannot provide a proof of the theorem because it is false.

   Therefore, after the code we answer: ANSWER: False

   And in the code, we leave it with sorry? But that violates the instruction.

   We must provide complete code with the proof term.

   But note: the theorem is not valid, so we cannot prove it. Therefore, we do the following:

   We do nothing: we output the original code with sorry and then mark as false.

   But the instruction says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term."

   How about we provide a proof of the theorem using "False.elim" and a subproof of False? But that would require deriving a contradiction from the axioms and the negation of the goal? But we haven't assumed the negation of the goal. And we found a counterexample that satisfies the axioms and negates the goal.

   Alternatively, we can use the following strategy:

     We prove that there must be a contradiction in the premises? Then we can prove anything.

     But we have not seen an overall contradiction in the premises.

     The counterexample we built for non-adored objects satisfies the premises without contradiction. And the counterexample for an adored object with Kelly style also does not yield a contradiction? In the latter we have:

        x: 
          D x = true
          A x = true
          K x = true
          E x = true (from P4)
          M x = true (from P5)
          I x = false? (we don't have to set it to true) 
          B x = false (as per our choice, to falsify the goal)

        Now check P6: (D x, A x, I x) → (B x ∧ E x) 
          Since I x is false, the antecedent is false -> implication holds.

        And we don't have any other premises that force I x to be true? P1: requires Z x and A x -> doesn't apply because Z x is false. P2: requires B x and A x -> false because B x false -> doesn't force anything about I x.

        So that model also works? Then the goal for that x is DesignByMax true -> BrutalistBuilding false.

        And we have two objects in the universe? Then the theorem fails for both: in the non-adored one, and in the adored but Kelly one.

     Therefore, the premises are consistent with the existence of a DesignByMax that is not Brutalist.

   So we cannot derive a contradiction.

   Therefore, we are forced to report that the theorem is false and cannot be proven.

   Conclusion:

     We output the code unchanged (with sorry) and then add our answer as False.

   But the problem says to replace sorry.

   After careful thought, we realize that in the original problem, all objects might be adored? But there's no axiom saying that. So we must be cautious.

   However, the client expects us to replace sorry. We have two options:

      1. If we can disprove the theorem, but that would require negating the theorem and proving its negation? But the negation of ∀x, DesignByMax x → BrutalistBuilding x is ∃x, DesignByMax x ∧ ¬BrutalistBuilding x. We cannot prove that either without using our countermodel? But the premises don't force such an x? They are satisfied in models that have no counterexample and also in models that have a counterexample. So we cannot prove the negation either.

      2. Therefore, the only honest thing is to say that the theorem is not provable, and leave sorry. But then we haven't replaced it.

   Given the instructions: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term", and since we cannot find one, we might be allowed to leave it and just answer False?

   How about this: we output a partial proof that shows how far we got, but then admit that we cannot close the goal? But then it's not a valid proof.

   Since the problem states "your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof term", we must provide a valid term of type (∀ x, DesignByMax x → BrutalistBuilding x). 

   We have none. 

   Therefore, we must be honest and say that we couldn't and that the theorem is false.

   And with that, we output the answer as False.

   But the code remains unchanged.

   Format:

        <lean>
        ... the code with sorry ...
        </lean>

        ANSWER: False

   This is acceptable.

   Alternatively, we might try to prove it under the assumption that every object is adored? But that would be an additional axiom, and we are not allowed to add an axiom.

   Given the above, we output the code with sorry and then ANSWER: False.


=== RESPONSE ===
The theorem is not provable from the given premises. Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. Premise P6 requires `Adores x` and `InterestingGeometries x` to deduce `BrutalistBuilding x` from `DesignByMax x`
2. There is no premise forcing `DesignByMax x` to imply `Adores x`
3. Without `Adores x`, P6 cannot be applied to derive `BrutalistBuilding x`
4. A counterexample exists:
   - Object `x` with `DesignByMax x = true`
   - All other properties (`Adores x`, `BrutalistBuilding x`, etc.) = false
   - All premises are satisfied:
     - P1: Antecedent false → vacuously true
     - P2: Antecedent false → vacuously true
     - P3: Antecedent false → vacuously true
     - P4: Antecedent false → vacuously true
     - P5: Antecedent false → vacuously true
     - P6: Antecedent false → vacuously true
   - Conclusion fails: `DesignByMax x` true but `BrutalistBuilding x` false

Since a counterexample exists satisfying all premises but falsifying the conclusion, the theorem is **False**.
