STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion about Coco Gauff.
 We need to model the logical structure in Lean 4.

 Steps:
 1. Identify the types and predicates.
 2. Represent individuals (like Iga Świątek, Rafael Nadal, Coco Gauff) and the domain (tennis players, events).
 3. Represent properties: 
    - being ranked highly by WTA
    - being one of the most active players in major tennis (conclusion uses "Grand-Slam players", so we might adjust)
    - losing to a particular player at a particular event
    - being a female or male tennis player at an event
    - being at an event

 Note: The conclusion is that "Coco Gauff is among the most active Grand-Slam players." 
 However, one of the premises uses "most active players in major tennis". We'll assume they are the same.

 Proposed representation:

 We will have:
   - A type for players (obj might be too generic; we can use `Player`).
   - A type for events? But the events are fixed: Roland Garros 2022. Alternatively, we can keep it simple by making specific predicates for Roland Garros 2022.

 Since the events and players are mentioned, we can do:

   axiom Player : Type
   axiom Event : Type  -- optional, but let's see if we need events in predicates.

 Alternatively, since the premises are about Roland Garros 2022, we can define a specific constant for that event and not introduce a general type.

 But note: we have multiple events? Not really, the premises only talk about Roland Garros 2022. The conclusion says "Grand-Slam players" but we are only given information about one Grand Slam (Roland Garros). 

 However, the problem says "Coco Gauff is among the most active Grand-Slam players", which might be a general status. So we are to assume that being active in major tennis (which we are told is implied by WTA high rank) and being a Grand-Slam player might be the same? 

 Actually, the premise: "If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis."

 And since Roland Garros is a major tennis event (a Grand Slam), if a player is at Roland Garros and is active in major tennis, that might be enough? But note the premise does not say that being active is defined by participation at Roland Garros. We must be cautious.

 We are going to define:

   - Constants: 
        CocoGauff : Player
        IgaSwiatek : Player
        RafaelNadal : Player
        RolandGarros2022 : Event   [if we use Event, otherwise we can avoid it]

   However, the premises also mention "female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022", so we have a property of being at that event and of being female/male.

  Let's define without Event if possible? Because all premises are about one event.

  Alternative: we can have a predicate `AtRolandGarros2022 : Player → Prop` and similarly for being a female tennis player at that event? But note: the premise says "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022", meaning we are considering those who are female and at the event.

  We'll define:

    axiom Player : Type
    axiom WTA_ranked_highly : Player → Prop
    axiom MostActive : Player → Prop   -- "among the most active Grand-Slam players"

    -- We have specific relations: lost to a player at a specific event (Roland Garros 2022).
    -- Let's define a binary relation: `defeatedAt` but we need the event? Since we only have one event, we can do:

    axiom defeatedByAtRG2022 : Player → Player → Prop   -- meaning the first was defeated by the second at RG 2022.

    But note: we have two separate defeats: to Iga Świątek and to Rafael Nadal.

    Alternatively, we can have:

        axiom lostToIgaAtRG2022 : Player → Prop   -- for females
        axiom lostToRafaelAtRG2022 : Player → Prop  -- for males

    However, the premises say:
        "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 ..." 
        and "All male tennis players ... lost to Rafael Nadal"

    But note: "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek" -> so lostToIgaAtRG2022 is for the females at that event? But also "Everyone who lost to Iga ..." (which are exactly the females) are WTA ranked highly.

    We have:

        Premise 1: If someone is ranked highly by WTA, then they are most active.
        Premise 2: Everyone who lost to Iga at RG2022 is WTA ranked highly.
        Premise 3: All female tennis players at RG2022 lost to Iga.
        Premise 4: All tennis players at RG2022 are either female or male.
        Premise 5: All male tennis players at RG2022 lost to Rafael.
        Premise 6: If Coco Gauff is WTA ranked highly OR lost to Rafael, then Coco is not male at RG2022.
        Premise 7: Coco Gauff is at RG2022.

    Also, note that the defeat relations are specific to the event. We'll need:

        axiom Female : Player → Prop   -- but note: the context is at Roland Garros? Or is being female independent? The premises are about "female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022". So we might define:

        We'll have:
          AtRG2022 : Player → Prop
          FemaleAtRG2022 : Player → Prop   -- meaning she is a female and at RG2022? Alternatively, we can define:
          Female : Player → Prop   -- for a player in general? But since our events are fixed, we can think in the context of the event.

        Actually, the premises say "all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022" -> so if a player is at RG2022 and is female, then they are a female tennis player at that event.

        Similarly, male.

        So let:

          axiom AtRG2022 : Player → Prop
          axiom Female : Player → Prop   -- general? But the problem only discusses at RG2022? We don't need to know about other contexts.
          axiom Male : Player → Prop

        However, note premise 4: "All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male." This implies that at RG2022, every player is either female or male. Also, we can assume that a player cannot be both? (but the problem doesn't say) - we'll assume exclusivity?

        But note: premise 6: "Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022" -> so we might have a predicate for being male and at RG2022.

        Alternatively, we can define a predicate:

          IsMaleAtRG2022 : Player → Prop   to mean the player is at RG2022 and male.

        Similarly for female. But premise 3: "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 ..." so that is exactly the set `IsFemaleAtRG2022`.

        Since we have `AtRG2022` and `Female`, we can define in the axioms that:

          IsFemaleAtRG2022 (p) = AtRG2022 p ∧ Female p
          similarly for male.

        But in the axioms we will write:

          For premise 3: ∀ p, (AtRG2022 p ∧ Female p) → lostToIgaAtRG2022 p

        We also need to represent the defeat:

          We can have a predicate for loss to Iga at RG2022. But note Iga is a player. Similarly, Rafael.

        We'll introduce:

          axiom lostToAtRG2022 : Player → Player → Prop

        But we know who is the winner: Iga and Rafael? And we want to relate:

          lostToIga p := lostToAtRG2022 p Iga
          lostToRafael p := lostToAtRG2022 p Rafael

        However, we don't know if a player can lose to multiple? The problem says specific losses.

        Alternatively, since the losses are only to these two, and the context is RG2022, we can define:

          axiom defeatedByIga : Player → Prop
          axiom defeatedByRafael : Player → Prop

        Then, we can write the premises.

    Let's define:

        axiom Player : Type
        axiom CocoGauff : Player
        axiom IgaSwiatek : Player
        axiom RafaelNadal : Player

        -- Properties:
        axiom WTA_ranked_highly : Player → Prop
        axiom MostActive : Player → Prop   -- active in major tennis / Grand-Slam players? We are taking the conclusion as this predicate.

        axiom AtRG2022 : Player → Prop

        -- We assume that Female and Male are not mutually exclusive? But in context, we have either/or. Also, we might want to represent that a player cannot be both? But the problem doesn't say. However, note premise 4: they are either female or male. So at RG2022, they are exclusive? But we don't have information about other players not at RG2022? Since we are only concerned with players at RG2022.

        -- We'll define:
        axiom Female : Player → Prop      -- being female (in general, but we only care at RG2022)
        axiom Male : Player → Prop        -- being male

        -- But note: for a player at RG2022, they are either female or male. And we might need that they are not both? Actually the premise says "either female or male", which typically allows both? But in sports, usually exclusive. However, we don't need to enforce exclusivity to state the axioms.

        -- Predicates for losses at Roland Garros 2022:
        axiom defeatedByIga : Player → Prop   -- defeated by Iga at RG2022
        axiom defeatedByRafael : Player → Prop -- defeated by Rafael at RG2022

    Now the premises:

      1. ∀ x, WTA_ranked_highly x → MostActive x

      2. ∀ x, (defeatedByIga x) → WTA_ranked_highly x

      3. ∀ x, (AtRG2022 x ∧ Female x) → defeatedByIga x

      4. ∀ x, AtRG2022 x → (Female x ∨ Male x)

      5. ∀ x, (AtRG2022 x ∧ Male x) → defeatedByRafael x

      6. (WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff ∨ defeatedByRafael CocoGauff) → ¬ (Male CocoGauff ∧ AtRG2022 CocoGauff)

          However, note: the premise says "Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022", which is exactly ¬(Male CocoGauff ∧ AtRG2022 CocoGauff). But we have AtRG2022 CocoGauff as a separate premise.

      7. AtRG2022 CocoGauff

    Conclusion: MostActive CocoGauff

    But note: we need to show MostActive CocoGauff. How do we get that?
      - We know Coco is at RG2022 (premise 7), and by premise 4, she is either female or male.

    We are going to show she is WTA_ranked_highly? Because then by premise1, she is MostActive.

    How to get WTA_ranked_highly for Coco?
      - If she is female: then by premise3 (because AtRG2022 and Female) she is defeated by Iga; then by premise2, she is WTA_ranked_highly.
      - If she is male: then by premise5, she is defeated by Rafael. But then by premise6: if she is defeated by Rafael (or if she is WTA_ranked_highly? we don't know) then she is not male at RG2022. But we are assuming she is male and at RG2022? Then we get a contradiction.

    Therefore, we can conclude that she must be female? Then we get the WTA ranking.

    However, the premise6 says: 
        (WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff ∨ defeatedByRafael CocoGauff) → ¬ (Male CocoGauff ∧ AtRG2022 CocoGauff)

    And note: AtRG2022 CocoGauff is given. So the consequent becomes ¬Male CocoGauff.

    Now, if Coco is male and at RG2022, then by premise5 she lost to Rafael. Then by premise6 (since she lost to Rafael, the antecedent is true) we get ¬Male CocoGauff. Contradiction.

    Therefore, Coco cannot be male. Then by premise4, she must be female. Then by premise3, she lost to Iga, then by premise2, she is WTA_ranked_highly, then by premise1, she is MostActive.

    But note: we are not proving, we are formalizing. So the theorem we will state is `MostActive CocoGauff`.

    However, we must also note: what about the defeat to Rafael? If Coco is female and at RG2022, she lost to Iga, but did she also lose to Rafael? The premises do not say. But in the antecedent of premise6, we have an OR. We don't actually need to use the part about defeatedByRafael for Coco because we have a different route for females.

    But we are building the axioms without proving. So we just need to state:

      theorem goal : MostActive CocoGauff

    However, we might have to note that the defeat by Iga and defeat by Rafael are independent? But for the same event? It is possible that a player loses to both? Actually, in tennis, each player loses to one person? They are eliminated by one of them? And the tournament structure: there is a men's tournament and a women's tournament. So a male player would only lose in the men's tournament and female in the women's. Therefore, we can assume that Coco Gauff (female) doesn't play Rafael Nadal? So she wouldn't lose to him? 

    So we might not need to worry about that.

    Now, we write the code.

    We note: the conclusion is about Coco Gauff, so we define constants for the players.

    We define the predicates accordingly.

    Let's write the axioms:

<lean>
axiom Player : Type

axiom WTA_ranked_highly : Player → Prop
axiom MostActive : Player → Prop

-- We assume that the event Roland Garros 2022 is implicitly defined by the predicates below.
axiom AtRG2022 : Player → Prop
axiom Female : Player → Prop
axiom Male : Player → Prop

axiom defeatedByIga : Player → Prop   -- defeated by Iga Swiatek at RG2022
axiom defeatedByRafael : Player → Prop -- defeated by Rafael Nadal at RG2022

-- Specific players
axiom CocoGauff : Player
axiom IgaSwiatek : Player
axiom RafaelNadal : Player

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ (x : Player), WTA_ranked_highly x → MostActive x
axiom P2 : ∀ (x : Player), defeatedByIga x → WTA_ranked_highly x
axiom P3 : ∀ (x : Player), (AtRG2022 x ∧ Female x) → defeatedByIga x
axiom P4 : ∀ (x : Player), AtRG2022 x → (Female x ∨ Male x)
axiom P5 : ∀ (x : Player), (AtRG2022 x ∧ Male x) → defeatedByRafael x

-- Premise 6: If Coco is WTA_ranked_highly OR lost to Rafael, then she is not (Male and at RG2022).
-- Since we have AtRG2022 as a separate axiom, and we know AtRG2022 CocoGauff, this means if the antecedent happens then Male CocoGauff is false.
axiom P6 : (WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff ∨ defeatedByRafael CocoGauff) → 
              ¬ (Male CocoGauff ∧ AtRG2022 CocoGauff)

axiom P7 : AtRG2022 CocoGauff

-- Conclusion: Coco Gauff is MostActive
theorem goal : MostActive CocoGauff := sorry
</lean>

 But wait: we didn't use IgaSwiatek and RafaelNadal as players? We defined the predicates `defeatedByIga` and `defeatedByRafael` without using the constants. That is acceptable? Because the premises don't state anything else about these players. We are only interested in the loss to them.

 However, note: in the defeat predicates we take a Player → Prop. We don't need to state that the winners are players? They are constants of type Player, so we have them. But we don't use them in any axiom that involves their own defeat? That's okay.

 Alternatively, we could model the defeats as relations:

   axiom defeatedBy : Player → Player → Prop
   and then have:
        defeatedByIga x := defeatedBy x IgaSwiatek
        defeatedByRafael x := defeatedBy x RafaelNadal

 But the problem doesn't require that. We can keep the separate predicates for simplicity.

 However, if we want to be more general, that's also possible, but the problem does not require it.

 We choose the above.

 But note: we used the same event (RG2022) implicitly in `defeatedByIga` and `defeatedByRafael`. How do we know they are at RG2022? The problem states that the losses are at Roland Garros 2022. We have the predicate `AtRG2022` for the players involved. In the axioms P3 and P5, we are requiring that the player is at RG2022. So we are correctly constraining the context.

 However, there is an implicit assumption that if a player lost to Iga at RG2022, then that player must have been at RG2022? The problem doesn't state, but that's inherent. We haven't enforced that. But the axioms P3 and P5 only apply to players at RG2022. The premise P2 does not require AtRG2022? 

 The second premise: "Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the WTA." 

 So the domain of "lost to Iga at RG2022" is by definition those who played at RG2022? But we don't have that explicitly. We could add:

   axiom defeatedByIga_implies_AtRG2022 : ∀ x, defeatedByIga x → AtRG2022 x

 Similarly for defeatedByRafael? But the problem does not say that explicitly. So we are not required to model that? The premises are stated only for the players at RG2022? Actually, the first premise doesn't specify the domain for the WTA ranking? It might be about all players? The WTA ranking is a global ranking? 

 Since we are only concerned with Coco Gauff and players at RG2022 (by other premises), we might not need that. 

 But note: the second premise is about everyone who lost to Iga at RG2022. We are only told about the female players at RG2022 losing to Iga? But there might be others? The problem states "All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Swiatek". That doesn't say that only females did. However, the tournament structure: only female players can lose to Iga in women's singles? Similarly for Rafael.

 We'll stick to our current representation. It is sufficient to derive the conclusion.

 However, we have an issue in the axioms: we have `defeatedByIga` and `defeatedByRafael` as being defined for any player? But the premises only state that the females lost to Iga and the males lost to Rafael? So we don't have that a player cannot be defeated by both? But we are not using both for Coco.

 Now, we write the Lean code accordingly.

 Note: we have to define the constants and predicates.

 Since we have already outlined above, we write:

<lean>
axiom Player : Type

axiom WTA_ranked_highly : Player → Prop
axiom MostActive : Player → Prop
axiom AtRG2022 : Player → Prop
axiom Female : Player → Prop
axiom Male : Player → Prop
axiom defeatedByIga : Player → Prop
axiom defeatedByRafael : Player → Prop

axiom CocoGauff : Player
axiom IgaSwiatek : Player
axiom RafaelNadal : Player

axiom P1 : ∀ (x : Player), WTA_ranked_highly x → MostActive x
axiom P2 : ∀ (x : Player), defeatedByIga x → WTA_ranked_highly x
axiom P3 : ∀ (x : Player), AtRG2022 x ∧ Female x → defeatedByIga x
axiom P4 : ∀ (x : Player), AtRG2022 x → Female x ∨ Male x
axiom P5 : ∀ (x : Player), AtRG2022 x ∧ Male x → defeatedByRafael x
axiom P6 : (WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff ∨ defeatedByRafael CocoGauff) → 
              ¬ (Male CocoGauff ∧ AtRG2022 CocoGauff)
axiom P7 : AtRG2022 CocoGauff

theorem goal : MostActive CocoGauff := sorry
</lean>

However, note: in P6, we have `Male CocoGauff` and `AtRG2022 CocoGauff`. But we already have `AtRG2022 CocoGauff` from P7, so we can write:

  ¬ Male CocoGauff

But the premise says "not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022", which is ¬(Male and AtRG2022). So our representation is exactly that.

 This should be correct.


=== RESPONSE ===
Here's the Lean 4 formalization of the given premises and conclusion:

<lean>
axiom Player : Type

axiom WTA_ranked_highly : Player → Prop
axiom MostActiveGrandSlam : Player → Prop

axiom defeatedByIgaAtRG2022 : Player → Prop
axiom defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 : Player → Prop

              ¬(MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff)
axiom P7 : AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff

theorem conclusion : MostActiveGrandSlam CocoGauff := sorry
</lean>

Explanation:
1. Basic types:
   - `Player` represents tennis players
   - Specific players: `CocoGauff`, `IgaSwiatek`, `RafaelNadal`

2. Key predicates:
   - `WTA_ranked_highly`: Player is highly ranked by WTA
   - `MostActiveGrandSlam`: Player is among most active Grand-Slam players
   - `AtRolandGarros2022`: Player participated in Roland Garros 2022
   - `FemaleTennisPlayer`/`MaleTennisPlayer`: Gender distinctions

3. Defeat relations:
   - `defeatedByIgaAtRG2022`: Lost to Iga Świątek specifically at RG2022
   - `defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022`: Lost to Rafael Nadal specifically at RG2022

4. Premises (P1-P7):
   - Translated directly from the natural language statements
   - Use explicit implications, universal quantifiers, and logical connectives
   - Premise 6 uses a disjunction and negation as specified

5. Theorem:
   - `conclusion` states that Coco Gauff is among the most active Grand-Slam players
   - `sorry` serves as the proof placeholder

Note: The formalization directly models the problem's structure while maintaining a one-to-one correspondence between natural language statements and axioms. The conclusion follows from the premises through logical deduction (not implemented here per requirements).


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given a set of axioms and need to prove `MostActiveGrandSlam CocoGauff`.
We have:
  P1: ∀ p, WTA_ranked_highly p → MostActiveGrandSlam p
  P2: ∀ p, defeatedByIgaAtRG2022 p → WTA_ranked_highly p
  P3: ∀ p, (FemaleTennisPlayer p ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 p) → defeatedByIgaAtRG2022 p
  P4: ∀ p, AtRolandGarros2022 p → (FemaleTennisPlayer p ∨ MaleTennisPlayer p)
  P5: ∀ p, (MaleTennisPlayer p ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 p) → defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 p
  P6: (WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff ∨ defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 CocoGauff) → 
          ¬(MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff)
  P7: AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff

We have P7: AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff.

By P4 applied to CocoGauff, we have:
  FemaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∨ MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff.

We can consider cases.

But note we also have P6. It says that if either WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff or defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 CocoGauff, 
then it is not the case that CocoGauff is both male and at Roland Garros 2022.

We know CocoGauff is at Roland Garros 2022 (by P7). So the conclusion of P6 is equivalent to:
  ¬(MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff)   [because AtRolandGarros2022 is true]

So P6 becomes: (WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff ∨ defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 CocoGauff) → ¬(MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff)

Now, we consider the two cases from P4.

Case 1: FemaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff.
  Then we have: FemaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff (by P7).
  By P3, we get: defeatedByIgaAtRG2022 CocoGauff.
  Then by P2, we get: WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff.
  Then by P1, we get: MostActiveGrandSlam CocoGauff.

Case 2: MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff.
  Then we have: MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff (by P7).
  By P5, we get: defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 CocoGauff.
  Then we have: defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 CocoGauff, which is one of the disjuncts in the premise of P6.
  So we have: WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff ∨ defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 CocoGauff.
  Hence by P6, we get: ¬(MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff)
  But we are in the case that MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, the male case leads to a contradiction, so we must have the female case, and hence the result.

Alternatively, we might try to avoid contradiction by noticing that in the male case, we get defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 CocoGauff, which by P6 would imply ¬(MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff) which contradicts our assumption. So the male case is impossible.

Hence, we only need to use the female case.

But note: we cannot prove which gender CocoGauff is. However, we have a disjunction from P4 and we can do case analysis.

In Lean, we can use `have` to get the disjunction and then cases on it.

We can do:

have case1 : FemaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∨ MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff := by exact P4 CocoGauff P7

Then, cases case1.

In case FemaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff:
  have h1 : FemaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff := ⟨h, P7⟩
  have h2 : defeatedByIgaAtRG2022 CocoGauff := P3 CocoGauff h1
  have h3 : WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff := P2 CocoGauff h2
  exact P1 CocoGauff h3

In case MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff:
  have h5 : MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff := ⟨h, P7⟩
  have h6 : defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 CocoGauff := P5 CocoGauff h5
  have h7 : WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff ∨ defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 CocoGauff := Or.inr h6
  have h8 := P6 h7   -- ¬(MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff)
  -- But h5 is exactly MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff
  contradiction

Alternatively, we can use `have` and `exfalso` in the male case.

But note: in Lean, we must be careful to name our hypotheses appropriately.

Alternatively, we can use the tactic mode to do case analysis.

However, the problem asks for a complete proof term. We can write it as a term or use `by` with tactics.

Given the complexity, it is easier to use `by` and tactics.

Let's write the proof using tactics:

theorem conclusion : MostActiveGrandSlam CocoGauff := by
  have case := P4 CocoGauff P7  -- FemaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∨ MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff
  cases case with
  | inl female => 
      have h1 : FemaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff := ⟨female, P7⟩
      have h2 : defeatedByIgaAtRG2022 CocoGauff := P3 CocoGauff h1
      have h3 : WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff := P2 CocoGauff h2
      exact P1 CocoGauff h3
  | inr male =>
      have h5 : MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff := ⟨male, P7⟩
      have h6 : defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 CocoGauff := P5 CocoGauff h5
      have h7 : WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff ∨ defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 CocoGauff := Or.inr h6
      have h8 := P6 h7  -- ¬(MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff)
      contradiction

But note: the contradiction is because we have h5 of type (MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff) and h8 is the negation of that.

We can use `exfalso; apply h8; exact h5` or simply `contradiction` (if the context has a contradiction).

Alternatively, we can combine steps. Since the male case leads to a contradiction, we can do:

theorem conclusion : MostActiveGrandSlam CocoGauff := by
  have case := P4 CocoGauff P7
  cases case
  case inl female =>
    apply P1
    apply P2
    apply P3
    constructor
    exact female
    exact P7
  case inr male =>
    have h5 := P6 (Or.inr (P5 CocoGauff (And.intro male P7)))
    contradiction   -- because h5 says not (male and P7) but we have both

Alternatively, the contradiction might be automatic.

But note that `contradiction` in Lean might not see it, so we can do:

    have h8 : ¬(MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff) := 
        P6 (Or.inr (P5 CocoGauff ⟨male, P7⟩))
    apply False.elim
    apply h8
    exact ⟨male, P7⟩

But the tactic `contradiction` should find a contradiction between `h : A` and `h' : ¬ A` in the context.

Wait, we have `h5 : MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff` and `h8 : ¬(MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff)`. So `contradiction` will close the goal.

Alternatively, we can use `absurd`.

But I think `contradiction` will work.

Therefore, we write:

axiom WTA_ranked_highly : Player → Prop
axiom MostActiveGrandSlam : Player → Prop

              ¬(MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff)
axiom P7 : AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff

theorem conclusion : MostActiveGrandSlam CocoGauff := by
  -- By P4, CocoGauff is either female or male
  have gender := P4 CocoGauff P7
  cases gender with
  | inl female => 
      -- When CocoGauff is female
      have h : FemaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff := ⟨female, P7⟩
      have defeated : defeatedByIgaAtRG2022 CocoGauff := P3 CocoGauff h
      have highly : WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff := P2 CocoGauff defeated
      exact P1 CocoGauff highly
  | inr male => 
      -- When CocoGauff is male
      have manAt : MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff := ⟨male, P7⟩
      have defeated : defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 CocoGauff := P5 CocoGauff manAt
      -- We have defeated by Rafael, so the premise of P6 holds (right disjunct)
      have prem : WTA_ranked_highly CocoGauff ∨ defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022 CocoGauff := Or.inr defeated
      have not_manAt := P6 prem   -- This is ¬(MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff)
      -- But we have manAt: MaleTennisPlayer CocoGauff ∧ AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff
      contradiction
</lean>

As for the answer: the theorem is proven, so ANSWER: True.

Note: The problem may be from an uncertain domain, but given the axioms, we have constructed a proof.

However, the question in the end is about the truth of this being a valid proof in Lean. We are to replace the sorry and then say whether the theorem is true (we proved it so true) based on the axioms.

So the answer is True.

But note: the problem says "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

In this context, we are to say whether the theorem (conclusion) is true given the axioms. Since we have a proof, it is true.

Therefore, we output:

ANSWER: True

But wait, the axioms are given and we constructed a proof, so it is true.

      have h7 := P6 h6  -- ¬(MaleTennisPlayer ∧ AtRolandGarros2022)
      contradiction  -- h4 contradicts h7
</lean>

ANSWER: True

**Proof Explanation:**  
1. **Setup:** We know `AtRolandGarros2022 CocoGauff` (P7).  
2. **Gender Analysis:** By axiom P4, Coco Gauff must be either female or male.  
3. **Female Case:**  
   - Axiom P3 shows Coco Gauff was defeated by Iga (since she is female and at RG 2022)  
   - Axiom P2 shows she is WTA-ranked highly  
   - Axiom P1 proves the goal `MostActiveGrandSlam`  
4. **Male Case:**  
   - Axiom P5 shows Coco Gauff was defeated by Rafael  
   - This triggers P6's premise since `defeatedByRafaelAtRG2022` is true  
   - P6's conclusion ¬(Male ∧ AtRG2022) contradicts the established facts  
   - `contradiction` tactic closes this impossible branch  

The proof holds under all given axioms, so the theorem is true.
