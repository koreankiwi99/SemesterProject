STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion about Coco Gauff.
 We need to define objects and relations.

 Steps:
 1. We have a domain of tennis players, but note that the premises also mention events (Roland Garros 2022) and specific players (Iga Świątek, Rafael Nadal, Coco Gauff).
 2. We'll introduce:
    - A type for players: `Player`
    - Specific players: `iga`, `rafael`, `coco`
    - We'll define predicates:
        * `WTA_highly_ranked : Player → Prop`   (for being ranked highly by WTA)
        * `MostActive : Player → Prop`          (for being one of the most active players in major tennis)
        * `LostTo : Player → Player → Prop`     (a relation: lost to someone)
        * `Female : Player → Prop`              (for female tennis players)
        * `Male : Player → Prop`                (for male tennis players)
        * `AtRG2022 : Player → Prop`            (for being at Roland Garros 2022)

 3. Premises:
    a. If someone is ranked highly by WTA, then they are one of the most active players.
        ∀ p, WTA_highly_ranked p → MostActive p

    b. Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by WTA.
        ∀ p, AtRG2022 p → LostTo p iga → WTA_highly_ranked p

    c. All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
        ∀ p, AtRG2022 p → Female p → LostTo p iga

    d. All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
        ∀ p, AtRG2022 p → Female p ∨ Male p

    e. All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
        ∀ p, AtRG2022 p → Male p → LostTo p rafael

    f. If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
        (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) → ¬ Male coco

    g. Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.
        AtRG2022 coco

 4. Conclusion: Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal.
        LostTo coco rafael

 5. We'll formalize accordingly.

 Important: We need to declare the specific players (iga, rafael, coco) as constants of type Player.

 Note: The premise (f) has a disjunction and a negation. We'll write it as:
        axiom T6 : WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael → ¬ Male coco

 However, note that the premise says "if ... or ... then ...", so we use implication with a disjunction in the antecedent.

 6. We'll define:
      axiom Player : Type
      axiom iga : Player
      axiom rafael : Player
      axiom coco : Player

      axiom WTA_highly_ranked : Player → Prop
      axiom MostActive : Player → Prop
      axiom LostTo : Player → Player → Prop
      axiom Female : Player → Prop
      axiom Male : Player → Prop
      axiom AtRG2022 : Player → Prop

 Then the premises as axioms T1 to T7 (with T7 being AtRG2022 coco).

 7. The theorem will be: LostTo coco rafael

 Let's write the code accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion provided, I'll formalize the logical structure in Lean 4. Here's the complete solution:

<lean>
axiom Player : Type

-- Specific players
axiom iga : Player
axiom rafael : Player
axiom coco : Player

-- Predicates
axiom WTA_highly_ranked : Player → Prop
axiom MostActive : Player → Prop
axiom LostTo : Player → Player → Prop
axiom Female : Player → Prop
axiom Male : Player → Prop
axiom AtRG2022 : Player → Prop

-- Premises
axiom T1 : ∀ p : Player, WTA_highly_ranked p → MostActive p
axiom T2 : ∀ p : Player, AtRG2022 p → LostTo p iga → WTA_highly_ranked p
axiom T3 : ∀ p : Player, AtRG2022 p → Female p → LostTo p iga
axiom T4 : ∀ p : Player, AtRG2022 p → Female p ∨ Male p
axiom T5 : ∀ p : Player, AtRG2022 p → Male p → LostTo p rafael
axiom T6 : (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) → ¬ Male coco
axiom T7 : AtRG2022 coco

-- Conclusion to formalize
theorem goal : LostTo coco rafael := sorry
</lean>

Explanation of the formalization:
1. Created a `Player` type for tennis players
2. Defined specific players: `iga`, `rafael`, and `coco`
3. Created predicates:
   - `WTA_highly_ranked` for WTA ranking status
   - `MostActive` for active player status
   - `LostTo` for match outcomes
   - `Female`/`Male` for gender categories
   - `AtRG2022` for Roland Garros 2022 participation
4. Formalized the 7 premises as axioms T1-T7
5. Declared the conclusion as a theorem with `sorry` placeholder

The formalization captures all relationships:
- Premise 1: WTA ranking implies active player (T1)
- Premise 2: Losing to Iga implies WTA ranking (T2)
- Premise 3: Female players lost to Iga (T3)
- Premise 4: Players are female or male (T4)
- Premise 5: Male players lost to Nadal (T5)
- Premise 6: Coco's status implies not male (T6)
- Premise 7: Coco's participation (T7)
- Conclusion: Coco lost to Nadal (goal)


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and we need to prove `LostTo coco rafael`.

 Let's analyze the axioms:

 T1: ∀ p, WTA_highly_ranked p → MostActive p
 T2: ∀ p, AtRG2022 p → LostTo p iga → WTA_highly_ranked p
 T3: ∀ p, AtRG2022 p → Female p → LostTo p iga
 T4: ∀ p, AtRG2022 p → Female p ∨ Male p
 T5: ∀ p, AtRG2022 p → Male p → LostTo p rafael
 T6: (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) → ¬ Male coco
 T7: AtRG2022 coco

 We know `T7: AtRG2022 coco`.

 By T4 and T7, we have: `Female coco ∨ Male coco`.

 We need to show `LostTo coco rafael`. Notice that T5 says if coco is male and at RG2022, then LostTo coco rafael.
 But we also have T6 which says that if either WTA_highly_ranked coco or LostTo coco rafael, then coco is not male.

 So, if we assume `Male coco`, then by T5 and T7 we get `LostTo coco rafael`. But then T6 would say that if we have `LostTo coco rafael` (which we just got) then `¬ Male coco`, which contradicts `Male coco`.

 Therefore, `Male coco` leads to a contradiction.

 So we must have `¬ Male coco`, which by T4 (and T7) implies `Female coco` (since T4 says `Female coco ∨ Male coco`).

 Now, by T3: since `AtRG2022 coco` (T7) and `Female coco`, we get `LostTo coco iga`.

 Then, by T2: with `AtRG2022 coco` and `LostTo coco iga`, we get `WTA_highly_ranked coco`.

 Now, T6 says: `(WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) → ¬ Male coco`. We already have `WTA_highly_ranked coco`, so the premise of T6 is satisfied (left disjunct true) and we get `¬ Male coco` (which we already have).

 But note: we haven't yet proved `LostTo coco rafael`. How do we get it?

 Let me reexamine:

 We have two cases from T4: Female coco or Male coco.

 Case 1: Male coco.
   Then by T5: LostTo coco rafael.
   But then T6: since LostTo coco rafael (so the right disjunct is true) implies ¬ Male coco -> contradiction.

 Case 2: Female coco.
   Then by T3: LostTo coco iga -> so we have that.
   Then by T2: WTA_highly_ranked coco.

   Now, we want LostTo coco rafael? We don't have a direct way from Female coco to LostTo coco rafael.

 However, note that T6 says: (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) → ¬ Male coco.

 We have WTA_highly_ranked coco, so the disjunction is true and we get ¬ Male coco. But that doesn't give us LostTo coco rafael.

 How can we get LostTo coco rafael? We don't have an axiom that says if coco is female then she lost to rafael? 

 Let me check the axioms again:

 T5: ∀ p, AtRG2022 p → Male p → LostTo p rafael.

 So if coco is female, we cannot use T5 to get LostTo coco rafael.

 What else? We have T3: for female players at RG2022, they lost to iga. But that doesn't say anything about rafael.

 So we have a problem: we cannot directly get LostTo coco rafael in the Female coco case.

 But wait: we have a contradiction in the Male coco case, so we must have Female coco. And we have LostTo coco iga. But we need LostTo coco rafael.

 How can we proceed?

 Let me look at T6 again: 
   T6: (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) → ¬ Male coco

 We have ¬ Male coco (from the disjunction of T4 and the contradiction in the Male case). But note: T6 is an implication. It does not say that if ¬ Male coco then we have the disjunction. It says the disjunction implies ¬ Male coco.

 So we cannot use ¬ Male coco to get the disjunction.

 However, we have WTA_highly_ranked coco (from Female coco, T7, T3, and T2). So the disjunction (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) is true because the left part is true. Therefore, by T6 we get ¬ Male coco. But we already have that.

 Now, we still don't have LostTo coco rafael.

 But note: we have not used T1. T1 says: WTA_highly_ranked coco → MostActive coco. That doesn't seem to help.

 What if we try to assume the negation of the goal? We want to prove LostTo coco rafael.

 Alternatively, let me try to see if we can get a contradiction without assuming the negation.

 We have two cases: Male coco and Female coco.

 In the Male coco case:
   T5: LostTo coco rafael -> so we have the goal.
   But then T6: (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) is true (because LostTo coco rafael is true) -> so ¬ Male coco -> contradiction.

 So in the Male coco case we get a contradiction, but we also get the goal (LostTo coco rafael) before the contradiction. However, we cannot have a contradiction and then keep the goal? 

 Actually, in intuitionistic logic, if we get a contradiction we can prove anything. But here we are in classical? Lean is classical by default? Actually, Lean is a classical system for Prop.

 However, note: we are not forced to use the Male coco case to prove the goal. We can do:

   have h_male_contradiction : Male coco -> False := 
        fun (h_male : Male coco) => 
        have h_lost : LostTo coco rafael := T5 coco T7 h_male
        have h_not_male : ¬ Male coco := T6 (Or.inr h_lost)
        h_not_male h_male

   Then we have: 
        h_female : ¬ Male coco -> ... but wait we have h_male_contradiction which is Male coco -> False, so we have ¬ Male coco.

   Then by T4: AtRG2022 coco -> Female coco ∨ Male coco, so with T7 we have:
        or.elim (T4 coco T7) 
          (fun h_female : Female coco => ...)
          (fun h_male : Male coco => False.elim (h_male_contradiction h_male))

   In the Female coco branch:
        we get LostTo coco iga (by T3) and then WTA_highly_ranked coco (by T2) -> so we have that.

   But we still don't have LostTo coco rafael.

 So we have a problem: we cannot prove LostTo coco rafael in the Female coco branch.

 However, note that T6 says: if we have (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) then ¬ Male coco. We have WTA_highly_ranked coco, so we get ¬ Male coco. But that doesn't give us LostTo coco rafael.

 What if we try to prove LostTo coco rafael by contradiction? Assume ¬ LostTo coco rafael.

 Then, in the Female coco branch we have:
   We have ¬ LostTo coco rafael.

   Now, what about T6? T6 requires the disjunction. We have WTA_highly_ranked coco, so the disjunction holds and we get ¬ Male coco -> which we already have.

   But we don't get any contradiction.

 Alternatively, let me see if we can use T6 to force a contradiction in the Female coco branch if we assume ¬ LostTo coco rafael? Not directly.

 Wait, we have T5: only for male players. And T3: only for female players losing to iga.

 There's no axiom that says coco must lose to rafael if female? 

 So is the theorem actually false? 

 But the problem asks to prove `LostTo coco rafael`.

 Let me reread the axioms:

 T6: (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) → ¬ Male coco

 This is equivalent to: 
      ¬ (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) ∨ ¬ Male coco
   ≡ (¬ WTA_highly_ranked coco ∧ ¬ LostTo coco rafael) ∨ ¬ Male coco

 So if we assume ¬ LostTo coco rafael and also ¬ WTA_highly_ranked coco, then we would have the left part of the disjunction and hence ¬ Male coco.

 But we don't have ¬ WTA_highly_ranked coco? In the Female branch we actually have WTA_highly_ranked coco (via T3 and T2).

 So in the Female branch, we have WTA_highly_ranked coco, so the disjunction holds and we get ¬ Male coco -> which is consistent.

 But we still don't have LostTo coco rafael.

 How about the Male branch? We already saw that Male branch leads to contradiction. So we are left with Female coco and we have:

   Female coco -> LostTo coco iga -> WTA_highly_ranked coco.

 And we have ¬ LostTo coco rafael? But we don't have any axiom that says that coco cannot lose to both? Actually, we have no axiom that says a player can lose to only one.

 So it's possible that coco lost to iga and also lost to rafael? But we don't have an axiom that forces that.

 Alternatively, is there an axiom that says if a player is female then they are not male? We have:

   T4: AtRG2022 p → Female p ∨ Male p

   But we don't have an axiom that says Female and Male are disjoint. However, in the context, we probably assume they are disjoint? But the axioms don't state that.

 However, note T6: if we have either WTA_highly_ranked coco or LostTo coco rafael, then coco is not male. In the Female branch we have WTA_highly_ranked coco, so we get ¬ Male coco. And from T4 we have Female coco ∨ Male coco, so by the Female branch we are in Female coco and not Male coco.

 But we still don't have LostTo coco rafael.

 What if we try to use T1? T1 says WTA_highly_ranked coco -> MostActive coco. That doesn't help.

 Alternatively, let me see if we can get LostTo coco rafael from somewhere else.

 There is no other axiom.

 So it seems we cannot prove LostTo coco rafael? 

 But wait: we have not used the fact that in the Male branch we get LostTo coco rafael and then a contradiction. However, in the Male branch we get LostTo coco rafael and then we get ¬ Male coco which contradicts Male coco. So the Male branch is impossible. But in the Female branch we don't get LostTo coco rafael.

 However, note that the goal is LostTo coco rafael. We have no way to get it in the Female branch.

 Unless we can show that coco must be male? But we showed that being male leads to a contradiction, so she must be female. And then we have no way to get LostTo coco rafael.

 So the theorem might be false? But the problem asks to replace the sorry.

 Alternatively, let me try to see if we can get LostTo coco rafael without the Male branch.

 We have T5: only for male players.

 And T3: only for female players -> lost to iga.

 There's no axiom that says a player loses to rafael if they are female? 

 So perhaps the theorem is not provable? But then we would have to answer Uncertain? Or False?

 However, note that the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry'", implying that the theorem is true and we can prove it.

 Let me double-check the axioms:

   T6: (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) → ¬ Male coco

 We can read T6 as: if coco is male, then she is not WTA_highly_ranked and she did not lose to rafael.

 But we have T5: if coco is male and at RG2022, then she lost to rafael.

 So if coco is male, then by T5 she lost to rafael, but by T6 (if she lost to rafael then ¬ Male) we get a contradiction. So coco cannot be male.

 Therefore, coco is female (by T4 and T7).

 Then by T3: she lost to iga.

 Then by T2: she is WTA_highly_ranked.

 Now, we have WTA_highly_ranked coco -> which satisfies the premise of T6 (left disjunct) and we get ¬ Male coco -> which we already have.

 But we still don't have LostTo coco rafael.

 However, note that T6 does not say that if ¬ Male coco then we have the disjunction. It only uses the disjunction to conclude ¬ Male coco.

 So we are stuck.

 What if we try to use the disjunction again? We have WTA_highly_ranked coco, so the disjunction (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) is true. But T6 only gives us ¬ Male coco, which we already have.

 There's no other axiom that uses LostTo coco rafael except T5 (which requires Male) and T6 (which we already used).

 So it seems we cannot prove LostTo coco rafael.

 But wait, there's a possibility: in the Female branch, we have LostTo coco iga. Is there an axiom that says that if a player lost to iga then they are WTA_highly_ranked? That's T2: but T2 requires AtRG2022 and LostTo p iga to get WTA_highly_ranked, which we used.

 And then T1: WTA_highly_ranked implies MostActive -> which doesn't help.

 So I think there might be a mistake in the problem.

 However, let me try to see if we can derive a contradiction from the assumption that ¬ LostTo coco rafael.

 Assume ¬ LostTo coco rafael.

 We have:
   T7: AtRG2022 coco.
   T4: Female coco ∨ Male coco.

   Case 1: Male coco.
        Then by T5: LostTo coco rafael -> but we assumed ¬ LostTo coco rafael -> contradiction.

   Case 2: Female coco.
        Then by T3: LostTo coco iga.
        Then by T2: WTA_highly_ranked coco.
        Then T6: (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) is true -> so ¬ Male coco -> which is consistent (we are in Female).

   So no contradiction.

 Therefore, the assumption ¬ LostTo coco rafael is consistent with the axioms in the Female branch.

 Hence, we cannot prove LostTo coco rafael.

 But wait, in the Male branch we get a contradiction regardless of the assumption on LostTo coco rafael? Actually, in the Male branch we get LostTo coco rafael by T5, which contradicts the assumption ¬ LostTo coco rafael. So in the Male branch, assuming ¬ LostTo coco rafael leads to contradiction (because T5 gives LostTo coco rafael).

 So overall, if we assume ¬ LostTo coco rafael, then:

   - In the Male branch: we get LostTo coco rafael (by T5) -> which contradicts the assumption.
   - In the Female branch: we don't get a contradiction.

 But since the Male branch is impossible (because we already know from earlier that Male coco leads to a contradiction even without the assumption), we only have the Female branch and there we have no contradiction.

 Therefore, the assumption ¬ LostTo coco rafael is consistent.

 So the theorem `LostTo coco rafael` is not provable.

 However, let me see if we can prove it by classical reasoning.

 We have:

   have h_em : LostTo coco rafael ∨ ¬ LostTo coco rafael := by apply Classical.em

   cases h_em with
   | inl h => exact h
   | inr not_lost => 

   Then we have not_lost: ¬ LostTo coco rafael.

   Now, from T4 and T7: Female coco ∨ Male coco.

   cases that:
   | inl female => 
        have lost_iga := T3 coco T7 female
        have wta := T2 coco T7 lost_iga
        have not_male := T6 (Or.inl wta)
        -- no contradiction, and we are in the branch where we assume not_lost, so we have to derive False?
        -- but we don't have any contradiction here.

   | inr male =>
        have lost_rafael := T5 coco T7 male   -- this is LostTo coco rafael
        contradiction   -- because we have not_lost and lost_rafael

   So in the Male branch we get a contradiction. In the Female branch we don't.

   Therefore, we cannot conclude False from not_lost. Hence, we cannot prove LostTo coco rafael by contradiction.

 Alternatively, we can use the fact that the Male branch is impossible to force the Female branch, but then we still don't have the goal.

 So I think the theorem is not provable.

 But wait: the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", meaning the axioms are consistent? And the theorem is to be proven.

 Let me try to see if there's a different interpretation.

 Another approach: use T6 to get ¬ Male coco first, and then use that to force the Female branch.

 How can we get ¬ Male coco? We need the disjunction (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael).

 We don't have either yet.

 But note: if we can prove WTA_highly_ranked coco without knowing the gender, then we get ¬ Male coco.

 How to prove WTA_highly_ranked coco? We need T2: which requires LostTo coco iga.

 How to get LostTo coco iga? We need Female coco (by T3) or Male coco? But there's no axiom for Male coco to lose to iga.

 T3: only for female.

 T5: for male -> lost to rafael.

 So we cannot get LostTo coco iga without Female coco.

 So we are back to the same problem.

 Therefore, I conclude that the theorem `LostTo coco rafael` is not provable from the given axioms.

 But the problem asks to replace 'sorry' with a proof. 

 Alternatively, is there a proof that I missed?

 Let me try to use T6 in a different way.

 We have T7: AtRG2022 coco.

 By T4: Female coco or Male coco.

 If Male coco, then T5: LostTo coco rafael -> which is our goal.

 If Female coco, then T3: LostTo coco iga.

 Now, we have LostTo coco iga, and then T2: WTA_highly_ranked coco.

 Now, T6: (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) -> ¬ Male coco.

 We have WTA_highly_ranked coco, so the disjunction is true -> so ¬ Male coco.

 But we already know that from the Female branch.

 However, note that T6 does not give us LostTo coco rafael.

 But wait: is there a way to get LostTo coco rafael from the Female branch? There is no axiom that says so.

 Unless we can show that coco must have lost to rafael because she is active or something? But T1 only says she is MostActive, which doesn't mention losses.

 So I think the axioms are insufficient.

 However, let me try to see if we can use the fact that we have ¬ Male coco to then use T5 in some way? T5 requires Male coco, which we don't have.

 So I give up.

 Given the above, I must say that the theorem is not provable. Therefore, the answer should be Uncertain? But the problem asks for a proof.

 But wait, there is a proof! We can do:

   by_contra h_not_lost   -- assume ¬ LostTo coco rafael
   have : Female coco ∨ Male coco := T4 coco T7
   cases this with
   | inl female =>
        have lost_iga := T3 coco T7 female
        have wta := T2 coco T7 lost_iga
        have not_male := T6 (Or.inl wta)
        -- at this point we have female and not_male, and our assumption h_not_lost, but no contradiction
   | inr male =>
        have lost_rafael := T5 coco T7 male
        contradiction   -- because h_not_lost and lost_rafael

   -- But we don't have a contradiction in the female branch.

   -- However, note that in the female branch we have not_male, but we also have female, which is consistent.

   -- So we haven't derived False.

   -- Therefore, we cannot discharge the by_contra.

 Alternatively, we can try to show that the Male branch is impossible and then use that to force the Female branch, but then we still don't have the goal.

 But wait, there is a different approach:

   We know that if coco is male, then we get LostTo coco rafael (by T5) and then by T6 we get ¬ Male coco -> contradiction. So coco is not male.

   Then by T4 and T7: Female coco.

   Then by T3: LostTo coco iga.

   Then by T2: WTA_highly_ranked coco.

   Now, we want LostTo coco rafael. How?

   But note: T6 says: (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) -> ¬ Male coco.

   We have WTA_highly_ranked coco, so the disjunction holds and we get ¬ Male coco -> which we already have.

   But we still don't have LostTo coco rafael.

   However, consider: we have no axiom that says a player can only lose to one person. So it's possible that coco lost to iga and also lost to rafael? 

   But we don't have an axiom that says she lost to rafael.

   Alternatively, is there an axiom that we haven't used that might force it? We've used all except T1.

   T1: WTA_highly_ranked coco -> MostActive coco.

   What does MostActive mean? It doesn't relate to losses.

   So I think the proof is not possible.

 Therefore, I must conclude that the theorem is not provable.

 But the problem states that the axioms are validated and the theorem declaration is given. It is possible that I made a mistake.

 Let me try to prove it in Lean with the given axioms.

 However, since I don't have Lean handy, I will try to write a proof that uses classical logic and see if I can find a way.

 We can do:

   have h_male_imp_lost : Male coco -> LostTo coco rafael := fun h => T5 coco T7 h
   have h_male_imp_not_male : Male coco -> ¬ Male coco := 
        fun h => T6 (Or.inr (h_male_imp_lost h)) 
   have not_male : ¬ Male coco := fun h => h_male_imp_not_male h h

   have female : Female coco := 
        have h_or := T4 coco T7
        Or.resolve_right h_or not_male

   have lost_iga : LostTo coco iga := T3 coco T7 female
   have wta : WTA_highly_ranked coco := T2 coco T7 lost_iga

   -- Now, we need LostTo coco rafael. How?

   -- We have not_male and female, and wta.

   -- But we have no way to get LostTo coco rafael.

   -- So we cannot prove it.

 Given the above, I think the answer is that the theorem is not provable, so we cannot replace the sorry with a proof.

 However, the problem says: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof."

 So what should I do?

 I recall that in some cases, we can use the fact that the Male branch is impossible to then use the law of excluded middle on the goal.

 But note: we have classical reasoning. We can do:

   by_contra h   -- h: ¬ LostTo coco rafael

   -- Now, we have two cases: Male coco or Female coco (from T4 and T7)

   cases (T4 coco T7) with
   | inl female =>
        have lost_iga := T3 _ _ female
        have wta := T2 _ _ lost_iga
        have not_male := T6 (Or.inl wta)
        -- This doesn't contradict h
        -- But we also have h: ¬ LostTo coco rafael, and there's no axiom that says Female coco implies not lost to rafael? 
        -- So we are done with this branch? We haven't derived False.
   | inr male =>
        have lost_rafael := T5 _ _ male
        exact h lost_rafael   -- this is a contradiction

   -- In the female branch we haven't derived False, so we cannot close the proof.

 Therefore, the proof by contradiction fails.

 Alternatively, we can try to use the disjunction in T6 to force LostTo coco rafael if we don't have WTA_highly_ranked coco.

 But we do have WTA_highly_ranked coco in the Female branch, so we don't need the disjunction to be from the right part.

 So I think it's hopeless.

 After careful analysis, I believe the theorem as stated is not provable from the given axioms.

 Therefore, I will answer Uncertain.

 But the problem asks for the complete code with proof. Since I cannot find a proof, I will leave the sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 However, the instruction says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term."

 But if I cannot find one, I cannot comply.

 Given the above, I think there might be a typo in the axioms or the theorem.

 Let me reread T6: 
   T6 : (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) → ¬ Male coco

 What if we interpret T6 as: if coco is male, then she is not WTA_highly_ranked and she did not lose to rafael.

 But then with T5: if she is male, then she lost to rafael -> contradiction. So she is not male.

 Then she is female, and then she lost to iga, and then she is WTA_highly_ranked.

 But we have no axiom that says she must lose to rafael even if she is female.

 So the conclusion `LostTo coco rafael` is not entailed.

 Therefore, I will output the code with sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 However, the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", so it's possible that the axioms are sufficient and I am missing something.

 Let me try one more time:

   We have: 
        T6: (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) → ¬ Male coco

   We can also read it as: ¬ Male coco is true if either WTA_highly_ranked coco or LostTo coco rafael is true.

   We have to prove LostTo coco rafael.

   What if we try to show that ¬ (WTA_highly_ranked coco) -> then by T6 applied in the contrapositive? 

   But T6 doesn't give us the converse.

   Alternatively, we can use proof by cases on the disjunction in T6's premise.

   Case 1: WTA_highly_ranked coco.
        then we have ¬ Male coco.
        then from T4 and T7: Female coco.
        then by T3: LostTo coco iga.
        then by T2: we already have WTA_highly_ranked coco -> so nothing new.
        and we don't have LostTo coco rafael.

   Case 2: LostTo coco rafael.
        then we have the goal.

   So if we can show that case 1 leads to LostTo coco rafael, then we are done. But it doesn't.

   Therefore, the only hope is if we can show that case 1 is impossible, forcing case 2.

   How to show that WTA_highly_ranked coco is impossible?

   We have no axiom that says WTA_highly_ranked coco implies anything that contradicts the other axioms.

   In fact, in the Female branch we have WTA_highly_ranked coco and it is consistent.

   So we cannot.

 Given the above, I think the answer is that the proof is not possible.

 Therefore, I will output the code with the original sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 But the problem says to replace sorry with a valid proof term. Since I can't, I must leave it as sorry.

 However, the instruction says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term."

 So if I can't, I have to say that it's not possible.

 But the problem might expect a proof.

 Let me try to prove it by:
   have := T6 _   -- we need to provide a proof of (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael)

   How can we get that disjunction? We can use classical.em: 
        have h_disj : WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael := by apply Classical.em

   Then we can do:
        have not_male := T6 h_disj

   Then from not_male and T4 and T7: Female coco.

   Then have lost_iga := T3 _ _ female

   Then have wta := T2 _ _ lost_iga

   Now, we have wta: WTA_highly_ranked coco.

   But we also have h_disj: either wta or lost rafael.

   Since we have wta, the disjunction is satisfied.

   But we still don't have lost rafael.

   Unless we are in the right disjunct of h_disj.

   So we case on h_disj:

        case inl wta' => 
             -- we have wta from above, so nothing new.
             -- and we still don't have lost rafael.
        case inr lost_rafael =>
             exact lost_rafael

   So in the right disjunct we have the goal, in the left we don't.

   Therefore, we only have the goal in one branch.

   So we cannot prove it for the left branch.

   Hence, this also fails.

 Therefore, I am out of ideas.

 I will output the code with sorry and answer Uncertain.

 However, the problem says "complete code with a valid proof", so if I leave sorry, it's not valid.

 Given the instructions, I must provide a proof if possible, else I have to say Uncertain.

 So I will box my answer as Uncertain.

 But note: the example provided in the instructions had a proof. So this task is for a theorem that is true.

 Perhaps there is a proof using the fact that if we don't have LostTo coco rafael, then by T6 we would need to have not (WTA_highly_ranked coco) to avoid concluding not male, but then in the female branch we get WTA_highly_ranked coco -> contradiction.

 Let me try that:

   Assume ¬ LostTo coco rafael.

   We want to derive False.

   Steps:

   have : Female coco ∨ Male coco := T4 coco T7

   case Male:
        have lost_rafael := T5 _ _ Male
        have not_lost_rafael from assumption
        contradiction.

   case Female:
        have lost_iga := T3 _ _ Female
        have wta := T2 _ _ lost_iga   [WTA_highly_ranked coco]

        Now, look at T6: (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) -> not male.
        Since we have WTA_highly_ranked coco, the disjunction is true, so not male.

        But we are in the Female branch, so not male is true.

        However, we also have ¬ LostTo coco rafael.

        Is there a contradiction? Only if we can show that Female implies something that contradicts not male? 
        But we have no axiom that says Female and Male are disjoint. We only have T4: Female or Male.

        And we have not male from T6, and Female from the branch, so it's consistent.

        Therefore, no contradiction in this branch.

   So overall, we only have a contradiction in the Male branch, not in the Female branch.

   Hence, the assumption ¬ LostTo coco rafael does not lead to a contradiction.

   Therefore, the theorem is not provable.

 So I will answer Uncertain.

 However, to comply with the format, I will provide the code with sorry and then answer Uncertain.

 But the problem says "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof."

 Since I cannot, I will leave the sorry.

 Alternatively, I might have to use a different proof that I haven't seen.

 After searching online or thinking more, I recall that in some cases we can use the following:

   have h := (T6 (Or.inr ?_))   -- if we can prove LostTo coco rafael, then we are done. But we can't.

   or:

   have h : ¬ Male coco := by
        apply T6
        apply Or.inr
        ???   -- we need LostTo coco rafael here, which is the goal.

   So that's circular.

 Given the above, I output the code unchanged and answer Uncertain.

 But note: the problem might have a typo. For example, if T6 was:
      T6 : (WTA_highly_ranked coco ∨ LostTo coco rafael) → ¬ Male coco
   and we also had an axiom that says Female coco implies not Male coco, and Male coco implies not Female coco, then we have disjointness, but still not the goal.

   or if there was an axiom that says every player at RG2022 loses to either iga or rafael, then in the Female branch we have lost to iga, so we might not have lost to rafael, but that's not helpful.

   or if there was an axiom that says no player loses to both, then in the Female branch we have lost to iga, so we cannot lose to rafael -> which contradicts the goal.

   so then the goal would be false.

   Given the axioms, we cannot prove it.

 Therefore, I think the answer is Uncertain.

 So here is the code:


=== RESPONSE ===
After careful analysis, the theorem `LostTo coco rafael` cannot be proven from the given axioms. The axioms establish that:
1. `coco` participated in RG2022 (`T7`)
2. `coco` is either female or male (`T4`)
3. If male, `coco` loses to rafael (`T5`), but this leads to a contradiction with `T6`
4. If female, `coco` loses to iga (`T3`) and is WTA highly ranked (`T2`)
5. There is no axiom linking female players to losing to rafael

The case analysis shows:
- Male case: Leads to contradiction (via `T5` and `T6`)
- Female case: Yields `LostTo coco iga` but not `LostTo coco rafael`

No axiom forces `LostTo coco rafael` in the female case, and the disjunction in `T6` doesn't provide this result. Classical reasoning (excluded middle) also fails to prove the theorem. The axioms are insufficient to prove the conclusion.
