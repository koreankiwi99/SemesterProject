STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion. We need to formalize the logical structure.

Premises:
1. Yale University is a private Ivy League research university.
2. Yale University moved to New Haven in 1716.
3. (We ignore the endowment fact as it doesn't relate to the conclusion.)
4. (The list of residential colleges is also not relevant to the conclusion.)

Conclusion: A private Ivy League research university moved to New Haven.

We note that the conclusion is existential: There exists a private Ivy League research university that moved to New Haven.

However, the premises tell us specifically about Yale University. So we can use Yale as the witness.

Steps:
- We'll define a type for entities (like universities).
- We'll have a constant for Yale University.
- We'll have predicates:
    * `Private` : entity → Prop
    * `IvyLeague` : entity → Prop
    * `ResearchUniversity` : entity → Prop
  Alternatively, we might combine these into one predicate if they are always used together? But note the premise says "is a private Ivy League research university", so we can break it down.

But note: the premise says Yale is all three. We can have:
  axiom P1 : Private Yale
  axiom P2 : IvyLeague Yale
  axiom P3 : ResearchUniversity Yale

Alternatively, we might have a single predicate for being a "private Ivy League research university", but that seems less modular.

However, the conclusion says "a private Ivy League research university", meaning an entity that is private AND Ivy League AND a research university.

So we'll define the properties separately.

Additionally, we have:
  axiom MovedToNewHaven : entity → Prop
  and we know: MovedToNewHaven Yale

Then the conclusion is: ∃ x, Private x ∧ IvyLeague x ∧ ResearchUniversity x ∧ MovedToNewHaven x

But note: the premises also say that Yale moved to New Haven in 1716. We don't need to model the year for the conclusion? The conclusion just says "moved to New Haven", so we ignore the year.

So we'll formalize:

- We have a type `obj` for objects (universities, etc.)
- We have a constant `Yale` of type `obj`.
- We have predicates: `Private`, `IvyLeague`, `ResearchUniversity`, `MovedToNewHaven`.
- Premises:
    P1: Private Yale
    P2: IvyLeague Yale
    P3: ResearchUniversity Yale
    P4: MovedToNewHaven Yale

- Conclusion: ∃ x, Private x ∧ IvyLeague x ∧ ResearchUniversity x ∧ MovedToNewHaven x

But note: the conclusion does not specify that it is Yale, but we know from the premises that Yale satisfies it. So we can state the existence.

However, the problem says to formalize the conclusion without proving. So we'll write:

  theorem goal : ∃ x, Private x ∧ IvyLeague x ∧ ResearchUniversity x ∧ MovedToNewHaven x := sorry

But wait: the premises also mention a list of residential colleges. Since the conclusion does not refer to these, we can ignore them.

Let's write the Lean code accordingly.

Important: We must use `sorry` for the theorem.

We'll define:
  axiom obj : Type
  axiom Yale : obj
  axiom Private : obj → Prop
  axiom IvyLeague : obj → Prop
  axiom ResearchUniversity : obj → Prop
  axiom MovedToNewHaven : obj → Prop

Then the premises:
  axiom P1 : Private Yale
  axiom P2 : IvyLeague Yale
  axiom P3 : ResearchUniversity Yale
  axiom P4 : MovedToNewHaven Yale

And the theorem:
  theorem goal : ∃ x : obj, Private x ∧ IvyLeague x ∧ ResearchUniversity x ∧ MovedToNewHaven x := sorry

But note: the conclusion says "A private Ivy League research university moved to New Haven." which is exactly the existential statement.

However, we have to be cautious: the premises only talk about Yale. But the conclusion is existential and we have Yale as a witness. However, we are not proving it, so we just state the theorem.

Alternatively, we might interpret the conclusion as: There is at least one private Ivy League research university that moved to New Haven. And we know Yale is one.

But note: the conclusion does not say "Yale moved to New Haven", it says "a ...". So existential is appropriate.

Let's code accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion provided, here's the Lean 4 formalization:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Yale : obj
axiom Private : obj → Prop
axiom IvyLeague : obj → Prop
axiom ResearchUniversity : obj → Prop
axiom MovedToNewHaven : obj → Prop

axiom premise1 : Private Yale
axiom premise2 : IvyLeague Yale
axiom premise3 : ResearchUniversity Yale
axiom premise4 : MovedToNewHaven Yale

theorem goal : ∃ x : obj, Private x ∧ IvyLeague x ∧ ResearchUniversity x ∧ MovedToNewHaven x := sorry
</lean>

Explanation:
1. `obj` represents the type of entities (universities)
2. `Yale` is a specific constant of type `obj`
3. Predicates defined:
   - `Private` for private universities
   - `IvyLeague` for Ivy League status
   - `ResearchUniversity` for research universities
   - `MovedToNewHaven` for relocation to New Haven
4. Premises formalized as axioms:
   - Yale is private, Ivy League, and a research university
   - Yale moved to New Haven
5. Conclusion formalized as:
   - Existential quantifier (∃) for "a university"
   - Conjunction (∧) of all required properties
   - `sorry` placeholder indicates unproven theorem

Note: The endowment information and college list were excluded as they don't contribute to the logical structure of the conclusion.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given that Yale is an object and has the properties Private, IvyLeague, ResearchUniversity, and MovedToNewHaven.
 The goal is to prove that there exists an object x such that x is Private, IvyLeague, ResearchUniversity, and MovedToNewHaven.

 Since we have Yale and all these properties for Yale, we can use Yale as the witness.

 We can prove the goal by applying `exists.intro` (or using the `exists` syntax) with Yale and then proving the conjunction.

 The conjunction of four propositions can be built by combining `and.intro` multiple times.

 Alternatively, we can use the `⟨ ... , ... , ... , ... ⟩` syntax for the conjunction.

 Steps:
 1. We know `premise1 : Private Yale`
 2. We know `premise2 : IvyLeague Yale`
 3. We know `premise3 : ResearchUniversity Yale`
 4. We know `premise4 : MovedToNewHaven Yale`

 We can write:
   exists Yale, ⟨premise1, premise2, premise3, premise4⟩

 But note: the conjunction is nested: Private x ∧ (IvyLeague x ∧ (ResearchUniversity x ∧ MovedToNewHaven x))
 However, the `⟨a, b, c, d⟩` syntax will build the nested conjunction appropriately.

 Alternatively, we can break it down:
   have h1 : Private Yale := premise1,
   have h2 : IvyLeague Yale := premise2,
   have h3 : ResearchUniversity Yale := premise3,
   have h4 : MovedToNewHaven Yale := premise4,
   exact exists.intro Yale (and.intro h1 (and.intro h2 (and.intro h3 h4)))

 But a more concise way is to use the term mode with the angle brackets.

 Since the theorem is an existential, we can use:
   `exists Yale` and then prove the conjunction.

 However, in Lean, we can also write:
   `⟨Yale, premise1, premise2, premise3, premise4⟩`

 But note: the type of the existential is `∃ x, Private x ∧ IvyLeague x ∧ ResearchUniversity x ∧ MovedToNewHaven x`.
 The term `⟨Yale, premise1, premise2, premise3, premise4⟩` will work because Lean will automatically build the nested `and` structure.

 Let me check: the expected structure is:
   Private x ∧ IvyLeague x ∧ ResearchUniversity x ∧ MovedToNewHaven x
 which is the same as:
   Private x ∧ (IvyLeague x ∧ (ResearchUniversity x ∧ MovedToNewHaven x))

 And the `⟨a, b, c, d⟩` for a conjunction of four elements is built as `a ∧ (b ∧ (c ∧ d))`.

 Therefore, we can write the proof term as:
   ⟨Yale, premise1, premise2, premise3, premise4⟩

 Alternatively, we can write:
   exists.intro Yale (and.intro premise1 (and.intro premise2 (and.intro premise3 premise4)))

 But the angle bracket version is more concise.

 So the complete code is:


=== RESPONSE ===
<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Yale : obj
axiom Private : obj → Prop
axiom IvyLeague : obj → Prop
axiom ResearchUniversity : obj → Prop
axiom MovedToNewHaven : obj → Prop

axiom premise1 : Private Yale
axiom premise2 : IvyLeague Yale
axiom premise3 : ResearchUniversity Yale
axiom premise4 : MovedToNewHaven Yale

theorem goal : ∃ x : obj, Private x ∧ IvyLeague x ∧ ResearchUniversity x ∧ MovedToNewHaven x := 
  ⟨Yale, premise1, premise2, premise3, premise4⟩
</lean>

ANSWER: True
