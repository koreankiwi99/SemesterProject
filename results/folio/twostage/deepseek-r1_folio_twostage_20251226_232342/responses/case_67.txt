STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion.
 The conclusion is: "Pierson College is a residential college at Yale."

 Steps:
 1. We need a type for entities. We can use `obj` as in the example, but note that we have universities and colleges.
    Alternatively, we might want two types: one for universities and one for colleges? However, the problem does not specify that.
    Since we are dealing with a list of residential colleges, we can treat them as objects.

 2. We have Yale University as an entity. We also have several colleges (like Pierson College) as entities.

 3. We are told that Yale is a private Ivy League research university. However, the conclusion does not depend on these attributes.
    So we might not need to represent them unless they are used in the reasoning. Since the conclusion is about Pierson being a residential college at Yale,
    we focus on the relevant parts.

 4. The premises state: "A list of residential colleges at Yale: ...". This suggests that we have a property of being a residential college at Yale.

 5. We can introduce:
    - An axiom for Yale University (as an object).
    - An axiom for each college (including Pierson College).
    - A predicate `ResidentialCollegeAtYale : obj → Prop` that indicates which objects are residential colleges at Yale.

 6. The premise explicitly lists the colleges that are residential colleges at Yale. Therefore, we can state that each of those colleges (including Pierson) satisfies the predicate.

 7. The conclusion is that Pierson College is a residential college at Yale. So we can state that as a theorem.

 However, note that the premises say "A list of residential colleges at Yale: ...". This list includes Pierson College. So we can have an axiom that states that each of the named colleges is a residential college at Yale.

 Implementation:

  Let's define:
    axiom obj : Type
    axiom YaleUniversity : obj
    axiom PiersonCollege : obj   (and similarly for the others? But note: we don't need all for the conclusion, but the premise lists them all.)

  However, the conclusion only requires Pierson College. But the premise lists multiple colleges. We have two options:

  Option 1: We define axioms for each college and then an axiom that says that each of these colleges is a residential college at Yale.

  Option 2: We define a predicate `ResidentialCollegeAtYale` and then an axiom that enumerates the colleges that satisfy it.

  But note: the premise says "A list of residential colleges at Yale: ...". This implies that these are the residential colleges at Yale? Or at least that they are residential colleges at Yale? We are not told that the list is exhaustive. However, for the purpose of the conclusion, we only need that Pierson College is one of them.

  Since the premise lists Pierson College in the list, we can safely say that Pierson College is a residential college at Yale.

  Therefore, we can have:

    axiom ResidentialCollegeAtYale : obj → Prop

    and then an axiom for each college in the list? That would be too verbose. Instead, we can have:

    axiom PiersonIsResidential : ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege

  But wait, the premise says "A list of residential colleges at Yale: ...". We are not told that every college in that list is a residential college at Yale? Actually, that's the meaning of the list. So we can have:

    axiom ListIncludes : ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege

  However, the premise lists multiple colleges. We are only concerned with Pierson College for the conclusion.

  Therefore, we can ignore the other colleges and just state that Pierson College is a residential college at Yale.

  But note: the problem says "Generate Lean 4 code with axiom definitions and a theorem declaration". We must formalize the premises? Actually, we are given premises and we are to formalize the logical structure. We don't have to formalize every premise if it is not needed for the conclusion? However, the premise about the list is the one that supports the conclusion.

  How about:

    We introduce:
      obj : Type
      YaleUniversity : obj
      PiersonCollege : obj

    And a predicate: ResidentialCollegeAtYale : obj → Prop

    Then, we have an axiom that says that PiersonCollege is in the list of residential colleges at Yale? But the premise does not say that the list is exhaustive. However, it says "A list of residential colleges at Yale" and includes Pierson. So we can interpret that as Pierson being one of them.

    Therefore, we can have:

      axiom T_list : ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege

    Then the theorem is:

      theorem goal : ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege := sorry

  But wait, that's just restating the axiom. However, note that the conclusion is directly supported by the premise about the list.

  Alternatively, we might formalize the entire list? But the conclusion only mentions Pierson.

  Considering the requirement: we are to formalize the logical structure. We are not required to prove anything, but we must represent the premises and the conclusion.

  However, the premises include other information (Yale is private, Ivy, moved to New Haven, endowment) that are not used in the conclusion. We can skip them because they are irrelevant to the conclusion.

  Therefore, we focus on:

    Premise: "A list of residential colleges at Yale: ... [including Pierson]"

    Conclusion: Pierson College is a residential college at Yale.

  So we can have:

    axiom obj : Type
    axiom YaleUniversity : obj
    axiom PiersonCollege : obj
    axiom ResidentialCollegeAtYale : obj → Prop
    axiom T_list : ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege   // because Pierson is in the list

    theorem goal : ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege := sorry

  But note: the premise says the list includes several colleges. We are only using Pierson. We don't need the others for the conclusion.

  However, if we want to be precise and formalize the entire list, we could do:

    axiom BenjaminFranklinCollege : obj
    axiom BerkeleyCollege : obj
    ... and so on ...

    axiom ResidentialCollegeAtYale : obj → Prop
    axiom T_list : 
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale BenjaminFranklinCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale BerkeleyCollege ∧
      ... ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege ∧
      ... 

    Then we can extract the fact for PiersonCollege by the conjunction.

  But the conclusion only requires PiersonCollege. So we can avoid defining all the others? However, the premise says "a list" and we are given that list. To be faithful, we should represent that the list exists and that it includes PiersonCollege.

  However, note: the problem does not require us to use every premise. It says "Premises" and then lists several. We are only concerned with the one that supports the conclusion.

  But the premise about the list is the one that directly supports the conclusion. And that premise says that the list includes PiersonCollege. So we can take that as a direct axiom.

  Therefore, I choose:

    We define `obj`, `YaleUniversity`, `PiersonCollege`, and the predicate `ResidentialCollegeAtYale`.
    We then have an axiom `T_list` that states that PiersonCollege is a residential college at Yale (because it is in the list).

  However, note: the premise says "A list of residential colleges at Yale: ...". This implies that each college in the list is a residential college at Yale. Therefore, we are justified in having an axiom for each one? But we don't need all for the conclusion.

  Since the problem asks for the conclusion about Pierson, we can just state the axiom for Pierson.

  Alternatively, if we want to represent the entire list, we could do:

    axiom Colleges : list obj   -- but we don't have a way to name the colleges? We need to refer to PiersonCollege in the conclusion.

  So it's better to have each college as a separate constant.

  Let me reconsider: the problem says "Generate Lean 4 code with axiom definitions and a theorem declaration". We are free to choose the representation.

  Option 1 (minimal, only what is needed for the conclusion):

    axiom obj : Type
    axiom YaleUniversity : obj
    axiom PiersonCollege : obj
    axiom ResidentialCollegeAtYale : obj → Prop
    axiom T_list : ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege   // because Pierson is in the list

    theorem goal : ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege := sorry

  Option 2 (represent the entire list):

    We define constants for all the colleges mentioned.

    axiom obj : Type
    axiom YaleUniversity : obj
    axiom BenjaminFranklinCollege : obj
    axiom BerkeleyCollege : obj
    axiom BranfordCollege : obj
    axiom DavenportCollege : obj
    axiom EzraStilesCollege : obj
    axiom GraceHopperCollege : obj
    axiom JonathanEdwardsCollege : obj
    axiom MorseCollege : obj
    axiom PauliMurrayCollege : obj
    axiom PiersonCollege : obj
    axiom SaybrookCollege : obj
    axiom SillimanCollege : obj
    axiom TimothyDwightCollege : obj
    axiom TrumbullCollege : obj

    axiom ResidentialCollegeAtYale : obj → Prop

    Then, we have an axiom that says each of these colleges is a residential college at Yale:

    axiom T_list : 
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale BenjaminFranklinCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale BerkeleyCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale BranfordCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale DavenportCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale EzraStilesCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale GraceHopperCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale JonathanEdwardsCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale MorseCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale PauliMurrayCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale SaybrookCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale SillimanCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale TimothyDwightCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale TrumbullCollege

    Then the theorem for PiersonCollege would be:

      theorem goal : ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege := sorry

    But note: we can prove it by `T_list` (using the conjunction) but we are not proving, we are just stating the theorem and using `sorry`.

  However, the problem says: "formalize the logical structure". Option 2 is more complete because it captures the entire list.

  But the problem also says: "Conclusion to formalize: Pierson College is a residential college at Yale."

  So we can do either. Since the premise lists all these colleges, I think we should represent the entire list.

  But note: the problem says "CRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax" and we are to wrap in <lean> tags.

  Writing a conjunction of 14 terms is tedious but straightforward.

  However, the problem does not require us to use every premise. The other premises (about Yale being private, moving to New Haven, endowment) are not used. We skip them.

  Let's go with Option 2 to represent the entire list.

  We'll define:

    axiom obj : Type

    -- Yale University
    axiom YaleUniversity : obj

    -- The residential colleges
    axiom BenjaminFranklinCollege : obj
    axiom BerkeleyCollege : obj
    axiom BranfordCollege : obj
    axiom DavenportCollege : obj
    axiom EzraStilesCollege : obj
    axiom GraceHopperCollege : obj
    axiom JonathanEdwardsCollege : obj
    axiom MorseCollege : obj
    axiom PauliMurrayCollege : obj
    axiom PiersonCollege : obj
    axiom SaybrookCollege : obj
    axiom SillimanCollege : obj
    axiom TimothyDwightCollege : obj
    axiom TrumbullCollege : obj

    -- The predicate for being a residential college at Yale
    axiom ResidentialCollegeAtYale : obj → Prop

    -- Axiom: Each of the above colleges is a residential college at Yale
    axiom T_list : 
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale BenjaminFranklinCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale BerkeleyCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale BranfordCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale DavenportCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale EzraStilesCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale GraceHopperCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale JonathanEdwardsCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale MorseCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale PauliMurrayCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale SaybrookCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale SillimanCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale TimothyDwightCollege ∧
      ResidentialCollegeAtYale TrumbullCollege

    theorem goal : ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege := sorry

  But note: the theorem is trivial because we have an axiom that directly includes PiersonCollege. However, we are using `sorry` so it doesn't matter.

  Alternatively, we could have defined the list as a set and then said PiersonCollege is in that set? But the problem says "a list" and then enumerates.

  Since we are in first-order logic, using a conjunction is standard.

  However, note: the premise does not say that these are the only residential colleges? But we don't need that for the conclusion.

  Therefore, this representation is sufficient.

  Let's write the code accordingly.

  IMPORTANT: We are skipping the other premises (about Yale being private, etc.) because they are irrelevant to the conclusion.

=== RESPONSE ===
The premises state that there is a list of residential colleges at Yale, which includes Pierson College. The conclusion asserts that Pierson College is indeed a residential college at Yale. We formalize this by:

1. Defining a type `obj` for entities
2. Introducing Yale University as an object
3. Defining all listed residential colleges as objects
4. Creating a predicate `ResidentialCollegeAtYale` to represent the property
5. Adding an axiom that explicitly states Pierson College has this property
6. Declaring the theorem with `sorry` as placeholder

STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given the axiom `PiersonIsResidential : ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege`
 and we need to prove `theorem goal : ResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege`

 The proof is immediate: we can use the axiom directly.

 Therefore, we replace `sorry` with `PiersonIsResidential`

 IMPORTANT: We must not modify any other part of the code.

 Let's write the complete code accordingly.
