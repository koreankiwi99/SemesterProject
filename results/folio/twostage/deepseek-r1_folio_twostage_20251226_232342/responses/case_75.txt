STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are formalizing the given premises and the conclusion about Hannah.
 We'll define:
   - A type `obj` for the people (and possibly other entities, but here it's people).
   - Predicates:
        WorkInStudentJobs : obj → Prop
        NeedEarnMoney : obj → Prop
        OrderTakeoutFrequently : obj → Prop
        EnjoyDiningHall : obj → Prop
        NotPickyEater : obj → Prop   [But note: we can define PickyEater and then use ¬, or directly define NotPickyEater. However, the premise says "they are not picky eaters", so let's define:]
        SpendTimeEatingFriends : obj → Prop   [for spending time eating and catching up with friends]

   - We have a constant for Hannah: `Hannah : obj`

   - We are given that Hannah is at Mary's school. Since all the premises are about "people at Mary's school", we can assume that Hannah is one of them. We don't need a separate axiom for that if we are quantifying over people at Mary's school? However, note the premises are universally quantified over people at Mary's school? Actually, the premises are stated as implications with the condition "people at Mary's school". But note: we have a specific person Hannah.

   Alternate approach: We can define a predicate `AtMarysSchool : obj → Prop` and then use that in the axioms.

   However, looking at the premises:

      "If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then ..."

   We can interpret: For all x, if x is at Mary's school and works in student jobs, then ...

   But note: the premises are about "people at Mary's school", so we can assume that the domain of discourse is people at Mary's school? Or we can explicitly include the condition.

   Since we have a specific individual (Hannah) and the premises are about people at Mary's school, it is safer to introduce a predicate `AtMarysSchool` and then state the axioms accordingly.

   Let's define:

      axiom obj : Type
      axiom AtMarysSchool : obj → Prop
      axiom WorkInStudentJobs : obj → Prop
      axiom NeedEarnMoney : obj → Prop
      axiom OrderTakeoutFrequently : obj → Prop
      axiom EnjoyDiningHall : obj → Prop
      axiom NotPickyEater : obj → Prop   [This is a property we can define, but note: the premise says "they are not picky eaters", so we can use this as a predicate meaning "is not a picky eater". Alternatively, we could define PickyEater and then use ¬. However, the conclusion does not require the negation, so we can choose either. Let's define `NotPickyEater` for clarity in the axiom.]

      Alternatively, we can define `PickyEater` and then use `¬ PickyEater` in the axiom? But the premise says "they are not picky eaters", so we can write:

          ∀ x, AtMarysSchool x → EnjoyDiningHall x → ¬ PickyEater x

      But the next premise uses "they are not picky eaters" as a positive statement? Actually, the conclusion does not involve picky eaters directly? However, note the last premise about Hannah says "she is neither picky nor needs to earn money", meaning `¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah`? But wait, the premise is:

          "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition."

      This is a bit complex. Let's break it down:

          Let H := Hannah
          We have: WorkInStudentJobs H ∧ (NeedEarnMoney H → (¬ PickyEater H ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney H))

      However, note: the consequent of the implication says ¬ NeedEarnMoney H, which would contradict the antecedent if NeedEarnMoney H holds? This seems to imply that NeedEarnMoney H must be false? But we are trying to conclude that Hannah needs to earn money? So we have to be careful.

      Actually, let me parse the premise:

          "Hannah works in student jobs on campus"  --> WorkInStudentJobs Hannah

          and

          "if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money" 

          i.e., NeedEarnMoney Hannah → (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah)

      Notice that the consequent includes ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah. So if we assume NeedEarnMoney Hannah, we get ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the implication forces that Hannah does not need to earn money? But wait, that contradicts the conclusion we are supposed to formalize? 

      However, note: the conclusion we are to formalize is: "Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition."

      This seems inconsistent? But let's read the entire premise again:

          "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition."

      This can be written as:

          WorkInStudentJobs Hannah ∧ (NeedEarnMoney Hannah → (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah))

      Now, note that the consequent of the implication includes ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah. So if NeedEarnMoney Hannah is true, then we get ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah (and also ¬ PickyEater Hannah) which is a contradiction. Therefore, the implication can only hold if NeedEarnMoney Hannah is false.

      But then we have WorkInStudentJobs Hannah and ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah.

      However, the first premise says:

          If people at Mary's school work in student jobs, then they need to earn money.

          ∀ x, AtMarysSchool x → WorkInStudentJobs x → NeedEarnMoney x

      Since Hannah is at Mary's school (axiom) and she works in student jobs, then we get NeedEarnMoney Hannah.

      This leads to a contradiction? 

      Therefore, there might be a typo in the premise? Or we are misreading.

      Let me re-read: "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition."

      The word "needs" in the consequent is the same as the antecedent? So:

          Let P: NeedEarnMoney Hannah
          Then the implication is: P → (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ P)

      This is equivalent to: P → false   (because ¬P is the negation of P)

      So the implication is equivalent to ¬P.

      Therefore, the premise says: WorkInStudentJobs Hannah ∧ ¬P.

      But then we have WorkInStudentJobs Hannah and ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah.

      Now, from the first premise: for Hannah (since she is at Mary's school), WorkInStudentJobs Hannah → NeedEarnMoney Hannah.

      So we have WorkInStudentJobs Hannah and ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah, which contradicts the first premise? 

      This suggests that the set of premises is inconsistent? But we are asked to formalize the conclusion that Hannah needs to earn money.

      How can we resolve? 

      Note: The problem says "formalize", meaning we just write the axioms and the conclusion without worrying about the proof. We are not required to resolve the inconsistency. So we write the axioms as given.

      Therefore, we will define `PickyEater` and then use negation.

      Alternatively, we can define `NotPickyEater` and then the premise would be:

          NeedEarnMoney Hannah → (NotPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah)

      which is the same as above.

      So let's define:

          axiom PickyEater : obj → Prop   [and then use ¬ when needed]

      Then the premise about Hannah becomes:

          WorkInStudentJobs Hannah ∧ (NeedEarnMoney Hannah → (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah))

      Now, we proceed.

   Steps:

      We'll define:
        obj : Type
        Hannah : obj
        AtMarysSchool : obj → Prop
        WorkInStudentJobs : obj → Prop
        NeedEarnMoney : obj → Prop
        OrderTakeoutFrequently : obj → Prop
        EnjoyDiningHall : obj → Prop
        PickyEater : obj → Prop   [so we can use ¬]
        SpendTimeEatingFriends : obj → Prop

      Axioms:

        A1: ∀ x : obj, AtMarysSchool x → WorkInStudentJobs x → NeedEarnMoney x
        A2: ∀ x : obj, AtMarysSchool x → OrderTakeoutFrequently x → WorkInStudentJobs x
        A3: ∀ x : obj, AtMarysSchool x → (OrderTakeoutFrequently x ∨ EnjoyDiningHall x)
        A4: ∀ x : obj, AtMarysSchool x → EnjoyDiningHall x → ¬ PickyEater x
        A5: ∀ x : obj, AtMarysSchool x → EnjoyDiningHall x → SpendTimeEatingFriends x
        A6: AtMarysSchool Hannah
        A7: WorkInStudentJobs Hannah ∧ (NeedEarnMoney Hannah → (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah))

      Conclusion: NeedEarnMoney Hannah

   However, note that A7 is a conjunction. We can split it into two axioms:

        A7a: WorkInStudentJobs Hannah
        A7b: NeedEarnMoney Hannah → (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah)

   Now, we write the Lean code accordingly.

   IMPORTANT: We must use the `¬` symbol for negation. In Lean, negation is written as `¬` which is a shorthand for `Not`.

   Let's code accordingly.

   Note: The premise A3 says "People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes." So we use `∨`.

   We'll write the axioms in the order given.

   We'll also note that the domain of quantification is over all `obj`, but we condition on `AtMarysSchool x` for the universal axioms.

   Finally, the theorem we want is `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`.

   We'll use `sorry` as the proof.

   Code:

Note: The last premise (A7) uses negation (`¬`) to represent "neither picky nor needs to earn money". The formalization preserves all logical relationships from the natural language premises without attempting to resolve any potential contradictions.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and we need to prove `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`.

Let's break down what we have:

1. Axiom A6: `AtMarysSchool Hannah`
2. Axiom A7: `WorkInStudentJobs Hannah ∧ (NeedEarnMoney Hannah → (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah))`

From A7, we get that Hannah works in student jobs (let's call this `W_Hannah`).

Now, using A1: Since Hannah is at Mary's school (A6) and she works in student jobs (from A7), then by A1 we have:
  `A1 Hannah A6 W_Hannah : NeedEarnMoney Hannah`

But wait, there's a catch: A7 also says that if Hannah needs to earn money, then we get a contradiction because it implies `¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah`. Specifically, the second part of A7 is:
  `NeedEarnMoney Hannah → (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah)`

This implication, if we assume `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`, leads to `¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah` (a contradiction). Therefore, we must avoid having `NeedEarnMoney Hannah` lead to this.

However, note that from A1 and the facts we have (A6 and the first part of A7) we can indeed derive `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`. But then we get a contradiction because we would have both `NeedEarnMoney Hannah` and `¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah`.

This suggests that the set of axioms might be inconsistent. But let's check:

We have:
  `H1: WorkInStudentJobs Hannah` (from A7)
  `H2: AtMarysSchool Hannah` (A6)

By A1: `∀ x, AtMarysSchool x → WorkInStudentJobs x → NeedEarnMoney x`
So for Hannah: `A1 Hannah H2 H1 : NeedEarnMoney Hannah`

Now, from A7 we also have:
  `H3: NeedEarnMoney Hannah → (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah)`

So if we have `NeedEarnMoney Hannah` (which we just got), then we can apply H3 to get:
  `H4: ¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah`
which gives us `H5: ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah`.

But we have both `NeedEarnMoney Hannah` and `¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah` -> contradiction.

Therefore, the axioms are inconsistent? But wait, we haven't used all axioms. Let me see if there's another way.

Alternatively, let's consider the other axioms:

A3: For Hannah, since she is at Mary's school, she either orders takeout frequently or enjoys dining hall meals.

A2: If she orders takeout frequently, then she works in student jobs (which we already know she does).

But note: we don't have any direct contradiction from the other axioms? However, we must consider the possibility that Hannah does not need to earn money? But we derived that she must.

Wait, maybe the issue is with the second part of A7. Let me write A7 again:
  `WorkInStudentJobs Hannah ∧ (NeedEarnMoney Hannah → (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah))`

This says: if Hannah needs to earn money, then she is not a picky eater and she does not need to earn money (which is a contradiction). Therefore, the only way for this to hold is if the premise is false, i.e., we must have `¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah`.

But we also have a derivation that she does need to earn money (from A1, A6, and the first part of A7). So we have:

  `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`  (from A1)
  and
  `¬ NeedEearnMoney Hannah` (from the second part of A7, because if we assume `NeedEarnMoney Hannah` we get a contradiction, but actually we have it so we get the contradiction)

So the axioms are inconsistent.

But wait, let me see if there's a way out. Maybe we can use the other axioms to avoid the derivation of `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`? However, A1 seems straightforward: if you are at Mary's school and work in student jobs, then you need to earn money. And we have both for Hannah.

Alternatively, maybe we can show that Hannah does not work in student jobs? But A7 says she does.

So we have an inconsistency.

But note: the second part of A7 is an implication. It does not say that `NeedEarnMoney Hannah` is false. It says that if it is true, then we get a contradiction. Therefore, we must conclude that `NeedEarnMoney Hannah` is false? But then we have a problem because A1 forces it to be true.

Therefore, the set of axioms is inconsistent.

However, let me try to derive a contradiction explicitly:

We have:
  h1: AtMarysSchool Hannah := A6
  h2: WorkInStudentJobs Hannah := A7.1
  h3: NeedEarnMoney Hannah := A1 Hannah h1 h2

Now, from A7.2: 
  h4: NeedEarnMoney Hannah → (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah)
  h5: h4 h3  -- this gives (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah)
  h6: h5.2   -- ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah

But h3 and h6 are contradictory.

Therefore, the axioms are inconsistent.

But the theorem is `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`. In an inconsistent system, we can prove anything. However, note that in Lean, if we have a contradiction we can use `False.elim` to prove anything. But we don't have an explicit `False` in our axioms.

We can derive `False` from `h3` and `h6`. Then we can prove `NeedEarnMoney Hannah` by `False.elim`? But wait, that would prove anything, including `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`. However, note that we are asked to prove `NeedEarnMoney Hannah` and we have a direct proof (h3) which is then contradicted. But the direct proof is valid until we get the contradiction.

Actually, we can prove `NeedEarnMoney Hannah` by `A1 Hannah A6 (A7.1)`. Then why do we have a contradiction? The contradiction doesn't negate the fact that we have a proof of `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`? It just means that we also have a proof of its negation.

So we can write the proof as simply: `A1 Hannah A6 (A7.1)`

But wait, what about the second part of A7? It doesn't prevent us from using `A1` to get `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`. It just says that if we have that, then we get a contradiction. However, in Lean, we can still form the term `A1 Hannah A6 (A7.1)` of type `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`. The fact that we can also derive a contradiction is a separate issue.

But note: the theorem is to prove `NeedEearnMoney Hannah`. We have a direct proof. So we can write:

  `theorem goal : NeedEarnMoney Hannah := A1 Hannah A6 A7.1`

However, this leads to an inconsistency in the system. But the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", meaning we are to work within the given axioms. And the axioms include A7 which, when combined with this proof, leads to a contradiction. But the proof term itself is valid.

But let me see: if we run this in Lean, will it accept it? Yes, because the proof is by `A1` applied to Hannah, A6, and the first part of A7.

The second part of A7 is not used in the proof of `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`. It is only an implication that we don't have to use. So we can ignore it for the purpose of proving `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`.

Therefore, the proof is simply:

  `A1 Hannah A6 A7.1`

But wait, what if the second part of A7 is intended to be used? Actually, we don't need it for this proof.

Alternatively, we might worry that the second part of A7 might be used to derive a contradiction and then prove anything, but we don't need that.

So the answer is: we can prove `NeedEarnMoney Hannah` by `A1 Hannah A6 A7.1`.

But let me check the other axioms to see if they affect this. They don't seem to. We don't use A2, A3, A4, A5 for this proof.

Therefore, the complete code is:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom AtMarysSchool : obj → Prop
axiom WorkInStudentJobs : obj → Prop
axiom NeedEarnMoney : obj → Prop
axiom OrderTakeoutFrequently : obj → Prop
axiom EnjoyDiningHall : obj → Prop
axiom PickyEater : obj → Prop
axiom SpendTimeEatingFriends : obj → Prop
axiom Hannah : obj

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, AtMarysSchool x → WorkInStudentJobs x → NeedEarnMoney x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, AtMarysSchool x → OrderTakeoutFrequently x → WorkInStudentJobs x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, AtMarysSchool x → OrderTakeoutFrequently x ∨ EnjoyDiningHall x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, AtMarysSchool x → EnjoyDiningHall x → ¬ PickyEater x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, AtMarysSchool x → EnjoyDiningHall x → SpendTimeEatingFriends x
axiom A6 : AtMarysSchool Hannah
axiom A7 : WorkInStudentJobs Hannah ∧ (NeedEarnMoney Hannah → (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah))

theorem goal : NeedEarnMoney Hannah := A1 Hannah A6 A7.1
</lean>

But note: after proving this, we can derive a contradiction by:

  have h : NeedEarnMoney Hannah := goal
  have h' : ¬ NeedEarnMoney Hannah := (A7.2 h).2

So the system becomes inconsistent. However, the problem only asks for the proof of `NeedEarnMoney Hannah`, and we have a direct proof from the axioms.

Therefore, we provide the above.

However, let me reconsider: maybe the second part of A7 is meant to be a biconditional or something else? But it is given as an implication. And we are not forced to use it. We only use the first part of A7 (the conjunction) to get `WorkInStudentJobs Hannah`.

So the proof is valid.

But wait, the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", meaning that the axioms are accepted. And we are to prove the theorem. We have a proof.

So we output the code.

But note: the user also asks for an answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain.

In this context, since we can prove the theorem, the answer is True? But wait, the theorem is `NeedEarnMoney Hannah` and we proved it. However, we also can prove its negation. So the system is inconsistent. But the question is about the provability of the theorem. Since we have a proof, we say True? Or do we say that the theorem is true in the system? Yes.

But note: the problem says "Provide the complete code with proof". We did.

Alternatively, if the problem expects the theorem to be actually true (without contradiction) then we might say Uncertain? But the task is to prove it from the axioms, and we did.

So I think we output the code and then ANSWER: True.

But let me see the example: in the example, we proved `Nice Cat` and then answered nothing? Actually, the example didn't have an answer. But the instruction says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

In this case, since we proved the theorem, we say True.

But note: the theorem is proven, so True.

However, we have an inconsistency. But that doesn't change the fact that we have a proof.

So I will output:

<lean>
... [the complete code with the proof] ...
</lean>
ANSWER: True

But wait, let me double-check: is there a way to avoid the contradiction? For example, by using the other axioms?

We have A3: Hannah either orders takeout frequently or enjoys dining hall.

Case 1: OrderTakeoutFrequently Hannah.
  Then by A2: AtMarysSchool Hannah → OrderTakeoutFrequently Hannah → WorkInStudentJobs Hannah.
  But we already know she works in student jobs (A7.1). So this doesn't add anything.

Case 2: EnjoyDiningHall Hannah.
  Then by A4: she is not a picky eater.
  And by A5: she spends time eating with friends.

But we don't have any connection to NeedEarnMoney.

So we still have the same issue.

Therefore, the proof by `A1` is the only direct way.

So we stick to it.
