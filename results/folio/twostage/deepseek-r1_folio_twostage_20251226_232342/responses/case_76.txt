STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion about Hannah and Mary's school.
 We need to define the types and predicates, then state the axioms (premises), and finally state the theorem (conclusion) as a goal.

 Steps:
 1. We'll have a type for the people (or entities) at the school. Let's call it `Person`.
 2. We have specific people: Mary (but note the premises talk about "people at Mary's school", and Hannah is introduced).
    However, note that Mary might not be directly referenced as an individual. We are told "Hannah is at Mary's school".
    So we'll have:
        axiom Person : Type
        axiom Hannah : Person

 3. Predicates:
    - `WorksInCampusJob : Person → Prop`   (for "work in student jobs on campus")
    - `NeedsMoney : Person → Prop`         (for "need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition")
    - `OrdersTakeoutFrequently : Person → Prop`
    - `EnjoysDiningHall : Person → Prop`   (for "enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes")
    - `IsPickyEater : Person → Prop`
    - `SpendsTimeEating : Person → Prop`   (for "spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls")

 4. We also note that the premises are about "people at Mary's school". However, the context is that all people we are talking about are at Mary's school.
    Since Hannah is introduced as being at Mary's school, and the premises are universally about people at Mary's school, we can model the premises as applying to all persons (since our type `Person` is for people at Mary's school).

    Alternatively, we could define:
        axiom AtMarysSchool : Person → Prop
    and then in the premises, we would universally quantify over `p` such that `AtMarysSchool p`. However, note the premises say "people at Mary's school", so we have two options:

    Option 1: Make the type `Person` represent exactly those at Mary's school. Then we don't need an extra predicate. This is simpler because we are told Hannah is at Mary's school, so we can have `Hannah : Person`.

    Option 2: Have a predicate `AtMarysSchool` and then state that Hannah satisfies it.

    Since the problem says "Hannah is at Mary's school", and the premises are about "people at Mary's school", we can choose Option 1: Let `Person` be the type of people at Mary's school. Then we don't need a separate predicate for being at the school because every `p : Person` is at the school.

 5. Now, the premises:

    P1: If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition.
        ∀ p : Person, WorksInCampusJob p → NeedsMoney p

    P2: If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus.
        ∀ p : Person, OrdersTakeoutFrequently p → WorksInCampusJob p

    P3: People at Mary's school order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes.
        ∀ p : Person, OrdersTakeoutFrequently p ∨ EnjoysDiningHall p

    P4: If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they are not picky eaters.
        ∀ p : Person, EnjoysDiningHall p → ¬ IsPickyEater p

    P5: If people at Mary's school enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, then they spend a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.
        ∀ p : Person, EnjoysDiningHall p → SpendsTimeEating p

    P6: Hannah is at Mary's school.
        Since we are using Option 1, we have `Hannah : Person` (so this is already captured by the type).

    P7: Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.
        This is a bit complex. Let's break it down:
        - First part: Hannah works in student jobs on campus: `WorksInCampusJob Hannah`
        - Second part: if she needs to earn money ... then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money.
          Formally: `NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)`

        Note: The second part is equivalent to: `NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah) ∧ (NeedsMoney Hannah → False)`
        But observe: the consequent says `¬ NeedsMoney Hannah` (i.e., she does not need the money) and also `¬ IsPickyEater Hannah`.
        However, the implication `NeedsMoney Hannah → ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah` is only possible if `NeedsMoney Hannah` is false.

        So we can split P7 into two axioms for Hannah:
          axiom A7a : WorksInCampusJob Hannah
          axiom A7b : NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)

        But note: the consequent of A7b has `¬ NeedsMoney Hannah`. Therefore, if `NeedsMoney Hannah` is true, then we get a contradiction (because we get both `NeedsMoney Hannah` and `¬ NeedsMoney Hannah`). Therefore, A7b implies that `NeedsMoney Hannah` must be false. Moreover, we also get that if `NeedsMoney Hannah` were true then we would have `¬ IsPickyEater Hannah` (but since `NeedsMoney Hannah` is false, we don't get that directly). However, we can deduce that `¬ NeedsMoney Hannah` holds.

        Alternatively, we can write A7b as:
          axiom A7b : NeedsMoney Hannah → False   (because the consequent includes `¬ NeedsMoney Hannah`)
          and also we get `NeedsMoney Hannah → ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah`? But note the consequent is a conjunction: so we have two parts.

        Actually, we can split A7b into two implications:
          axiom A7b1 : NeedsMoney Hannah → ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah
          axiom A7b2 : NeedsMoney Hannah → ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah

        But A7b2 is equivalent to `¬ NeedsMoney Hannah` (because if we assume `NeedsMoney Hannah` then we get a contradiction, so it must be false). Therefore, we can instead have:

          axiom A7a : WorksInCampusJob Hannah
          axiom A7b : ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah   [because from A7b2 we get that `NeedsMoney Hannah` is false]

        However, note that the premise says "if she needs ... then she is neither picky nor needs ...". We are not told that she needs the money. We are told she works on campus (A7a). And by P1, if she works then she needs money: `WorksInCampusJob Hannah → NeedsMoney Hannah`. So by P1 and A7a we get `NeedsMoney Hannah`. But then by A7b we get `¬ NeedsMoney Hannah` (from the second part of the consequent) and also `¬ IsPickyEater Hannah`. This leads to a contradiction: `NeedsMoney Hannah` and `¬ NeedsMoney Hannah`.

        This suggests that the premise P7 might be intended to be parsed differently? Let me read again:

          "Hannah works in student jobs on campus and if she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition."

        The "neither picky nor needs" is: (not picky) and (not needs money). So:

          A7: WorksInCampusJob Hannah ∧ (NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah))

        But note: the consequent of the implication includes `¬ NeedsMoney Hannah`, so if `NeedsMoney Hannah` is true, then we get a contradiction. Therefore, the only way for the implication to hold is if `NeedsMoney Hannah` is false. So we can deduce:

          ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah

        However, we also have from P1: WorksInCampusJob Hannah → NeedsMoney Hannah, and we have WorksInCampusJob Hannah (A7a). Therefore, we have:

          NeedsMoney Hannah   (by P1 and A7a)

        and

          ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah   (by the implication in A7b, because if NeedsMoney Hannah were true, then we would get ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah, which is a contradiction; so by the implication we must avoid the premise being true, hence ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)

        This is a contradiction. Therefore, the set of premises is inconsistent? But note: the problem asks to formalize, not to prove. We are only formalizing.

        We must represent the premise exactly as stated. Therefore, we will keep:

          axiom A7a : WorksInCampusJob Hannah
          axiom A7b : NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)

        Even though it leads to a contradiction when combined with P1, that is the problem's premise.

 6. Conclusion: 
        Hannah is at Mary's school (which we have by `Hannah : Person`) and she is not a picky eater and spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.

        So: 
          AtMarysSchool Hannah ∧ ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ SpendsTimeEating Hannah

        But note: we don't have an explicit `AtMarysSchool` predicate because we are using Option 1. So we only need:

          ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ SpendsTimeEating Hannah

        However, the conclusion says "Hannah is at Mary's school" as well. Since we are using `Person` to represent people at Mary's school, having `Hannah` of type `Person` already captures that. But the conclusion explicitly states it. We have two choices:

          Option A: Since we are in the context of `Person` being at Mary's school, we don't need to state it again. The theorem can be just about the other two.

          Option B: The conclusion includes "Hannah is at Mary's school", so we should include it. But we don't have a predicate for it. Therefore, we might need to change our approach to Option 2.

        Let's reconsider: maybe we should use Option 2? We can define:

          axiom Person : Type
          axiom AtMarysSchool : Person → Prop
          axiom Hannah : Person
          axiom A6 : AtMarysSchool Hannah   (for premise 6)

        Then the premises P1-P5 would be universally quantified over `p` with `AtMarysSchool p`? But note the premises say "people at Mary's school", so:

          P1: ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (WorksInCampusJob p → NeedsMoney p)
          ... and similarly for others.

        However, note that the premises are conditional on being at Mary's school. But we are told that Hannah is at Mary's school (A6). 

        Alternatively, we can avoid introducing `AtMarysSchool` by noting that the entire discussion is about people at Mary's school. So we can let `Person` be the type of all people (not necessarily only at Mary's school) and then use `AtMarysSchool` to restrict. But then the premises would be:

          P1: ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (WorksInCampusJob p → NeedsMoney p)

        This is more general but also more verbose.

        Given the problem, I think it's simpler to let `Person` be the type of people at Mary's school. Then we don't need the predicate `AtMarysSchool` because every `p : Person` is at the school. Then:

          - Premise 6 is automatically satisfied because `Hannah : Person`.
          - The conclusion's first part "Hannah is at Mary's school" is also automatically satisfied.

        Therefore, the theorem we need to state is:

          ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ SpendsTimeEating Hannah

        However, the conclusion explicitly says "Hannah is at Mary's school", but in our type system, we cannot state that as a proposition because we don't have a predicate. So we have two options:

          Option 1: Change to having a predicate `AtMarysSchool` and then include `AtMarysSchool Hannah` in the conclusion.

          Option 2: Since the problem says "Hannah is at Mary's school" is part of the conclusion, and we have already introduced Hannah as a `Person` (which by our type is at Mary's school), we can omit it in the theorem? But the problem says to formalize the conclusion exactly.

        After reevaluating, I think the intended meaning of the conclusion is that Hannah (who we know is at Mary's school) is not picky and spends time eating. The first part "Hannah is at Mary's school" is already established by premise 6 and the context. However, to be safe, we can use Option 2.

        Let me go with Option 2: introduce `AtMarysSchool` predicate.

        Why? Because the premises are about "people at Mary's school", meaning that they are conditional. And Hannah is one of them. Also, the conclusion explicitly says "Hannah is at Mary's school".

        We'll do:

          axiom Person : Type
          axiom AtMarysSchool : Person → Prop
          axiom Hannah : Person
          axiom A6 : AtMarysSchool Hannah   (premise 6)

        Then the premises:

          P1: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (WorksInCampusJob p → NeedsMoney p)
          P2: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently p → WorksInCampusJob p)
          P3: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently p ∨ EnjoysDiningHall p)
          P4: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (EnjoysDiningHall p → ¬ IsPickyEater p)
          P5: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (EnjoysDiningHall p → SpendsTimeEating p)

        P7: 
          axiom A7a : WorksInCampusJob Hannah
          axiom A7b : NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)

        But note: in P7, we are told that Hannah works and the implication. However, we don't have an explicit `AtMarysSchool` condition in A7a and A7b? But the premise is about Hannah who is at Mary's school (by A6). So we don't need to wrap A7a and A7b in `AtMarysSchool` because they are specific to Hannah.

        Conclusion: 
          AtMarysSchool Hannah ∧ ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ SpendsTimeEating Hannah

        However, note that we have A6 for the first part.

 7. Let's write the code accordingly.

    We'll define:
      - `Person` as a type
      - Predicates: `AtMarysSchool`, `WorksInCampusJob`, `NeedsMoney`, `OrdersTakeoutFrequently`, `EnjoysDiningHall`, `IsPickyEater`, `SpendsTimeEating`
      - Constant `Hannah : Person`
      - Axioms for the premises.

    Premise 1: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (WorksInCampusJob p → NeedsMoney p)
    Premise 2: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently p → WorksInCampusJob p)
    Premise 3: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently p ∨ EnjoysDiningHall p)
    Premise 4: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (EnjoysDiningHall p → ¬ IsPickyEater p)
    Premise 5: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (EnjoysDiningHall p → SpendsTimeEating p)
    Premise 6: AtMarysSchool Hannah
    Premise 7: 
        WorksInCampusJob Hannah ∧ (NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah))

    Conclusion: AtMarysSchool Hannah ∧ ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ SpendsTimeEating Hannah

    However, note that the conclusion includes "Hannah is at Mary's school", which we have as A6, and then the other two.

    We'll break premise 7 into two axioms for clarity.

    Let's code accordingly.

 8. Code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type

axiom AtMarysSchool : Person → Prop
axiom WorksInCampusJob : Person → Prop
axiom NeedsMoney : Person → Prop
axiom OrdersTakeoutFrequently : Person → Prop
axiom EnjoysDiningHall : Person → Prop
axiom IsPickyEater : Person → Prop
axiom SpendsTimeEating : Person → Prop

axiom Hannah : Person

-- Premise 1: If people at Mary's school work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money...
axiom P1 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (WorksInCampusJob p → NeedsMoney p)

-- Premise 2: If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently, then they work in student jobs...
axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently p → WorksInCampusJob p)

-- Premise 3: People at Mary's school order takeout frequently or enjoy the dining hall.
axiom P3 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently p ∨ EnjoysDiningHall p)

-- Premise 4: If they enjoy dining hall, then they are not picky eaters.
axiom P4 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (EnjoysDiningHall p → ¬ IsPickyEater p)

-- Premise 5: If they enjoy dining hall, then they spend time eating and catching up.
axiom P5 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (EnjoysDiningHall p → SpendsTimeEating p)

-- Premise 6: Hannah is at Mary's school.
axiom P6 : AtMarysSchool Hannah

-- Premise 7: Hannah works in student jobs and if she needs to earn money then she is neither picky nor needs money.
axiom P7a : WorksInCampusJob Hannah
axiom P7b : NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)

-- Conclusion: Hannah is at Mary's school and she is not a picky eater and spends a lot of her time eating...
theorem goal : AtMarysSchool Hannah ∧ ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ SpendsTimeEating Hannah := sorry
</lean>

Note: We used `P7a` and `P7b` for premise 7.

However, note that the conclusion includes `AtMarysSchool Hannah` which we have as `P6`, and then the other two parts. So the theorem is stated accordingly.

But wait: the conclusion does not require `WorksInCampusJob` or `NeedsMoney`? We are only to formalize the conclusion as stated.

This should be complete.


=== RESPONSE ===
Here's the Lean 4 formalization of the logical structure:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type

axiom AtMarysSchool : Person → Prop
axiom WorksInCampusJob : Person → Prop
axiom NeedsMoney : Person → Prop
axiom OrdersTakeoutFrequently : Person → Prop
axiom EnjoysDiningHall : Person → Prop
axiom IsPickyEater : Person → Prop
axiom SpendsTimeEating : Person → Prop

axiom Hannah : Person

-- If people at Mary's school work campus jobs, they need money for tuition
axiom P1 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (WorksInCampusJob p → NeedsMoney p)

-- If people at Mary's school order takeout frequently, they work campus jobs
axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently p → WorksInCampusJob p)

-- People at Mary's school either order takeout frequently or enjoy dining hall meals
axiom P3 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently p ∨ EnjoysDiningHall p)

-- Enjoying dining hall meals implies not being a picky eater
axiom P4 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (EnjoysDiningHall p → ¬ IsPickyEater p)

-- Conclusion: Hannah is at Mary's school, not picky, and spends time eating/socializing

Key points:
1. Created a `Person` type for individuals
2. Defined predicates for all properties mentioned in premises
3. Added Hannah as a specific person
4. Formalized each premise as an axiom with proper quantifiers and implications
5. Split premise 7 into two parts for clarity
6. Theorem statement exactly matches the conclusion structure using `sorry` as placeholder


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and need to prove the theorem about Hannah.
 The theorem states: AtMarysSchool Hannah ∧ ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ SpendsTimeEating Hannah

 We know:
   P6: AtMarysSchool Hannah

 So we need to prove ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah and SpendsTimeEating Hannah.

 Let's break down the axioms:

 P1: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (WorksInCampusJob p → NeedsMoney p)
 P2: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently p → WorksInCampusJob p)
 P3: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently p ∨ EnjoysDiningHall p)
 P4: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (EnjoysDiningHall p → ¬ IsPickyEater p)
 P5: ∀ p, AtMarysSchool p → (EnjoysDiningHall p → SpendsTimeEating p)

 P7a: WorksInCampusJob Hannah
 P7b: NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)

 Note: P7b is a bit tricky. It says that if Hannah needs money, then she is not a picky eater and she does not need money.
 This implies that if Hannah needs money, we get a contradiction because we have both NeedsMoney Hannah and ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah.
 Therefore, Hannah cannot need money. But let's see if we can derive that she does need money.

 Steps:

 1. We know Hannah is at Mary's school (P6).
 2. We know she works a campus job (P7a).

 From P1 and P6 and P7a:
   P1 Hannah P6: WorksInCampusJob Hannah → NeedsMoney Hannah
   Since WorksInCampusJob Hannah (P7a), we get NeedsMoney Hannah.

 But then by P7b: NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)
 So we get ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah and also ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah.

 But now we have NeedsMoney Hannah and ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah -> contradiction.

 This suggests that our assumption that NeedsMoney Hannah leads to a contradiction? 
 However, note that P7b says: if NeedsMoney Hannah then we have both ¬ IsPickyEater and ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah. 
 So if we have NeedsMoney Hannah, we get ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah -> which is a contradiction.

 Therefore, we must not have NeedsMoney Hannah? But from P1 and P6 and P7a we have NeedsMoney Hannah.

 This leads to a contradiction. 

 Let me reexamine:

 We have:
   NeedsMoney Hannah   [from P1 applied to Hannah, using P6 and P7a]
   Then by P7b: NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)
   So we can apply P7b to NeedsMoney Hannah to get:
        ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah
   Therefore, we have ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah.

 But we also have NeedsMoney Hannah. So we have a contradiction.

 This means that the set of axioms is inconsistent? 

 However, the theorem is supposed to be proved. Let me check the axioms again.

 Alternatively, perhaps P7b is meant to be an axiom that is only about Hannah and it might be that we are to use it to derive ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah? 

 But note: if we have NeedsMoney Hannah, then P7b gives ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah -> contradiction. Therefore, we must avoid having NeedsMoney Hannah? 
 But we have no choice: from P1, P6, and P7a we get NeedsMoney Hannah.

 Therefore, the axioms are inconsistent.

 But wait, maybe I misinterpreted P7b? It says:
   NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)

 This is equivalent to:
   NeedsMoney Hannah → ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah
   and
   NeedsMoney Hannah → ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah

 The second part is: NeedsMoney Hannah implies its negation. Therefore, the only way for this to be true is if NeedsMoney Hannah is false.

 So we can conclude ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah? 

 However, from P1, P6, P7a we have:
   AtMarysSchool Hannah → (WorksInCampusJob Hannah → NeedsMoney Hannah)
   So with P6 and P7a we get NeedsMoney Hannah.

 Therefore, we have both NeedsMoney Hannah and ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah -> contradiction.

 This means the axioms are inconsistent. Therefore, the theorem cannot be proven without contradiction? 

 But note: the theorem is part of the same context. Since we have a contradiction, we can prove anything.

 However, the problem asks for a proof of the theorem. In an inconsistent system, we can prove any statement.

 But let's see if we can prove the theorem without running into the contradiction? 

 Alternatively, maybe we are supposed to use the contradiction to prove the theorem? 

 Actually, in Lean, if we have a contradiction we can use `False.elim` or something. But let's see:

 We have:
   H1: NeedsMoney Hannah   (from P1, P6, P7a)
   H2: NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)   (P7b)
   Applying H2 to H1, we get:
        ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah
   So we have ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah and NeedsMoney Hannah -> contradiction.

 Therefore, we can prove False. Then by `False.elim` we can prove anything, including the goal.

 However, the goal is: 
   AtMarysSchool Hannah ∧ ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ SpendsTimeEating Hannah

 We already have AtMarysSchool Hannah (P6). So we need ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah and SpendsTimeEating Hannah.

 From the contradiction we can get anything, so we can get these two.

 But note: we can also derive ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah from the application of P7b? 

 Actually, from H1 and H2 we get a pair: (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah, ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah). So we have ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah.

 Now, how to get SpendsTimeEating Hannah?

 We have P3: AtMarysSchool Hannah → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently Hannah ∨ EnjoysDiningHall Hannah)

 Since we have P6, we have OrdersTakeoutFrequently Hannah ∨ EnjoysDiningHall Hannah.

 Now, we can break into cases:

 Case 1: OrdersTakeoutFrequently Hannah.
   Then by P2: AtMarysSchool Hannah → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently Hannah → WorksInCampusJob Hannah)
   We know she already works a campus job (P7a), so this doesn't give new info.

 Case 2: EnjoysDiningHall Hannah.
   Then by P5: AtMarysSchool Hannah → (EnjoysDiningHall Hannah → SpendsTimeEating Hannah)
   So we get SpendsTimeEating Hannah.

 But what if she doesn't enjoy dining hall? Then she orders takeout frequently. Can we derive SpendsTimeEating Hannah from ordering takeout? 
 The axioms don't say anything about ordering takeout implying spending time eating.

 So without the contradiction, we might not get SpendsTimeEating Hannah in the case of ordering takeout.

 However, we have a contradiction! So we can use the contradiction to prove SpendsTimeEating Hannah.

 But note: we have already derived ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah (from the pair from H2). And we have a contradiction (NeedsMoney Hannah and ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah). 
 So we can use `False.elim` to prove SpendsTimeEating Hannah.

 However, let me see if we can avoid the contradiction and still prove the theorem.

 Alternatively, we might try to show that Hannah enjoys dining hall.

 We have:
   P3: OrdersTakeoutFrequently Hannah ∨ EnjoysDiningHall Hannah.

 Suppose she orders takeout frequently. Then by P2: 
   P2 Hannah P6: OrdersTakeoutFrequently Hannah → WorksInCampusJob Hannah
   But we already know she works a campus job, so that doesn't help.

 But note: we have P1: if she works a campus job, then she needs money (given she is at Mary's school). So we get NeedsMoney Hannah.

 Then by P7b: we get ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah and ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah -> contradiction.

 Therefore, in the case that she orders takeout frequently, we get a contradiction.

 Therefore, she must enjoy dining hall? 

 So by contradiction in the ordering takeout branch, we can show that she must enjoy dining hall.

 Then we can use P5 to get SpendsTimeEating Hannah.

 And we already have ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah from the application of P7b? But wait, we only get ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah if we have NeedsMoney Hannah? 
 And we do have NeedsMoney Hannah (from P1, P6, P7a) regardless of the case.

 Therefore, we can do:

   have money : NeedsMoney Hannah := P1 Hannah P6 P7a
   have not_money_and_not_picky : ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah := P7b money
   let not_picky := not_money_and_not_picky.left
   let not_money := not_money_and_not_picky.right
   have contra : False := not_money money   -- because we have NeedsMoney Hannah and ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah

 Now, we can use `False.elim` to prove anything. But we want to prove the goal.

 Alternatively, we can avoid the contradiction by using the case analysis on P3 and showing that in the takeout case we get contradiction, so we must have EnjoysDiningHall.

 Then we can use P5 to get SpendsTimeEating Hannah.

 Steps:

   We have P3: OrdersTakeoutFrequently Hannah ∨ EnjoysDiningHall Hannah

   Case 1: OrdersTakeoutFrequently Hannah.
        Then we have WorksInCampusJob Hannah (by P2 Hannah P6 and the case) -> but we already have it.
        Then we have NeedsMoney Hannah (by P1) -> then by P7b we get ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah -> contradiction.

   Case 2: EnjoysDiningHall Hannah.
        Then by P4: EnjoysDiningHall Hannah → ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah -> so we get ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah.
        And by P5: EnjoysDiningHall Hannah → SpendsTimeEating Hannah -> so we get SpendsTimeEating Hannah.

   Therefore, in Case 2 we have the two parts we need.

   But note: we already have ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah from the contradiction? Actually, we can also get it from P4 in this case.

   However, we also have the contradiction from the money part? Because we still have NeedsMoney Hannah and ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah.

   So even in Case 2 we have the contradiction.

   Therefore, the entire system is inconsistent.

   But note: in Case 2 we don't need the money contradiction to get ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah? Because P4 gives it to us? 
   And we get SpendsTimeEating Hannah from P5.

   However, we still have the money contradiction: we have NeedsMoney Hannah (from P1, P6, P7a) and ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah (from P7b).

   So regardless of the case, we have a contradiction.

   Therefore, we can prove the goal by:

        have money : NeedsMoney Hannah := P1 Hannah P6 P7a
        have not_money_and_not_picky := P7b money
        have not_money := not_money_and_not_picky.right
        have contra : False := not_money money

        exact False.elim contra   -- but then we wouldn't have the goal?

   Actually, we can prove anything, including the goal.

   However, the goal is specific: we need AtMarysSchool Hannah (which we have) and ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah and SpendsTimeEating Hannah.

   We can try to prove the goal without using the contradiction? But we have a contradiction so we can.

   Alternatively, we can use the case analysis and in each case we get the goal? 

   In Case 1: we get contradiction -> then we can prove the goal by contradiction.
   In Case 2: we get ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah and SpendsTimeEating Hannah -> then we can build the goal.

   But in Case 2, we also have the money contradiction? So Case 2 also leads to contradiction? 

   Therefore, the only consistent way is to avoid having NeedsMoney Hannah? But we cannot avoid it.

   This suggests that the axioms are inconsistent.

   However, let me read P7b again: 
        NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)

   This is equivalent to: 
        ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah ∨ (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)

   which is equivalent to: 
        ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah

   because if NeedsMoney Hannah is true, then we get ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah, so it must be false.

   Therefore, we can prove ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah.

   How? 
        We have P7b: if we assume NeedsMoney Hannah, then we get ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah -> so by implication we have ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah.

   So we can do:

        have not_money : ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah := 
            fun h : NeedsMoney Hannah => (P7b h).right h   -- this is a proof of ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah: assume h, then (P7b h).right is ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah, applied to h gives False -> so we have proven False from h, hence ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah.

   But then we have:

        have money : NeedsMoney Hannah := P1 Hannah P6 P7a

        contradiction.

   So we still get contradiction.

   Therefore, the axioms are inconsistent.

   Since the axioms are inconsistent, we can prove the goal by deriving a contradiction and then using `False.elim`.

   However, the theorem is a conjunction. We can build it as:

        ⟨P6, ? , ?⟩

   We need ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah and SpendsTimeEating Hannah.

   We can use the contradiction to prove each of them.

   Alternatively, we can use the case analysis on P3 and in each case we get either a contradiction or the desired properties? But both cases lead to contradiction? 

   Actually, in Case 2 we get EnjoysDiningHall Hannah, then by P4 we get ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah and by P5 we get SpendsTimeEating Hannah. 
   So if we can avoid the money contradiction, we would have the goal. But we cannot avoid the money contradiction.

   Therefore, we must use the fact that we have a contradiction to prove the goal.

   We can do:

        theorem goal : AtMarysSchool Hannah ∧ ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ SpendsTimeEating Hannah := by
          have money : NeedsMoney Hannah := P1 Hannah P6 P7a
          have not_money : ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah := fun h => (P7b h).right h
          contradiction

   But `contradiction` only closes the goal if it is False? Actually, the goal is not False. We have a contradiction in our context, so we can use `exfalso` to reduce the goal to False.

        apply And.intro P6
        apply And.intro ?_ ?_
        · have h : False := not_money money
          exact False.elim h   -- but this would prove anything, so we can put ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah here
        · have h : False := not_money money
          exact False.elim h

   But this proves the goal by proving both parts by contradiction.

   However, we can also use the case analysis and then in each case we get a contradiction? Then we can do:

        cases P3 Hannah P6 with
        | inl takeout =>
            -- we have OrdersTakeoutFrequently Hannah
            -- we already know WorksInCampusJob Hannah (P7a) but we don't need that again
            -- but we have money: NeedsMoney Hannah, and not_money: ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah -> contradiction
            contradiction
        | inr enjoys =>
            -- we have EnjoysDiningHall Hannah
            -- then ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah from P4 Hannah P6 enjoys
            -- and SpendsTimeEating Hannah from P5 Hannah P6 enjoys
            -- BUT we also have money and not_money -> contradiction
            contradiction

   So again, both branches lead to contradiction.

   Therefore, we must use the contradiction to prove the entire goal.

   We can write:

        have false : False := by
          apply not_money money
        exact false.elim (goal)   -- but wait, goal is the theorem we are proving? 

   Actually, we can do:

        have false : False := not_money money
        exact False.elim false   -- and then the goal is proven because anything follows from false.

   But note: the entire theorem is proven by `False.elim false`.

   So:

        theorem goal : ... := by
          have money : NeedsMoney Hannah := P1 Hannah P6 P7a
          have not_money : ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah := fun h => (P7b h).right h
          exact False.elim (not_money money)

   This will work.

   However, let me check: we are proving the goal by deriving False and then eliminating it.

   But note: we don't need to break the goal into parts.

   Therefore, the complete code is:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type

axiom AtMarysSchool : Person → Prop
axiom WorksInCampusJob : Person → Prop
axiom NeedsMoney : Person → Prop
axiom OrdersTakeoutFrequently : Person → Prop
axiom EnjoysDiningHall : Person → Prop
axiom IsPickyEater : Person → Prop
axiom SpendsTimeEating : Person → Prop

axiom Hannah : Person

axiom P1 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (WorksInCampusJob p → NeedsMoney p)
axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently p → WorksInCampusJob p)
axiom P3 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (OrdersTakeoutFrequently p ∨ EnjoysDiningHall p)
axiom P4 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (EnjoysDiningHall p → ¬ IsPickyEater p)
axiom P5 : ∀ p : Person, AtMarysSchool p → (EnjoysDiningHall p → SpendsTimeEating p)

axiom P6 : AtMarysSchool Hannah

axiom P7a : WorksInCampusJob Hannah
axiom P7b : NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah)

theorem goal : AtMarysSchool Hannah ∧ ¬ IsPickyEater Hannah ∧ SpendsTimeEating Hannah := by
  have money : NeedsMoney Hannah := P1 Hannah P6 P7a
  have not_money : ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah := fun h => (P7b h).right h
  exact False.elim (not_money money)
</lean>

 However, note: the theorem is proven by contradiction. But the axioms are inconsistent.

 But the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions" meaning that the axioms are validated? But they lead to contradiction.

 Therefore, we have proven the theorem, but in an inconsistent context.

 Since the theorem is proven, we output the code.

 After the code, we are to provide: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain

 But note: the theorem is proven, so we say True? However, the axioms are inconsistent. In an inconsistent system, every statement is true.

 So the theorem is true (in this inconsistent system).

 Therefore, we answer True.

 However, let me see if there is a way without contradiction? 

 We might try to use the case analysis and then in the enjoys case we get the two properties without using the money part? But we still have the money part leading to contradiction.

 Alternatively, we can try to prove ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah independently? But we have shown that we have NeedsMoney Hannah and ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah.

 Therefore, we stick with the proof by contradiction.

 Let me write the proof in term mode:

        theorem goal : ... := 
          let money := P1 Hannah P6 P7a;
          let not_money := fun h => (P7b h).right h;
          False.elim (not_money money)

 But note: the theorem is a conjunction. The proof above is a proof of the entire conjunction because False.elim can produce any type.

 So we can do that.

 However, the problem says: use 'by' followed by tactics? 

 We did:

        by
          have money : NeedsMoney Hannah := P1 Hannah P6 P7a
          have not_money : ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah := fun h => (P7b h).right h
          exact False.elim (not_money money)

 This is acceptable.

 Therefore, the complete code is as above.

 But note: we are not modifying the axioms or theorem statement.

 We are replacing the sorry with a proof.

 ANSWER: True   (because we have proven the theorem, even though the axioms are inconsistent)

 However, the problem says "validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", so we assume the user has validated them and we just prove the theorem.

 Let me run through the steps:

   money: NeedsMoney Hannah
        P1 Hannah: AtMarysSchool Hannah → (WorksInCampusJob Hannah → NeedsMoney Hannah)
        We have P6: AtMarysSchool Hannah, and P7a: WorksInCampusJob Hannah, so this is valid.

   not_money: ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah
        We define: assume h: NeedsMoney Hannah, then (P7b h) gives a pair, and the right part is ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah. So we apply that to h to get False. Therefore, this is a proof of ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah.

   Then not_money money: is a proof of False.

   Then False.elim (not_money money) is a proof of the goal (any goal).

 Therefore, the proof is valid.

 We output the code and answer True.


=== RESPONSE ===
The axioms provided lead to a contradiction, which allows proving the theorem via explosion (ex falso quodlibet). Specifically:
1. From `P1`, `P6`, and `P7a`, we derive `NeedsMoney Hannah`.
2. From `P7b`, assuming `NeedsMoney Hannah` implies `¬ NeedsMoney Hannah`, creating a contradiction.
3. This contradiction proves any proposition, including the theorem.

Here is the complete Lean code with the proof:

axiom WorksInCampusJob : Person → Prop
axiom NeedsMoney : Person → Prop
axiom OrdersTakeoutFrequently : Person → Prop
