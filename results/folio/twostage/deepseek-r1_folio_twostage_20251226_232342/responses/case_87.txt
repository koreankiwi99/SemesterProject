STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion. We need to formalize the logical structure in Lean 4.

 Premises:
 1. Books contain tons of knowledge.
    Interpretation: All books contain knowledge. We can interpret "contain tons of knowledge" as containing knowledge.
    We might have: ∀ (book : Book), ContainsKnowledge book

 2. When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.
    Interpretation: If a person reads a book, then that person gains knowledge.
    ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p

 3. If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.
    Interpretation: GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p

 4. Harry read the book “Walden” by Henry Thoreau.
    Interpretation: We have a specific person Harry and a specific book Walden. And we have: Reads Harry Walden.

 Conclusion:
   Walden contains knowledge.

 However, note that the first premise says that books contain tons of knowledge. So we can directly conclude that Walden (being a book) contains knowledge.

 But let's break down the entities:

 We have:
   - Books: we can introduce a type `Book`
   - Persons: we can introduce a type `Person`
   - Knowledge: we are not going to model "knowledge" as an object but as a property (a predicate). Alternatively, we might model "containing knowledge" as a property of books.

 We need:
   - A constant for Harry: `Harry : Person`
   - A constant for Walden: `Walden : Book`

 Predicates:
   - `ContainsKnowledge : Book → Prop`   (meaning the book contains knowledge)
   - `Reads : Person → Book → Prop`       (a person reads a book)
   - `GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop`     (a person gains knowledge)
   - `Smarter : Person → Prop`            (a person becomes smarter)

 Alternatively, the first premise says "Books contain tons of knowledge". We can interpret this as: every book contains knowledge. So:
   `axiom A1 : ∀ (b : Book), ContainsKnowledge b`

 Then the conclusion about Walden would be immediate: `ContainsKnowledge Walden`.

 However, note that the other premises talk about a person reading a book and then gaining knowledge. But they don't directly say that the book must contain knowledge for the person to gain knowledge? Actually, the premise says "when a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge". This might imply that the book contains knowledge, but we are also given the first premise independently.

 Since we are only formalizing, we'll represent the premises as given.

 Steps:

  1. We'll declare types for the objects we need: `Person`, `Book`.
  2. We'll declare constants: Harry (as a Person) and Walden (as a Book).
  3. We'll declare predicates:
        ContainsKnowledge : Book → Prop
        Reads : Person → Book → Prop
        GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop
        Smarter : Person → Prop

  4. We'll state the axioms:

        A1: ∀ (b : Book), ContainsKnowledge b   -- Every book contains knowledge.

        A2: ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p   -- If a person reads a book, they gain knowledge.

        A3: ∀ (p : Person), GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p   -- If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.

        A4: Reads Harry Walden   -- Harry read Walden.

  5. The conclusion we want to formalize is: `ContainsKnowledge Walden`

  But note: we have A1 which already says that every book contains knowledge. So we can derive `ContainsKnowledge Walden` by applying A1 to Walden.

  However, the problem says to formalize the premises and the conclusion without proving. So we just write:

        theorem goal : ContainsKnowledge Walden := sorry

  But wait: is there an alternative interpretation? The problem says "Books contain tons of knowledge". We interpreted as every book contains knowledge. But what if it only says that books in general contain knowledge (without specifying every book)? However, in logical terms, we usually take such a statement as universally quantified.

  Alternatively, if we interpret "Books contain tons of knowledge" as "there exists knowledge in books", that would be weaker. But the conclusion is about a specific book. So we need the universal form.

  Therefore, we stick to the universal interpretation.

  However, note that the problem says "Books contain tons of knowledge". The word "tons" might be intended to be ignored? Or it might be an emphasis that they do contain knowledge. So we take it as every book contains knowledge.

  But also note: the second premise says that reading a book causes the person to gain knowledge. This might imply that the book must contain knowledge? However, we are given the first premise independently, so we have two ways to get that Walden contains knowledge.

  Since the conclusion is directly stated and we have the first premise, we formalize accordingly.

  Important: We are not proving, so we just write the theorem statement.

  Let's write the Lean code accordingly.

  We'll define:

      axiom Person : Type
      axiom Book : Type
      axiom Harry : Person
      axiom Walden : Book
      axiom ContainsKnowledge : Book → Prop
      axiom Reads : Person → Book → Prop
      axiom GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop
      axiom Smarter : Person → Prop

  Then the axioms:

      axiom A1 : ∀ (b : Book), ContainsKnowledge b
      axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p
      axiom A3 : ∀ (p : Person), GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p
      axiom A4 : Reads Harry Walden

  And the theorem:

      theorem goal : ContainsKnowledge Walden := sorry

  However, note that we don't actually need the other axioms (A2, A3, A4) to state the conclusion. But the problem says to formalize all premises. So we include them.

  Alternatively, we might notice that the conclusion does not depend on Harry's reading or gaining knowledge. It is directly from the first premise.

  So we proceed.

  But wait: what if the problem intended that the book containing knowledge is derived from the fact that Harry read it and gained knowledge? However, the first premise already states that books contain knowledge. So we have two independent ways? But the conclusion is about Walden containing knowledge, which we get from A1.

  We'll formalize as above.

  However, note: the first premise says "Books contain tons of knowledge". We have taken it as every book. But what if it is meant that books as a whole contain knowledge? Then we might need to interpret it as: there exists a book that contains knowledge? But that would not let us conclude about Walden. Therefore, we stick to the universal.

  Let me re-read: "Books contain tons of knowledge." -> This is a general statement about books, so we take it as universally quantified.

  Therefore, the Lean code is as below.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the premises and conclusion provided, here's the Lean 4 formalization:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Book : Type
axiom Harry : Person
axiom Walden : Book
axiom ContainsKnowledge : Book → Prop
axiom Reads : Person → Book → Prop
axiom GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop
axiom Smarter : Person → Prop

-- Books contain tons of knowledge
axiom A1 : ∀ (b : Book), ContainsKnowledge b

-- When a person reads a book, they gain knowledge
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p

-- Gaining knowledge makes a person smarter
axiom A3 : ∀ (p : Person), GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p

-- Harry read Walden
axiom A4 : Reads Harry Walden

-- Conclusion: Walden contains knowledge
theorem goal : ContainsKnowledge Walden := sorry
</lean>

Explanation:
1. Introduced types `Person` and `Book` for entities
2. Declared constants:
   - `Harry` as a specific person
   - `Walden` as a specific book
3. Defined predicates:
   - `ContainsKnowledge` for books
   - `Reads` for person-book relationships
   - `GainsKnowledge` and `Smarter` for persons
4. Formalized premises as axioms:
   - `A1`: All books contain knowledge (universal quantification)
   - `A2`: Reading implies gaining knowledge
   - `A3`: Knowledge gain implies becoming smarter
   - `A4`: Harry read Walden
5. Declared the conclusion as `theorem goal` using `sorry` as placeholder

Note: The conclusion follows directly from axiom `A1` since Walden is a book, but all premises are included for completeness as per the problem statement.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given:
  Axiom A1: ∀ (b : Book), ContainsKnowledge b
  Theorem goal: ContainsKnowledge Walden

Since A1 says that every book contains knowledge, and Walden is a book, we can directly apply A1 to Walden.

Therefore, the proof is: A1 Walden

But note: the theorem is concluding that Walden contains knowledge, which is exactly what (A1 Walden) proves.

However, let me check the other axioms. We have:
  A2: If a person reads a book, they gain knowledge.
  A3: If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.
  A4: Harry read Walden.

But note that the theorem goal is only about Walden containing knowledge, which does not depend on Harry or reading. It is a direct consequence of A1.

Therefore, we don't need to use A2, A3, or A4.

So, the complete code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Book : Type
axiom Harry : Person
axiom Walden : Book
axiom ContainsKnowledge : Book → Prop
axiom Reads : Person → Book → Prop
axiom GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop
axiom Smarter : Person → Prop

-- Books contain tons of knowledge
axiom A1 : ∀ (b : Book), ContainsKnowledge b

-- When a person reads a book, they gain knowledge
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p

-- Gaining knowledge makes a person smarter
axiom A3 : ∀ (p : Person), GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p

-- Harry read Walden
axiom A4 : Reads Harry Walden

-- Conclusion: Walden contains knowledge
theorem goal : ContainsKnowledge Walden := A1 Walden
</lean>

ANSWER: True

But note: the problem asks to provide the answer as: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain
Here, the theorem is proven, so it is True.

However, let me double-check: the user might be confused because the axioms also talk about Harry reading Walden and gaining knowledge, but the theorem is only about the book containing knowledge. Since A1 states that every book contains knowledge, this is independent of reading.

Therefore, the proof is straightforward.


=== RESPONSE ===
The theorem `goal` states that Walden contains knowledge, which directly follows from axiom `A1` asserting that every book contains knowledge. Since `Walden` is a book, applying `A1` to `Walden` completes the proof.

**Complete Code:**
<lean>

axiom Book : Type
axiom Harry : Person
axiom Walden : Book
axiom ContainsKnowledge : Book → Prop
axiom Reads : Person → Book → Prop

-- Books contain tons of knowledge
axiom A1 : ∀ (b : Book), ContainsKnowledge b

-- When a person reads a book, they gain knowledge
