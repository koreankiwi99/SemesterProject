STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are introducing several types and predicates.
 First, we need types for objects: people and books.
 Since the conclusion is about "Harry" and a book "Walden", we can have:
   - `obj` for general objects? But note: we have books and persons. Alternatively, we can have separate types for person and book.
 However, note that the premise says "a person reads a book", so we have two distinct kinds.

 Approach 1: Use types `Person` and `Book`.
   - We can then have Harry as a constant of type `Person`
   - We can have "Walden" as a constant of type `Book`

 Alternatively, Approach 2: Use one type `obj` and have predicates to distinguish: `is_person : obj -> Prop` and `is_book : obj -> Prop`.
 However, the relations are between persons and books, so it might be cleaner to use two types.

 But note: the premise says "books contain tons of knowledge". We might also have a concept of knowledge.

 However, the problem doesn't require us to formalize knowledge as an object. Instead, we might have:

   - We have a predicate `ContainsTonsOfKnowledge` for books? But the premise says "Books contain tons of knowledge" meaning all books? So we can say:
        axiom T1 : ∀ b : Book, ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b

 But wait: the first premise is about books in general. We can take it as universally quantified.

 Alternatively, the premise says "Books contain tons of knowledge" meaning every book contains a lot of knowledge. But then note:

   - When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge. It doesn't specify which book. So it must be for any book.

 Steps:

   We need:
     - Type `Book`
     - Type `Person`
     - Constant `Harry : Person`
     - Constant `Walden : Book`

   We have the concept of "gaining knowledge" and "becoming smarter". We can model:

     - We might have a predicate or a function for knowledge? But the premises are about change: "gains knowledge" and "becomes smarter".
       Since we are representing a state change (before and after reading), we might need to model time or state.

 However, note that the conclusion is "Harry is smarter than before". This implies we are comparing two states: before and after the reading event.

 We have two options for temporal modeling:

   1. Explicit states (or moments in time): We introduce a type `Time` and then have relations at time.
   2. We use a relational approach: we have a relation for "after the event". Since we only care about comparing Harry now to Harry before, we can define:

        axiom Smarter : Person -> Person -> Prop
        -- meaning the first person is smarter than the second at (implicitly) the same time? But note: we compare Harry at two different times.

      Actually, we want: Harry at the current time is smarter than Harry at a past time.

   3. We can model with a state for Harry: having his knowledge and smartness at a given time.

 But the problem is: how to model the change?

 We are told:
   Premises:
     (1) Books contain tons of knowledge: ∀ b:Book, has_tons_knowledge(b)   [we can define a predicate for books]
     (2) When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge: 
            ∀ p:Person, ∀b:Book, reads(p,b) → gains_knowledge(p)
     (3) If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter: 
            ∀ p:Person, gains_knowledge(p) → becomes_smarter(p)

 And we are given: Harry read the book “Walden” by Henry Thoreau.

 How to model "become smarter"? This is a change over time. We might need:

   - We have two time points: one before the event, and one after.
   - We have an event: the reading event.

 However, the problem doesn't specify the time explicitly. We can abstract:

   Let us introduce:
      - A two-state model: we have time `t0` (before reading) and `t1` (after reading).

   Then:

      - We can have a function `knowledge : Person -> Time -> nat` (if we model numerically) or a predicate `Knows : Person -> Time -> SomeKnowledge -> Prop`? But that would require formalizing what is known.

   Alternatively, to keep it simple and in the spirit of the example, we can avoid explicit time and instead have:

      - We have a state transition: Harry has a state before and after.
      - We can define Harry's smartness in the initial state and in the final state.

   Since the conclusion is about being smarter than before, we can:

        axiom Smartness : Person -> Time -> nat   -- a function to represent smartness level

        Then the conclusion would be: Smartness Harry t1 > Smartness Harry t0

   However, the problem does not specify that we have such a function. The premises only talk about gains in knowledge and becoming smarter.

   Alternatively, we can define two predicates:

        GainsKnowledge (p: Person) : Prop   -- meaning: at the event, the person gains knowledge.

        and then:

        axiom T3 : ∀ p, GainsKnowledge p → (∃ t_before, t_after, Smartness p t_after > Smartness p t_before)

   But this is complex.

 Since the problem is to formalize without proving, let's choose a minimal model that captures the story.

 Another approach:

   We model:

      - Let `State` be the type of all states (or moments).
      - Let `read_event : State -> State` such that if Harry reads Walden at state s, then after reading we are in state read_event s (or just represent the event as a relation?).

   However, we are not given details about the state machine.

   We can instead abstract the temporal aspect by representing "smartness at a state" and then relate two particular states: the state before reading and the state after.

   We are told: Harry read the book Walden. So:

      There exists a state s0 (before) and a state s1 (after) such that:
          at state s0: Harry has not yet read Walden? 
          but the premise just says he read it. So we have the event.

   So, we can have:

        axiom t0 : Time   -- a starting point
        axiom t1 : Time   -- after the event

        axiom read_event : Person -> Book -> Time -> Time   -- if p reads b at time t, then the new time is ... (but we don't need function, just that the reading occurred at a certain time)

   This gets too involved.

 Given the constraints, let's try to model without time, but by introducing:

     - We define a property "smarter": meaning that after the event Harry is smarter than he was before.

     We can have:

        axiom GainsKnowledge : Person -> Book -> Prop   -- the person gains knowledge by reading that book? Then we can say:

        Then, from the premises: 
          (i) All books contain tons of knowledge: 
                  axiom P1 : ∀ (b : Book), ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b

          (ii) Reading a book (any book) causes the person to gain knowledge: 
                  axiom P2 : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p b

          (iii) If a person gains knowledge (from a book? we don't care which), then they become smarter: 
                  axiom P3 : ∀ (p : Person), (∃ b : Book, GainsKnowledge p b) → Smarter p

        And then the fact: 
                  axiom F1 : Reads Harry Walden

        The conclusion: Smarter Harry

        But what does "Smarter Harry" mean? That Harry is smarter than before? The predicate `Smarter p` would then mean that p has become smarter (i.e., is currently in a smarter state than before the reading). 

        However, note that the conclusion is "Harry is smarter than before", meaning relative to himself in the past.

        So we can interpret `Smarter p` as a property that holds for p meaning that p is now smarter than he was before.

        The problem: We don't have a model of time. But if we define `Smarter p` as meaning p has become smarter (so comparing to his past self) then it's acceptable.

        However, the premise (iii) says: if a person gains knowledge, they become smarter. So we can define:

            Smarter (p) : Prop   -- meaning that the person has become smarter (relative to his previous state).

        Then the conclusion is `Smarter Harry`.

        But note: we need to relate the reading event to the change in smartness. We have:

            GainsKnowledge p b   --> does it mean that the person gains knowledge at the moment of reading? And then that triggers becoming smarter.

        This chain then:

            F1: Reads Harry Walden   (so by P2: GainsKnowledge Harry Walden)
            Then by P3 (instantiating p=Harry and b=Walden) we get: GainsKnowledge Harry Walden → Smarter Harry? 
            But P3 is: ∀ p, (∃ b, GainsKnowledge p b) → Smarter p. Since we have GainsKnowledge Harry Walden, we have ∃ b (Walden) so Smarter Harry.

        However, wait: P2 says: reading a book causes GainsKnowledge for that book. And then P3 says: if there exists a book for which a person has gained knowledge, then that person is smarter. Since Harry has gained knowledge from Walden, then he fulfills ∃ b.

        This seems to work.

        But note: we didn't use P1 (that books contain tons of knowledge). Why is that? It might be that the fact that books contain tons of knowledge is the reason why reading them gives knowledge? But P2 already says that reading a book gives knowledge. So P1 might be redundant? 

        Alternatively, perhaps we should redefine GainsKnowledge to be caused by reading a book that contains tons of knowledge? Then:

            P1 is for all books, they have the property of containing tons of knowledge.

            Then we might not need a quantifier in the antecedent of P2? We can have:

                P2 : ∀ p b, Reads p b → ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b → GainsKnowledge p b

        However, the first premise says "Books contain tons of knowledge" and then the second says "When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge". It does not condition on the book actually having knowledge. But if all books do, then we don't need to condition P2.

        Since the first premise says all books, we can have P1, and then in P2 we don't have to mention it? Because we get that for any b that Harry reads, ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b holds by P1.

        Alternatively, we can use:

            P2 : ∀ p b, Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p b    [because the book has tons of knowledge by P1]

        But then P1 is not mentioned in the formalization? That is okay because we can use it to justify P2? However, in the logical formalization, we have:

            T1: all books contain tons of knowledge. 
            Then we want: from reading, gains knowledge.

        The link is missing? That is, the premise says that books contain tons of knowledge, and then separately that reading a book causes gaining knowledge. It doesn't say explicitly that the reason for the gain is the contained knowledge. 

        However, the problem does not require us to make connections beyond the stated axioms. So we can have:

            P1: ∀ b : Book, ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b
            P2: ∀ p b, Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p b

        and not use P1 in the chain to the conclusion. Then P1 is actually redundant? But the problem says "Books contain tons of knowledge" as a premise. So we must formalize it.

        But it is not necessary for the derivation? Then it might be that the reasoning is:

            Harry reads Walden (F1) so by P2: GainsKnowledge Harry Walden.

            Then by P3: (∃ b, GainsKnowledge Harry b) → Smarter Harry.

            And we have ∃ b (b=Walden) so Smarter Harry.

        However, note that P3 condition is only the existence of a book that the person has gained knowledge from. So what if we use P1? We don't need it. But the problem states it as a premise.

        This suggests that perhaps we have a different understanding of GainsKnowledge: the person gains knowledge only if the book contains tons of knowledge? But the first premise says all books do. So we can either:

          Option A: Formalize P1 and then state P2 without the condition, and accept that P1 is not used? 
          Option B: Change P2 so that it requires the book to contain tons of knowledge? 

        The natural language: 
          Premise 1: Books contain tons of knowledge. 
          Premise 2: When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.

        This implies that reading any book (which by Premise 1 contains tons of knowledge) gives gain of knowledge. However, the link is implicit. In logic, we can formalize the second premise as:

          ∀ p b, Reads p b ∧ ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b → GainsKnowledge p b

        but then we would get GainsKnowledge by using P1? However, the first premise says all books. So we can write:

          P1: ∀ b, ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b
          P2: ∀ p b, Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p b    [because by P1 we know that b satisfies the condition, so we don't need to state it]

        and then P2 is justified because of P1? But we are not building a proof; we are building an axiomatization. We want:

          F1: Reads Harry Walden
          P1: so ContainsTonsOfKnowledge Walden
          P2: Reads Harry Walden → GainsKnowledge Harry Walden   [so we get GainsKnowledge Harry Walden]

        However, note that P2 as stated does not depend on the book having knowledge. But that's acceptable? We have an axiom that says if you read a book you gain knowledge, and then P1 is just extra information. So we can do without the condition? But then why is P1 stated? It might be that in reality we want to derive that the book contains tons of knowledge? But the conclusion doesn't require that.

        Alternatively, the problem might be designed so that the first premise is redundant? We'll formalize it as an axiom anyway.

        Given the above, we design:

          types: Person, Book
          constants: Harry : Person, Walden : Book
          predicates: 
             ContainsTonsOfKnowledge : Book → Prop
             Reads : Person → Book → Prop
             GainsKnowledge : Person → Book → Prop
             Smarter : Person → Prop   -- meaning that the person has become smarter (relative to their past self)

          axioms:
             P1 : ∀ b : Book, ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b
             P2 : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p b
             P3 : ∀ (p : Person), (∃ b : Book, GainsKnowledge p b) → Smarter p
             F1 : Reads Harry Walden

          theorem goal : Smarter Harry := sorry

        Then the proof would be:

          have H1 : ContainsTonsOfKnowledge Walden := P1 Walden   -- but we don't use it
          have H2 : GainsKnowledge Harry Walden := P2 Harry Walden F1
          have H3 : ∃ b, GainsKnowledge Harry b := exists.intro Walden H2
          have goal : Smarter Harry := P3 Harry H3

        So the axiom P1 is not used? That is acceptable because P2 does not depend on it.

        However, note the premise: "When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge." is given without condition. So P2 is sound.

        This model works.

        But note: the problem states "Books contain tons of knowledge" as a premise. We have formalized it as P1. If the problem expects to use it, that's okay. We are including it.

        Alternatively, we might interpret that the gaining of knowledge is because the book contains knowledge? Then:

          P2 : ∀ p b, Reads p b → ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b → GainsKnowledge p b

          and then we have to combine with P1 to get that for any book read, we have the condition.

          Then:

             F1: Reads Harry Walden
             P1: ContainsTonsOfKnowledge Walden
             P2: GainsKnowledge Harry Walden   (from F1 and P1)

          The rest the same.

        This is a more cautious approach: only when you read a book that contains tons of knowledge do you gain knowledge. And since all books contain tons of knowledge, we can derive that reading any book will give gain.

        This makes P1 necessary for the derivation. Then we need:

          P1: ∀ b, ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b
          P2: ∀ p b, Reads p b → ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b → GainsKnowledge p b

          However, then to get GainsKnowledge for Harry and Walden, we need the condition:

          Then: GainsKnowledge Harry Walden := P2 Harry Walden F1 (P1 Walden)

        Then:

          H2 : GainsKnowledge Harry Walden
          H3 : ∃ b, GainsKnowledge Harry b
          H4 : Smarter Harry by P3 Harry H3

        So the conclusion holds.

        Which is better? The natural language presents two premises: one that books contain knowledge and then one that reading a book gives knowledge. The connection might be that the latter occurs because of the former? The problem does not say. So to be safe, we can choose the first version (without condition) to capture the direct premise that reading gives knowledge. Since we also have that all books have knowledge, it doesn't harm.

        Let me choose the simpler one (without condition) because premise 2 says unconditionally that reading a book gives knowledge.

        But the problem says: "Premises: ...". We are translating each premise:

          Premise 1: Books contain tons of knowledge. → ∀ b, ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b

          Premise 2: When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge. → ∀ p b, Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p b

          Premise 3: If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter. → ∀ p, (∃ b, GainsKnowledge p b) → Smarter p

          Fact: Harry read Walden. → Reads Harry Walden

        Therefore, we can proceed.

        We model:

          types: Book, Person
          constants: 
            Walden : Book
            Harry : Person
          predicates:
            ContainsTonsOfKnowledge : Book → Prop
            Reads : Person → Book → Prop
            GainsKnowledge : Person → Book → Prop   -- Note: we model GainsKnowledge per book? Or just per person? 
              Actually, we use GainsKnowledge per book because then we can existentially quantify over the book in Premise3.

          But note: GainsKnowledge might be interpreted as an event: by reading a book, the person gains knowledge. So it's associated with a book.

        Alternatively, we can model GainsKnowledge without the book? Like:

            GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop   -- meaning the person has gained knowledge (from some book)

        Then:

          Premise 2: ∀ p b, Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p

          Premise 3: ∀ p, GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p

        But then we don't need the existential. And then F1 and P2 get GainsKnowledge Harry.

        This is simpler. Why did we think of existential? Because the premise says: "gains knowledge" and that might come from multiple books? But the conclusion only cares that Harry has gained knowledge, regardless which book. 

        But note: the natural language of Premise3: "If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter". This is independent of the book.

        So it is better:

          Types: 
            Book
            Person

          Constants:
            Harry : Person
            Walden : Book

          Predicates:
            ContainsTonsOfKnowledge : Book → Prop   -- for premise1
            Reads : Person → Book → Prop
            GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop           -- the person gains knowledge (from any reading event? We don't need to specify the book for the knowledge gain)
            Smarter : Person → Prop

          Axioms:
            P1 : ∀ b, ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b
            P2 : ∀ p b, Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p    -- Note: reading a book causes the person to gain knowledge (we don't care which book for the GainsKnowledge predicate)
            P3 : ∀ p, GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p
            F1 : Reads Harry Walden

          Theorem goal : Smarter Harry := sorry

        Then the proof:

          H1: GainsKnowledge Harry   by P2 Harry Walden F1
          goal: Smarter Harry by P3 Harry H1

        And P1 is not used? Yes, because no axiom uses ContainsTonsOfKnowledge. 

        But Premise1 is stated as a premise. Why? In this model, it is not necessary for the conclusion. 

        So we have two interpretations:

          Interpretation A: The GainsKnowledge event is triggered by reading a book that contains tons of knowledge? Then:

             P2: ∀ p b, Reads p b → ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b → GainsKnowledge p

          Then we use P1 to get that Walden has the property.

          Interpretation B: The first premise is a background fact, but the second premise does not link explicitly to it. The problem might not require the link? 

        Since the problem says: "Books contain tons of knowledge", we must include it. So Interpretation A might be more accurate? 

        Let me re-read the natural language:

          Premise: Books contain tons of knowledge. 
          Premise: When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.

        The second sentence does not condition on the book having knowledge? It might be that the speaker is intending that the book having knowledge is the reason for the gain. But the second sentence is stated unconditionally. So we can assume that it holds unconditionally. Therefore, Interpretation B is acceptable.

        But the second premise might be intended to follow from the fact that books contain knowledge? Then the argument would be:

          Books contain tons of knowledge -> when a person reads a book, they gain knowledge.

        That would mean that the second premise is actually derived? But the problem says we have two independent premises? 

        The problem lists:

          Premises:
            1. Books contain tons of knowledge.
            2. When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.

        So we have both as input premises. Therefore, we formalize both.

        Therefore, we include both and interpret them as independent. Then P1 (all books have knowledge) does not get used.

        However, to be safe and to capture the possible dependence, we can include the condition? But that would change the meaning: the second premise would be conditional. The natural language does not say "if the book contains knowledge then reading it gives knowledge". It just says "when a person reads a book, ...". And by Premise1, all books contain knowledge. So we can remove the condition? 

        After consideration, we decide to model without the condition. Since the first premise says all books have knowledge, the condition in P2 would always hold. So the condition is redundant.

        Therefore, we choose Interpretation B.

        Final formalization:

          <lean>
          axiom Book : Type
          axiom Person : Type
          axiom Walden : Book
          axiom Harry : Person

          -- Predicates
          axiom ContainsTonsOfKnowledge : Book → Prop
          axiom Reads : Person → Book → Prop
          axiom GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop
          axiom Smarter : Person → Prop

          -- Premise 1: Books contain tons of knowledge.
          axiom P1 : ∀ b : Book, ContainsTonsOfKnowledge b

          -- Premise 2: When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.
          axiom P2 : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p

          -- Premise 3: If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.
          axiom P3 : ∀ p : Person, GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p

          -- Fact: Harry read the book "Walden" by Henry Thoreau.
          axiom F1 : Reads Harry Walden

          -- Conclusion: Harry is smarter than before.
          theorem goal : Smarter Harry := sorry
          </lean>

        But wait: the conclusion says "Harry is smarter than before". Our axiom `Smarter p` is defined as a predicate that holds for a person meaning that they have become smarter (so relative to their previous state). That captures the meaning.

        We did not model "before" as a separate time, but the predicate `Smarter Harry` is intended to represent the after state relative to the reading event.

        Therefore, this formalization captures the problem.

        Let's write the code accordingly.


=== RESPONSE ===
To formalize the given premises and conclusion, we define types for `People` and `Books` to distinguish between these entities. The predicate `SmartnessIncreased` captures the key change in Harry's state. Here's the complete Lean 4 formalization:

<lean>
axiom People : Type
axiom Books : Type
axiom Harry : People
axiom Walden : Books

-- Predicates
axiom HasKnowledge : Books → Prop -- Books contain knowledge
axiom Reads : People → Books → Prop -- Person reads a book
axiom GainsKnowledge : People → Prop -- Person gains knowledge
axiom SmartnessIncreased : People → Prop -- Person becomes smarter relative to their past self

-- Premise: All books contain tons of knowledge
axiom P1 : ∀ b : Books, HasKnowledge b

-- Premise: Reading any book causes knowledge gain
axiom P2 : ∀ (p : People) (b : Books), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p

-- Premise: Knowledge gain increases smartness
axiom P3 : ∀ p : People, GainsKnowledge p → SmartnessIncreased p

-- Fact: Harry read Walden
axiom F1 : Reads Harry Walden

-- Conclusion: Harry became smarter than before
theorem goal : SmartnessIncreased Harry := sorry
</lean>

### Explanation:
1. **Types and Constants**: 
   - `People` and `Books` are distinct types.
   - `Harry` (a person) and `Walden` (a book) are specific constants.

2. **Predicates**:
   - `HasKnowledge b` ≡ Book `b` contains knowledge.
   - `Reads p b` ≡ Person `p` read book `b`.
   - `GainsKnowledge p` ≡ Person `p` gained knowledge (after some reading).
   - `SmartnessIncreased p` ≡ Person `p` is smarter than before.

3. **Axioms**:
   - `P1`: All books have knowledge (from first premise).
   - `P2`: If a person reads any book, they gain knowledge (from second premise).
   - `P3`: Knowledge gain causes increased smartness (from third premise).
   - `F1`: Harry read Walden (given fact).

4. **Theorem**: 
   - `goal` concludes Harry became smarter using `sorry` as a placeholder.

STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several axioms and a fact. The goal is to prove that Harry became smarter than before (SmartnessIncreased Harry).

Let's break down the given information:

1. `P1` says that every book contains tons of knowledge, but note that we don't directly use this in the proof because the next axiom (P2) already uses the act of reading to cause knowledge gain.

2. `P2` states that if a person reads any book, then that person gains knowledge. Specifically, for any person `p` and any book `b`, if `p` reads `b`, then `GainsKnowledge p`.

3. `P3` states that if a person gains knowledge, then that person's smartness increases.

4. `F1` states that Harry read Walden (which is a book).

The conclusion we want is `SmartnessIncreased Harry`.

We can chain these together:

- From `F1 : Reads Harry Walden`, and using `P2` with `Harry` and `Walden`, we get that `GainsKnowledge Harry` (by applying `P2 Harry Walden` to `F1`).

- Then, with `P3 Harry` and the fact that `GainsKnowledge Harry`, we get `SmartnessIncreased Harry`.

So the proof term is: `P3 Harry (P2 Harry Walden F1)`

Let's write it step by step:

1. `P2 Harry Walden F1` : This is of type `GainsKnowledge Harry`.
2. `P3 Harry` : This is of type `GainsKnowledge Harry → SmartnessIncreased Harry`.
3. Applying the above to the result of step 1: `P3 Harry (P2 Harry Walden F1)`.

Therefore, the complete code is:

<lean>
axiom People : Type
axiom Books : Type
axiom Harry : People
axiom Walden : Books

-- Predicates
axiom HasKnowledge : Books → Prop -- Books contain knowledge
axiom Reads : People → Books → Prop -- Person reads a book
axiom GainsKnowledge : People → Prop -- Person gains knowledge
axiom SmartnessIncreased : People → Prop -- Person becomes smarter relative to their past self

-- Premise: All books contain tons of knowledge
axiom P1 : ∀ b : Books, HasKnowledge b

-- Premise: Reading any book causes knowledge gain
axiom P2 : ∀ (p : People) (b : Books), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p

-- Premise: Knowledge gain increases smartness
axiom P3 : ∀ p : People, GainsKnowledge p → SmartnessIncreased p

-- Fact: Harry read Walden
axiom F1 : Reads Harry Walden

-- Conclusion: Harry became smarter than before
theorem goal : SmartnessIncreased Harry := P3 Harry (P2 Harry Walden F1)
</lean>

ANSWER: True

Proof reasoning:
1. By axiom P2, reading any book causes knowledge gain: ∀ (p : People) (b : Books), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p
2. Fact F1 states Reads Harry Walden
3. Applying P2 to Harry and Walden with F1 gives GainsKnowledge Harry
4. By axiom P3, knowledge gain increases smartness: ∀ p, GainsKnowledge p → SmartnessIncreased p
5. Applying P3 to Harry with the previous result gives SmartnessIncreased Harry

The term is directly composed: P3 Harry (P2 Harry Walden F1)
