STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are defining a new type for "natural language processing task"
 We have two categories: language generation and language understanding.
 We also have a specific task: machine translation.

 Premises:
 1. Every NLP task is either language generation or language understanding.
    We can model this with a disjunction? But in Lean, we can use two predicates or use an inductive type?
    However, the problem says "categorized as either", so we can have two predicates and an axiom that says every task is one or the other.

    Alternatively, we can have:
      axiom categorization : ∀ t, LG t ∨ LU t

 2. If the output of an NLP task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.
    So: ∀ t, OutputIsTextSequence t → LG t

 3. Machine translation is an NLP task. We'll have a constant for it.

 4. The output of machine translation is a text sequence.

 Conclusion: Machine translation is a language generation task.

 We can set up:

   axiom Task : Type   -- the type of natural language processing tasks

   -- We'll define two predicates:
   axiom LG : Task → Prop   -- language generation task
   axiom LU : Task → Prop   -- language understanding task

   -- Premise 1: every task is either LG or LU
   axiom P1 : ∀ (t : Task), LG t ∨ LU t

   -- We have a function or a predicate for the output? The premise says: "the output ... is a text sequence"
   -- We can define a predicate: HasOutputTextSequence : Task → Prop
   axiom HasOutputTextSequence : Task → Prop

   -- Premise 2: if a task has output that is a text sequence, then it is LG.
   axiom P2 : ∀ (t : Task), HasOutputTextSequence t → LG t

   -- Machine translation is a specific task
   axiom MT : Task

   -- Premise 3: Machine translation is an NLP task? Well, we have it as an element of Task, so that's given.

   -- Premise 4: the output of machine translation is a text sequence.
   axiom P4 : HasOutputTextSequence MT

   Conclusion: LG MT

 However, note that premise 1 is not actually required for the conclusion? Because from P2 and P4 we get LG MT.

 But to be faithful to the premises, let's include everything.

 We might note that premise 1 is a background fact and might be used in a more complex proof, but here we don't need it.

 However, the problem says to formalize all premises.

 So we do:

   axiom Task : Type
   axiom LG : Task → Prop
   axiom LU : Task → Prop
   axiom P1 : ∀ t, LG t ∨ LU t
   axiom HasOutputTextSequence : Task → Prop
   axiom P2 : ∀ t, HasOutputTextSequence t → LG t
   axiom MT : Task
   axiom P4 : HasOutputTextSequence MT

   theorem goal : LG MT := sorry

 But wait, we have the premise that machine translation is an NLP task? Actually, we have the type `Task` for NLP tasks, and `MT` is of type `Task`, so that's already covered.

 However, the premise says "Machine translation is a natural language processing task", so by having `MT : Task` we are representing that.

 Let me check: The first premise says "A natural language processing task ...", so we are only talking about objects of type `Task`. Therefore, when we say `∀ t : Task`, we are quantifying over NLP tasks.

 Therefore, the above axioms are sufficient.

 Let's write the code accordingly.

 Important: We are not trying to prove it, just setting up the axioms and the theorem with `sorry`.


=== RESPONSE ===
Below is the Lean 4 formalization of the logic puzzle:

<lean>
-- Define types for NLP tasks and text sequences
axiom NLP_Task : Type
axiom TextSequence : Type

-- Define categories and properties
axiom LangGeneration : NLP_Task → Prop
axiom LangUnderstanding : NLP_Task → Prop
axiom OutputTextSequence : NLP_Task → TextSequence → Prop

-- Define specific task
axiom MachineTranslation : NLP_Task

-- Premises
axiom task_categorization : ∀ t : NLP_Task, 
  LangGeneration t ∨ LangUnderstanding t

axiom text_sequence_implies_generation : 
  ∀ t : NLP_Task, (∃ s : TextSequence, OutputTextSequence t s) → LangGeneration t

axiom mt_output_exists : 
  ∃ s : TextSequence, OutputTextSequence MachineTranslation s

-- Conclusion
theorem goal : LangGeneration MachineTranslation := sorry
</lean>

Key formalization choices:
1. `NLP_Task` represents natural language processing tasks
2. `TextSequence` represents possible text outputs
3. `LangGeneration/LangUnderstanding` as predicates on tasks
4. `OutputTextSequence` predicate connects tasks to their output
5. The critical premise uses existential quantifier: "∃ s" captures "there is some text sequence output"
6. `mt_output_exists` formalizes "The output of machine translation is a text sequence"
7. Theorem `goal` states the desired conclusion using `sorry` placeholder

Note: The task_categorization axiom (1st premise) is included for completeness but isn't strictly necessary for deriving the conclusion from the given premises.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given:
  mt_output_exists : ∃ s, OutputTextSequence MachineTranslation s

We have a lemma:
  text_sequence_implies_generation : ∀ t, (∃ s, OutputTextSequence t s) → LangGeneration t

We want to prove:
  LangGeneration MachineTranslation

We can use the lemma on the MachineTranslation task by providing the evidence of the existence of a text sequence for it.

Specifically, we can instantiate the lemma with MachineTranslation and then provide the premise mt_output_exists.

In Lean, we can write:
  text_sequence_implies_generation MachineTranslation mt_output_exists

Therefore, the proof term is:

  text_sequence_implies_generation MachineTranslation mt_output_exists

Now, we write the complete code accordingly.
