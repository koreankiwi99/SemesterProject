STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion.
 We need to define the necessary types, predicates, and axioms to represent the statements.
 Then we declare the theorem to be the conclusion, using the axioms (and sorry as the proof).

 Steps:
 1. We have objects (like business organizations, companies, private companies, and the Harvard Weekly Book Club).
 2. We define a type for objects: `obj`.
 3. We define predicates (or functions) for the categories and relations:
    - `BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop`
    - `LegalEntity : obj → Prop`
    - `Company : obj → Prop`
    - `PrivateCompany : obj → Prop`
    - `CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop`
    - `HasLegalObligations : obj → Prop`
 4. We also have a constant for the Harvard Weekly Book Club: `HWBC : obj`

 Premises:
  A1: "All business organizations are legal entities."
      → ∀ x, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x

  A2: "All companies are business organizations."
      → ∀ x, Company x → BusinessOrganization x

  A3: "All private companies are companies."
      → ∀ x, PrivateCompany x → Company x

  A4: "All legal entities are created under law."
      → ∀ x, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x

  A5: "All legal entities have legal obligations."
      → ∀ x, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x

  A6: "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company."
      → CreatedUnderLaw HWBC → ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC

 Conclusion: "The Harvard Weekly Book club has legal obligations."
     → HasLegalObligations HWBC

 However, note that we cannot directly deduce the conclusion from the given axioms without additional steps, but our job is not to prove it but to formalize it.

 Important: The problem does not require proving, just setting up the theorem with axioms and a sorry.

 But note: We do have an axiom (A6) that involves HWBC being created under law implying it's not a private company. However, the conclusion is about having legal obligations.

 We need to show that HWBC is a legal entity? How? We don't have a direct statement that HWBC is a business organization or company. But note the conclusion.

 However, we are only formalizing the statements, so we just set up the axioms and the theorem.

 Let's define:

  axiom obj : Type
  axiom HWBC : obj

  axiom BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop
  axiom LegalEntity : obj → Prop
  axiom Company : obj → Prop
  axiom PrivateCompany : obj → Prop
  axiom CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop
  axiom HasLegalObligations : obj → Prop

  Axioms:

  A1: ∀ x : obj, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
  A2: ∀ x : obj, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
  A3: ∀ x : obj, PrivateCompany x → Company x
  A4: ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
  A5: ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
  A6: CreatedUnderLaw HWBC → ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC

  Theorem stating the conclusion:
    theorem goal : HasLegalObligations HWBC := sorry

 But wait: we don't have any axiom that states that HWBC is a business organization or a company? However, note that we have A6 that has a condition about HWBC being created under law.

 Actually, the problem does not state that HWBC is anything in particular? How then do we get that it has legal obligations? 

 However, we are only to formalize the given statements. The user might have intended that we connect HWBC being created under law (which we can get if we can show it's a legal entity) to having obligations. But we don't have a direct link from HWBC to business organizations.

 But note: the problem gives the premises and the conclusion. We just formalize what is given.

 It is possible that the user made a mistake? Or maybe we are missing a premise? But the problem says "Premises" and lists those.

 So we stick to the given.

 However, note: we have A5: every legal entity has legal obligations. So if we can show that HWBC is a legal entity, then we are done. But we don't have that HWBC is a business organization. We only know from A6: if it is created under law then it is not a private company. But created under law is a property of legal entities (A4). So if we could show that HWBC is a legal entity, then we would have both that it is created under law and that it has legal obligations.

 But we don't have any premise that says HWBC is a business organization or company.

 However, the formalization must exactly reflect the problem.

 Therefore, we do not introduce any extra assumptions. We just create the structure as per the problem.

 Let's code accordingly.

 IMPORTANT: The theorem we are to formalize is: `HasLegalObligations HWBC`

 But note: we cannot prove this with the current axioms without additional premises. But that is not our job. Our job is to formalize.

 We'll write:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HWBC : obj

axiom BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : obj → Prop
axiom Company : obj → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : obj → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom A6 : CreatedUnderLaw HWBC → ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC

theorem goal : HasLegalObligations HWBC := sorry
</lean>

 However, note: the problem says "If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company", which we have as A6.

 We are not providing a proof for the theorem, only the structure.

 So this code formalizes the problem.

 But wait: is there a dependency? In particular, the HWBC might be a legal entity by being a business organization? But we don't have that premise. So we cannot prove it. The formalization is still correct.

 Let's check: the theorem is declared and uses `sorry`. That is acceptable.


=== RESPONSE ===
To formalize the given premises and conclusion in Lean 4, we define the following:

1. A type `obj` representing all objects
2. The Harvard Weekly Book Club as a constant `HWBC : obj`
3. Predicates for each relevant property:
   - `BusinessOrganization`
   - `LegalEntity`
   - `Company`
   - `PrivateCompany`
   - `CreatedUnderLaw`
   - `HasLegalObligations`

**Premises as axioms:**
- `A1`: All business organizations are legal entities
- `A2`: All companies are business organizations
- `A3`: All private companies are companies
- `A4`: All legal entities are created under law
- `A5`: All legal entities have legal obligations
- `A6`: The Harvard Weekly Book Club being created under law implies it is not a private company

**Conclusion theorem:**
`HasLegalObligations HWBC`

Here is the complete Lean 4 code representation:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HWBC : obj
axiom BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : obj → Prop
axiom Company : obj → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : obj → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom A6 : CreatedUnderLaw HWBC → ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC

theorem conclusion : HasLegalObligations HWBC := sorry
</lean>

This setup:
- Declares all required predicates and objects
- Formally maps all premises to Lean axioms
- Structures the conclusion as a theorem with placeholder proof (`sorry`)
- Maintains exact correspondence to the natural language premises
- Uses Lean 4 syntax conventions (`fun`, `by`, no `λ`)


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given a goal to prove: `HasLegalObligations HWBC`
 We have axioms:
   A1: ∀ x, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
   A2: ∀ x, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
   A3: ∀ x, PrivateCompany x → Company x
   A4: ∀ x, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
   A5: ∀ x, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
   A6: CreatedUnderLaw HWBC → ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC

 However, note that we are not given any direct positive facts about HWBC (like `BusinessOrganization HWBC` or `PrivateCompany HWBC`). 
 We must derive `HasLegalObligations HWBC` by chaining the implications.

 But observe: to use A5 we need `LegalEntity HWBC`. 
 To get `LegalEntity HWBC` from A1 we need `BusinessOrganization HWBC`. 
 To get `BusinessOrganization HWBC` from A2 we need `Company HWBC`. 
 To get `Company HWBC` from A3 we need `PrivateCompany HWBC`.

 However, we have an axiom A6 that says: if `CreatedUnderLaw HWBC` then `¬ PrivateCompany HWBC`. 
 But note: without knowing `PrivateCompany HWBC` or `CreatedUnderLaw HWBC` we are stuck.

 Let us try to see if we can get a contradiction? But the goal is to prove `HasLegalObligations HWBC`.

 How can we prove it? We do not have any positive hypothesis about HWBC.

 We have to reexamine the axioms: 
   A4: LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
   A5: LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x

 So if we can show `LegalEntity HWBC`, then we get `HasLegalObligations HWBC` by A5.

 How to get `LegalEntity HWBC`? We need either:
   (1) through A1: by `BusinessOrganization HWBC`
   (2) we are not given any other way to get `LegalEntity` (since A1 is the only one producing LegalEntity from BusinessOrganization).

 And A1 requires BusinessOrganization, which from A2 requires Company, which from A3 requires PrivateCompany.

 So the chain is: PrivateCompany HWBC → Company HWBC → BusinessOrganization HWBC → LegalEntity HWBC → HasLegalObligations HWBC.

 However, we have A6 that says: if we have CreatedUnderLaw HWBC then we cannot have PrivateCompany HWBC.

 Note: CreatedUnderLaw HWBC is a consequence of LegalEntity HWBC (by A4). 
 But if we had PrivateCompany HWBC, then we would get LegalEntity HWBC (by the chain) and then CreatedUnderLaw HWBC (by A4), and then by A6 we would have ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC -> contradiction.

 Therefore, if we assume that we cannot get a contradiction, we must avoid having PrivateCompany HWBC? 

 But wait, without any starting point, how can we even begin? 

 The problem is: we are not given any positive fact about HWBC (like `BusinessOrganization HWBC` or `Company HWBC` or `PrivateCompany HWBC`). 

 Therefore, we cannot prove `HasLegalObligations HWBC` from the given axioms.

 However, let us see if we can derive a contradiction? The axioms might be inconsistent? But the problem does not state any fact about HWBC, so we might be able to assume that none of these hold?

 Actually, we are not forced to have any of the properties for HWBC. For example, if HWBC is not a private company, then we don't have a chain to get to LegalEntity.

 Therefore, it seems the theorem is not provable.

 But wait: we have the axiom A6 that says: CreatedUnderLaw HWBC implies not PrivateCompany HWBC. 

 However, without knowing either CreatedUnderLaw HWBC or PrivateCompany HWBC, we cannot use it.

 How about using the chain and then getting to CreatedUnderLaw? But again, the chain starts with PrivateCompany, which we don't have.

 Considering this, there is no proof of `HasLegalObligations HWBC`.

 Thus, the answer should be Uncertain? Or do we have to prove it? Let's reexamine:

 We have only axioms that are implications. Without at least one positive property about HWBC, we cannot start.

 Therefore, we conclude that the theorem is not provable? 

 But note: the goal is to replace `sorry` with a valid proof term. If it is unprovable, we cannot provide a proof. So we must say False? 

 But the TASK says: Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term.

 However, we have to admit it is unprovable. The answer after the code should be the verdict.

 Since the user asks: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 In this case, we cannot write a valid proof term. Therefore, we must say that the theorem is not provable? How do we represent that?

 The instructions are: "Provide the complete code with a valid proof." If we cannot, then we must indicate that the theorem is unprovable (False, because the statement is not always true? but we have a countermodel?).

 Actually, we can build a model where there are no facts about HWBC. Then `HasLegalObligations HWBC` does not hold.

 However, note: the axioms A5 says: ∀ x, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x. 
 If HWBC is not a LegalEntity, then we don't have to have HasLegalObligations. 

 Therefore, the statement `HasLegalObligations HWBC` is not necessarily true. 

 So the answer should be: False? Meaning that the statement is not always true? But we are in a specific context. 

 Actually, the question is: under the given axioms, is the theorem true? The answer is that it is not provable because we don't have enough information. So the theorem does not follow.

 How about we try to implement a proof? We see that without any private company we don't get the obligation. 

 Therefore, we say that the theorem is not provable and the answer should be "False" meaning the statement is not true (without additional assumptions). But note, in logic, if the system is consistent, then the statement might be false.

 We can build a countermodel:

   Let there be one object: HWBC.
   We assign:
      PrivateCompany HWBC: false
      Then Company HWBC: false (by A3: if it were true, then PrivateCompany would have to be true, which it isn't)
      Then BusinessOrganization HWBC: false.
      Then LegalEntity HWBC: false.
      Then HasLegalObligations HWBC: false. (We don't have to assign anything by A5: the implication holds vacuously if the antecedent is false.)

   What about the other axioms?
      A4: LegalEntity x -> CreatedUnderLaw x: for HWBC, if LegalEntity is false, then the implication is true.
      A5: similarly.

      A6: CreatedUnderLaw HWBC -> ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC. Now if we set CreatedUnderLaw HWBC to false, then the implication is true.

   So in this model, everything holds and the conclusion is false.

   Therefore, the statement `HasLegalObligations HWBC` is not necessarily true under the given axioms.

   Hence, we cannot prove it, and the conclusion is actually false in some models. Therefore, the theorem as stated is false? 

   Actually, the theorem is not a valid logical consequence. So the answer is False: the statement is not true.

 But note: what if we had an axiom that said `BusinessOrganization HWBC`? Then we could prove it. But we don't.

 Therefore, we have to give up and say that the conclusion is not provable, and in fact false in some models.

 However, the problem says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration", meaning that the axioms are fixed and we are to prove the theorem. Since we can't, and we see a countermodel, we say the statement is False.

 But the task is to replace 'sorry' with a proof term. We cannot, because the theorem is false.

 We must therefore report that the theorem is false? But note: the instruction says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 Since we cannot provide a proof, we must not try to write a false proof. Instead, we should indicate that the statement is False.

 However, the problem says: "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." If the theorem is false, then there is no valid proof term. 

 In this situation, we are forced to abort. We have to say that the theorem is false.

 But how exactly? We cannot write a proof. Therefore, the only option is to not change the code? Or write something that fails? 

 That's not what the problem expects. We are to provide the complete code with the proof if possible, and if not, we must mark it as false.

 Actually, the problem says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

 So we can write that the answer is False, and for the code, we leave sorry? Or maybe we indicate failure.

 However, reviewing the task: "TASK: Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term." and "CRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax.".

 Since we cannot write a valid proof term, the best we can do is to leave it as sorry? But that would be incorrect.

 Alternative: we can try to use classical logic? But we have no classical axioms.

 We can try to use `by_contra`? But we don't have classical reasoning. And even if we did, we cannot get a contradiction? 

 Let me try a proof attempt:

   We have no way to create LegalEntity for HWBC without PrivateCompany. But if we assume PrivateCompany HWBC, then:
      HP: PrivateCompany HWBC
      from A3: Company HWBC
      from A2: BusinessOrganization HWBC
      from A1: LegalEntity HWBC
      then from A4: CreatedUnderLaw HWBC
      then from A6: ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC -> contradiction.

   Therefore, if we assume PrivateCompany HWBC, we get a contradiction.

   So by classical reasoning, we can prove ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC.

   But now we have ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC, and we still cannot get LegalEntity HWBC? 

   We are stuck: we don't have any other way to get LegalEntity.

   Therefore, even with classical logic, we cannot prove HasLegalObligations HWBC.

   We can prove that it is not the case that HWBC is a PrivateCompany, but that doesn't help.

 Therefore, we cannot prove the goal.

 Given that, we must conclude the answer is False: the statement is not true.

 But in the code, we are to replace sorry. We cannot. However, note: the problem may have intended that HWBC is a PrivateCompany? But axiom A6 says if it is CreatedUnderLaw then it isn't. 

 Without an explicit axiom giving a positive property to HWBC, we are stuck.

 Therefore, we output the code unchanged? That is, with `sorry`? But that is not a valid proof.

 However, the instructions say: "Provide the complete code with a valid proof term." and if we cannot, then we must state that the answer is False.

 For the code part, since we cannot write a valid proof, we have no alternative. So we leave sorry and state that the answer is False? Or can we write something else?

 Let me think: maybe we can use the fact that we have a contradiction under the assumption of PrivateCompany, and then we might get the goal by ex falso? But ex falso would give us any proposition from False, but we don't have False.

 Therefore, we cannot.

 We decide to output:

<lean>
... unchanged code ...
theorem conclusion : HasLegalObligations HWBC := sorry
</lean>

and then ANSWER: False

 But note: the problem says to replace sorry with a valid proof term. Since we cannot, we leave sorry and mark it as False? 

 However, the problem expects a valid proof. Without one, the code is not valid. But the answer is that the theorem is false.

 Another approach: in Lean, if a theorem is unprovable, we cannot just leave it. The code must compile? But it won't.

 Therefore, we must not produce a proof, and we state that the answer is False.

 Alternatively, the problem might have been intended that we have a positive fact about HWBC? But it is not given.

 Given the instructions, we do the following:

   We write in the code: `theorem conclusion : HasLegalObligations HWBC := by admit` or something? But that is not valid.

   Since the problem only allows valid Lean, we are not allowed to leave sorry. 

   So perhaps we must abort.

 But note: the problem says "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions", meaning the axioms are consistent? And the theorem is part of the code block.

 How about we write a proof that uses `let' statements? We can try to build the chain, but we get stuck at the beginning.

 Example:

   we know that we need `LegalEntity HWBC` to apply A5. But we don't have that.

   we need to find a way to get `LegalEntity HWBC`. Without any properties about HWBC in the axioms, we can't.

 Therefore, we output:

   The theorem is not provable, so the answer is False.

   In the code, we will leave `sorry` and note that. However, that doesn't meet the requirement.

 We are trapped.

 I think the intended solution was that we use the chain to prove `HasLegalObligations HWBC` by showing that HWBC is a LegalEntity? But without a starting point, we can't.

 Given that, I suspect there might be an axiom missing. But the problem states the axioms.

 After careful analysis, I conclude that the theorem `conclusion` cannot be proven. Therefore, the answer is False.

 We will now write the code with `sorry` (because we cannot write a valid proof) and then state ANSWER: False.

 But note: the expectation is to replace sorry. So we must do something else.

 Alternative: use the fact that we have a contradiction if we assume PrivateCompany, but then use classical reasoning to show that HWBC must not be a PrivateCompany, however that doesn't help us prove the goal.

 There's not a path to prove HasLegalObligations.

 Therefore, we write:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HWBC : obj
axiom BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : obj → Prop
axiom Company : obj → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : obj → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom A6 : CreatedUnderLaw HWBC → ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC

theorem conclusion : HasLegalObligations HWBC := by
  -- We need to show HasLegalObligations HWBC. By A5, this would follow from LegalEntity HWBC.
  -- By A1, LegalEntity HWBC would follow from BusinessOrganization HWBC.
  -- By A2, that would follow from Company HWBC.
  -- By A3, that would follow from PrivateCompany HWBC.
  -- So we need PrivateCompany HWBC.
  -- However, if we had PrivateCompany HWBC, then we would have:
  have H_chain : PrivateCompany HWBC → HasLegalObligations HWBC := by
    intro hPC
    have hC : Company HWBC := A3 HWBC hPC
    have hBO : BusinessOrganization HWBC := A2 HWBC hC
    have hLE : LegalEntity HWBC := A1 HWBC hBO
    exact A5 HWBC hLE
  -- Now, from A4, if we have LegalEntity HWBC then CreatedUnderLaw HWBC, and then by A6 we have ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC.
  -- So if we assume hPC: PrivateCompany HWBC, then by the chain we get CreatedUnderLaw HWBC?
  have H_contradiction : PrivateCompany HWBC → False := by
    intro hPC
    have hLE : LegalEntity HWBC := by 
      apply A1
      apply A2
      apply A3
      exact hPC
    have hCL : CreatedUnderLaw HWBC := A4 HWBC hLE
    have hNotPC := A6 hCL
    exact hNotPC hPC
  -- We can prove ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC from the above.
  have H_notPC : ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC := H_contradiction
  -- But now we need HasLegalObligations HWBC. 
  -- We don't have it. We only have that if it is a PrivateCompany then it has obligations, and we know it fails to be a PrivateCompany, but that doesn't give us the obligations.
  -- So we are stuck.
  -- ... no tactics to prove the goal
  sorry
</lean>

 But this proof attempt already fails because we have the sorry at the end.

 We tried to mimic the chain but got stuck because we proved the negation of the starting point.

 Therefore, we must abandon.

 Given that the problem requires a valid proof term and we cannot provide one, and our analysis shows that the theorem is not always true (there exists a countermodel), we mark the answer as False.

 So our output will be the code with a sorry in the theorem (because there's no way to avoid it) and then ANSWER: False.

 However, that leaves the code with sorry which is not a complete proof.

 Given the problem constraints, this is the best we can do.

 Alternatively, we might try to use classical.choice or excluded_middle, but Lean does not have that in the default set. And we are not given any classical axioms.

 Therefore, we output the code above with the proof attempt that ends in sorry, and then state ANSWER: False.

 But the instructions say "Replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term". Since we cannot, we have to leave sorry. 

 Alternatively, we can note that if we use classical logic and our chain leads to a contradiction for NonObligation, then we can prove by contradiction? But we are not given anything like that.

 Without any other option, we simply state that the theorem is not provable.

 Final decision: 

   We write the code we have and then answer False.

 Let me re-read the axioms: maybe there's a hidden positive fact.

   Axiom A6: `CreatedUnderLaw HWBC → ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC` 
   does not say whether `CreatedUnderLaw HWBC` holds or not.

   And the other axioms are all implications: they do not assert any property about HWBC.

   So HWBC is an object about which no positive fact is known!

 Therefore, the theorem is false.

Code:


=== RESPONSE ===
The theorem `HasLegalObligations HWBC` is **not provable** from the given axioms. 

Here's why:
1. To prove `HasLegalObligations HWBC`, we need `LegalEntity HWBC` (by A5).
2. To get `LegalEntity HWBC`, we need `BusinessOrganization HWBC` (by A1).
3. To get `BusinessOrganization HWBC`, we need `Company HWBC` (by A2).
4. To get `Company HWBC`, we need `PrivateCompany HWBC` (by A3).

However, axiom A6 states that if `CreatedUnderLaw HWBC` holds, then `¬ PrivateCompany HWBC`. There is:
- **No axiom asserting `PrivateCompany HWBC`**, so we cannot start the chain.
- **No other way to establish `LegalEntity HWBC`** (other axioms require the properties derived above).

The absence of any positive property about `HWBC` (e.g., `PrivateCompany HWBC`, `BusinessOrganization HWBC`, etc.) makes it impossible to prove the goal. A countermodel where `HWBC` satisfies no properties except those implied by the axioms (e.g., `CreatedUnderLaw HWBC` is false) shows `HasLegalObligations HWBC` can be false.
