STAGE 1: TRANSLATION
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given several premises and a conclusion.
 We need to formalize the logical structure in Lean 4.

 Steps:

 1. Identify the types and predicates we need.

 We are talking about animals and bees. So let's introduce:
   - A type `Animal` for animals.
   - Harry is a particular animal? But note: the premises start with "Animals", then talk about bees, and then Harry is a bee.
     So we can have:
        axiom Animal : Type
        axiom Bee : Animal → Prop   -- to say which animals are bees
        axiom Harry : Animal        -- Harry is an animal (specifically a bee)

    Alternatively, we might have a separate type for bees? But note the premise "All bees" and "All queen bees are bees".
    Since a queen bee is a bee and a bee is an animal, we can model bees as a subset of animals.

 2. Predicates from premises:

    Premise 1: Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
        We can define:
          Invertebrate : Animal → Prop
          Vertebrate : Animal → Prop
        and the premise: ∀ a : Animal, Invertebrate a ∨ Vertebrate a

    Premise 2: All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
        We need:
          HasBackbone : Animal → Prop
          ReproduceByMating : Animal → Prop   (meaning they reproduce by male-and-female mating)

        Premise: ∀ a : Animal, HasBackbone a → ReproduceByMating a

    Premise 3: All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
        Premise: ∀ a : Animal, Vertebrate a → HasBackbone a

    Premise 4: All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
        Premise: ∀ a : Animal, Bee a → ¬ ReproduceByMating a

    Premise 5: All queen bees are bees.
        We introduce:
          QueenBee : Animal → Prop
        Premise: ∀ a : Animal, QueenBee a → Bee a

    Premise 6: Harry is a bee.
        Bee Harry

 3. Conclusion: Harry is a queen bee.
        QueenBee Harry

 4. But note: the conclusion is "Harry is a queen bee". However, from the premises we can only deduce that Harry is a bee and that no bee reproduces by mating.
    Actually, the argument might be that since Harry is a bee, he doesn't reproduce by mating. But animals with backbones do reproduce by mating, so Harry cannot have a backbone. 
    Then, since vertebrates have a backbone, Harry must be an invertebrate. However, this does not directly say that Harry is a queen bee.

    BUT WAIT: the conclusion is that Harry is a queen bee. How does that follow? 
    The key is that the premises might suggest that non-queen bees don't exist? Actually, no.

    Let me read the premises again:

        Premise 4: All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
        Premise 5: All queen bees are bees.

    And then we have Harry as a bee. The conclusion is that Harry is a queen bee.

    How can we get that from the premises? Actually, we cannot. So the problem might be that we are missing a premise.

    However, note: the problem says "Conclusion to formalize". We are not to question the validity, but just formalize.

    But wait, the problem also has:

        Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.

        All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.

        All vertebrate animals have a backbone.

        All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.

        All queen bees are bees.

        Harry is a bee.

    We can deduce that:

        Harry, being a bee, does not reproduce by mating (by Premise 4).
        Therefore, Harry does not have a backbone (by contraposition of Premise 2: if he had a backbone, he would reproduce by mating, which he doesn't).
        Therefore, Harry is not a vertebrate (by Premise 3: if he were a vertebrate, he would have a backbone, which he doesn't).
        Then by Premise 1, Harry must be an invertebrate.

    But how does that lead to "Harry is a queen bee"?

    The argument must be that queen bees are a kind of bee that are invertebrates? But the premises don't say that.

    Alternatively, perhaps there is an unstated premise? But the problem gives the premises.

    Another possibility: we are to formalize the given premises and the conclusion, even if the conclusion does not follow? 
    However, the problem says "Conclusion to formalize", meaning we are to include the conclusion as a theorem.

    After re-examining the problem, note:

        The premises state that only animals with backbones reproduce by mating, and bees don't reproduce by mating, so bees are either invertebrates or ...?

        But the premises say all bees are without mating, so they cannot be vertebrates (because vertebrates have backbones and then would have to reproduce by mating). 
        So bees must be invertebrates.

        However, queen bees are bees. But we don't have any premise that says that every bee is a queen bee? 

        So why is the conclusion about Harry being a queen bee?

    There seems to be a gap. But the problem says to formalize what's given.

    IMPORTANT: We are not to fix the argument. We are only to formalize the given premises and the conclusion.

    Therefore, we will have:

        axiom Animal : Type
        axiom Harry : Animal

        -- Predicates
        axiom Invertebrate : Animal → Prop
        axiom Vertebrate : Animal → Prop
        axiom HasBackbone : Animal → Prop
        axiom ReproduceByMating : Animal → Prop
        axiom Bee : Animal → Prop
        axiom QueenBee : Animal → Prop

        -- Premises
        axiom P1 : ∀ a : Animal, Invertebrate a ∨ Vertebrate a
        axiom P2 : ∀ a : Animal, HasBackbone a → ReproduceByMating a
        axiom P3 : ∀ a : Animal, Vertebrate a → HasBackbone a
        axiom P4 : ∀ a : Animal, Bee a → ¬ ReproduceByMating a
        axiom P5 : ∀ a : Animal, QueenBee a → Bee a
        axiom P6 : Bee Harry

        -- Conclusion: Harry is a queen bee.
        theorem goal : QueenBee Harry := sorry

    However, note: the conclusion states "Harry is a queen bee", which we formalize as `QueenBee Harry`.

    But wait, is that all? The problem says "Harry is a bee", but the conclusion says he is a queen bee.

    Another interpretation: maybe the argument is that Harry is a bee and therefore not a vertebrate (as we saw). 
    However, the premises don't connect being a bee and being a queen bee beyond the fact that queen bees are a subset of bees.

    But note: the problem gives the conclusion. So we formalize it as given.

    However, there might be a mistake in the problem? Or perhaps the formalization is incomplete?

    Alternatively, we might be missing a premise about the reproductive method of queen bees? 

    But the problem says the premises are as given.

    Therefore, we stick to the above.

    Let me check the example in the problem: 
        Context: The cat is blue. If someone is blue then they are nice.
        Conclusion: The cat is nice.

    We formalized:
        axiom obj : Type
        axiom Cat : obj
        axiom Blue : obj → Prop
        axiom Nice : obj → Prop
        axiom T1 : Blue Cat
        axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Blue x → Nice x
        theorem goal : Nice Cat := sorry

    Similarly, we are using a type `Animal` and predicates on `Animal`.

 5. Let's write the code accordingly.

  However, note: Premise 1: Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates. 
      We wrote: ∀ a, Invertebrate a ∨ Vertebrate a.
      But it doesn't say that being invertebrate and vertebrate are mutually exclusive? 
      The problem says "either ... or ...", which usually means exclusive or? 
      But in logic, we don't have to enforce mutual exclusion by the axiom. We state what is given.

  So, we write the axioms as above.

  IMPORTANT: The problem says "Harry is a bee", so we have an animal Harry and he is a bee (P6).

  Conclusion: QueenBee Harry

  We are to prove the goal QueenBee Harry, but we use `sorry`.

  We do not need to include an axiom for the exclusivity of invertebrate and vertebrate because it isn't stated.

  Code:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type

axiom Harry : Animal

axiom Invertebrate : Animal → Prop
axiom Vertebrate : Animal → Prop
axiom HasBackbone : Animal → Prop
axiom ReproduceByMating : Animal → Prop
axiom Bee : Animal → Prop
axiom QueenBee : Animal → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ a : Animal, Invertebrate a ∨ Vertebrate a
axiom P2 : ∀ a : Animal, HasBackbone a → ReproduceByMating a
axiom P3 : ∀ a : Animal, Vertebrate a → HasBackbone a
axiom P4 : ∀ a : Animal, Bee a → ¬ ReproduceByMating a
axiom P5 : ∀ a : Animal, QueenBee a → Bee a
axiom P6 : Bee Harry

theorem goal : QueenBee Harry :=
  sorry
</lean>

But wait, the conclusion is that Harry is a queen bee. However, we don't have any premise that forces Harry to be a queen bee. 
That the argument is invalid is not a problem because we are only formalizing.

However, note: the problem says to formalize the premises and the conclusion.

But there is a potential issue: the premise "All queen bees are bees" (P5) is only an implication. We don't have any premise that says that bees are queen bees or anything about which bees are present.

That's the given. We are to represent the argument as stated.

This formalization is complete given the problem.


=== RESPONSE ===
Based on the provided premises and conclusion, here is the formalization in Lean 4:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Invertebrate : Animal → Prop
axiom Vertebrate : Animal → Prop
axiom HasBackbone : Animal → Prop
axiom ReproduceByMating : Animal → Prop
axiom Bee : Animal → Prop
axiom QueenBee : Animal → Prop

-- Specific individual
axiom Harry : Animal

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ a : Animal, Invertebrate a ∨ Vertebrate a
axiom P2 : ∀ a : Animal, HasBackbone a → ReproduceByMating a
axiom P3 : ∀ a : Animal, Vertebrate a → HasBackbone a
axiom P4 : ∀ a : Animal, Bee a → ¬ ReproduceByMating a
axiom P5 : ∀ a : Animal, QueenBee a → Bee a
axiom P6 : Bee Harry

-- Formalized conclusion (not provable from premises)
theorem goal : QueenBee Harry :=
  sorry
</lean>

Explanation of formalization:
1. `Animal` is the base type
2. Predicates defined:
   - `Invertebrate`: animals without backbones
   - `Vertebrate`: animals with backbones
   - `HasBackbone`: indicates backbone presence
   - `ReproduceByMating`: reproduction method
   - `Bee`: identifies bees
   - `QueenBee`: identifies queen bees
3. Premises mapped to axioms:
   - P1: Animals are invertebrates or vertebrates
   - P2: Backbone implies mating reproduction
   - P3: Vertebrates have backbones
   - P4: Bees don't reproduce by mating
   - P5: Queen bees are bees
   - P6: Harry is a bee
4. Theorem `goal` represents the conclusion about Harry being a queen bee

Note: The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises as formalized, but we represent it exactly as requested using `sorry`.


======================================================================
STAGE 2: PROVING
======================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

=== REASONING ===
We are given axioms and need to prove `QueenBee Harry`. However, note the comment: "Formalized conclusion (not provable from premises)".

Looking at the premises:
- P1: Every animal is either an invertebrate or a vertebrate.
- P2: If an animal has a backbone, then it reproduces by mating.
- P3: If an animal is a vertebrate, then it has a backbone.
- P4: If an animal is a bee, then it does not reproduce by mating.
- P5: If an animal is a queen bee, then it is a bee.
- P6: Harry is a bee.

We want to prove `QueenBee Harry`.

Note that from P5, to prove `QueenBee Harry` we would need `Bee Harry` (which we have by P6) and then something else? But P5 only says that if it's a queen bee then it's a bee; it doesn't say that every bee is a queen bee. So we cannot prove that Harry is a queen bee just because he is a bee.

Moreover, we have:
- From P6, Harry is a bee.
- From P4, since Harry is a bee, he does not reproduce by mating.
- Now, from P1, Harry is either an invertebrate or vertebrate.
  - If Harry is a vertebrate:
      Then by P3, Harry has a backbone.
      Then by P2, Harry reproduces by mating.
      But P4 says he does not. Contradiction.
  - Therefore, Harry must be an invertebrate.

But nowhere do we get any premise that links being a bee to being a queen bee beyond P5 (which is one direction). In fact, we have no premise that says that some bees are queen bees or that Harry in particular is a queen bee.

Therefore, we cannot prove `QueenBee Harry`. In fact, the system might be consistent with Harry being a bee but not a queen bee.

But note: the theorem is stated as `theorem goal : QueenBee Harry`. We are to replace `sorry` with a proof. However, from the above, we see that it is not provable.

But wait, could there be a proof by contradiction?

We have:
  Assume Harry is not a queen bee. But we don't have any premises that would cause a contradiction.

However, note that we have P6: Bee Harry. And P4: Bee Harry -> not ReproduceByMating Harry.

Then from P1, we get:
  Harry is either Invertebrate or Vertebrate.

Case 1: Vertebrate Harry.
  Then by P3, HasBackbone Harry.
  Then by P2, ReproduceByMating Harry.
  But P4 says not ReproduceByMating Harry. Contradiction.

Therefore, Harry must be Invertebrate. But that doesn't tell us he is a queen bee.

So we cannot prove QueenBee Harry.

But the task is to replace `sorry` with a valid proof term. If it's unprovable, we should state that in the answer. However, the instructions say: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

But note: the problem says "Formalized conclusion (not provable from premises)". So indeed, we cannot prove it.

However, the theorem is declared. We must provide a proof if we can, or if we can't we have to reconsider.

But let's check: is it possible to prove? We have no axiom that says every bee is a queen bee. We have P5: queen bee implies bee, but not the converse.

Moreover, we have a contradiction in the case of vertebrate bee? That implies that Harry cannot be a vertebrate. But that doesn't help for being a queen bee.

Alternatively, is there a way to derive QueenBee Harry? I don't see any.

Therefore, we recognize that the theorem as stated is not provable. So we cannot write a valid proof. Hence, we must leave `sorry`? But the task says "replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term".

However, note that the task also says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry', your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof."

But if it is unprovable, then we can't. Therefore, we must conclude with an answer of Uncertain? or False? The answer part is for the conclusion: we are to say whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain.

Actually, the answer part is not about the provability of the theorem in the system, but about the statement. The problem says: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

But note: the theorem is `QueenBee Harry`. We are to say whether it is true, false, or uncertain given the premises.

Given the premises, what do we know about `QueenBee Harry`? We cannot prove it true and we cannot prove it false? We have P6: Bee Harry. And we have no premise that says that Harry is a queen bee or that he is not.

Therefore, it is uncertain.

But wait, could the premises force Harry to be a queen bee? Let me reexamine.

Premises:
- Every animal is either invertebrate or vertebrate.
- If it has a backbone, it reproduces by mating.
- If it's vertebrate, it has a backbone.
- If it's a bee, then it does not reproduce by mating.
- QueenBee implies bee.
- Harry is a bee.

We deduced that Harry must be an invertebrate (since if he were vertebrate, we get a contradiction with P4 and the chain P3 and P2). But that's all. We have no information that every invertebrate bee is a queen bee? Or some such. And we don't have any other individual that is a queen bee.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that Harry is a queen bee. It could be that Harry is a worker bee (if that exists in our model) or a drone, but we don't have any premises that define more.

So the status of `QueenBee Harry` is uncertain: we don't have evidence it is true, nor have we proven it false.

However, we have a contradiction if we assume Harry is a vertebrate, so he is an invertebrate. But we still don't know about being queen.

Therefore, for the answer we say Uncertain.

But what about the code? We cannot provide a proof. The instructions say to replace `sorry` with a valid proof term. Since we don't have one, we must leave `sorry`? But then our code would be the same as given.

That can't be. The task says: "your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof". But if we cannot, then we must explain? However, the answer format requires the code in <lean> tags and then an answer statement.

Alternatively, note that the problem states: "Formalized conclusion (not provable from premises)". So it is intended that we cannot prove it. Therefore, in the code, we cannot replace `sorry` with a valid proof. But the problem says we must replace `sorry` with a valid proof term. This is a dilemma.

Looking back at the example, we only had a simple example that was provable. But here, the problem itself says it is not provable. So perhaps we are expected to write a proof by contradiction? But what contradiction?

Assume that Harry is not a queen bee. We don't have any contradiction: we can consistently have Harry as a non-queen bee (an invertebrate bee) that does not reproduce by mating.

Therefore, we cannot form a proof term. Hence, the only option is to leave `sorry` and then in the answer say Uncertain? But the instruction says we must replace `sorry` with a valid proof term.

Wait, there is an alternative: we might be able to derive a contradiction from the premises without the theorem? Actually, no: the premises are consistent. We have Harry as an invertebrate bee and not a queen bee? Let me check:

- Let Harry be a bee and an invertebrate. Then P1 is satisfied: Harry is invertebrate.
- P2: we don't require HasBackbone? Since Harry is invertebrate, we don't expect him to have a backbone, so P2 is vacuous for Harry? Actually, we have P2: if he has a backbone then he reproduces by mating, but if he doesn't have a backbone, then no problem. So P2 doesn't force anything for Harry.
- P3: same: if he were vertebrate then he would have a backbone, but he isn't, so nothing.
- P4: Harry is a bee and doesn't reproduce by mating -> this is satisfied because we assume he doesn't reproduce by mating? But note, we don't have a premise that says invertebrates don't have to have the property? Actually, P4 says if he is a bee then he does not reproduce by mating. So that is satisfied: we have that Harry doesn't reproduce by mating? But we do not have a positive statement about his reproduction.

However, we don't have any premise that says anything about reproduction for invertebrates? So it's consistent for Harry to not reproduce by mating (as per P4) because he's a bee.

Therefore, the premises are consistent with Harry being a non-queen-bee.

Alternatively, they are also consistent with Harry being a queen bee? Because the premises do not prevent it: we have P5 (if queen bee then bee) but if we add QueenBee Harry, then we get that Harry is a bee, which we already have. And the other premises? P4: if he is a bee then he doesn't reproduce by mating. That holds regardless.

But note: we don't have any premise that says queen bees have different reproduction? Actually, we don't. So it would be consistent as well.

Therefore, we cannot prove it.

But the task says: "Given validated Lean 4 axiom definitions and a theorem declaration with 'sorry', your task is to provide the complete code with a valid proof."

However, we don't have a proof. So we must not replace `sorry`? Or we must provide a proof that the theorem is not provable? That is meta and not in the object language.

This is a problem.

But note: the example was straightforward and provable. This one is not. However, the problem states that the conclusion is not provable. Therefore, we should not provide a proof.

Looking at the instructions: "After your code, provide your answer: ANSWER: True/False/Uncertain"

But the answer is to the conclusion: is the theorem true, false, or uncertain? The theorem is `QueenBee Harry`.

Given the premises, is it true? We don't have enough information to say it's true, but we also don't have information to say it's false. Therefore, uncertain.

And for the code, we cannot provide a proof. Therefore, we leave the `sorry` in place? But the task says to replace it.

Alternatively, we can provide a proof that uses `by` tactics to show that it is unprovable? But that's not how Lean works. We can only write a proof of the statement.

But note: we can also provide a proof of false from the assumptions and the negation of the goal? That is, by contradiction we assume ¬QueenBee Harry and derive a contradiction? Let me see:

Proof state:

  Premises (assumptions)
  ¬QueenBee Harry

We need to find a contradiction.

What do we have?
- P6: Bee Harry.
- P5: forall a, QueenBee a -> Bee a. This doesn't help in the forward direction.
- We have that Harry is a bee and not a queen bee. That doesn't conflict with any premise.

Can we derive any contradiction? The only potential contradiction we found earlier was that Harry being a vertebrate leads to a contradiction. So:

  By P1: Invertebrate Harry ∨ Vertebrate Harry.

  Case Vertebrate Harry:
      Then by P3: HasBackbone Harry -> ReproduceByMating Harry (by P2).
      But by P4: Bee Harry -> not ReproduceByMating Harry.
      Since Harry is a bee (P6), we have not ReproduceByMating Harry.
      But also, by P3: Vertebrate Harry -> HasBackbone Harry, so we have ReproduceByMating Harry.
      Contradiction.

  Therefore, Harry must be Invertebrate.

  But then no contradiction: we have:
      ¬QueenBee Harry, Bee Harry, Invertebrate Harry, and not ReproduceByMating Harry (because bee).

  And no other premises. So no contradiction.

Therefore, we cannot prove the goal by contradiction either.

We conclude that the proof of `QueenBee Harry` does not exist.

But the task requires a proof. Since we cannot provide a proof of the goal, we must not provide any proof? So the code remains as is? But then the task says to replace `sorry` with a valid proof term.

We are stuck.

Let me reread the task: "theorem goal : QueenBee Harry := sorry"

and the example output had a proof term.

Alternative: what if we use the fact that Harry must be an invertebrate? Then but that doesn't make him a queen bee.

We have to be straight: the proof does not exist.

Therefore, I think the intended answer is to provide the code with `sorry` replaced by a proof that uses tactics to try to prove it, but if it's unprovable we can't.

But note: the tactics in Lean might be able to derive the Invertebrate part, but not the queen bee.

So we can write a proof that Harry is an invertebrate? But we want QueenBee Harry.

Alternatively, we recognize that there is an error in the problem: perhaps the conclusion is not QueenBee Harry but something else? But the code says QueenBee Harry.

Therefore, after careful analysis, I must conclude that the theorem cannot be proven. So I will write an answer of Uncertain and leave the code with `sorry`, but that violates the instruction to replace `sorry`.

Or we can write a proof that leads to an error? That's not acceptable.

But another idea: we can prove anything including QueenBee Harry by using classical.choice on the fact that we have no contradiction? But that's too advanced and there's not such an axiom.

Given that, what should we do? The problem says: "Formalized conclusion (not provable from premises)". So it is intended that we recognize that we cannot prove it.

But the answer we are to provide is about the conclusion: True/False/Uncertain.

We are uncertain about whether Harry is a queen bee.

Therefore, for the code, since we cannot provide a proof, we keep the `sorry` and then answer Uncertain. But that violates the instruction to replace `sorry`.

Alternatively, can we use the axiom of choice arbitrarily? We don't have such an axiom.

Let's see what we can prove:

  we can prove that Harry is not a vertebrate.

  theorem not_vertebrate : ¬ Vertebrate Harry := by
    intro h
    have h1 : HasBackbone Harry := P3 Harry h
    have h2 : ReproduceByMating Harry := P2 Harry h1
    have h3 := P4 Harry P6
    contradiction

  But we haven't been asked for that.

  And we can prove that Harry is an invertebrate:

  theorem invertebrate : Invertebrate Harry := by
    cases P1 Harry with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr h => 
        have h1 : HasBackbone Harry := P3 Harry h
        have h2 : ReproduceByMating Harry := P2 Harry h1
        have h3 := P4 Harry P6
        contradiction

  But still, that doesn't give QueenBee Harry.

We want to prove `QueenBee Harry`, and we cannot.

So, after this long thought, I decide to:

  - Keep the original code with `sorry` for the theorem `goal`.
  - But then we are not replacing `sorry`. Alternatively, I can replace it with an incomplete proof `by admit`? But admit is not allowed.

  Or use `by` block that doesn't close the goal? Then it would be an error in Lean.

So I think the only honest answer is to leave the `sorry` and then in the answer say Uncertain.

Therefore, I will output the code as is with `sorry`, and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

But the problem says: "replace 'sorry' with a valid proof term".

Since we cannot, we must output the code with "sorry" and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

But maybe the task expects us to construct a proof that uses the premises and classical logic to derive something. Looking again:

  We have no connection between being a bee and being a queen bee beyond the subset relation (queen bees are bees). So unless we can show that Harry is a bee and that every bee is a queen bee, we can't. But we cannot show every bee is a queen bee.

Therefore, we cannot prove the goal.

So, I will provide the code unchanged and then ANSWER: Uncertain.

Maybe we are allowed to output a proof of the inversed statement? But the goal is `QueenBee Harry`.

 But the problem is: the code block we output must be valid Lean code? It is, because `sorry` is valid (for unfinished work).

 So:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Invertebrate : Animal → Prop
axiom Vertebrate : Animal → Prop
axiom HasBackbone : Animal → Prop
axiom ReproduceByMating : Animal → Prop
axiom Bee : Animal → Prop
axiom QueenBee : Animal → Prop

-- Specific individual
axiom Harry : Animal

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ a : Animal, Invertebrate a ∨ Vertebrate a
axiom P2 : ∀ a : Animal, HasBackbone a → ReproduceByMating a
axiom P3 : ∀ a : Animal, Vertebrate a → HasBackbone a
axiom P4 : ∀ a : Animal, Bee a → ¬ ReproduceByMating a
axiom P5 : ∀ a : Animal, QueenBee a → Bee a
axiom P6 : Bee Harry

-- Formalized conclusion (not provable from premises)
theorem goal : QueenBee Harry :=
  sorry
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

But the problem said "replace 'sorry'", and we didn't. However, based on the analysis we cannot. So this is the best we can do.

Actually, the problem said: "Provide the complete code with 'sorry' replaced by your proof." Since we have no proof, we cannot.

Alternatively, we can fill in a proof of `False`? But that would require deriving a contradiction from the premises and the negation of the goal? We would do:

  theorem goal : QueenBee Harry := by
    by_contra h
    -- h : ¬ QueenBee Harry
    -- but we don't get any contradiction from that.

We cannot continue.

Or we can write:

  theorem goal : QueenBee Harry := by
    let v := P1 Harry
    cases v with
    | inl i => 
        -- Harry is invertebrate
        -- but now what?
        sorry
    | inr v =>
        have backbone := P3 Harry v
        have mates := P2 Harry backbone
        have no_mates := P4 Harry P6
        contradiction
    -- we close the second case, but the first case has no proof of QueenBee Harry.

So we are stuck in the first case.

So we can only prove that if Harry is not a queen bee and we come into the first case, we have no way to prove he is a queen bee.

 Therefore, we cannot complete the proof.

So we must admit defeat.

Hence, the code remains with sorry.

ANSWER: Uncertain

I expect that's the intended answer.


=== RESPONSE ===
After analyzing the provided axioms and the theorem, it is concluded that the theorem `goal : QueenBee Harry` is not provable from the given premises. The premises allow deriving that Harry is a bee and an invertebrate but do not provide any connection between being a bee and being a queen bee beyond the fact that queen bees are bees (axiom P5). There is no premise stating that Harry is a queen bee or that all bees are queen bees. Hence, `QueenBee Harry` cannot be proven.

The complete code remains unchanged, with `sorry` as the proof term since no valid proof exists within the system:

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Invertebrate : Animal → Prop
axiom Vertebrate : Animal → Prop
axiom HasBackbone : Animal → Prop
axiom ReproduceByMating : Animal → Prop
axiom Bee : Animal → Prop
axiom QueenBee : Animal → Prop

-- Specific individual
axiom Harry : Animal

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ a : Animal, Invertebrate a ∨ Vertebrate a
axiom P2 : ∀ a : Animal, HasBackbone a → ReproduceByMating a
axiom P3 : ∀ a : Animal, Vertebrate a → HasBackbone a
axiom P4 : ∀ a : Animal, Bee a → ¬ ReproduceByMating a
axiom P5 : ∀ a : Animal, QueenBee a → Bee a
axiom P6 : Bee Harry

-- Formalized conclusion (not provable from premises)
theorem goal : QueenBee Harry :=
  sorry
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain
