axiom Bonnie : obj

-- Premises
-- 1. Club members who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ PerformsOften x → AttendSchoolEvents x ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents x

-- 2. Club members either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x → PerformsOften x ∨ InactiveDisinterestedCommunityMember x

-- 3. Club members who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ ChaperoneHighSchoolDances x → ¬ StudentAtSchool x

-- 4. Club members who are inactive and disinterested community members chaperone high school dances.
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ InactiveDisinterestedCommunityMember x → ChaperoneHighSchoolDances x

-- 5. All young children and teenagers in the club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
axiom P5 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ (YoungChild x ∨ Teenager x) ∧ WishesToFurtherAcademicOpportunities x → StudentAtSchool x

-- 6. Bonnie is in the club and either (attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student at the school)
--    or (is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student at the school).
axiom P6 : InClub Bonnie ∧ ((AttendSchoolEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents Bonnie ∧ StudentAtSchool Bonnie) ∨ (¬ (AttendSchoolEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedWithSchoolEvents Bonnie) ∧ ¬ StudentAtSchool Bonnie))

-- Conclusion to formalize: Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.
