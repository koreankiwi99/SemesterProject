-- Premises
-- If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
axiom P1 : ∀ x y : obj, Man x → Man y → Taller x y → CanBlockShooting x y

-- Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
axiom P2a : Man Michael
axiom P2b : ∀ y : obj, InMichaelClass y → Taller Michael y

-- If x is taller than y, and y is taller than z, then x is taller than z.
axiom P3 : ∀ x y z : obj, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z

-- Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
axiom P4a : Man Peter
axiom P4b : Taller Peter Michael

-- Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
axiom P5 : ∀ x : obj, ¬ JumpsWhenShooting x → CanBlockShooting Michael x

-- Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
axiom P6 : ¬ CanBlockShooting Michael Windy

-- Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.
axiom P7 : ∀ x : obj, Shooter x ∧ JumpsWhenShooting x → GreatShooter x

-- Conclusion to formalize: Peter can block Windy's shooting.

  -- From the given premises, this conclusion is not derivable.
  -- There is no information that Windy is a man or is in Michael's class,
  -- both of which would be necessary to use the available rules to conclude blocking by Peter.
  -- Hence a proof cannot be constructed from the given axioms.
  -- We provide a placeholder proof via contradiction would be required, but no contradiction is derivable.
  -- Therefore, this theorem is not provable from the premises.
