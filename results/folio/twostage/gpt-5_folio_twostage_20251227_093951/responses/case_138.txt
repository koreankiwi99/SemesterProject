  -- This goal is not derivable from the given axioms.
  -- From T3 we get an ML algorithm used to train SOTA.
  -- Using T4, that algorithm cannot be reinforcement.
  -- Using T5 and T6, that ML algorithm requires labeled data.
  -- By T2, any unsupervised algorithm does not require labeled data.
  -- Hence that ML algorithm is not unsupervised; it must be supervised via T1.
  -- However, none of the axioms assert that every algorithm used to train SOTA is ML,
  -- nor do they assert existence of any unsupervised algorithm used to train SOTA.
  -- Therefore the existential claim cannot be proven from the axioms.
  -- We provide a proof by contradiction is not possible here; thus we cannot construct such an 'a'.
  -- Since Lean requires a term, but the statement is not derivable, we end the proof with an explicit contradiction, which we cannot obtain from the axioms.
  -- As a result, this theorem is unprovable given the current axioms.
  -- We conclude that the statement is not derivable (left intentionally unprovable).
