ANSWER: False

[LEAN ERROR]: Tactic `cases` failed: major premise type is not an inductive type
  False → ?m.6

Explanation: the `cases` tactic is for constructor-based reasoning as well as for applying custom cases principles with a 'using' clause or a registered '@[cases_eliminator]' theorem. The above type neither is an inductive type nor has a registered theorem.
