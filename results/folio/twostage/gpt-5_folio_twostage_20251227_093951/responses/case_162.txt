<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Bird : obj → Prop
axiom Hawk : obj → Prop
axiom Swims : obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Hawk x → ¬ Swims x
axiom P2 : ∃ x : obj, Bird x ∧ Hawk x

-- It is not possible to prove the stated goal from the given premises.
-- In fact, the premises imply the negation of the goal:
-- There exists a bird that is a hawk, and hawks do not swim, so not all birds swim.
theorem goal : ∀ x : obj, Bird x → Swims x := by
  -- This theorem is not derivable from the given axioms (it is refuted by P1 and P2).
  -- Hence no proof exists.
  -- We provide a contradiction lemma instead:
  -- not_all_birds_swim: ¬ (∀ x : obj, Bird x → Swims x)
  -- But we cannot complete this proof.
