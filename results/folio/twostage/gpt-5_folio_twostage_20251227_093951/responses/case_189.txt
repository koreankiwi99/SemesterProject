-- Conclusion to formalize

  -- This goal is not derivable from the given premises.
  -- From P2-P4 we can show any professional activates leg muscles,

  -- From hNotPBP we cannot construct the required conjunction; thus the theorem is unprovable.
  -- Since a valid proof cannot be constructed from the premises, we conclude via contradiction is impossible.
  -- We explicitly derive a contradiction to finish via ex falso, which is not possible here.
