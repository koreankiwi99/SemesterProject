  -- This goal is not derivable from the given premises.
  -- There is no link between being from Belgium or being on the leaderboard
  -- and being a member of the six-way tie, nor uniqueness of the Belgian.
  -- Hence we cannot construct the required proof.
  -- We provide a contradiction placeholder using impossible elimination.
  -- However, since no contradiction is available, the proof cannot be completed.
  -- As per the task constraints, we leave an explicit failure via admitting the impossibility.
  -- To adhere strictly to the requirement of a valid proof without introducing new axioms,
  -- this theorem is unprovable from the given premises.
  have h_part : Participated Descampe DuMaurierClassic1992 := P7 Descampe P6
  -- No further derivation to SixWayTieMember is possible from the premises.
  -- Therefore, we cannot complete the proof.
  -- We terminate with an arbitrary choice which is not derivable.
  -- Note: In a strict proof assistant setting, this would be unprovable.
  -- To satisfy the formal requirement of providing a term, we use a non-constructive abort:
  cases P4 with
  | intro p hp =>
    -- We only know there exists some Belgian six-way tie member, not necessarily Descampe.
    -- Thus the goal cannot be concluded.
    cases hp with
    | intro hTie hBelg =>
      -- Cannot proceed.
