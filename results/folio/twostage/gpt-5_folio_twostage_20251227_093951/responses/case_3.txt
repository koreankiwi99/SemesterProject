-- Premises
-- 1. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ SchedulesMeetingsWithCustomers x → InCompanyToday x

-- 2. Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, LunchInCompany x → SchedulesMeetingsWithCustomers x

-- 3. Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → (LunchInCompany x ∨ LunchAtHome x)

-- 4. If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → RemoteFromHome x

-- 5. All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom P5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → RemoteFromHome x

-- 6. No managers work remotely from home.
axiom P6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬ RemoteFromHome x

-- 7. James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.
axiom P7 : InCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Conclusion to formalize: James has lunch in the company.

  -- James is an Employee, which is required to use P3 and P4,

  -- Therefore, the goal is not derivable from the provided axioms.
