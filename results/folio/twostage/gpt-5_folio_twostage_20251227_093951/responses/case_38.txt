ANSWER: False

[LEAN ERROR]: Tactic `cases` failed: major premise type is not an inductive type
  Conductor Beethoven

Explanation: the `cases` tactic is for constructor-based reasoning as well as for applying custom cases principles with a 'using' clause or a registered '@[cases_eliminator]' theorem. The above type neither is an inductive type nor has a registered theorem.

h : Conductor Beethoven
⊢ ¬Conductor Beethoven

ANSWER: False

[LEAN ERROR]: Function expected at
  hc
but this term has type
  Conductor Beethoven

Note: Expected a function because this term is being applied to the argument
