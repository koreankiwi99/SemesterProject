-- Conclusion to formalize: No pets are cats
-- This statement does not follow from the given premises, so it is not provable.
theorem goal : ∀ x : obj, Pet x → ¬ Cat x := by
  -- This theorem is not derivable from A1 and A2.
  -- From A2 we only know there exists at least one pet that is not a mammal (hence not a cat by A1),
  -- but this does not rule out the existence of some other pet that is a cat.
  -- Therefore, the universal claim cannot be proven from the given premises.
  -- No proof is possible without additional assumptions.
