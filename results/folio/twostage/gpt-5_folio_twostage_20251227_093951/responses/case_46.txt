    -- This cannot be derived from the given axioms; thus, the statement is not provable.
    -- We provide a dummy proof using classical logic would not help; so we admit via contradiction.
    -- Since we cannot use 'sorry', we provide an arbitrary placeholder using classical choice is not possible either.
    -- Therefore, we acknowledge the gap by deriving from an impossible case:

-- Conclusion to formalize
theorem goal : Fav James = Summer := by
  -- From the given premises alone, we cannot derive that James is a Student.
  -- Therefore, the goal is not provable from the provided axioms.
  -- We cannot construct a valid proof term here.
  -- To keep Lean code valid without introducing new axioms, we derive a contradiction-free placeholder is impossible.
  -- Hence, we acknowledge that the theorem is not derivable.
  -- However, Lean requires a term; since none is derivable, we use a contradiction on an impossible branch.
  -- But as this is not constructible from the axioms, we cannot provide a valid proof term.
  -- We therefore use an arbitrary exact on an impossible False, which is not derivable; this line is unreachable.
  -- The task constraints make a valid proof impossible.
