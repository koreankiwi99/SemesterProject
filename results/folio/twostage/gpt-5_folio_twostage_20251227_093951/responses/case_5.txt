  -- This statement is not derivable from the given axioms.
  -- In particular, from Manager James we can derive ¬ RemoteFromHome James (via P6),
  -- but we have no way to derive ¬ LunchAtHome James. Similarly, from LunchAtHome James
  -- or RemoteFromHome James we cannot derive ¬ InOtherCountries James without further premises
  -- (e.g., that Managers are Employees, or that LunchAtHome implies Employee).
  -- Hence, the claimed implications cannot be proven from the provided axioms.
  -- We therefore cannot construct a proof term here.
