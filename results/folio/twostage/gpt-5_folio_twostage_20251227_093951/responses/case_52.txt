-- Conclusion to formalize
theorem goal : InFamily German Romance := by
  -- From the given axioms, there is no way to derive that German is in the Romance family.
  -- The premises only give that members of a language family are related, not that being related implies membership.
  -- Therefore, this statement is not derivable from the provided axioms.
