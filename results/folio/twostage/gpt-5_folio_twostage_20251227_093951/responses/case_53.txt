axiom RomanceFam : Family

-- Premise: All Romance languages are Indo-European languages.
axiom P1 : ∀ x : Lang, Romance x → IndoEuropean x

-- Premise: Romance languages are a language family (captured by a specific family whose members are exactly the Romance languages).
axiom P2a : LanguageFamily RomanceFam
axiom P2b : ∀ x : Lang, Romance x ↔ InFamily x RomanceFam

-- Premise: All languages within a language family are related to each other.
axiom P3 : ∀ f : Family, LanguageFamily f → ∀ x y : Lang, InFamily x f → InFamily y f → Related x y

-- Premise: French and Spanish are both Romance languages.
axiom P4a : Romance French
