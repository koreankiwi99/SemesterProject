-- Premise: An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, InternationalUS x → F1Visa x → (WantsWorkUS x → (NeedsApplyCPT x ∨ NeedsApplyOPT x))

-- Premise: Mike is an international student.

  -- From P1 and P3, we only get F1Visa Mike ∨ J1Visa Mike, and there is no way to rule out F1Visa Mike
  -- with the given premises. Hence the statement is not derivable.
  -- We cannot complete this proof from the provided axioms.
  -- However, Lean requires a term; since the goal is not derivable, we leave this as an impossible branch.
  -- To comply with the requirement to avoid 'sorry', this proof cannot be constructed.
  -- Therefore, no valid Lean proof exists from the given axioms.
