  -- This statement is not derivable from the given premises.
  -- From P3 we have GainsKnowledge → Smarter, but not the converse.
  -- There is no premise connecting Smarter to Reads or directly to GainsKnowledge.
  -- Hence, we cannot construct GainsKnowledge p from Smarter p in general.
  -- We therefore provide a contradiction-driven placeholder which cannot be filled from the axioms.
  intro p hp hs
  -- We can prove GainsKnowledge for Harry specifically:
  have gHarry : GainsKnowledge Harry := P2 Harry Walden P4 P5 P6
  -- But there is no way to generalize this to arbitrary p from Smarter p.
  -- Since the goal is unprovable from the given axioms, we must abort.

</lean>
ANSWER: False

[LEAN ERROR]: Unknown constant `False.intro?`
Tactic `cases` failed: major premise type is not an inductive type
  ?m.10

Explanation: the `cases` tactic is for constructor-based reasoning as well as for applying custom cases principles with a 'using' clause or a registered '@[cases_eliminator]' theorem. The above type neither is an inductive type nor has a registered theorem.
