Story ID: 171
Example ID: 493
Premises: Some fish stings people.
Stonefish is a fish.
Stonefish stings when stepped on. 
If a stonefish stings someone and they are not treated, it can cause death to them.
To treat stonefish stings, apply heat to the affected area or use an antivenom.
Conclusion: If you step on a stonefish and apply heat to the affected area, it can cause death to you.
