Story ID: 180
Example ID: 520
Premises: Sam is doing a project.
A project is written either in C++ or Python.
If Sam does a project written in Python, he will not use a Mac.
Sam is using a Mac.
If Sam uses a Mac, he will play a song.
If a song is not titled "Perfect," Sam will never play it.
Conclusion: If a song is titled "Perfect", Sam will play it.
