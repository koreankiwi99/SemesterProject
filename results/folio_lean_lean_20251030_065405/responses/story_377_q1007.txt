Example ID: 1007
Premises: Everything is either outside the solar system or in the solar system. 
Nothing outside the solar system has the Sun as its star.
Everything in the solar system is gravitationally bound by the Sun.
No planets gravitationally bound by the Sun are rogue planets. 
All orphan planets are rogue planets.
If PSO J318.5−22 is not both a rogue planet and a planet gravitationally bound by the Sun, then it is a rogue planet.
Conclusion: If PSO J318.5−22 is an orphan planet or it does not have the Sun as the star, or both, then PSO J318.5−22 neither is an orphan planet nor does it have the Sun as the star.
