Example ID: 1175
Premises: Some monitors made by LG have a type-c port.
Monitors that have a type-c port were not made before 2010.
All monitors in the library are made before 2010. 
The L-2021 monitor is either used in the library or has a type-c port.
The L-2021 monitor is either both produced before 2010 and made by LG, or neither is true.
Conclusion: The L-2021 monitor either has a type-c port or is produced by LG.
