Premises: All customers in James' family who subscribe to AMC A-List are eligible to watch three movies every week without any additional fees. 
Some of the customers in James' family go to the cinema every week.
Customers in James' family subscribe to AMC A-List or HBO service. 
Customers in James' family who prefer TV series will not watch TV series in cinemas.
All customers in James' family who subscribe to HBO services prefer TV series to movies. 
Lily is in James' family; she watches TV series in cinemas. 
Conclusion: If Lily is available to watch 3 movies every week without any additional fees and she watches TV series in cinemas, then she goes to cinemas every week and prefers TV series more.
