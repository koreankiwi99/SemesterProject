Example ID: 1386
Premises: All social media applications containing chat features are software. 
All social media applications that allow users to send messages to each other have chat features. 
All social media applications have chat features or video features. 
All social media applications that have video features allow users to upload videos. 
All software that is social media applications are computer programs. 
All social media applications that have high engagement metrics are addictive. 
If a social media application is addictive, then it is not ideal for preteens. 
TikTok is a social media application, and it is not ideal for preteens. 
Conclusion: TikTok is either ideal for preteens or a computer program.
