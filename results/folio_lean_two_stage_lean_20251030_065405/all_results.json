If you can prove the theorem, give me True at the end of the answer. If you can prove the negation of the theorem, write False at the end of the answer. If you can neither prove the original theorem nor the negation of the theorem, please give me Unknown at the end of the answer.\n\nCRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax.\n\nFORMATTING REQUIREMENT:\nYou must wrap ALL your Lean code in <lean></lean> tags like this:\n\n<lean>\naxiom Person : Type\naxiom Alice : Person\naxiom Happy : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom premise : Happy Alice\ntheorem goal : Happy Alice := by\n  exact premise\n</lean>\n\nDo not include any Lean code outside these tags.\n\nIMPORTANT: After your Lean analysis, provide your final answer in exactly this format:\nANSWER: True/False/Unknown"

(Fish \u2192 \u00acPlant)\n- Everything displayed in the collection is either a plant or an animal. (Displayed \u2192 Plant \u2228 Animal)\n- All multicellular animals are not bacteria. (Multicellular \u2227 Animal \u2192 \u00acBacteria)\n- All animals displayed in the collection are multicellular. (Displayed \u2227 Animal \u2192 Multicellular)\n- A sea eel is displayed in the collection. (Displayed(SeaEel))\n- The sea eel is an eel or an animal or not a plant. (Eel(SeaEel) \u2228 Animal(SeaEel) \u2228 \u00acPlant(SeaEel))\n\nGoal: The sea eel is an eel. (Eel(SeaEel))\n\nReasoning:\n- From \u201cEel \u2192 Fish\u201d and \u201cFish \u2192 \u00acPlant,\u201d if the sea eel is an eel, then it is not a plant. This is a derived fact: Eel(SeaEel) \u2192 \u00acPlant(SeaEel).\n- From \u201cDisplayed \u2192 Plant \u2228 Animal\u201d and the fact that the sea eel is displayed, we get Plant(SeaEel) \u2228 Animal(SeaEel).\n- If we assume \u00acPlant(SeaEel), then combining with Plant(SeaEel) \u2228 Animal(SeaEel) we can conclude Animal(SeaEel).\n- The disjunction \u201cEel(SeaEel) \u2228 Animal(SeaEel) \u2228 \u00acPlant(SeaEel)\u201d gives three cases:\n  - If Eel(SeaEel), then the goal is satisfied.\n  - If Animal(SeaEel), we do not get Eel(SeaEel) from the other premises.\n  - If \u00acPlant(SeaEel), then from Displayed and Plant \u2228 Animal, we can infer Animal(SeaEel), but still not Eel(SeaEel).\n\nThus, the premises allow the possibilities that the sea eel is merely an animal (and not necessarily an eel), or that it is not a plant which, together with being displayed, implies it is an animal. There is no way to eliminate these alternative disjuncts to force Eel(SeaEel). Therefore, the conclusion \u201cThe sea eel is an eel\u201d does not follow from the given premises.\n\nSTAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and attempt\n\n<lean>\nuniverse u\naxiom Entity : Type u\n\naxiom Eel : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Fish : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Plant : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Animal : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Multicellular : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Bacteria : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Displayed : Entity \u2192 Prop\n\naxiom SeaEel : Entity\n\n-- Premises\naxiom all_eels_are_fish : \u2200 x, Eel x \u2192 Fish x\naxiom no_fish_are_plants : \u2200 x, Fish x \u2192 \u00ac Plant x\naxiom displayed_is_plant_or_animal : \u2200 x, Displayed x \u2192 Plant x \u2228 Animal x\naxiom all_multicellular_animals_not_bacteria : \u2200 x, (Multicellular x \u2227 Animal x) \u2192 \u00ac Bacteria x\naxiom displayed_animals_are_multicellular : \u2200 x, (Displayed x \u2227 Animal x) \u2192 Multicellular x\naxiom sea_eel_is_displayed : Displayed SeaEel\naxiom sea_eel_eel_or_animal_or_not_plant : Eel SeaEel \u2228 Animal SeaEel \u2228 \u00ac Plant SeaEel\n\n-- Some derived lemmas\nlemma not_plant_of_eel {x : Entity} (hx : Eel x) : \u00ac Plant x := by\n  have hf : Fish x := all_eels_are_fish x hx\n  exact no_fish_are_plants x hf\n\nlemma animal_of_displayed_and_not_plant {x : Entity} (hd : Displayed x) (hnp : \u00ac Plant x) : Animal x := by\n  have h := displayed_is_plant_or_animal x hd\n  cases h with\n  | inl hp => exact False.elim (hnp hp)\n  | inr ha => exact ha\n\nlemma eel_or_animal_for_sea_eel : Eel SeaEel \u2228 Animal SeaEel := by\n  have h := sea_eel_eel_or_animal_or_not_plant\n  cases h with\n  | inl he => exact Or.inl he\n  | inr h2 =>\n    cases h2 with\n    | inl ha => exact Or.inr ha\n    | inr hnp =>\n      have ha : Animal SeaEel := animal_of_displayed_and_not_plant sea_eel_is_displayed hnp\n      exact Or.inr ha\n\n-- Target statement (not derivable from the given premises)\ntheorem sea_eel_is_an_eel : Eel SeaEel := by\n  -- This does not follow from the premises; cannot be proven.\n  sorry\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: Unknown",

(Eel(SeaEel) \u2228 Animal(SeaEel) \u2228 \u00acPlant(SeaEel))\n\nGoal: The sea eel is an eel. (Eel(SeaEel))\n\nReasoning:\n- From \u201cEel \u2192 Fish\u201d and \u201cFish \u2192 \u00acPlant,\u201d if the sea eel is an eel, then it is not a plant. This is a derived fact: Eel(SeaEel) \u2192 \u00acPlant(SeaEel).\n- From \u201cDisplayed \u2192 Plant \u2228 Animal\u201d and the fact that the sea eel is displayed, we get Plant(SeaEel) \u2228 Animal(SeaEel).\n- If we assume \u00acPlant(SeaEel), then combining with Plant(SeaEel) \u2228 Animal(SeaEel) we can conclude Animal(SeaEel).\n- The disjunction \u201cEel(SeaEel) \u2228 Animal(SeaEel) \u2228 \u00acPlant(SeaEel)\u201d gives three cases:\n  - If Eel(SeaEel), then the goal is satisfied.\n  - If Animal(SeaEel), we do not get Eel(SeaEel) from the other premises.\n  - If \u00acPlant(SeaEel), then from Displayed and Plant \u2228 Animal, we can infer Animal(SeaEel), but still not Eel(SeaEel).\n\nThus, the premises allow the possibilities that the sea eel is merely an animal (and not necessarily an eel), or that it is not a plant which, together with being displayed, implies it is an animal. There is no way to eliminate these alternative disjuncts to force Eel(SeaEel). Therefore, the conclusion \u201cThe sea eel is an eel\u201d does not follow from the given premises.\n\nSTAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and attempt\n\n<lean>\nuniverse u\naxiom Entity : Type u\n\naxiom Eel : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Fish : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Plant : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Animal : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Multicellular : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Bacteria : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Displayed : Entity \u2192 Prop\n\naxiom SeaEel : Entity\n\n-- Premises\naxiom all_eels_are_fish : \u2200 x, Eel x \u2192 Fish x\naxiom no_fish_are_plants : \u2200 x, Fish x \u2192 \u00ac Plant x\naxiom displayed_is_plant_or_animal : \u2200 x, Displayed x \u2192 Plant x \u2228 Animal x\naxiom all_multicellular_animals_not_bacteria : \u2200 x, (Multicellular x \u2227 Animal x) \u2192 \u00ac Bacteria x\naxiom displayed_animals_are_multicellular : \u2200 x, (Displayed x \u2227 Animal x) \u2192 Multicellular x\naxiom sea_eel_is_displayed : Displayed SeaEel\naxiom sea_eel_eel_or_animal_or_not_plant : Eel SeaEel \u2228 Animal SeaEel \u2228 \u00ac Plant SeaEel\n\n-- Some derived lemmas\nlemma not_plant_of_eel {x : Entity} (hx : Eel x) : \u00ac Plant x := by\n  have hf : Fish x := all_eels_are_fish x hx\n  exact no_fish_are_plants x hf\n\nlemma animal_of_displayed_and_not_plant {x : Entity} (hd : Displayed x) (hnp : \u00ac Plant x) : Animal x := by\n  have h := displayed_is_plant_or_animal x hd\n  cases h with\n  | inl hp => exact False.elim (hnp hp)\n  | inr ha => exact ha\n\nlemma eel_or_animal_for_sea_eel : Eel SeaEel \u2228 Animal SeaEel := by\n  have h := sea_eel_eel_or_animal_or_not_plant\n  cases h with\n  | inl he => exact Or.inl he\n  | inr h2 =>\n    cases h2 with\n    | inl ha => exact Or.inr ha\n    | inr hnp =>\n      have ha : Animal SeaEel := animal_of_displayed_and_not_plant sea_eel_is_displayed hnp\n      exact Or.inr ha\n\n-- Target statement (not derivable from the given premises)\ntheorem sea_eel_is_an_eel : Eel SeaEel := by\n  -- This does not follow from the premises; cannot be proven.\n  sorry\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: Unknown"

Combining with the previous, Plant implies \u00acEel (since Plant \u2227 Eel would give Fish and \u00acFish).\n- Using (7), Eel \u2228 Animal \u2228 \u00acPlant. Given Plant is true, \u00acPlant is false; given Plant implies \u00acEel, Eel is false; hence the disjunction forces Animal to be true: Animal(SeaEel).\n- As in Case 1, from Animal and (6),(5) we get Multicellular; then from (4) we get \u00acBacteria(SeaEel).\n\nThus in both cases we conclude \u00acBacteria(SeaEel).

During the translation, please pay close attention to the predicates and entities. There is an additional requirement: I also want you to try to prove the theorem you translated to Lean. If you can prove the theorem, give me True at the end of the answer. If you can prove the negation of the theorem, write False at the end of the answer. If you can neither prove the original theorem nor the negation of the theorem, please give me Unknown at the end of the answer.\n\nCRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax.\n\nFORMATTING REQUIREMENT:\nYou must wrap ALL your Lean code in <lean></lean> tags like this:\n\n<lean>\naxiom Person : Type\naxiom Alice : Person\naxiom Happy : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom premise : Happy Alice\ntheorem goal : Happy Alice := by\n  exact premise\n</lean>\n\nDo not include any Lean code outside these tags.\n\nIMPORTANT: After your Lean analysis, provide your final answer in exactly this format:\nANSWER: True/False/Unknown"

Combining with the previous, Plant implies \u00acEel (since Plant \u2227 Eel would give Fish and \u00acFish).\n- Using (7), Eel \u2228 Animal \u2228 \u00acPlant. Given Plant is true, \u00acPlant is false; given Plant implies \u00acEel, Eel is false; hence the disjunction forces Animal to be true: Animal(SeaEel).\n- As in Case 1, from Animal and (6),(5) we get Multicellular; then from (4) we get \u00acBacteria(SeaEel).\n\nThus in both cases we conclude \u00acBacteria(SeaEel).

So if s is a fish, then s is not a plant.\n- Everything displayed is either a plant or an animal. Since s is displayed, s is a plant or s is an animal.\n- All multicellular animals are not bacteria. If s is an animal and multicellular, then s is not bacteria.\n- All displayed animals are multicellular. If s is an animal and displayed, then s is multicellular.\n- The sea eel s is displayed.\n- s is an eel or s is an animal or s is not a plant.\n\nGoal: s is multicellular or s is bacteria.\n\nReasoning:\n1) From display, we have: Plant s \u2228 Animal s.\n\n2) From \"The sea eel is an eel or an animal or not a plant\", we do a case split:\n   - Case A: s is an animal. Then since s is displayed, by \"All displayed animals are multicellular,\" s is multicellular. Thus the disjunction (multicellular s \u2228 bacteria s) holds.\n   - Case B: s is an eel. Then by \"All eels are fish,\" s is a fish. By \"No fish are plants,\" s is not a plant. Together with \"Displayed implies Plant or Animal,\" and since Plant s is false, we must have Animal s. Then as in Case A, s is multicellular, and the disjunction holds.\n   - Case C: s is not a plant. Together with \"Displayed implies Plant or Animal,\" and since Plant s is false, we again conclude Animal s. Then as in Case A, s is multicellular, and the disjunction holds.\n\nTherefore in all cases, s is an animal, hence (using displayed) s is multicellular. Therefore the conclusion \"s is multicellular or s is bacteria\" is true (the left disjunct holds). In fact, we can also infer s is not bacteria from \"All multicellular animals are not bacteria,\" but that is not needed for the disjunction.\n\nSTAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and proof\n\n<lean>\naxiom Entity : Type\naxiom SeaEel : Entity\n\naxiom Eel : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Fish : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Plant : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Animal : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Multicellular : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Bacteria : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Displayed : Entity \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom all_eels_are_fish : \u2200 x, Eel x \u2192 Fish x\naxiom no_fish_are_plants : \u2200 x, Fish x \u2192 \u00ac Plant x\naxiom displayed_is_plant_or_animal : \u2200 x, Displayed x \u2192 Plant x \u2228 Animal x\naxiom multicellular_animals_not_bacteria : \u2200 x, Animal x \u2227 Multicellular x \u2192 \u00ac Bacteria x\naxiom displayed_animals_are_multicellular : \u2200 x, Animal x \u2227 Displayed x \u2192 Multicellular x\naxiom sea_eel_displayed : Displayed SeaEel\naxiom sea_eel_eel_or_animal_or_notplant : Eel SeaEel \u2228 Animal SeaEel \u2228 \u00ac Plant SeaEel\n\ntheorem sea_eel_multicellular_or_bacteria : Multicellular SeaEel \u2228 Bacteria SeaEel := by\n  -- First, show the sea eel is an animal.\n  have sea_eel_is_animal : Animal SeaEel := by\n    -- Use the given trichotomy: eel \u2228 animal \u2228 \u00acplant\n    cases sea_eel_eel_or_animal_or_notplant with\n    | inl eel_or_animal =>\n        cases eel_or_animal with\n        | inl hEel =>\n            -- From eel -> fish -> \u00acplant\n            have hFish : Fish SeaEel := all_eels_are_fish SeaEel hEel\n            have hNotPlant : \u00ac Plant SeaEel := no_fish_are_plants SeaEel hFish\n            -- Displayed implies plant \u2228 animal; with \u00acplant, deduce animal\n            have hPA : Plant SeaEel \u2228 Animal SeaEel :=\n              displayed_is_plant_or_animal SeaEel sea_eel_displayed\n            cases hPA with\n            | inl hPlant => exact False.elim (hNotPlant hPlant)\n            | inr hAnimal => exact hAnimal\n        | inr hAnimal => exact hAnimal\n    | inr hNotPlant =>\n        -- From displayed implies plant \u2228 animal; with \u00acplant, deduce animal\n        have hPA : Plant SeaEel \u2228 Animal SeaEel :=\n          displayed_is_plant_or_animal SeaEel sea_eel_displayed\n        cases hPA with\n        | inl hPlant => exact False.elim (hNotPlant hPlant)\n        | inr hAnimal => exact hAnimal\n  -- From animal \u2227 displayed, deduce multicellular\n  have hMulti : Multicellular SeaEel :=\n    displayed_animals_are_multicellular SeaEel \u27e8sea_eel_is_animal, sea_eel_displayed\u27e9\n  -- Conclude the disjunction\n  exact Or.inl hMulti\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: True",

So if s is a fish, then s is not a plant.\n- Everything displayed is either a plant or an animal. Since s is displayed, s is a plant or s is an animal.\n- All multicellular animals are not bacteria. If s is an animal and multicellular, then s is not bacteria.\n- All displayed animals are multicellular. If s is an animal and displayed, then s is multicellular.\n- The sea eel s is displayed.\n- s is an eel or s is an animal or s is not a plant.\n\nGoal: s is multicellular or s is bacteria.\n\nReasoning:\n1) From display, we have: Plant s \u2228 Animal s.\n\n2) From \"The sea eel is an eel or an animal or not a plant\", we do a case split:\n   - Case A: s is an animal. Then since s is displayed, by \"All displayed animals are multicellular,\" s is multicellular. Thus the disjunction (multicellular s \u2228 bacteria s) holds.\n   - Case B: s is an eel. Then by \"All eels are fish,\" s is a fish. By \"No fish are plants,\" s is not a plant. Together with \"Displayed implies Plant or Animal,\" and since Plant s is false, we must have Animal s. Then as in Case A, s is multicellular, and the disjunction holds.\n   - Case C: s is not a plant. Together with \"Displayed implies Plant or Animal,\" and since Plant s is false, we again conclude Animal s. Then as in Case A, s is multicellular, and the disjunction holds.\n\nTherefore in all cases, s is an animal, hence (using displayed) s is multicellular. Therefore the conclusion \"s is multicellular or s is bacteria\" is true (the left disjunct holds). In fact, we can also infer s is not bacteria from \"All multicellular animals are not bacteria,\" but that is not needed for the disjunction.\n\nSTAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and proof\n\n<lean>\naxiom Entity : Type\naxiom SeaEel : Entity\n\naxiom Eel : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Fish : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Plant : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Animal : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Multicellular : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Bacteria : Entity \u2192 Prop\naxiom Displayed : Entity \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom all_eels_are_fish : \u2200 x, Eel x \u2192 Fish x\naxiom no_fish_are_plants : \u2200 x, Fish x \u2192 \u00ac Plant x\naxiom displayed_is_plant_or_animal : \u2200 x, Displayed x \u2192 Plant x \u2228 Animal x\naxiom multicellular_animals_not_bacteria : \u2200 x, Animal x \u2227 Multicellular x \u2192 \u00ac Bacteria x\naxiom displayed_animals_are_multicellular : \u2200 x, Animal x \u2227 Displayed x \u2192 Multicellular x\naxiom sea_eel_displayed : Displayed SeaEel\naxiom sea_eel_eel_or_animal_or_notplant : Eel SeaEel \u2228 Animal SeaEel \u2228 \u00ac Plant SeaEel\n\ntheorem sea_eel_multicellular_or_bacteria : Multicellular SeaEel \u2228 Bacteria SeaEel := by\n  -- First, show the sea eel is an animal.\n  have sea_eel_is_animal : Animal SeaEel := by\n    -- Use the given trichotomy: eel \u2228 animal \u2228 \u00acplant\n    cases sea_eel_eel_or_animal_or_notplant with\n    | inl eel_or_animal =>\n        cases eel_or_animal with\n        | inl hEel =>\n            -- From eel -> fish -> \u00acplant\n            have hFish : Fish SeaEel := all_eels_are_fish SeaEel hEel\n            have hNotPlant : \u00ac Plant SeaEel := no_fish_are_plants SeaEel hFish\n            -- Displayed implies plant \u2228 animal; with \u00acplant, deduce animal\n            have hPA : Plant SeaEel \u2228 Animal SeaEel :=\n              displayed_is_plant_or_animal SeaEel sea_eel_displayed\n            cases hPA with\n            | inl hPlant => exact False.elim (hNotPlant hPlant)\n            | inr hAnimal => exact hAnimal\n        | inr hAnimal => exact hAnimal\n    | inr hNotPlant =>\n        -- From displayed implies plant \u2228 animal; with \u00acplant, deduce animal\n        have hPA : Plant SeaEel \u2228 Animal SeaEel :=\n          displayed_is_plant_or_animal SeaEel sea_eel_displayed\n        cases hPA with\n        | inl hPlant => exact False.elim (hNotPlant hPlant)\n        | inr hAnimal => exact hAnimal\n  -- From animal \u2227 displayed, deduce multicellular\n  have hMulti : Multicellular SeaEel :=\n    displayed_animals_are_multicellular SeaEel \u27e8sea_eel_is_animal, sea_eel_displayed\u27e9\n  -- Conclude the disjunction\n  exact Or.inl hMulti\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: True"

Reason: Premise (4) is InFamily(x) \u2227 PreferTV(x) \u2192 \u00acWatchSeriesCinema(x). Using modus tollens in a constructive way: from WatchSeriesCinema(Lily), it follows that PreferTV(Lily) cannot hold, because PreferTV(Lily) together with InFamily(Lily) would imply \u00acWatchSeriesCinema(Lily), contradicting (6). Formally, (PreferTV \u2192 \u00acWatch) yields (Watch \u2192 \u00acPrefer).\n- From (5): If Lily were an HBO subscriber, then PreferTV(Lily) would hold. But we have \u00acPreferTV(Lily), so Lily cannot be an HBO subscriber. Thus \u00acSubHBO(Lily).\n- From (3): Since Lily is in the family, SubAMC(Lily) \u2228 SubHBO(Lily). Using the disjunction and \u00acSubHBO(Lily), we conclude SubAMC(Lily).\n- From (1) and SubAMC(Lily) plus InFamily(Lily): Lily is EligibleThreeMoviesWeekly(Lily).\n\nNone of these entail GoesCinemaWeekly(Lily). Premise (2) states that some family member goes weekly, not necessarily Lily. Premise (1) only grants eligibility, not actual attendance.

Reason: Premise (4) is InFamily(x) \u2227 PreferTV(x) \u2192 \u00acWatchSeriesCinema(x). Using modus tollens in a constructive way: from WatchSeriesCinema(Lily), it follows that PreferTV(Lily) cannot hold, because PreferTV(Lily) together with InFamily(Lily) would imply \u00acWatchSeriesCinema(Lily), contradicting (6). Formally, (PreferTV \u2192 \u00acWatch) yields (Watch \u2192 \u00acPrefer).\n- From (5): If Lily were an HBO subscriber, then PreferTV(Lily) would hold. But we have \u00acPreferTV(Lily), so Lily cannot be an HBO subscriber. Thus \u00acSubHBO(Lily).\n- From (3): Since Lily is in the family, SubAMC(Lily) \u2228 SubHBO(Lily). Using the disjunction and \u00acSubHBO(Lily), we conclude SubAMC(Lily).\n- From (1) and SubAMC(Lily) plus InFamily(Lily): Lily is EligibleThreeMoviesWeekly(Lily).\n\nNone of these entail GoesCinemaWeekly(Lily). Premise (2) states that some family member goes weekly, not necessarily Lily. Premise (1) only grants eligibility, not actual attendance.

By contrapositive, \u00acPreferTV(Lily) implies \u00acHBO(Lily) (using InFamily(Lily) from (6)).\n- From (3) and the previous step: InFamily(Lily) implies AMC(Lily) \u2228 HBO(Lily). Given \u00acHBO(Lily), by disjunctive syllogism, AMC(Lily).\n- From (1) and the previous step: InFamily(Lily) and AMC(Lily) imply Eligible(Lily). This is about eligibility to watch three movies weekly, not actual attendance.\n\nAbout the goal \u00acGoWeekly(Lily):\n- Premise (2) only says some family member goes weekly, not necessarily Lily.\n- No premise connects WatchTVInCinema or eligibility or AMC/HBO status to GoWeekly directly.\n- Thus, neither \u00acGoWeekly(Lily) nor GoWeekly(Lily) follows from the given premises. The statement \u201cLily does not go to cinemas every week\u201d is not entailed, nor is its negation, given the information.\n\nConclusion: The claim cannot be proven or refuted from the premises.\n\nSTAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and attempted derivations\n\n<lean>\naxiom Person : Type\naxiom Lily : Person\n\naxiom InFamily : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom AMC : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom HBO : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom Eligible : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom GoWeekly : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom PreferTV : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom WatchTVInCinema : Person \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom premise1 : \u2200 x : Person, InFamily x \u2227 AMC x \u2192 Eligible x\naxiom premise2 : \u2203 x : Person, InFamily x \u2227 GoWeekly x\naxiom premise3 : \u2200 x : Person, InFamily x \u2192 AMC x \u2228 HBO x\naxiom premise4 : \u2200 x : Person, InFamily x \u2227 PreferTV x \u2192 \u00ac WatchTVInCinema x\naxiom premise5 : \u2200 x : Person, InFamily x \u2227 HBO x \u2192 PreferTV x\naxiom premise6a : InFamily Lily\naxiom premise6b : WatchTVInCinema Lily\n\n-- Derived facts\n\n-- Lily does not prefer TV series (since she watches TV series in cinemas and family-members who prefer TV do not watch TV in cinemas)\ntheorem not_prefer_Lily : \u00ac PreferTV Lily := by\n  intro hPrefer\n  have hcontra : \u00ac WatchTVInCinema Lily := by\n    exact premise4 Lily \u27e8premise6a, hPrefer\u27e9\n  exact hcontra premise6b\n\n-- Therefore, Lily is not an HBO subscriber\ntheorem not_HBO_Lily : \u00ac HBO Lily := by\n  intro hHBO\n  have hPrefer : PreferTV Lily := premise5 Lily \u27e8premise6a, hHBO\u27e9\n  exact not_prefer_Lily hPrefer\n\n-- Hence, by the family disjunction, Lily must be an AMC subscriber\ntheorem AMC_Lily : AMC Lily := by\n  have hdisj : AMC Lily \u2228 HBO Lily := premise3 Lily premise6a\n  cases hdisj with\n  | inl hAMC => exact hAMC\n  | inr hHBO =>\n      have : False := not_HBO_Lily hHBO\n      exact False.elim this\n\n-- Therefore, Lily is eligible to watch three movies weekly without fees\ntheorem Eligible_Lily : Eligible Lily := by\n  exact premise1 Lily \u27e8premise6a, AMC_Lily\u27e9\n\n-- Note: From the given premises, we cannot derive \u00ac GoWeekly Lily nor its negation.\n-- We have not introduced any axiom asserting either direction.\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: Unknown",

Since Lily is in the family and WatchTVInCinema(Lily) holds (premise 7), we can derive \u00acPreferTV(Lily) by contradiction: assuming PreferTV(Lily) would imply \u00acWatchTVInCinema(Lily), contradicting premise 7. Thus, we can prove \u00acPreferTV(Lily).\n- This directly conflicts with the \u201cPreferTV(Lily)\u201d part of the target\u2019s consequent. However, to refute the entire implication, we would need the antecedent to hold, i.e., in particular Eligible(Lily). We do not have any premise that lets us conclude Eligible(Lily). Premise (1) only gives SubscribeAList \u2192 Eligible, not the converse; and premise (3) gives SubscribeAList \u2228 SubscribeHBO, but not enough to conclude SubscribeAList specifically, nor Eligible.\n- We also cannot derive GoesWeekly(Lily): we only know that some family member goes weekly (premise 2), not necessarily Lily.\n- Therefore, we cannot prove the implication (since we cannot derive GoesWeekly nor PreferTV from the antecedent). We also cannot prove the negation of the implication, because to do so we would need to establish the antecedent (Eligible(Lily) \u2227 WatchTVInCinema(Lily)); we have WatchTVInCinema(Lily) but lack Eligible(Lily).\n\nConclusion: The statement is not derivable from the premises, and its negation is also not derivable from the premises.

Since Lily is in the family and WatchTVInCinema(Lily) holds (premise 7), we can derive \u00acPreferTV(Lily) by contradiction: assuming PreferTV(Lily) would imply \u00acWatchTVInCinema(Lily), contradicting premise 7. Thus, we can prove \u00acPreferTV(Lily).\n- This directly conflicts with the \u201cPreferTV(Lily)\u201d part of the target\u2019s consequent. However, to refute the entire implication, we would need the antecedent to hold, i.e., in particular Eligible(Lily). We do not have any premise that lets us conclude Eligible(Lily). Premise (1) only gives SubscribeAList \u2192 Eligible, not the converse; and premise (3) gives SubscribeAList \u2228 SubscribeHBO, but not enough to conclude SubscribeAList specifically, nor Eligible.\n- We also cannot derive GoesWeekly(Lily): we only know that some family member goes weekly (premise 2), not necessarily Lily.\n- Therefore, we cannot prove the implication (since we cannot derive GoesWeekly nor PreferTV from the antecedent). We also cannot prove the negation of the implication, because to do so we would need to establish the antecedent (Eligible(Lily) \u2227 WatchTVInCinema(Lily)); we have WatchTVInCinema(Lily) but lack Eligible(Lily).\n\nConclusion: The statement is not derivable from the premises, and its negation is also not derivable from the premises.

        "llm_response": "STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning\n\nLet the domain be monitors, with predicates:\n- LG(x): x is made by LG\n- TypeC(x): x has a type-c port\n- Before2010(x): x was made before 2010\n- InLibrary(x): x is in the library\n- Constant L2021: the L-2021 monitor\n\nPremises:\n1) \u2203m, LG(m) \u2227 TypeC(m)\n2) \u2200m, TypeC(m) \u2192 \u00acBefore2010(m)\n3) \u2200m, InLibrary(m) \u2192 Before2010(m)\n4) InLibrary(L2021) \u2228 TypeC(L2021)\n5) (Before2010(L2021) \u2227 LG(L2021)) \u2228 (\u00acBefore2010(L2021) \u2227 \u00acLG(L2021))\n\nFrom (2) and (3), we get that InLibrary(L2021) and TypeC(L2021) cannot both hold, because InLibrary(L2021) implies Before2010(L2021) by (3), while TypeC(L2021) implies \u00acBefore2010(L2021) by (2). Therefore, \u00ac(InLibrary(L2021) \u2227 TypeC(L2021)).\n\nFrom (4), we know InLibrary(L2021) \u2228 TypeC(L2021); combined with the previous observation, exactly one of them can be true.\n\nPremise (5) says, specifically for L2021, either both Before2010 and LG hold, or neither holds (so \u00acBefore2010 and \u00acLG). This ties Before2010 and LG together for L2021 but does not by itself decide which side is true.\n\nWe cannot deduce InLibrary(L2021) outright:\n- Consistent scenario where InLibrary(L2021) is true: take the first disjunct of (5), so Before2010(L2021) and LG(L2021). By (4) we need InLibrary(L2021) or TypeC(L2021). If we choose InLibrary(L2021) and set TypeC(L2021) false, all premises are satisfied. Premise (1) can be satisfied by some other monitor having LG and TypeC.\n- Consistent scenario where InLibrary(L2021) is false: then by (4) TypeC(L2021) must be true. By (2), \u00acBefore2010(L2021). Then by (5) the second disjunct holds, so \u00acLG(L2021). Again, all premises are satisfied and (1) can be witnessed by a different monitor.\n\nThus, the premises do not entail that L2021 is in the library. The statement \u201cThe monitor L-2021 is in the library\u201d is not derivable, nor is its negation derivable from the given information.\n\nSTAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and attempted proof\n\n<lean>\nuniverse u\n\n-- Domain and constants\naxiom Monitor : Type\naxiom L2021 : Monitor\n\n-- Predicates\naxiom LG : Monitor \u2192 Prop\naxiom TypeC : Monitor \u2192 Prop\naxiom Before2010 : Monitor \u2192 Prop\naxiom InLibrary : Monitor \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\n-- 1) Some monitors made by LG have a type-c port.\naxiom some_LG_TypeC : \u2203 m : Monitor, LG m \u2227 TypeC m\n\n-- 2) Monitors that have a type-c port were not made before 2010.\naxiom typec_not_before : \u2200 m : Monitor, TypeC m \u2192 \u00ac Before2010 m\n\n-- 3) All monitors in the library are made before 2010.\naxiom library_before : \u2200 m : Monitor, InLibrary m \u2192 Before2010 m\n\n-- 4) L-2021 is either in the library or has a type-c port.\naxiom l2021_or_typec : InLibrary L2021 \u2228 TypeC L2021\n\n-- 5) L-2021 is either both produced before 2010 and made by LG, or neither is true.\naxiom l2021_equiv : (Before2010 L2021 \u2227 LG L2021) \u2228 (\u00ac Before2010 L2021 \u2227 \u00ac LG L2021)\n\n-- Useful derived lemmas\n\n-- InLibrary and TypeC cannot both hold for L2021.\ntheorem l2021_not_both_inlib_and_typec : \u00ac (InLibrary L2021 \u2227 TypeC L2021) := by\n  intro h\n  have b : Before2010 L2021 := library_before _ h.left\n  have nb : \u00ac Before2010 L2021 := typec_not_before _ h.right\n  exact nb b\n\n-- If L2021 is in the library, it was made before 2010.\ntheorem l2021_before_of_inlib : InLibrary L2021 \u2192 Before2010 L2021 := by\n  intro h\n  exact library_before _ h\n\n-- If L2021 is not in the library, then it must have a type-c port (by the disjunction in premise 4).\ntheorem l2021_typec_of_not_inlib : \u00ac InLibrary L2021 \u2192 TypeC L2021 := by\n  intro hnot\n  cases l2021_or_typec with\n  | inl hlib => exact False.elim (hnot hlib)\n  | inr htc  => exact htc\n\n-- If L2021 is in the library, then it is made by LG (using premise 5).\ntheorem l2021_lg_of_inlib : InLibrary L2021 \u2192 LG L2021 := by\n  intro hlib\n  have b : Before2010 L2021 := library_before _ hlib\n  cases l2021_equiv with\n  | inl hb_lg =>\n      exact hb_lg.right\n  | inr hnb_nlg =>\n      have : False := hnb_nlg.left b\n      exact False.elim this\n\n-- If L2021 is made by LG, then it was made before 2010 (using premise 5).\ntheorem l2021_before_of_lg : LG L2021 \u2192 Before2010 L2021 := by\n  intro hlg\n  cases l2021_equiv with\n  | inl hb_lg =>\n      exact hb_lg.left\n  | inr hnb_nlg =>\n      have : False := hnb_nlg.right hlg\n      exact False.elim this\n\n-- If L2021 is made by LG, then it is in the library (disqualifying the TypeC branch via 2).\ntheorem l2021_inlib_of_lg : LG L2021 \u2192 InLibrary L2021 := by\n  intro hlg\n  have b : Before2010 L2021 := l2021_before_of_lg hlg\n  cases l2021_or_typec with\n  | inl hlib => exact hlib\n  | inr htc  =>\n      have nb : \u00ac Before2010 L2021 := typec_not_before _ htc\n      exact False.elim (nb b)\n\n-- Thus, for L2021, being made by LG is equivalent to being in the library.\ntheorem l2021_lg_iff_inlib : LG L2021 \u2194 InLibrary L2021 :=\n  And.intro l2021_inlib_of_lg l2021_lg_of_inlib\n\n-- Also, if L2021 is in the library, then it cannot have a type-c port.\ntheorem l2021_not_typec_if_inlib : InLibrary L2021 \u2192 \u00ac TypeC L2021 := by\n  intro hlib htc\n  exact l2021_not_both_inlib_and_typec \u27e8hlib, htc\u27e9\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: Unknown",

Therefore, \u00ac(InLibrary(L2021) \u2227 TypeC(L2021)).\n\nFrom (4), we know InLibrary(L2021) \u2228 TypeC(L2021); combined with the previous observation, exactly one of them can be true.\n\nPremise (5) says, specifically for L2021, either both Before2010 and LG hold, or neither holds (so \u00acBefore2010 and \u00acLG). This ties Before2010 and LG together for L2021 but does not by itself decide which side is true.\n\nWe cannot deduce InLibrary(L2021) outright:\n- Consistent scenario where InLibrary(L2021) is true: take the first disjunct of (5), so Before2010(L2021) and LG(L2021). By (4) we need InLibrary(L2021) or TypeC(L2021). If we choose InLibrary(L2021) and set TypeC(L2021) false, all premises are satisfied. Premise (1) can be satisfied by some other monitor having LG and TypeC.\n- Consistent scenario where InLibrary(L2021) is false: then by (4) TypeC(L2021) must be true. By (2), \u00acBefore2010(L2021). Then by (5) the second disjunct holds, so \u00acLG(L2021). Again, all premises are satisfied and (1) can be witnessed by a different monitor.\n\nThus, the premises do not entail that L2021 is in the library.

(For L, being before 2010 is equivalent to being LG-made.)\n\nGoal: Lib(L) \u2228 LG(L).\n\nReasoning:\n- From (4), do case analysis:\n  - Case A: Lib(L). Then the conclusion Lib(L) \u2228 LG(L) holds immediately by left introduction of \u2228.\n  - Case B: TC(L). From (2), TC(L) \u2192 \u00acB(L). Hence \u00acB(L).\n    - From (3), contraposition gives \u00acB(L) \u2192 \u00acLib(L). Thus \u00acLib(L).\n    - From (5), since \u00acB(L), the first disjunct (B(L) \u2227 LG(L)) is impossible, so the second must hold, yielding \u00acLG(L).\n    - In this case, both Lib(L) and LG(L) are false, so Lib(L) \u2228 LG(L) is false in this branch.\n\nTherefore, the premises do not entail the goal; the goal can fail when TC(L) holds. On the other hand, the premises are also consistent with Lib(L) holding (then by (3) B(L), and by (5) LG(L) as well), which makes the goal true.

Thus \u00acLib(L).\n    - From (5), since \u00acB(L), the first disjunct (B(L) \u2227 LG(L)) is impossible, so the second must hold, yielding \u00acLG(L).\n    - In this case, both Lib(L) and LG(L) are false, so Lib(L) \u2228 LG(L) is false in this branch.\n\nTherefore, the premises do not entail the goal; the goal can fail when TC(L) holds. On the other hand, the premises are also consistent with Lib(L) holding (then by (3) B(L), and by (5) LG(L) as well), which makes the goal true.

Combining with the first implication above yields InLibrary(L) \u2192 MadeByLG(L).\n\nFrom (2), HasTypeC(L) \u2192 \u00acMadeBefore2010(L), and by the contrapositive just noted, HasTypeC(L) \u2192 \u00acMadeByLG(L). Also, HasTypeC(L) implies \u00acInLibrary(L), because InLibrary(L) \u2192 MadeBefore2010(L) would contradict HasTypeC(L) \u2192 \u00acMadeBefore2010(L).\n\nUsing (4), we split:\n- If InLibrary(L), then we get MadeByLG(L), so (InLibrary(L) \u2227 MadeByLG(L)).\n- If HasTypeC(L), then we get \u00acInLibrary(L) and \u00acMadeByLG(L), so (\u00acInLibrary(L) \u2227 \u00acMadeByLG(L)).\nHence the antecedent A := (InLibrary(L) \u2227 MadeByLG(L)) \u2228 (\u00acInLibrary(L) \u2227 \u00acMadeByLG(L)) is derivable.\n\nConsider the conclusion C := \u00acHasTypeC(L) \u2227 \u00acMadeByLG(L). Suppose C holds. From (4), since \u00acHasTypeC(L), we must have InLibrary(L). Then by (3) and the implication MadeBefore2010(L) \u2192 MadeByLG(L) (from (5)), we derive MadeByLG(L), contradicting \u00acMadeByLG(L). Thus \u00acC holds.\n\nWe have proven A and \u00acC from the premises.

In particular, if TypeC(L) then \u00acLibrary(L) by negation introduction.\n- From (4), we have a case split on L:\n  - Case A: Library(L). Then the desired conclusion Library(L) \u2228 LG(L) holds immediately by disjunction introduction.\n  - Case B: TypeC(L). Then by (2) we get \u00acBefore(L). Using the antecedent of the implication (LG(L) \u2227 Before(L)) \u2228 (\u00acLG(L) \u2227 \u00acBefore(L)):\n    - Subcase B1: LG(L) \u2227 Before(L). This contradicts \u00acBefore(L), hence from False we could derive the conclusion vacuously in this subcase.\n    - Subcase B2: \u00acLG(L) \u2227 \u00acBefore(L). This is consistent with \u00acBefore(L). From TypeC(L) and (2)(3) we also have \u00acLibrary(L). Thus in this subcase both disjuncts of the desired conclusion Library(L) \u2228 LG(L) are false, so the conclusion fails.\n\nTherefore, under the premises, there is a consistent scenario (Case B with Subcase B2) where the antecedent of the implication holds but the consequent does not. Hence the implication cannot be derived from the premises. On the other hand, we cannot derive its negation outright either, because (4) also allows Case A (Library(L)), under which the conclusion holds. So neither the implication nor its negation is provable from the given premises.\n\nSTAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization\n\n<lean>\nuniverse u\n\n-- Entities and predicates\naxiom Monitor : Type\naxiom L2021 : Monitor\n\naxiom MadeByLG : Monitor \u2192 Prop\naxiom HasTypeC : Monitor \u2192 Prop\naxiom MadeBefore2010 : Monitor \u2192 Prop\naxiom InLibrary : Monitor \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom some_LG_TypeC : \u2203 m : Monitor, MadeByLG m \u2227 HasTypeC m\naxiom typec_not_before : \u2200 m : Monitor, HasTypeC m \u2192 \u00ac MadeBefore2010 m\naxiom library_before : \u2200 m : Monitor, InLibrary m \u2192 MadeBefore2010 m\naxiom L2021_lib_or_typec : InLibrary L2021 \u2228 HasTypeC L2021\naxiom L2021_either_or :\n  (MadeBefore2010 L2021 \u2227 MadeByLG L2021) \u2228 (\u00ac MadeBefore2010 L2021 \u2227 \u00ac MadeByLG L2021)\n\n-- The user\u2019s target implication to try to prove\ntheorem target :\n  ((MadeByLG L2021 \u2227 MadeBefore2010 L2021) \u2228 (\u00ac MadeByLG L2021 \u2227 \u00ac MadeBefore2010 L2021))\n    \u2192 (InLibrary L2021 \u2228 MadeByLG L2021) := by\n  intro hA\n  -- Split on whether L-2021 is in the library or has type-c\n  cases L2021_lib_or_typec with\n  | inl hLib =>\n      -- If it's in the library, the conclusion holds immediately\n      exact Or.inl hLib\n  | inr hTypeC =>\n      -- From type-c, not before 2010\n      have hnb : \u00ac MadeBefore2010 L2021 := typec_not_before L2021 hTypeC\n      -- Analyze the antecedent\n      cases hA with\n      | inl hLGbefore =>\n          -- hLGbefore : MadeByLG L2021 \u2227 MadeBefore2010 L2021\n          -- This contradicts hnb; from False we could conclude the goal,\n          -- but we still must handle the other branch below.\n          have contra : False := hnb hLGbefore.right\n          exact False.elim contra\n      | inr hnot =>\n          -- hnot : \u00ac MadeByLG L2021 \u2227 \u00ac MadeBefore2010 L2021\n          -- In this branch, we cannot derive InLibrary L2021 \u2228 MadeByLG L2021 from the given axioms.\n          sorry\n\n-- A supporting lemma: if L-2021 has type-c, then the desired conclusion fails\n-- given the \"either-or\" premise about before-2010 and LG.\nlemma not_conclusion_if_typec_using_given_premise :\n  HasTypeC L2021 \u2192 \u00ac (InLibrary L2021 \u2228 MadeByLG L2021) := by\n  intro hTypeC\n  -- From type-c: not before 2010\n  have hnb : \u00ac MadeBefore2010 L2021 := typec_not_before L2021 hTypeC\n  -- From type-c and library-before: not in library\n  have hNotLib : \u00ac InLibrary L2021 := by\n    intro hLib\n    have hb : MadeBefore2010 L2021 := library_before L2021 hLib\n    exact hnb hb\n  -- From the given either-or premise and not-before, get not LG\n  have hNotLG : \u00ac MadeByLG L2021 := by\n    cases L2021_either_or with\n    | inl hbeforeLG =>\n        -- hbeforeLG : MadeBefore2010 L2021 \u2227 MadeByLG L2021\n        have hb : MadeBefore2010 L2021 := hbeforeLG.left\n        have : False := hnb hb\n        intro hLG\n        exact False.elim this\n    | inr hnot =>\n        -- hnot : \u00ac MadeBefore2010 L2021 \u2227 \u00ac MadeByLG L2021\n        exact hnot.right\n  -- Now discharge the negation of the disjunction\n  intro hDisj\n  cases hDisj with\n  | inl hLib => exact hNotLib hLib\n  | inr hLG  => exact hNotLG hLG\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: Unknown",

Combined with (5), the left disjunct (Before \u2227 LG) is impossible, so (5) yields \u00acMadeByLG(L2021). Thus, under HasTypeC(L2021), both InLibrary(L2021) and MadeByLG(L2021) are false, so the conclusion (InLibrary \u2228 MadeByLG) fails, even though the antecedent of the implication holds by (5). Therefore, we cannot prove the implication from the premises in general. But we also cannot prove its negation outright, because if InLibrary(L2021) holds (allowed by (4)), the conclusion (InLibrary \u2228 LG) holds trivially.

In particular, if TypeC(L) then \u00acLibrary(L) by negation introduction.\n- From (4), we have a case split on L:\n  - Case A: Library(L). Then the desired conclusion Library(L) \u2228 LG(L) holds immediately by disjunction introduction.\n  - Case B: TypeC(L). Then by (2) we get \u00acBefore(L). Using the antecedent of the implication (LG(L) \u2227 Before(L)) \u2228 (\u00acLG(L) \u2227 \u00acBefore(L)):\n    - Subcase B1: LG(L) \u2227 Before(L). This contradicts \u00acBefore(L), hence from False we could derive the conclusion vacuously in this subcase.\n    - Subcase B2: \u00acLG(L) \u2227 \u00acBefore(L). This is consistent with \u00acBefore(L). From TypeC(L) and (2)(3) we also have \u00acLibrary(L). Thus in this subcase both disjuncts of the desired conclusion Library(L) \u2228 LG(L) are false, so the conclusion fails.\n\nTherefore, under the premises, there is a consistent scenario (Case B with Subcase B2) where the antecedent of the implication holds but the consequent does not. Hence the implication cannot be derived from the premises. On the other hand, we cannot derive its negation outright either, because (4) also allows Case A (Library(L)), under which the conclusion holds. So neither the implication nor its negation is provable from the given premises.\n\nSTAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization\n\n<lean>\nuniverse u\n\n-- Entities and predicates\naxiom Monitor : Type\naxiom L2021 : Monitor\n\naxiom MadeByLG : Monitor \u2192 Prop\naxiom HasTypeC : Monitor \u2192 Prop\naxiom MadeBefore2010 : Monitor \u2192 Prop\naxiom InLibrary : Monitor \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom some_LG_TypeC : \u2203 m : Monitor, MadeByLG m \u2227 HasTypeC m\naxiom typec_not_before : \u2200 m : Monitor, HasTypeC m \u2192 \u00ac MadeBefore2010 m\naxiom library_before : \u2200 m : Monitor, InLibrary m \u2192 MadeBefore2010 m\naxiom L2021_lib_or_typec : InLibrary L2021 \u2228 HasTypeC L2021\naxiom L2021_either_or :\n  (MadeBefore2010 L2021 \u2227 MadeByLG L2021) \u2228 (\u00ac MadeBefore2010 L2021 \u2227 \u00ac MadeByLG L2021)\n\n-- The user\u2019s target implication to try to prove\ntheorem target :\n  ((MadeByLG L2021 \u2227 MadeBefore2010 L2021) \u2228 (\u00ac MadeByLG L2021 \u2227 \u00ac MadeBefore2010 L2021))\n    \u2192 (InLibrary L2021 \u2228 MadeByLG L2021) := by\n  intro hA\n  -- Split on whether L-2021 is in the library or has type-c\n  cases L2021_lib_or_typec with\n  | inl hLib =>\n      -- If it's in the library, the conclusion holds immediately\n      exact Or.inl hLib\n  | inr hTypeC =>\n      -- From type-c, not before 2010\n      have hnb : \u00ac MadeBefore2010 L2021 := typec_not_before L2021 hTypeC\n      -- Analyze the antecedent\n      cases hA with\n      | inl hLGbefore =>\n          -- hLGbefore : MadeByLG L2021 \u2227 MadeBefore2010 L2021\n          -- This contradicts hnb; from False we could conclude the goal,\n          -- but we still must handle the other branch below.\n          have contra : False := hnb hLGbefore.right\n          exact False.elim contra\n      | inr hnot =>\n          -- hnot : \u00ac MadeByLG L2021 \u2227 \u00ac MadeBefore2010 L2021\n          -- In this branch, we cannot derive InLibrary L2021 \u2228 MadeByLG L2021 from the given axioms.\n          sorry\n\n-- A supporting lemma: if L-2021 has type-c, then the desired conclusion fails\n-- given the \"either-or\" premise about before-2010 and LG.\nlemma not_conclusion_if_typec_using_given_premise :\n  HasTypeC L2021 \u2192 \u00ac (InLibrary L2021 \u2228 MadeByLG L2021) := by\n  intro hTypeC\n  -- From type-c: not before 2010\n  have hnb : \u00ac MadeBefore2010 L2021 := typec_not_before L2021 hTypeC\n  -- From type-c and library-before: not in library\n  have hNotLib : \u00ac InLibrary L2021 := by\n    intro hLib\n    have hb : MadeBefore2010 L2021 := library_before L2021 hLib\n    exact hnb hb\n  -- From the given either-or premise and not-before, get not LG\n  have hNotLG : \u00ac MadeByLG L2021 := by\n    cases L2021_either_or with\n    | inl hbeforeLG =>\n        -- hbeforeLG : MadeBefore2010 L2021 \u2227 MadeByLG L2021\n        have hb : MadeBefore2010 L2021 := hbeforeLG.left\n        have : False := hnb hb\n        intro hLG\n        exact False.elim this\n    | inr hnot =>\n        -- hnot : \u00ac MadeBefore2010 L2021 \u2227 \u00ac MadeByLG L2021\n        exact hnot.right\n  -- Now discharge the negation of the disjunction\n  intro hDisj\n  cases hDisj with\n  | inl hLib => exact hNotLib hLib\n  | inr hLG  => exact hNotLG hLG\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: Unknown"

Predicates:\n- Outside(x): x is outside the solar system.\n- InSolar(x): x is in the solar system.\n- HasSun(x): x has the Sun as its star.\n- GravBound(x): x is gravitationally bound by the Sun.\n- Planet(x): x is a planet.\n- Rogue(x): x is a rogue planet.\n- Orphan(x): x is an orphan planet.\nLet PSO denote PSO J318.5\u221222.\n\nPremises:\n1) \u2200x, Outside(x) \u2228 InSolar(x).\n2) \u2200x, Outside(x) \u2192 \u00acHasSun(x).\n3) \u2200x, InSolar(x) \u2192 GravBound(x).\n4) \u2200x, (Planet(x) \u2227 GravBound(x)) \u2192 \u00acRogue(x).\n5) \u2200x, Orphan(x) \u2192 Rogue(x).\n6) \u00ac(Rogue(PSO) \u2227 Planet(PSO) \u2227 GravBound(PSO)) \u2192 Rogue(PSO).\n7) (Orphan(PSO) \u2228 \u00acHasSun(PSO)) \u2192 (\u00acOrphan(PSO) \u2227 \u00acHasSun(PSO)).\n\nUseful derivations:\n- From (1) and (2), we can show HasSun(x) \u2192 InSolar(x): Given HasSun(x), consider the disjunction Outside(x) \u2228 InSolar(x). If Outside(x), then by (2) we get \u00acHasSun(x), contradicting HasSun(x); hence the Outside case is impossible and we conclude InSolar(x). From (3), this further gives HasSun(x) \u2192 GravBound(x).\n- From (7), we can derive \u00acOrphan(PSO): Assume Orphan(PSO). Then the antecedent of (7), Orphan(PSO) \u2228 \u00acHasSun(PSO), holds, so (7) yields \u00acOrphan(PSO) \u2227 \u00acHasSun(PSO). This contradicts Orphan(PSO). Therefore, by negation introduction, \u00acOrphan(PSO).\n\nWe do not need classical reasoning for \u00acOrphan(PSO); the argument is intuitionistic. Other consequences like Rogue(PSO) from (6) would require classical reasoning to eliminate double negation in general, and we don\u2019t need them to prove the chosen goal.\n\nSTAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and proof\n\n<lean>\nuniverse u\n\naxiom Obj : Type u\naxiom PSO : Obj\n\naxiom Outside : Obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom InSolar : Obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom HasSun : Obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom GravBound : Obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Planet : Obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Rogue : Obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Orphan : Obj \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom ax1 : \u2200 x : Obj, Outside x \u2228 InSolar x\naxiom ax2 : \u2200 x : Obj, Outside x \u2192 \u00ac HasSun x\naxiom ax3 : \u2200 x : Obj, InSolar x \u2192 GravBound x\naxiom ax4 : \u2200 x : Obj, (Planet x \u2227 GravBound x) \u2192 \u00ac Rogue x\naxiom ax5 : \u2200 x : Obj, Orphan x \u2192 Rogue x\naxiom ax6 : \u00ac(Rogue PSO \u2227 Planet PSO \u2227 GravBound PSO) \u2192 Rogue PSO\naxiom ax7 : (Orphan PSO \u2228 \u00ac HasSun PSO) \u2192 (\u00ac Orphan PSO \u2227 \u00ac HasSun PSO)\n\n-- Derived lemmas (optional)\nlemma hasSun_implies_in (x : Obj) : HasSun x \u2192 InSolar x := by\n  intro hSun\n  have h := ax1 x\n  cases h with\n  | inl hOut =>\n      have nhSun : \u00ac HasSun x := ax2 x hOut\n      exact False.elim (nhSun hSun)\n  | inr hIn =>\n      exact hIn\n\nlemma hasSun_implies_grav (x : Obj) : HasSun x \u2192 GravBound x := by\n  intro hSun\n  have hIn : InSolar x := hasSun_implies_in x hSun\n  exact ax3 x hIn\n\n-- Main goal\ntheorem not_orphan_PSO : \u00ac Orphan PSO := by\n  intro hO\n  have disj : Orphan PSO \u2228 \u00ac HasSun PSO := Or.inl hO\n  have conj := ax7 disj\n  have hNotO : \u00ac Orphan PSO := conj.left\n  exact hNotO hO\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: True",

Predicates:\n- Outside(x): x is outside the solar system.\n- InSolar(x): x is in the solar system.\n- HasSun(x): x has the Sun as its star.\n- GravBound(x): x is gravitationally bound by the Sun.\n- Planet(x): x is a planet.\n- Rogue(x): x is a rogue planet.\n- Orphan(x): x is an orphan planet.\nLet PSO denote PSO J318.5\u221222.\n\nPremises:\n1) \u2200x, Outside(x) \u2228 InSolar(x).\n2) \u2200x, Outside(x) \u2192 \u00acHasSun(x).\n3) \u2200x, InSolar(x) \u2192 GravBound(x).\n4) \u2200x, (Planet(x) \u2227 GravBound(x)) \u2192 \u00acRogue(x).\n5) \u2200x, Orphan(x) \u2192 Rogue(x).\n6) \u00ac(Rogue(PSO) \u2227 Planet(PSO) \u2227 GravBound(PSO)) \u2192 Rogue(PSO).\n7) (Orphan(PSO) \u2228 \u00acHasSun(PSO)) \u2192 (\u00acOrphan(PSO) \u2227 \u00acHasSun(PSO)).\n\nUseful derivations:\n- From (1) and (2), we can show HasSun(x) \u2192 InSolar(x): Given HasSun(x), consider the disjunction Outside(x) \u2228 InSolar(x). If Outside(x), then by (2) we get \u00acHasSun(x), contradicting HasSun(x); hence the Outside case is impossible and we conclude InSolar(x). From (3), this further gives HasSun(x) \u2192 GravBound(x).\n- From (7), we can derive \u00acOrphan(PSO): Assume Orphan(PSO). Then the antecedent of (7), Orphan(PSO) \u2228 \u00acHasSun(PSO), holds, so (7) yields \u00acOrphan(PSO) \u2227 \u00acHasSun(PSO). This contradicts Orphan(PSO). Therefore, by negation introduction, \u00acOrphan(PSO).\n\nWe do not need classical reasoning for \u00acOrphan(PSO); the argument is intuitionistic. Other consequences like Rogue(PSO) from (6) would require classical reasoning to eliminate double negation in general, and we don\u2019t need them to prove the chosen goal.\n\nSTAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and proof\n\n<lean>\nuniverse u\n\naxiom Obj : Type u\naxiom PSO : Obj\n\naxiom Outside : Obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom InSolar : Obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom HasSun : Obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom GravBound : Obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Planet : Obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Rogue : Obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Orphan : Obj \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Premises\naxiom ax1 : \u2200 x : Obj, Outside x \u2228 InSolar x\naxiom ax2 : \u2200 x : Obj, Outside x \u2192 \u00ac HasSun x\naxiom ax3 : \u2200 x : Obj, InSolar x \u2192 GravBound x\naxiom ax4 : \u2200 x : Obj, (Planet x \u2227 GravBound x) \u2192 \u00ac Rogue x\naxiom ax5 : \u2200 x : Obj, Orphan x \u2192 Rogue x\naxiom ax6 : \u00ac(Rogue PSO \u2227 Planet PSO \u2227 GravBound PSO) \u2192 Rogue PSO\naxiom ax7 : (Orphan PSO \u2228 \u00ac HasSun PSO) \u2192 (\u00ac Orphan PSO \u2227 \u00ac HasSun PSO)\n\n-- Derived lemmas (optional)\nlemma hasSun_implies_in (x : Obj) : HasSun x \u2192 InSolar x := by\n  intro hSun\n  have h := ax1 x\n  cases h with\n  | inl hOut =>\n      have nhSun : \u00ac HasSun x := ax2 x hOut\n      exact False.elim (nhSun hSun)\n  | inr hIn =>\n      exact hIn\n\nlemma hasSun_implies_grav (x : Obj) : HasSun x \u2192 GravBound x := by\n  intro hSun\n  have hIn : InSolar x := hasSun_implies_in x hSun\n  exact ax3 x hIn\n\n-- Main goal\ntheorem not_orphan_PSO : \u00ac Orphan PSO := by\n  intro hO\n  have disj : Orphan PSO \u2228 \u00ac HasSun PSO := Or.inl hO\n  have conj := ax7 disj\n  have hNotO : \u00ac Orphan PSO := conj.left\n  exact hNotO hO\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: True"

Clearly explain which rules you're applying and how you reach your conclusion.\n\nSTAGE 2: Then translate your reasoning into Lean 4 code. During the translation, please pay close attention to the predicates and entities. There is an additional requirement: I also want you to try to prove the theorem you translated to Lean. If you can prove the theorem, give me True at the end of the answer. If you can prove the negation of the theorem, write False at the end of the answer.
