Story ID: 133
Example ID: 392
Premises: The Blake McFall Company Building is a building added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
The Emmet Building is a five-story building in Portland, Oregon.
The Emmet Building was built in 1915.
The Emmet Building is another name for the Blake McFall Company Building.
John works at the Emmet Building.
Conclusion: A five-story building is built in 1915.

==================================================
Iteration 1

STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

- From the context: "The Emmet Building is a five-story building in Portland, Oregon." So Emmet Building is five-story.
- Also: "The Emmet Building was built in 1915." So Emmet Building was built in 1915.
- Therefore, there exists a building (namely, the Emmet Building) that is five-story and was built in 1915.
- Hence the statement "A five-story building is built in 1915" (an existential claim) is true, with the Emmet Building as a witness.
- The fact that the Emmet Building is another name for the Blake McFall Company Building and other details (e.g., John works there, NRHP listing) are not needed for this conclusion.
