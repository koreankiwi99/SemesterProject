STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Premises:
  - The Emmet Building is another name for the Blake McFall Company Building. Interpreted as Emmet = Blake.
  - The Emmet Building was built in 1915. Interpreted as BuiltInYear(Emmet, 1915).

- Rule used:
  - Substitution of identicals (Leibniz's law): If A = B and P(A) holds, then P(B) holds for any predicate P.

- Application:
  - From Emmet = Blake and BuiltInYear(Emmet, 1915), by substitution we infer BuiltInYear(Blake, 1915).

- Conclusion:
  - The Blake McFall Company Building was built in 1915.
