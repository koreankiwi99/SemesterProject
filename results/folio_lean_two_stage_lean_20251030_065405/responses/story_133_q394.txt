Premises: The Blake McFall Company Building is a building added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
The Emmet Building is a five-story building in Portland, Oregon.
The Emmet Building was built in 1915.
The Emmet Building is another name for the Blake McFall Company Building.
John works at the Emmet Building.
Conclusion: John started his current job in 1990.

STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- From the statement "The Emmet Building is another name for the Blake McFall Company Building," we infer that the Emmet Building and the Blake McFall Company Building are the same building. Logically, this is identity (Emmet = BlakeMcFall).
- We also have "The Blake McFall Company Building is a building added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990." Let AddedToNRHP(B, y) be the predicate “building B was added to the NRHP in year y.” So we have AddedToNRHP(BlakeMcFall, 1990).
- By the substitutivity of identicals (Leibniz's law), from Emmet = BlakeMcFall and AddedToNRHP(BlakeMcFall, 1990), we conclude AddedToNRHP(Emmet, 1990).
- Additionally, we know John works at the Emmet Building and John started his current job in 1990. These facts are independent but consistent with the above and show that John works at a building that was added to the NRHP in 1990.

Therefore, a clear theorem to prove is: The Emmet Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
