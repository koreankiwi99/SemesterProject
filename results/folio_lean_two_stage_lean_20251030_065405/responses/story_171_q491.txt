Premises: Some fish stings people.
Stonefish is a fish.
Stonefish stings when stepped on. 
If a stonefish stings someone and they are not treated, it can cause death to them.
To treat stonefish stings, apply heat to the affected area or use an antivenom.
Conclusion: If a stonefish stings you and you don’t use an antivenom, it can cause death to you.

STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

Formalization of predicates and entities:
- Types:
  - Person: the set of people.
  - Fish: the set of fish.
- Constants and predicates:
  - Stonefish: Fish (a particular fish).
  - Stings: Fish → Person → Prop, where Stings f p means fish f stings person p.
  - StepsOn: Person → Fish → Prop, where StepsOn p f means person p steps on fish f.
  - Treated: Person → Prop, where Treated p means person p received treatment.
  - Heat: Person → Prop, where Heat p means heat was applied to person p’s affected area.
  - Antivenom: Person → Prop, where Antivenom p means person p used an antivenom.
  - CanCauseDeath: Person → Prop, where CanCauseDeath p means the sting can cause death to person p.

Premises extracted from the text:
1) Some fish stings people:
   ∃ f:Fish, ∃ p:Person, Stings f p.
2) Stonefish is a fish: given by the constant Stonefish : Fish.
3) Stonefish stings when stepped on:
   ∀ p:Person, StepsOn p Stonefish → Stings Stonefish p.
4) If a stonefish stings someone and they are not treated, it can cause death to them:
   ∀ p:Person, (Stings Stonefish p ∧ ¬ Treated p) → CanCauseDeath p.
5) To treat stonefish stings, apply heat to the affected area or use an antivenom:
   ∀ p:Person, Stings Stonefish p → (Heat p ∨ Antivenom p) → Treated p.
   This says that either heat or antivenom suffices for treatment (sufficient conditions).

Target statement to assess:
- If a stonefish stings you and you don’t use an antivenom, it can cause death to you.
Formally, universally: ∀ p:Person, (Stings Stonefish p ∧ ¬ Antivenom p) → CanCauseDeath p.

Reasoning:
- From premise (4), death is only guaranteed (in the sense of “can cause death”) when the person is not treated.
- From premise (5), using an antivenom is sufficient for being treated, but heat is also independently sufficient for being treated.
- Therefore, knowing only that ¬ Antivenom p does not imply ¬ Treated p, because Heat p could still hold, which would imply Treated p via (5).
- Hence, from Stings Stonefish p ∧ ¬ Antivenom p, we cannot conclude ¬ Treated p, and thus cannot apply (4) to conclude CanCauseDeath p.
- Consequently, the target implication is not derivable from the given premises.
- Can we prove the negation of the target? The negation of ∀ p, (A p → B p) is ∃ p, A p ∧ ¬ B p, i.e., there exists some person stung by a stonefish who doesn’t use antivenom and for whom it cannot cause death. We have no premises guaranteeing such a person exists, so we cannot prove the negation either.

Conclusion: The statement is not provable from the premises, and its negation is not provable from the premises. Logical status: Unknown.
