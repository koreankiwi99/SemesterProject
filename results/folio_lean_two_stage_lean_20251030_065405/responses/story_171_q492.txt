Premises: Some fish stings people.
Stonefish is a fish.
Stonefish stings when stepped on. 
If a stonefish stings someone and they are not treated, it can cause death to them.
To treat stonefish stings, apply heat to the affected area or use an antivenom.
Conclusion: Stings of some fish can cause death if not treated.

==================================================
Iteration 1
==================================================
STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Let S denote Stonefish.
- Premise: Stonefish is a fish. Formally, Fish(S).
- Premise: If a stonefish stings someone and they are not treated, it can cause death to them. Formally, ∀p, (Stings S p ∧ ¬ Treated p) → Dies p.
- From these two premises, by existential introduction, we can conclude there exists a fish (namely S) such that for all individuals p, if that fish stings p and p is not treated, then p dies. Formally, ∃f, Fish f ∧ ∀p, (Stings f p ∧ ¬ Treated p) → Dies p.
- The other premises (some fish sting people; stonefish stings when stepped on; how to treat stonefish stings) are consistent context but not needed to derive the conclusion.
- Therefore, the statement “Stings of some fish can cause death if not treated” follows.
