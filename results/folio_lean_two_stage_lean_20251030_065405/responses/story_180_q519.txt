Story ID: 180
Example ID: 519
Premises: Sam is doing a project.
A project is written either in C++ or Python.
If Sam does a project written in Python, he will not use a Mac.
Sam is using a Mac.
If Sam uses a Mac, he will play a song.
If a song is not titled "Perfect," Sam will never play it.
Conclusion: The song Sam is playing is titled "Perfect".

==================================================
Iteration 1
==================================================
STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Let Sam be a person, projects be entities with properties “written in C++” or “written in Python,” and songs be entities with properties “Perfect” or not, and a relation “Sam plays this song.”
- Premises:
  1) A project is written either in C++ or Python. (forall projects p, Cpp(p) or Python(p))
  2) If Sam does a project written in Python, he will not use a Mac. (for all p, (Does(Sam, p) and Python(p)) → ¬UsesMac(Sam))
  3) Sam is using a Mac. (UsesMac(Sam))
  4) If Sam uses a Mac, he will play a song. (UsesMac(Sam) → exists s, Play(Sam, s))
  5) If a song is not titled “Perfect,” Sam will never play it. (for all s, ¬Perfect(s) → ¬Play(Sam, s))

- From 3 and 4 by modus ponens, Sam plays some song s0: there exists s0 such that Play(Sam, s0).
- From 5 instantiated at s0, if ¬Perfect(s0) then ¬Play(Sam, s0).
- Since we have Play(Sam, s0), assuming ¬Perfect(s0) would contradict 5. By contradiction (or contrapositive), Perfect(s0) holds.
- Therefore, there exists a song that Sam is playing and that song is titled “Perfect.” In symbols: ∃ s, Play(Sam, s) ∧ Perfect(s).

- (Irrelevant but consistent extra reasoning using the programming premises: From 2 and 3, Sam cannot be doing a project in Python; with 1 and the fact he’s doing a project, his project must be in C++. This does not affect the song conclusion.)
