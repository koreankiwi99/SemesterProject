Story ID: 193
Example ID: 550
Premises: A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.
If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.
Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.
Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.
Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.
Conclusion: Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.

STAGE 1: Logical reasoning

- Rule 1: For any two La Liga teams x and y, if x has more points than y, then x ranks higher than y.
- Rule 2: For any two La Liga teams x and y, if neither has more points than the other, then the team that has more points in their head-to-head games ranks higher.
- Facts:
  - Real Madrid is a La Liga team.
  - Barcelona is a La Liga team.
  - Real Madrid has more points than Barcelona.
  - Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona has more head-to-head points than the other.

Reasoning:
- From the facts that Real Madrid and Barcelona are La Liga teams and that Real Madrid has more points than Barcelona, apply Rule 1 with x = Real Madrid and y = Barcelona to conclude that Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.
- Rule 2 is inapplicable because its antecedent (neither has more points overall) is false; we already know Real Madrid has more points than Barcelona. The head-to-head tie is therefore irrelevant to the conclusion.
