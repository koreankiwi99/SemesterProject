Story ID: 193
Example ID: 551
Premises: A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.
If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.
Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.
Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.
Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.
Conclusion: Barcelona ranks higher than Real Madrid.

STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Rule 1 (Points rule): For any two La Liga teams A and B, if A has more points than B, then A ranks higher than B.
- Rule 2 (Head-to-head tiebreaker): For any two La Liga teams A and B, if neither has more points than the other overall (i.e., it is not the case that A has more points than B, and it is not the case that B has more points than A), then the team that has more points from the head-to-head games between them ranks higher.

Facts:
- Real Madrid and Barcelona are La Liga teams.
- Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona overall.
- Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the head-to-head games between them (so head-to-head points are equal).

Reasoning:
- From the fact that both are La Liga teams and that Real Madrid has more points than Barcelona, apply Rule 1 to conclude: Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.
- Rule 2 does not apply because its precondition fails: it requires that neither team has more points overall; however, we are given that Real Madrid has more points than Barcelona. Therefore, the head-to-head tiebreaker is irrelevant here.
- The claim to be proven is “Barcelona ranks higher than Real Madrid.” This does not follow from any rule or fact given. Moreover, we cannot conclude its negation (that Barcelona does not rank higher than Real Madrid) unless we assume further properties of “ranks higher” (such as asymmetry), which are not provided. Thus, we can prove that Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, but we cannot prove or refute that Barcelona ranks higher than Real Madrid within the given axioms.

Conclusion: The statement “Barcelona ranks higher than Real Madrid” is not derivable from the premises, nor is its negation derivable without extra assumptions. Hence, Unknown.
