William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.
The University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom.
William Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs.

Conclusion: William Dickinson did not get a seat in Parliament.

STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Let Person be the domain of people.
- Let SupportPortlandWhigs(x) mean “x supported the Portland Whigs.”
- Let GotSeatInParliament(x) mean “x got a seat in Parliament.”

Premises:
1) William Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs: SupportPortlandWhigs(William).
2) Universal rule: For all x, if SupportPortlandWhigs(x), then not GotSeatInParliament(x).

Goal: Show not GotSeatInParliament(William).

Reasoning:
- From (1) and (2) by modus ponens: since SupportPortlandWhigs(William) and (∀x, SupportPortlandWhigs(x) → ¬GotSeatInParliament(x)), instantiate x := William to get ¬GotSeatInParliament(William).
- Other given facts (e.g., that he sat in the House of Commons, his schooling, and that the University of Edinburgh is in the UK) are irrelevant to this specific inference. Note that “sat in the House of Commons” would ordinarily imply he had a seat, which would contradict the conclusion, but we do not need that premise to derive the conclusion; the conclusion follows directly from the support premise and the universal rule.

Therefore, William Dickinson did not get a seat in Parliament.
