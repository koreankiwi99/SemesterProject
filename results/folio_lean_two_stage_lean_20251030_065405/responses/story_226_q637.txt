Premises: William Dickinson was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons
William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.
The University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom.
William Dickinson supported the Portland Whigs.
People who supported the Portland Whigs did not get a seat in the Parliament.
Conclusion: William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.

Iteration 1
==================================================
STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

- From the text: “William Dickinson attended Westminster school for high school and then the University of Edinburgh.” So he attended a specific high school (Westminster School) and a specific university (University of Edinburgh).
- From the text: “The University of Edinburgh is a university located in the United Kingdom.” So the university he attended is located in the UK.
- The claim we are asked to assess is: “William Dickinson went to schools located in the United Kingdom for both high school and university.” This requires both:
  - the high school he attended (Westminster School) to be located in the UK, and
  - the university he attended (University of Edinburgh) to be located in the UK.
- We have an explicit statement for the university’s location (UK), but we do not have any explicit statement in the provided text that Westminster School is located in the UK. Although one might know externally that Westminster School is in London, we must not use external knowledge; only the given premises count.
- Therefore:
  - We can derive that his university was in the UK.
  - We cannot derive that his high school was in the UK.
- Hence, the overall statement “for both high school and university” is not derivable from the provided premises. We also cannot derive its negation (since the text does not state that Westminster School is not in the UK).
- Conclusion: Unknown.

STAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and attempt

We formalize persons, schools, countries, attendance relations, and location. We encode the given premises. We define the claim that there exist a high school and a university he attended, both located in the UK. We then show a conditional theorem: if Westminster School is located in the UK, the claim follows. Since we do not have that premise, we cannot prove the claim outright, nor can we prove its negation.
