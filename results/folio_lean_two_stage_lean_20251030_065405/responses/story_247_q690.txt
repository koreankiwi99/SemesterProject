Premises: LanguageA is a universal language
If a universal language exists, then for every two people if they both know the same universal language they can communicate.
Katya cannot communicate with Danil.
Katya knows LanguageA. 
Conclusion: Danil knows LanguageA.

==================================================
Iteration 1
==================================================
STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Entities and predicates:
  - Persons: Katya, Danil
  - Languages: LanguageA
  - Predicates:
    - Universal(L): L is a universal language
    - Knows(p, L): person p knows language L
    - Communicate(p, q): p and q can communicate

- Premises:
  1) Universal(LanguageA).
  2) If a universal language exists, then for any two people and any language L, if L is universal and both know L, they can communicate:
     (∃ L, Universal L) → ∀ p q L, Universal L → Knows p L → Knows q L → Communicate p q.
  3) ¬Communicate(Katya, Danil).
  4) Knows(Katya, LanguageA).
  5) Knows(Danil, LanguageA).

- Derivation:
  - From (1), by existential introduction, we obtain ∃ L, Universal L with witness LanguageA.
  - Apply (2) with that existence to get the general rule: for any p, q, L, if Universal L and both know L, then Communicate p q.
  - Instantiate with p = Katya, q = Danil, L = LanguageA, and use (1), (4), and (5). By modus ponens, conclude Communicate(Katya, Danil).
  - This contradicts (3), so the premises are inconsistent. Nevertheless, the target claim Communicate(Katya, Danil) is derivable from the given rules and facts.
