Premises: Everything is either outside the solar system or in the solar system. 
Nothing outside the solar system has the Sun as its star.
Everything in the solar system is gravitationally bound by the Sun.
No planets gravitationally bound by the Sun are rogue planets. 
All orphan planets are rogue planets.
If PSO J318.5−22 is not both a rogue planet and a planet gravitationally bound by the Sun, then it is a rogue planet.
Conclusion: PSO J318.5−22 is an orphan planet or it does not have the Sun as its star, or both.

STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

Let PSO denote PSO J318.5−22.

Premises:
- For any x, either x is outside the solar system or x is in the solar system. (Exhaustivity)
- For any x, if x is outside the solar system, then x does not have the Sun as its star.
- For any x, if x is in the solar system, then x is gravitationally bound by the Sun.
- For any x, if x is a planet gravitationally bound by the Sun, then x is not a rogue planet. (No bound planets are rogue)
- For any x, if x is an orphan planet, then x is a rogue planet.
- If PSO is not both a rogue planet and a planet gravitationally bound by the Sun, then PSO is a rogue planet.
- PSO is an orphan planet or PSO does not have the Sun as its star (or both).

Goal: Show PSO is a rogue planet.

Reasoning:
1) From the universal premise “no planets gravitationally bound by the Sun are rogue,” instantiate at PSO: if Planet(PSO) ∧ BoundBySun(PSO), then ¬Rogue(PSO).
2) Suppose for contradiction that Rogue(PSO) ∧ (Planet(PSO) ∧ BoundBySun(PSO)) holds. From the right conjunct we get Planet(PSO) ∧ BoundBySun(PSO), which by step (1) implies ¬Rogue(PSO). This contradicts Rogue(PSO) from the left conjunct. Hence ¬(Rogue(PSO) ∧ (Planet(PSO) ∧ BoundBySun(PSO))) holds. (Proof by contradiction, deriving a negated conjunction.)
3) Apply modus ponens to the conditional “If PSO is not both a rogue planet and a planet gravitationally bound by the Sun, then PSO is a rogue planet” using the antecedent established in (2). Conclude Rogue(PSO).
4) Note: The disjunction “PSO is an orphan planet or it does not have the Sun as its star” is not needed for this conclusion. Even without it, steps (1)–(3) suffice to prove PSO is a rogue planet. Alternatively, if PSO is an orphan planet, we also get Rogue(PSO) directly from the “all orphan planets are rogue planets” premise.

Conclusion: PSO J318.5−22 is a rogue planet.
