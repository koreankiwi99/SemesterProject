Premises: All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine.
People regularly drink coffee, or they don't want to be addicted to caffeine, or both.
No one who doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
Rina is either a student who is unaware that caffeine is a drug, or she is not a student and is she aware that caffeine is a drug.
Rina  is either a student who is dependent on caffeine, or she is not a student and not dependent on caffeine.
Conclusion: Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug.

Iteration 1

STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

Let the predicates be:
- Drinks(x): x regularly drinks coffee.
- Dep(x): x is dependent on caffeine.
- WantsAvoid(x): x doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine.
- Unaware(x): x is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
- Aware(x): x is aware that caffeine is a drug.
- Student(x): x is a student.

Premises:
1) ∀x, Drinks(x) → Dep(x).
2) ∀x, Drinks(x) ∨ WantsAvoid(x).
3) ∀x, WantsAvoid(x) → ¬Unaware(x).
4) (Student(Rina) ∧ Unaware(Rina)) ∨ (¬Student(Rina) ∧ Aware(Rina)).
5) (Student(Rina) ∧ Dep(Rina)) ∨ (¬Student(Rina) ∧ ¬Dep(Rina)).

Goal: WantsAvoid(Rina) ∨ Unaware(Rina).

Reasoning:
- From premise (2) instantiated at Rina, we have Drinks(Rina) ∨ WantsAvoid(Rina).
  - If WantsAvoid(Rina), then the goal WantsAvoid(Rina) ∨ Unaware(Rina) holds by left introduction of ∨.
  - If Drinks(Rina), then by (1) we get Dep(Rina).
    Using (5):
    - Case (Student(Rina) ∧ Dep(Rina)): we get Student(Rina).
    - Case (¬Student(Rina) ∧ ¬Dep(Rina)): this contradicts Dep(Rina), so this case is impossible.
    Hence Student(Rina) holds.
    Now use (4):
    - Case (Student(Rina) ∧ Unaware(Rina)): then Unaware(Rina) holds, and thus the disjunction goal holds by right introduction of ∨.
    - Case (¬Student(Rina) ∧ Aware(Rina)): this contradicts Student(Rina), so this case is impossible; from contradiction we can infer Unaware(Rina).
- Therefore, in all cases, WantsAvoid(Rina) ∨ Unaware(Rina) holds.

Note: We did not need premise (3) for this conclusion.
