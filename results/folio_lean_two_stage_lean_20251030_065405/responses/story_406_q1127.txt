Premises: All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine.
People regularly drink coffee, or they don't want to be addicted to caffeine, or both.
No one who doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
Rina is either a student who is unaware that caffeine is a drug, or she is not a student and is she aware that caffeine is a drug.
Rina  is either a student who is dependent on caffeine, or she is not a student and not dependent on caffeine.
Conclusion: Rina eith doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug.

STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

Let the domain be persons. Introduce predicates:
- Coffee(x): x regularly drinks coffee.
- Dep(x): x is dependent on caffeine.
- WantFree(x): x does not want to be addicted to caffeine.
- Unaware(x): x is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
- Aware(x): x is aware that caffeine is a drug.
- Student(x): x is a student.
- Constant: Rina.

Premises:
1) ∀x, Coffee(x) → Dep(x).
2) ∀x, Coffee(x) ∨ WantFree(x).
3) ∀x, WantFree(x) → ¬Unaware(x).
4) (Student(Rina) ∧ Unaware(Rina)) ∨ (¬Student(Rina) ∧ Aware(Rina)).
5) (Student(Rina) ∧ Dep(Rina)) ∨ (¬Student(Rina) ∧ ¬Dep(Rina)).

Goal: WantFree(Rina) ∨ Unaware(Rina).

Proof:
- From (4), do a case split.
  - Case 4-left: Student(Rina) ∧ Unaware(Rina). Then Unaware(Rina) holds, so the goal follows by right-introduction of ∨.
  - Case 4-right: ¬Student(Rina) ∧ Aware(Rina). Then ¬Student(Rina) holds. From (5), since Rina is not a student, we must be in the right disjunct, so ¬Dep(Rina).
    Now use (2) on Rina: Coffee(Rina) ∨ WantFree(Rina).
    - Subcase: WantFree(Rina). Then the goal holds by left-introduction of ∨.
    - Subcase: Coffee(Rina). Then by (1), Dep(Rina), contradicting ¬Dep(Rina). Hence this subcase is impossible; by disjunction elimination with absurdity, we conclude WantFree(Rina).
  In either subcase, we get WantFree(Rina), so the goal holds.
Thus, in all cases, WantFree(Rina) ∨ Unaware(Rina) is established.
