Premises: All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine.
People regularly drink coffee, or they don't want to be addicted to caffeine, or both.
No one who doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
Rina is either a student who is unaware that caffeine is a drug, or she is not a student and is she aware that caffeine is a drug.
Rina  is either a student who is dependent on caffeine, or she is not a student and not dependent on caffeine.
Conclusion: Rina either regularly drinks coffee or is unaware that caffeine is a drug.

STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

Let Person be the domain. Predicates:
- RegularCoffee(x): x regularly drinks coffee.
- Dependent(x): x is dependent on caffeine.
- WantsAddicted(x): x wants to be addicted to caffeine.
- Unaware(x): x is unaware that caffeine is a drug. (So aware means ¬Unaware.)
- Student(x): x is a student.

Constant: Rina.

Formalized premises:
1) ∀x, RegularCoffee(x) → Dependent(x).
2) ∀x, RegularCoffee(x) ∨ ¬WantsAddicted(x).
3) ∀x, ¬WantsAddicted(x) → ¬Unaware(x).
4) (Student(Rina) ∧ Unaware(Rina)) ∨ (¬Student(Rina) ∧ ¬Unaware(Rina)).
5) (Student(Rina) ∧ Dependent(Rina)) ∨ (¬Student(Rina) ∧ ¬Dependent(Rina)).

Goal: RegularCoffee(Rina) ∨ Unaware(Rina).

Reasoning by cases on (4):
- Case A: Student(Rina) ∧ Unaware(Rina). Then Unaware(Rina) holds, so RegularCoffee(Rina) ∨ Unaware(Rina) is true by right introduction.
- Case B: ¬Student(Rina) ∧ ¬Unaware(Rina). Here we need RegularCoffee(Rina) ∨ Unaware(Rina). Since ¬Unaware(Rina), the only way to prove the disjunction is to prove RegularCoffee(Rina).

Try to force RegularCoffee(Rina) from other premises:
- From (2) instantiated at Rina: RegularCoffee(Rina) ∨ ¬WantsAddicted(Rina). If RegularCoffee(Rina), we’re done. If ¬WantsAddicted(Rina), then by (3) we get ¬Unaware(Rina), which is consistent with this case but does not give RegularCoffee(Rina).
- Consider (5):
  - Subcase B1: Student(Rina) ∧ Dependent(Rina). This contradicts ¬Student(Rina), so from this subcase we can conclude anything, including the goal (ex falso).
  - Subcase B2: ¬Student(Rina) ∧ ¬Dependent(Rina). This is consistent with Case B. From (1) we only have RegularCoffee → Dependent, which does not force RegularCoffee. Even classically, combining with ¬Dependent only gives ¬RegularCoffee (by contrapositive), not RegularCoffee.

Therefore in Case B2 we cannot prove RegularCoffee(Rina) ∨ Unaware(Rina). Indeed, there is a concrete countermodel satisfying all premises while falsifying the goal: take a one-person domain {Rina} and set
- RegularCoffee(Rina) = false
- Unaware(Rina) = false
- WantsAddicted(Rina) = false
- Student(Rina) = false
- Dependent(Rina) = false
Check:
- (1) holds vacuously since RegularCoffee is false.
- (2) holds since ¬WantsAddicted is true.
- (3) holds since ¬WantsAddicted implies ¬Unaware (true → true).
- (4) holds via (¬Student ∧ ¬Unaware) = (true ∧ true).
- (5) holds via (¬Student ∧ ¬Dependent) = (true ∧ true).
But the goal RegularCoffee ∨ Unaware is false ∨ false = false.

Thus the conclusion is not entailed by the premises, and neither its negation is derivable from the premises. So the status is Unknown.
