Premises: Some monitors made by LG have a type-c port.
Monitors that have a type-c port were not made before 2010.
All monitors in the library are made before 2010. 
The L-2021 monitor is either used in the library or has a type-c port.
The L-2021 monitor is either both produced before 2010 and made by LG, or neither is true.
Conclusion: The monitor L-2021 is in the library.

==================================================
Iteration 1
==================================================
STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

Let the domain be monitors, with predicates:
- LG(x): x is made by LG
- TypeC(x): x has a type-c port
- Before2010(x): x was made before 2010
- InLibrary(x): x is in the library
- Constant L2021: the L-2021 monitor

Premises:
1) ∃m, LG(m) ∧ TypeC(m)
2) ∀m, TypeC(m) → ¬Before2010(m)
3) ∀m, InLibrary(m) → Before2010(m)
4) InLibrary(L2021) ∨ TypeC(L2021)
5) (Before2010(L2021) ∧ LG(L2021)) ∨ (¬Before2010(L2021) ∧ ¬LG(L2021))

From (2) and (3), we get that InLibrary(L2021) and TypeC(L2021) cannot both hold, because InLibrary(L2021) implies Before2010(L2021) by (3), while TypeC(L2021) implies ¬Before2010(L2021) by (2). Therefore, ¬(InLibrary(L2021) ∧ TypeC(L2021)).

From (4), we know InLibrary(L2021) ∨ TypeC(L2021); combined with the previous observation, exactly one of them can be true.

Premise (5) says, specifically for L2021, either both Before2010 and LG hold, or neither holds (so ¬Before2010 and ¬LG). This ties Before2010 and LG together for L2021 but does not by itself decide which side is true.

We cannot deduce InLibrary(L2021) outright:
- Consistent scenario where InLibrary(L2021) is true: take the first disjunct of (5), so Before2010(L2021) and LG(L2021). By (4) we need InLibrary(L2021) or TypeC(L2021). If we choose InLibrary(L2021) and set TypeC(L2021) false, all premises are satisfied. Premise (1) can be satisfied by some other monitor having LG and TypeC.
- Consistent scenario where InLibrary(L2021) is false: then by (4) TypeC(L2021) must be true. By (2), ¬Before2010(L2021). Then by (5) the second disjunct holds, so ¬LG(L2021). Again, all premises are satisfied and (1) can be witnessed by a different monitor.

Thus, the premises do not entail that L2021 is in the library. The statement “The monitor L-2021 is in the library” is not derivable, nor is its negation derivable from the given information.
