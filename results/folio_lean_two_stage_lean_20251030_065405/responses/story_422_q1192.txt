Premises: All customers in James' family who subscribe to AMC A-List are eligible to watch three movies every week without any additional fees. 
Some of the customers in James' family go to the cinema every week.
Customers in James' family subscribe to AMC A-List or HBO service. 
Customers in James' family who prefer TV series will not watch TV series in cinemas.
All customers in James' family who subscribe to HBO services prefer TV series to movies. 
Lily is in James' family; she watches TV series in cinemas. 
Conclusion: Lily goes to cinemas every week.

==================================================
Iteration 1
==================================================
STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

Let the domain be customers in James' family (tracked by a predicate InFamily). Predicates we use:
- Subscribes to AMC A-List: SubAMC(x)
- Subscribes to HBO: SubHBO(x)
- Prefers TV series: PreferTV(x)
- Watches TV series in cinemas: WatchSeriesCinema(x)
- Eligible to watch three movies weekly for free: EligibleThreeMoviesWeekly(x)
- Goes to the cinema every week: GoesCinemaWeekly(x)

Premises:
1) ∀x, if InFamily(x) ∧ SubAMC(x), then EligibleThreeMoviesWeekly(x).
2) ∃x, InFamily(x) ∧ GoesCinemaWeekly(x).
3) ∀x, if InFamily(x), then SubAMC(x) ∨ SubHBO(x).
4) ∀x, if InFamily(x) ∧ PreferTV(x), then ¬WatchSeriesCinema(x).
5) ∀x, if InFamily(x) ∧ SubHBO(x), then PreferTV(x).
6) InFamily(Lily) and WatchSeriesCinema(Lily).

Goal: GoesCinemaWeekly(Lily).

Reasoning:
- From (4) and (6): Since InFamily(Lily) and WatchSeriesCinema(Lily), we can infer ¬PreferTV(Lily). Reason: Premise (4) is InFamily(x) ∧ PreferTV(x) → ¬WatchSeriesCinema(x). Using modus tollens in a constructive way: from WatchSeriesCinema(Lily), it follows that PreferTV(Lily) cannot hold, because PreferTV(Lily) together with InFamily(Lily) would imply ¬WatchSeriesCinema(Lily), contradicting (6). Formally, (PreferTV → ¬Watch) yields (Watch → ¬Prefer).
- From (5): If Lily were an HBO subscriber, then PreferTV(Lily) would hold. But we have ¬PreferTV(Lily), so Lily cannot be an HBO subscriber. Thus ¬SubHBO(Lily).
- From (3): Since Lily is in the family, SubAMC(Lily) ∨ SubHBO(Lily). Using the disjunction and ¬SubHBO(Lily), we conclude SubAMC(Lily).
- From (1) and SubAMC(Lily) plus InFamily(Lily): Lily is EligibleThreeMoviesWeekly(Lily).

None of these entail GoesCinemaWeekly(Lily). Premise (2) states that some family member goes weekly, not necessarily Lily. Premise (1) only grants eligibility, not actual attendance. Therefore, the statement “Lily goes to cinemas every week” is not logically entailed by the premises, and neither is its negation derivable from the given information.
