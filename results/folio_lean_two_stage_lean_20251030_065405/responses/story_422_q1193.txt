Premises: All customers in James' family who subscribe to AMC A-List are eligible to watch three movies every week without any additional fees. 
Some of the customers in James' family go to the cinema every week.
Customers in James' family subscribe to AMC A-List or HBO service. 
Customers in James' family who prefer TV series will not watch TV series in cinemas.
All customers in James' family who subscribe to HBO services prefer TV series to movies. 
Lily is in James' family; she watches TV series in cinemas. 
Conclusion: Lily does not go to cinemas every week.

Iteration 1
==================================================
STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning with explicit rules

Let the domain be “customers in James’ family.” Predicates:
- InFamily(x): x is in James’ family
- AMC(x): x subscribes to AMC A-List
- HBO(x): x subscribes to HBO
- Eligible(x): x is eligible to watch three movies every week without fees
- GoWeekly(x): x goes to the cinema every week
- PreferTV(x): x prefers TV series to movies
- WatchTVInCinema(x): x watches TV series in cinemas

Premises:
1) ∀x, InFamily(x) ∧ AMC(x) → Eligible(x).
2) ∃x, InFamily(x) ∧ GoWeekly(x).
3) ∀x, InFamily(x) → AMC(x) ∨ HBO(x).
4) ∀x, InFamily(x) ∧ PreferTV(x) → ¬WatchTVInCinema(x).
5) ∀x, InFamily(x) ∧ HBO(x) → PreferTV(x).
6) InFamily(Lily) and WatchTVInCinema(Lily).

Goal: ¬GoWeekly(Lily).

Derivations:
- From (4) and (6): Using modus tollens in its conjunctive form. Premise (4) says InFamily(x) ∧ PreferTV(x) → ¬WatchTVInCinema(x). Instantiate x = Lily. Since InFamily(Lily) and WatchTVInCinema(Lily), we conclude ¬PreferTV(Lily). Reason: contrapositive of (A ∧ B) → ¬C is C → (¬A ∨ ¬B); with C = WatchTVInCinema(Lily) and A = InFamily(Lily), B = PreferTV(Lily), since A holds, we deduce ¬B, i.e., ¬PreferTV(Lily).
- From (5) and (6) and the previous step: If HBO(Lily) then PreferTV(Lily) (by (5)). But we have ¬PreferTV(Lily). By contrapositive, ¬PreferTV(Lily) implies ¬HBO(Lily) (using InFamily(Lily) from (6)).
- From (3) and the previous step: InFamily(Lily) implies AMC(Lily) ∨ HBO(Lily). Given ¬HBO(Lily), by disjunctive syllogism, AMC(Lily).
- From (1) and the previous step: InFamily(Lily) and AMC(Lily) imply Eligible(Lily). This is about eligibility to watch three movies weekly, not actual attendance.

About the goal ¬GoWeekly(Lily):
- Premise (2) only says some family member goes weekly, not necessarily Lily.
- No premise connects WatchTVInCinema or eligibility or AMC/HBO status to GoWeekly directly.
- Thus, neither ¬GoWeekly(Lily) nor GoWeekly(Lily) follows from the given premises. The statement “Lily does not go to cinemas every week” is not entailed, nor is its negation, given the information.

Conclusion: The claim cannot be proven or refuted from the premises.
