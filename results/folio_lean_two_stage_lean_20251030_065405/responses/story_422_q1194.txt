Premises: All customers in James' family who subscribe to AMC A-List are eligible to watch three movies every week without any additional fees. 
Some of the customers in James' family go to the cinema every week.
Customers in James' family subscribe to AMC A-List or HBO service. 
Customers in James' family who prefer TV series will not watch TV series in cinemas.
All customers in James' family who subscribe to HBO services prefer TV series to movies. 
Lily is in James' family; she watches TV series in cinemas. 
Conclusion: Lily goes to cinemas every week or watches 3 movies every week without any additional fees.

Iteration 1

STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

Let the domain be customers in general, with a predicate InFamily(x) specifying that x is a customer in James' family.

Predicates:
- InFamily(x): x is in James' family.
- SubAMC(x): x subscribes to AMC A-List.
- SubHBO(x): x subscribes to HBO.
- PreferTV(x): x prefers TV series to movies.
- WatchTVInCinema(x): x watches TV series in cinemas.
- CinemaEveryWeek(x): x goes to the cinema every week.
- Watch3Free(x): x is eligible to watch three movies every week without additional fees.

Premises:
1) ∀x, InFamily x ∧ SubAMC x → Watch3Free x.
2) ∃x, InFamily x ∧ CinemaEveryWeek x.
3) ∀x, InFamily x → SubAMC x ∨ SubHBO x.
4) ∀x, InFamily x ∧ PreferTV x → ¬WatchTVInCinema x.
5) ∀x, InFamily x ∧ SubHBO x → PreferTV x.
6) InFamily Lily.
7) WatchTVInCinema Lily.

Goal: CinemaEveryWeek Lily ∨ Watch3Free Lily.

Reasoning:
- From (4), for Lily: (InFamily Lily ∧ PreferTV Lily) → ¬WatchTVInCinema Lily.
- Given (7) WatchTVInCinema Lily, we get ¬(InFamily Lily ∧ PreferTV Lily) by contradiction: if both held, we would have ¬WatchTVInCinema Lily, contradicting (7).
- Using (6) InFamily Lily and ¬(InFamily Lily ∧ PreferTV Lily), we conclude ¬PreferTV Lily.
- From (5): (InFamily Lily ∧ SubHBO Lily) → PreferTV Lily. With ¬PreferTV Lily, we get ¬(InFamily Lily ∧ SubHBO Lily).
- Using (6) again, from ¬(InFamily Lily ∧ SubHBO Lily) we conclude ¬SubHBO Lily.
- From (3): InFamily Lily → (SubAMC Lily ∨ SubHBO Lily). With (6), we have SubAMC Lily ∨ SubHBO Lily. Together with ¬SubHBO Lily, we infer SubAMC Lily.
- From (1): InFamily Lily ∧ SubAMC Lily → Watch3Free Lily. Thus Watch3Free Lily.
- Therefore, CinemaEveryWeek Lily ∨ Watch3Free Lily holds by choosing the right disjunct.
