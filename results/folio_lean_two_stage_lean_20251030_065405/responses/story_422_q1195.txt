Premises: All customers in James' family who subscribe to AMC A-List are eligible to watch three movies every week without any additional fees. 
Some of the customers in James' family go to the cinema every week.
Customers in James' family subscribe to AMC A-List or HBO service. 
Customers in James' family who prefer TV series will not watch TV series in cinemas.
All customers in James' family who subscribe to HBO services prefer TV series to movies. 
Lily is in James' family; she watches TV series in cinemas. 
Conclusion: If Lily does not both go to cinemas every week and subscribe to HBO service, then Lily is either available to watch 3 movies every week without any additional fees or she prefers TV more.

Iteration 1

STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

Let’s formalize the statements with predicates over persons:
- InFamily(x): x is in James’ family.
- SubAMC(x): x subscribes to AMC A-List.
- SubHBO(x): x subscribes to HBO.
- Eligible3(x): x is eligible to watch three movies every week without additional fees.
- GoWeekly(x): x goes to the cinema every week.
- PreferTV(x): x prefers TV series to movies.
- WatchTVCinema(x): x watches TV series in cinemas.
- Lily: a specific person.

Premises:
1) ∀x, InFamily(x) ∧ SubAMC(x) → Eligible3(x).
2) ∃x, InFamily(x) ∧ GoWeekly(x).
3) ∀x, InFamily(x) → SubAMC(x) ∨ SubHBO(x).
4) ∀x, InFamily(x) ∧ PreferTV(x) → ¬WatchTVCinema(x).
5) ∀x, InFamily(x) ∧ SubHBO(x) → PreferTV(x).
6) InFamily(Lily) and WatchTVCinema(Lily).

Goal:
¬(GoWeekly(Lily) ∧ SubHBO(Lily)) → (Eligible3(Lily) ∨ PreferTV(Lily)).

Reasoning:

- From (4) with x = Lily and using InFamily(Lily) from (6), we have:
  InFamily(Lily) ∧ PreferTV(Lily) → ¬WatchTVCinema(Lily).
  Since WatchTVCinema(Lily) holds (from (6)), by contrapositive form (WatchTVCinema → ¬(InFamily ∧ PreferTV)) and given InFamily(Lily), we get ¬PreferTV(Lily).

- From (5) with x = Lily, InFamily(Lily) ∧ SubHBO(Lily) → PreferTV(Lily). But we have just shown ¬PreferTV(Lily). Therefore, we conclude ¬SubHBO(Lily) (otherwise we would derive a contradiction).

- From (3) with x = Lily and InFamily(Lily), we have SubAMC(Lily) ∨ SubHBO(Lily). Together with ¬SubHBO(Lily), it follows that SubAMC(Lily).

- From (1) with x = Lily and InFamily(Lily) ∧ SubAMC(Lily), we conclude Eligible3(Lily).

- Hence Eligible3(Lily) ∨ PreferTV(Lily) is true regardless of the antecedent. Therefore the implication ¬(GoWeekly(Lily) ∧ SubHBO(Lily)) → (Eligible3(Lily) ∨ PreferTV(Lily)) is true.
