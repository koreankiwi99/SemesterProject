Premises: All customers in James' family who subscribe to AMC A-List are eligible to watch three movies every week without any additional fees. 
Some of the customers in James' family go to the cinema every week.
Customers in James' family subscribe to AMC A-List or HBO service. 
Customers in James' family who prefer TV series will not watch TV series in cinemas.
All customers in James' family who subscribe to HBO services prefer TV series to movies. 
Lily is in James' family; she watches TV series in cinemas. 
Conclusion: If Lily is available to watch 3 movies every week without any additional fees and she watches TV series in cinemas, then she goes to cinemas every week and prefers TV series more.

Iteration 1

STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

Let the domain be “customers in James’ family,” modeled as persons with predicates:

- InFamily(x): x is in James’ family.
- SubscribeAList(x): x subscribes to AMC A-List.
- Eligible(x): x is eligible to watch 3 movies per week for free.
- GoesWeekly(x): x goes to the cinema every week.
- SubscribeHBO(x): x subscribes to HBO.
- PreferTV(x): x prefers TV series to movies.
- WatchTVInCinema(x): x watches TV series in cinemas.
- Lily is a specific individual in the family.

Premises:
1) ∀x, if InFamily(x) and SubscribeAList(x), then Eligible(x).
2) ∃x, InFamily(x) and GoesWeekly(x).
3) ∀x, if InFamily(x), then SubscribeAList(x) or SubscribeHBO(x).
4) ∀x, if InFamily(x) and PreferTV(x), then not WatchTVInCinema(x).
5) ∀x, if InFamily(x) and SubscribeHBO(x), then PreferTV(x).
6) InFamily(Lily).
7) WatchTVInCinema(Lily).

Target claim to assess:
If Lily is eligible to watch 3 movies every week without additional fees and she watches TV series in cinemas, then she goes to cinemas every week and prefers TV series more.
Formally:
(Eligible(Lily) ∧ WatchTVInCinema(Lily)) → (GoesWeekly(Lily) ∧ PreferTV(Lily)).

Analysis:
- From (4), for anyone in the family, PreferTV → ¬WatchTVInCinema. Since Lily is in the family and WatchTVInCinema(Lily) holds (premise 7), we can derive ¬PreferTV(Lily) by contradiction: assuming PreferTV(Lily) would imply ¬WatchTVInCinema(Lily), contradicting premise 7. Thus, we can prove ¬PreferTV(Lily).
- This directly conflicts with the “PreferTV(Lily)” part of the target’s consequent. However, to refute the entire implication, we would need the antecedent to hold, i.e., in particular Eligible(Lily). We do not have any premise that lets us conclude Eligible(Lily). Premise (1) only gives SubscribeAList → Eligible, not the converse; and premise (3) gives SubscribeAList ∨ SubscribeHBO, but not enough to conclude SubscribeAList specifically, nor Eligible.
- We also cannot derive GoesWeekly(Lily): we only know that some family member goes weekly (premise 2), not necessarily Lily.
- Therefore, we cannot prove the implication (since we cannot derive GoesWeekly nor PreferTV from the antecedent). We also cannot prove the negation of the implication, because to do so we would need to establish the antecedent (Eligible(Lily) ∧ WatchTVInCinema(Lily)); we have WatchTVInCinema(Lily) but lack Eligible(Lily).

Conclusion: The statement is not derivable from the premises, and its negation is also not derivable from the premises. So the status is Unknown.
