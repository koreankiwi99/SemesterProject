Example ID: 1337
Premises: All eels are fish. 
No fish are plants. 
Everything displayed in the collection is either a plant or an animal.
All multicellular animals are not bacteria.
All animals displayed in the collection are multicellular.
A sea eel is displayed in the collection.
The sea eel is an eel or an animal or not a plant.
Conclusion: The sea eel is bacteria.

STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

Premises:
1) All eels are fish. (∀x, Eel(x) → Fish(x))
2) No fish are plants. (∀x, Fish(x) → ¬Plant(x))
3) Everything displayed is either a plant or an animal. (∀x, Displayed(x) → Plant(x) ∨ Animal(x))
4) All multicellular animals are not bacteria. (∀x, Multicellular(x) ∧ Animal(x) → ¬Bacteria(x))
5) All animals displayed are multicellular. (∀x, Displayed(x) ∧ Animal(x) → Multicellular(x))
6) The sea eel is displayed. (Displayed(SeaEel))
7) The sea eel is an eel or an animal or not a plant. (Eel(SeaEel) ∨ Animal(SeaEel) ∨ ¬Plant(SeaEel))

Claim to assess: Bacteria(SeaEel).

Reasoning:
- From (6) and (3), SeaEel is either a plant or an animal: Plant(SeaEel) ∨ Animal(SeaEel).

We do a case split on this disjunction:

Case 1: Animal(SeaEel).
- From (6) and (5), since the sea eel is displayed and an animal, it is multicellular: Multicellular(SeaEel).
- From (4), since it is a multicellular animal, it is not bacteria: ¬Bacteria(SeaEel).

Case 2: Plant(SeaEel).
- From (2), Fish → ¬Plant, so by a direct proof by contradiction we get Plant → ¬Fish: assume Plant and Fish, then contradiction; hence Plant implies not Fish.
- From (1), Eel → Fish. Combining with the previous, Plant implies ¬Eel (since Plant ∧ Eel would give Fish and ¬Fish).
- Using (7), Eel ∨ Animal ∨ ¬Plant. Given Plant is true, ¬Plant is false; given Plant implies ¬Eel, Eel is false; hence the disjunction forces Animal to be true: Animal(SeaEel).
- As in Case 1, from Animal and (6),(5) we get Multicellular; then from (4) we get ¬Bacteria(SeaEel).

Thus in both cases we conclude ¬Bacteria(SeaEel). Therefore, the statement “The sea eel is bacteria” is false.
