Premises: All eels are fish. 
No fish are plants. 
Everything displayed in the collection is either a plant or an animal.
All multicellular animals are not bacteria.
All animals displayed in the collection are multicellular.
A sea eel is displayed in the collection.
The sea eel is an eel or an animal or not a plant.
Conclusion: The sea eel is multicellular or is bacteria.

Iteration 1

STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

Let s denote the sea eel.

Premises:
- All eels are fish. So if s is an eel, then s is a fish.
- No fish are plants. So if s is a fish, then s is not a plant.
- Everything displayed is either a plant or an animal. Since s is displayed, s is a plant or s is an animal.
- All multicellular animals are not bacteria. If s is an animal and multicellular, then s is not bacteria.
- All displayed animals are multicellular. If s is an animal and displayed, then s is multicellular.
- The sea eel s is displayed.
- s is an eel or s is an animal or s is not a plant.

Goal: s is multicellular or s is bacteria.

Reasoning:
1) From display, we have: Plant s ∨ Animal s.

2) From "The sea eel is an eel or an animal or not a plant", we do a case split:
   - Case A: s is an animal. Then since s is displayed, by "All displayed animals are multicellular," s is multicellular. Thus the disjunction (multicellular s ∨ bacteria s) holds.
   - Case B: s is an eel. Then by "All eels are fish," s is a fish. By "No fish are plants," s is not a plant. Together with "Displayed implies Plant or Animal," and since Plant s is false, we must have Animal s. Then as in Case A, s is multicellular, and the disjunction holds.
   - Case C: s is not a plant. Together with "Displayed implies Plant or Animal," and since Plant s is false, we again conclude Animal s. Then as in Case A, s is multicellular, and the disjunction holds.

Therefore in all cases, s is an animal, hence (using displayed) s is multicellular. Therefore the conclusion "s is multicellular or s is bacteria" is true (the left disjunct holds). In fact, we can also infer s is not bacteria from "All multicellular animals are not bacteria," but that is not needed for the disjunction.

Success: False
Errors:
  - Tactic `cases` failed: major premise type is not an inductive type
  Eel SeaEel

Explanation: the `cases` tactic is for constructor-based reasoning as well as for applying custom cases principles with a 'using' clause or a registered '@[cases_eliminator]' theorem. The above type neither is an inductive type nor has a registered theorem.

case inl
eel_or_animal : Eel SeaEel
⊢ Animal SeaEel
  - Function expected at
  hNotPlant
but this term has type
  Animal SeaEel ∨ ¬Plant SeaEel

Note: Expected a function because this term is being applied to the argument
  hPlant
