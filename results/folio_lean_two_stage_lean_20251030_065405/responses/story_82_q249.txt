Story ID: 82
Example ID: 249
Premises: Lawton Park is a neighborhood in Seattle. 
All citizens of Lawton Park use the zip code 98199. 
Tom is a citizen of Lawton Park.
Daniel uses the zip code 98199. 
Conclusion: Tom uses the zip code 98199.

==================================================
Iteration 1
==================================================
STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Premise 1: All citizens of Lawton Park use the zip code 98199. Formally: for any person x, if x is a citizen of Lawton Park, then x uses zip 98199.
- Premise 2: Tom is a citizen of Lawton Park.
- From Premise 1 by universal instantiation with x = Tom, we get: If Tom is a citizen of Lawton Park, then Tom uses zip 98199.
- By modus ponens on that instantiation with Premise 2, we conclude: Tom uses the zip code 98199.
- The information that Daniel uses 98199 is irrelevant to concluding about Tom.
