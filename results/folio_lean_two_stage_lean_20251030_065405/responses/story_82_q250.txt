Story ID: 82
Example ID: 250
Premises: Lawton Park is a neighborhood in Seattle. 
All citizens of Lawton Park use the zip code 98199. 
Tom is a citizen of Lawton Park.
Daniel uses the zip code 98199. 
Conclusion: Tom doesn't use the zip code 98199.

STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

- Let Person be the domain of people. Introduce predicates:
  - CitizenLP(x): x is a citizen of Lawton Park.
  - Uses98199(x): x uses the zip code 98199.
- Premises:
  1) ∀x, CitizenLP(x) → Uses98199(x). (All citizens of Lawton Park use 98199.)
  2) CitizenLP(Tom). (Tom is a citizen of Lawton Park.)
  3) Uses98199(Daniel). (Daniel uses 98199.) This is irrelevant for Tom.
- From (1) and (2), by universal instantiation and modus ponens, we derive Uses98199(Tom).
- The claim to assess is: ¬Uses98199(Tom) (“Tom doesn't use the zip code 98199.”).
- Since we derived Uses98199(Tom), the claim ¬Uses98199(Tom) is false given the premises. If we were to add it as an extra premise, it would directly contradict Uses98199(Tom) and yield a contradiction.
