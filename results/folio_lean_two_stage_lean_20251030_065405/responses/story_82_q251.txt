Story ID: 82
Example ID: 251
Premises: Lawton Park is a neighborhood in Seattle. 
All citizens of Lawton Park use the zip code 98199. 
Tom is a citizen of Lawton Park.
Daniel uses the zip code 98199. 
Conclusion: Tom is a citizen of Washington.

STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Define predicates:
  - CitizenLawtonPark(x): x is a citizen of Lawton Park.
  - UsesZip98199(x): x uses the zip code 98199.
  - CitizenWashington(x): x is a citizen of Washington.

- Premises:
  1) ∀x, CitizenLawtonPark(x) → UsesZip98199(x). (All citizens of Lawton Park use the zip code 98199.)
  2) CitizenLawtonPark(Tom). (Tom is a citizen of Lawton Park.)
  3) UsesZip98199(Daniel). (Daniel uses the zip code 98199.)
  4) Lawton Park is a neighborhood in Seattle. (No formal rule linking this to Washington is provided in the text.)

- From (1) and (2), by universal instantiation on Tom and modus ponens, we derive UsesZip98199(Tom).

- There is no given rule that:
  - From using zip code 98199 one is a citizen of Washington, or
  - From being a citizen of Lawton Park (a neighborhood in Seattle) one is a citizen of Washington, or
  - That Seattle is in Washington.

- Therefore, the statement “Tom is a citizen of Washington” cannot be deduced from the provided premises. It is also not contradicted by them. Hence, from the given information, the truth value is undetermined.
