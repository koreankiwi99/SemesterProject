Story ID: 82
Example ID: 252
Premises: Lawton Park is a neighborhood in Seattle. 
All citizens of Lawton Park use the zip code 98199. 
Tom is a citizen of Lawton Park.
Daniel uses the zip code 98199. 
Conclusion: Daniel is a citizen of Lawton Park.

==================================================
Iteration 1
==================================================
STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

- Let CitizenLP(x) mean “x is a citizen of Lawton Park” and Zip98199(x) mean “x uses the zip code 98199.”
- Premise 1: ∀x (CitizenLP(x) → Zip98199(x)).
- Premise 2: CitizenLP(Tom).
- Premise 3: Zip98199(Daniel).

From Premise 1 and Premise 2, by universal instantiation and modus ponens, we can conclude Zip98199(Tom).

We also have Zip98199(Daniel) directly from Premise 3. However, Premise 1 only gives the one-way implication CitizenLP(x) → Zip98199(x). It does not assert the converse Zip98199(x) → CitizenLP(x). Therefore, from Zip98199(Daniel) we cannot infer CitizenLP(Daniel) without committing the fallacy of affirming the consequent.

The statement “Lawton Park is a neighborhood in Seattle” is irrelevant to the logical derivation about citizenship and zip code use.

Conclusion: The premises do not entail “Daniel is a citizen of Lawton Park,” nor do they entail its negation. So the status is undetermined.

STAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and attempt

Below is a concrete model that satisfies all the premises but in which Daniel is not a citizen. This shows the conclusion is not derivable from the premises (i.e., it’s not a logical consequence).
