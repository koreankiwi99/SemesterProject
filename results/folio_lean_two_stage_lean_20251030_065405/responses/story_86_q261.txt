Premises: If a legislator is found guilty of stealing government funds, they will be suspended from office.
Tiffany T. Alston was a legislator in Maryland's House of Delegates from 2011 to 2013.
Tiffany T. Alston was found guilty of stealing government funds in 2012.
Conclusion: Tiffany T. Alston was suspended from the Maryland House of Delegates.

Iteration 1

STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Rule: If a legislator is found guilty of stealing government funds, they will be suspended from office. Logically, for any person p, office o, and time t: if p is a legislator of o at time t and p is found guilty at time t, then p is suspended from office o at time t. This is an implication we can use via modus ponens.
- Facts:
  - Tiffany T. Alston was a legislator in the Maryland House of Delegates (the office) during 2011–2013. In particular, she was a legislator there in 2012.
  - Tiffany T. Alston was found guilty of stealing government funds in 2012.
- Application: Instantiate the rule with p = Tiffany T. Alston, o = Maryland House of Delegates, t = 2012. Both antecedents hold in 2012 (she held the office in 2012 and was found guilty in 2012), so by modus ponens she was suspended from that office in 2012.
- Conclusion: Tiffany T. Alston was suspended from the Maryland House of Delegates.
