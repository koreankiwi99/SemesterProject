Premises: If a legislator is found guilty of stealing government funds, they will be suspended from office.
Tiffany T. Alston was a legislator in Maryland's House of Delegates from 2011 to 2013.
Tiffany T. Alston was found guilty of stealing government funds in 2012.
Conclusion: Tiffany T. Alston was not suspended from the Maryland House of Delegates.

STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Introduce predicates:
  - Legislator(x): x is a legislator.
  - FoundGuilty(x): x was found guilty of stealing government funds.
  - Suspended(x): x was suspended from office.
- Rule (universal conditional): For all x, if x is a legislator and x was found guilty of stealing government funds, then x will be suspended from office. Formally: ∀x, (Legislator(x) ∧ FoundGuilty(x)) → Suspended(x).
- Facts about Tiffany T. Alston:
  - Legislator(Tiffany).
  - FoundGuilty(Tiffany) in 2012.
- By conjunction introduction, from the two facts we infer Legislator(Tiffany) ∧ FoundGuilty(Tiffany).
- By modus ponens with the rule, we infer Suspended(Tiffany).
- The claim says Tiffany was not suspended from the Maryland House of Delegates, i.e., ¬Suspended(Tiffany).
- This contradicts the derived conclusion Suspended(Tiffany). Therefore, the claim is false; its negation is provable.
