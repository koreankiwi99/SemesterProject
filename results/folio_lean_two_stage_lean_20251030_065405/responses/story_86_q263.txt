Premises: If a legislator is found guilty of stealing government funds, they will be suspended from office.
Tiffany T. Alston was a legislator in Maryland's House of Delegates from 2011 to 2013.
Tiffany T. Alston was found guilty of stealing government funds in 2012.
Conclusion: Tiffany T. Alston went to prison for stealing government funds.

STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Let L(x) mean “x is a legislator,” G(x) mean “x was found guilty of stealing government funds,” S(x) mean “x is suspended from office,” and P(x) mean “x went to prison for stealing government funds.”
- Premise 1: For all x, if L(x) and G(x) then S(x). (If a legislator is found guilty of stealing government funds, they will be suspended from office.)
- Premise 2: L(Alston). (Tiffany T. Alston was a legislator.)
- Premise 3: G(Alston). (Tiffany T. Alston was found guilty of stealing government funds in 2012.)
- From Premise 2 and Premise 3, we have L(Alston) ∧ G(Alston). By Premise 1 and modus ponens, S(Alston).
- The claim to assess is P(Alston): “Tiffany T. Alston went to prison for stealing government funds.”
- None of the premises mention imprisonment or relate guilt/suspension to imprisonment. Therefore, P(Alston) does not follow from the given premises. We also cannot derive ¬P(Alston). So the truth of the claim is not determined by the provided information.
