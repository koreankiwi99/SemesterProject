STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

- Let the domain be persons. Define predicates:
  - ChoralConductor(x): x is a choral conductor.
  - Musician(x): x is a musician.
  - LovesMusic(x): x loves music.
- Constants: MV = Miroslav Venhoda.
- Premises:
  1) ChoralConductor(MV). (Miroslav Venhoda was a choral conductor.)
  2) ∀x (ChoralConductor(x) → Musician(x)). (Any choral conductor is a musician.)
  3) ∃x (Musician(x) ∧ LovesMusic(x)). (Some musicians love music.)
  4) An additional fact about publishing a specific book in 1946 (irrelevant to whether he loves music).
- From (1) and (2), by universal instantiation and modus ponens, we infer Musician(MV).
- From (3), we only know that there exists at least one musician who loves music, but this need not be MV. Existential instantiation does not allow us to identify MV as that witness without additional information.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude LovesMusic(MV) from the given premises. We also cannot conclude ¬LovesMusic(MV). Hence, the truth of “Miroslav Venhoda loved music” is not determined by the premises.
