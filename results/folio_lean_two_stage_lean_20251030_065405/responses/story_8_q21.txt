STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

- From the context: Miroslav Venhoda is a Czech and a choral conductor.
- Premise: Any choral conductor is a musician. This implies that Miroslav is a musician, though this is not needed for the goal.
- Premise: Some musicians love music. This is unrelated to the target claim.
- From the context: Miroslav Venhoda published a book in 1946.
- Goal: A Czech published a book in 1946. This is an existential statement: there exists someone who is Czech and published a book in 1946.
- Using existential introduction: take the witness to be Miroslav Venhoda. We know Czech(Miroslav) and PublishedIn1946(Miroslav), so we conclude there exists a person who is Czech and published a book in 1946.
