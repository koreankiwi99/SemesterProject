Premises: Miroslav Venhoda was a Czech choral conductor who specialized in the performance of Renaissance and Baroque music.

Conclusion: No choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance.

==================================================
STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Let Miroslav be an individual (Miroslav Venhoda).
- Premise: Miroslav is a choral conductor. So ChoralConductor(Miroslav).
- Premise: Miroslav specialized in the performance of Renaissance music. So SpecializedRenaissance(Miroslav).
- Premise: Miroslav specialized in the performance of Baroque music. So SpecializedBaroque(Miroslav).
- Premise: Any choral conductor is a musician. Formalized as ∀x, ChoralConductor(x) → Musician(x).
- Premise: Some musicians love music. Formalized as ∃x, Musician(x) ∧ LovesMusic(x).
- Premise: Miroslav published a book in 1946 called Method of Studying Gregorian Chant.
- Premise: No choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance. Formalized as ∀x, ChoralConductor(x) → ¬SpecializedRenaissance(x).

Derivation:
- From the universal statement ∀x, ChoralConductor(x) → ¬SpecializedRenaissance(x) and ChoralConductor(Miroslav), by universal instantiation and modus ponens, we get ¬SpecializedRenaissance(Miroslav).
- But we also have SpecializedRenaissance(Miroslav).
- Therefore, we derive a contradiction SpecializedRenaissance(Miroslav) ∧ ¬SpecializedRenaissance(Miroslav), which entails False.

Conclusion: The premises are inconsistent; thus we can prove False.
