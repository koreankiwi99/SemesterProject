No converse is given.\n- Nothing outside the solar system has the Sun as its star: Outside(x) -> \u00acSunStar(x).\n- Everything is either outside or in the solar system, and everything in the solar system is BoundSun: In(x) -> BoundSun(x). Also, SunStar(x) -> In(x) -> BoundSun(x).\n- No planets that are BoundSun are rogue: (Planet(x) \u2227 BoundSun(x)) -> \u00acRogue(x). With Rogue(p) true, this only yields \u00ac(Planet(p) \u2227 BoundSun(p)).\n\nQuestion 1:\n- We have Rogue(p) true, but only Orphan -> Rogue, not Rogue -> Orphan. Cannot conclude Orphan(p) or its negation. Answer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- The statement is Orphan(p) \u2228 \u00acSunStar(p).\n- We cannot derive Orphan(p). From Rogue(p) and given rules, we also cannot derive \u00acSunStar(p) (since Rogue does not imply not bound unless we also know Planet(p), which we don\u2019t). Thus the disjunction is not entailed nor refuted.

We have no information that George walks; \u201chumans can swim or walk\u201d plus the fact he swims does not imply he walks.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude George has functional leg muscles.

The premises do not state that MP is deductive (only that it is a component of a major type) nor that components inherit the \u201cdeductive process\u201d property.

The premises do not assert either of these about MP. The constraint that \u201cnothing only based on facts and rules is used for statistical generalization\u201d does not settle whether MP is used for statistical generalization, since we do not know whether MP is only based on facts and rules.

Risk-averse working people have corporate jobs, so they do not take more than normal risks and cannot be entrepreneurs. Working people who hate working for others merely want to be entrepreneurs (does not imply they are entrepreneurs).\n- The only statement about Mark is conditional: If Mark is neither an entrepreneur nor someone who hates working for others, then he is not a risk-averse working person. This does not assert whether he is an entrepreneur, whether he hates working for others, or whether he is risk-averse in general.\n\nQuestion 1: There is no information establishing that Mark is an entrepreneur. Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2: Nothing establishes that Mark is risk-averse; the conditional only rules out him being both risk-averse and working under a specific condition.

Consequent \u201cneither French nor EU\u201d holds.\n- If Spanish: she cannot be PRC (since PRC \u21d2 not EU and Spanish \u21d2 EU), so she must be French; thus French is true and EU is true.

    "model_response": "Reasoning:\n\nGiven:\n- If someone can fly over a vast distance, then they glide in the air. (FlyVast -> Glide)\n- Flightless birds cannot fly over a vast distance. (Flightless -> \u00acFlyVast), hence contrapositively FlyVast -> \u00acFlightless.\n- Penguins are flightless birds. (Penguin -> Flightless -> \u00acFlyVast)\n- Nonflying birds in Antarctica are penguins. (NFLAnt -> Penguin)\n- Fido is a penguin or flies over a vast distance. (Penguin(Fido) \u2228 FlyVast(Fido))\n\nQuestion 1:\n- If Fido is a penguin, then he is flightless. If Fido flies over a vast distance, then he is not flightless. Since we only know Penguin(Fido) \u2228 FlyVast(Fido), we cannot determine which disjunct holds. Therefore, whether Fido is flightless is not determined.\nAnswer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 2:\n- Claim: \u00acNFLAnt(Fido) \u2227 \u00acGlide(Fido).\n- From the premises, we cannot infer \u00acNFLAnt(Fido); we only know NFLAnt -> Penguin, not the converse.\n- We also cannot infer \u00acGlide(Fido); we only have FlyVast -> Glide, and lack of FlyVast does not imply lack of Glide.\n- Moreover, in the case FlyVast(Fido) holds (consistent with the disjunction), Glide(Fido) would be true, making the second conjunct false. But this is not forced by the premises. Hence the conjunction is neither entailed nor contradicted.\nAnswer: Unknown.\n\nQuestion 3:\n- The antecedent \u201cFido either can fly over a vast distance or cannot fly over a vast distance\u201d is a tautology (FlyVast \u2228 \u00acFlyVast). Thus the conditional is equivalent to asserting NFLAnt(Fido).\n- The premises do not entail NFLAnt(Fido), nor its negation. Therefore the conditional is not determined.\nAnswer: Unknown.\n\nANSWERS:\n1: Unknown\n2: Unknown\n3: Unknown",
