Premises: The world's only major large passenger aircraft manufacturers are Boeing and Airbus.
All American Airlines planes are from the world's major large passenger aircraft manufacturers. 
Airbus made more revenue than Boeing last year.

Reasoning:
1. The only major large passenger aircraft manufacturers are Boeing and Airbus, and all American Airlines planes come from that set. Therefore, any American Airlines plane must be either Boeing or Airbus. True.
2. The context provides no information about SpaceX making commercial aircraft. The statement about major large passenger aircraft manufacturers being only Boeing and Airbus does not address SpaceX’s existence in commercial aircraft generally. Unknown.
3. The context says nothing about United Airlines’ fleet composition. We cannot infer whether Boeing produces United Airlines planes. Unknown.
4. Nothing in the context indicates any plane is jointly made by both Airbus and Boeing, nor does it rule it out. Unknown.
