Thick as Thieves was published by Greenwillow Books.
If a book was published by a company, then the author of that book worked with the company that published the book.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

1. Thick as Thieves was published by Greenwillow Books. Given the rule that if a book was published by a company, then the author worked with that company, and the author is Megan Whalen Turner, it follows that she worked with Greenwillow Books. Therefore, the statement is true.

2. The Mede Empire plots to swallow up some nearby countries, and Attolia is a nearby country. However, "some" does not specify which nearby countries, so we cannot conclude that Attolia specifically is planned to be swallowed up. Therefore, the statement is unknown.

3. The text states that Thick as Thieves is set in the Mede Empire. Therefore, the statement that it is not set there is false.

4. From the rule and facts in Question 1, Megan Whalen Turner worked with Greenwillow Books. Therefore, the statement that she did not is false.
