Story ID: 117
Premises: Roads are made of either concrete or asphalt.
Roads made of concrete last longer than roads made with asphalt.
Roads made of asphalt are smoother than roads made of concrete.
Everyone prefers the smoother of two roads. 
The first road is made of concrete, and the second road is made of asphalt.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Given: First road is concrete; second is asphalt. Concrete roads last longer than asphalt roads. Therefore, the first road lasts longer than the second. So Q1 is True.
- Asphalt roads are smoother than concrete roads. Since the second is asphalt and the first is concrete, the second is smoother than the first. The statement says the second is not smoother, which contradicts the given. So Q2 is False.
- Everyone prefers the smoother of two roads. The second road is smoother. Therefore, John (being part of everyone) prefers the second road. So Q3 is True.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: True
