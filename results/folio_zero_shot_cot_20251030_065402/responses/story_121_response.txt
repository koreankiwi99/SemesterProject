==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- “Neocrepidodera Corpulentas are in the Chrysomelidae family,” and “There is a Neocrepidodera Corpulenta” together imply at least one such individual exists in Chrysomelidae.
- “Neocrepidodera Corpulentas are flea beetles or moths, or both,” but “There are no moths within the Chrysomelidae family.” Therefore, any Neocrepidodera Corpulenta in Chrysomelidae must be a flea beetle.
- Hence, there exists a flea beetle within Chrysomelidae, making the statement in Q1 true and the negation in Q2 false.
