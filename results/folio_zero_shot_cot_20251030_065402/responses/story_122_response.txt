Beasts of Prey Is about a creature known as the Shetani.
Shetanis are mythological.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "Beasts of Prey is a fantasy novel or a science fiction novel, or both" and "Science fiction novels are not about mythological creatures," plus "Beasts of Prey is about a creature known as the Shetani" and "Shetanis are mythological," it follows that Beasts of Prey is about a mythological creature. Therefore it cannot be a science fiction novel. Given the initial disjunction, it must be a fantasy novel (not both, since that would include sci-fi).
- Hence, "Beasts of prey isn't a science fiction novel" is true.
- "A shetani is either mythological or a creature": we are told Shetanis are mythological, and also referred to as a creature. The inclusive disjunction is thus true.
