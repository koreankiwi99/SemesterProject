==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Given: New York City (NYC) is located in the USA. The USA is part of North America. North America is in the western hemisphere. Interpreting “part of” and “in” as location/containment, and using the transitivity rule for “located in,” we can chain locations: USA is located in North America; North America is located in the western hemisphere; therefore NYC is located in the western hemisphere. Also given: NYC is a highly developed city.

Question 1:
- Since NYC is a highly developed city and is located in the western hemisphere, there exists a highly developed city located in the western hemisphere. True.

Question 2:
- From the chain above, the USA is located in the western hemisphere. Therefore the statement that it is not located there is false. False.

Question 3:
- No premise mentions New York State or places NYC within it. Cannot conclude. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: Unknown
