Story ID: 129
Premises: The Turing Award has been awarded to Donald Knuth, Marvin Minsky, Richard Hamming, and John McCarthy. 
Donald Knuth made contributions to the analysis of algorithms.
Marvin Minsky is recognized for his contributions to the field of artificial intelligence.
Richard Hamming researched numerical methods.
John McCarthy made contributions to the field of artificial intelligence. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1 reasoning:
- Among the Turing Award winners listed, Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy worked in artificial intelligence. Therefore, at least two winners worked in AI. True.

Question 2 reasoning:
- Considering people who worked in AI, Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, both have won the Turing Award. Therefore, at least two AI researchers have won the award. True.

Question 3 reasoning:
- The text states that Donald Knuth made contributions to the analysis of algorithms. It does not state whether others did or did not. We cannot conclude that only one winner did so. Unknown.

Question 4 reasoning:
- Richard Hamming, a Turing Award winner, researched numerical methods. This contradicts the statement that no winners worked in numerical methods. False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
4: False
