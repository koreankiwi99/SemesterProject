Premises: The Croton River watershed is the drainage basin of the Croton River.
The Croton River is in southwestern New York.
Water from the Croton River watershed flows to the Bronx.
The Bronx is in New York.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. The text states that water from the Croton River watershed flows to the Bronx, and that the Bronx is in New York. Therefore, it follows that the water flows to somewhere in New York.
2. The text does not say where the Croton River watershed is located, only that water from it flows to the Bronx and that the Croton River is in southwestern New York. This does not establish that the watershed is in the Bronx.
3. The text states that water from the watershed flows to the Bronx, but does not say that water from the Croton River itself flows to the Bronx. The watershed includes more than just the river, so this cannot be concluded.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
