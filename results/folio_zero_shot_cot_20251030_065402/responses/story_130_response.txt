==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- John goes iff Jack goes today.
- Jack goes iff (Iron Man is on AND weather is not bad today).
- Iron Man is on, so Jack goes iff weather is not bad today.
- We only know that some days in March have bad weather and it is March; this does not determine today’s weather.
- Therefore, whether Jack goes (and thus whether John goes) is undetermined.

Question 2:
- We know only that some days in March are bad and it is March.
- This does not indicate whether today is good or bad.
- Iron Man being on gives no information about the weather.
- Thus today’s weather status is undetermined.
