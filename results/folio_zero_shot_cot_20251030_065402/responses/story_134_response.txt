Premises: Islip Speedway is the smallest race track.

Islip doesn't have races held at it.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Islip Speedway is the smallest race track. There was a demolition derby on the smallest race track, so there was a demolition derby at Islip.
- If a speedway is still being used, then races are held at it. Islip does not have races held at it, so Islip is not still being used (modus tollens).
- From “Islip is either demolished or still being used” and “not still being used,” it follows that Islip is demolished.

Question 1:
- A demolition derby occurred at Islip, and Islip is demolished. Therefore, there has been a demolition derby at a place that has since been demolished. True.

Question 2:
- As shown above, Islip is demolished. True.

Question 3:
- Islip is not still being used. False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: False
