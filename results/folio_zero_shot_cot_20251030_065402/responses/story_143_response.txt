Story ID: 143
Premises: Video Gag is a French television series that airs weekly.
Video Gag airs on the French broadcast channel TF1. 
If viewers send funny videos to the French broadcast channel TF1, then Video Gag airs them weekly.
All videos aired on Video Gag are in French.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Given: If viewers send funny videos to TF1, then Video Gag airs them weekly. Also, all videos aired on Video Gag are in French.
- This implies: Any funny videos sent to TF1 (if any) would be aired on Video Gag and thus be in French.
- However, the premises do not state that viewers actually send any videos at all; the conditional does not guarantee existence.

Question 1:
- The statement asserts existence of viewer-sent funny videos and that they are in French.
- Existence is not established by the premises. Therefore, we cannot conclude this is true; nor is it contradicted.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement asserts existence of viewer-sent funny videos that are in English.
- From the premises, if any funny videos are sent, they would be aired and hence in French; if none are sent, the existential claim is false anyway.
- In all cases consistent with the premises, there are no sent English funny videos.
- Conclusion: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
