Story ID: 148
Premises: Boney M. had several German #1 singles.
"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!" was a big hit all over Europe.
"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!" was not in German #1 singles.
A song that peaks below #1 on the german charts is also a song that is not the #1 single in Germany.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Given: "Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!" was not in German #1 singles.
- Therefore, it was not a #1 hit in Germany.
- The statement claims it was #1, which contradicts the given information. So it is false.

Question 2:
- We know the song was not a German #1.
- We are given: If a song peaks below #1, then it is not #1. This is one-way.
- From "not #1," we cannot infer "peaked below #1" (it could have charted lower or not charted at all). So this is unknown.

Question 3:
- No information is given about UK chart positions.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether it peaked at #3 in the UK. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
