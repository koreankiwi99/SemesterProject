Story ID: 157
Premises: The party provides five kinds of fruits: strawberry, orange, blueberry, grape, and cherry.
If the fruit had the lowest remaining weight at the end of the party, then it means it was the most popular fruit.
At the end of the party, strawberries had the lowest remaining weight.
At the end of the party, the number of leftover blueberries was lower than that of cherries.
Benjamin only ate oranges and grapes at the party.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- The rule says: if a fruit had the lowest remaining weight, then it was the most popular. Strawberries had the lowest remaining weight, so strawberries were the most popular. Therefore, neither blueberries nor cherries were the most popular.
- The comparison of leftover numbers between blueberries and cherries is irrelevant to popularity, which is determined by weight.
- Benjamin only ate oranges and grapes, so he did not eat blueberries.
