Story ID: 161
Premises: There are five grades in English class: A+, A, B+, B, and C. 
If a student gets an A+ in English class, then his score is greater than 95.
If a student gets an A in English class, then his score is greater than 90 but lower than 95.
Zhang got an A in English class.
Wang's English class score is better than Zhang's.
Wu's English class score is lower than 90.
If a student's English class score is lower than 90, then it is not greater than 95 or 90, and lower than 95.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Zhang got an A.
- An A implies the score is >90 and <95.
- Therefore Zhang’s score is lower than 95.
Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- Wang’s score is better (higher) than Zhang’s.
- Zhang’s score is between 90 and 95 (exclusive).
- Wang’s score could still be below 95 (thus A) or above 95 (thus A+).
- Not enough information to conclude A+.
Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- Wu’s score is lower than 90.
- A requires >90 and <95; A+ requires >95.
- Therefore Wu cannot have A or A+.
Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: True
