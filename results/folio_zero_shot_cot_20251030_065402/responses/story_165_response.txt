Story ID: 165
Premises: Belgium, France, and Germany are European countries.
Paris is the capital of France.
The Eiffel Tower is one of the main tourist attractions located in Paris.
Some people who live in Belgium speak French.
If John goes to Europe, he will see some tourist attractions.
John speaks French.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. We know: If John goes to Europe, he will see some tourist attractions. That does not specify which ones. Speaking French does not imply he will visit Paris or the Eiffel Tower. Therefore, whether he will see the Eiffel Tower is not determined by the given information.
2. We know: Paris is the capital of France, and the Eiffel Tower is located in Paris. Therefore, the Eiffel Tower is located in the capital of France.
3. We know: Some people who live in Belgium speak French, and John speaks French. From "some people in Belgium speak French" we cannot infer that any given French speaker (John) lives in Belgium. No information specifies where John lives.
