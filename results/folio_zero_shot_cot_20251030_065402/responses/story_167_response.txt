Story ID: 167
Premises: If you go somewhere by train, you will not lose time.
If you go somewhere by car and meet a traffic jam, you will lose time.
If you lose time, you will be late for work.
Mary can get from New Haven to New York City either by train or car.
Mary is late for work.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Let:
- T = Mary goes by train
- C = Mary goes by car
- J = Mary meets a traffic jam
- L = Mary loses time
- Late = Mary is late for work

Given:
1) T -> ¬L
2) C ∧ J -> L
3) L -> Late
4) Mary can get from NH to NYC either by train or car (gives options, not exclusive certainty of which one she took)
5) Late is true

From 3), Late does not imply L (affirming the consequent is invalid), so L is Unknown.
From 1), we cannot infer ¬T from Late because we do not know L.
From 2), Late does not imply L, and even if L were true, that would not imply C ∧ J (again affirming the consequent).
Thus T, C, and J all remain undetermined.

Counterexamples showing consistency:
- She could have taken the train (T true), not lost time (¬L), yet still be late for another reason (Late true).
- She could have taken the car and met a traffic jam (C and J true), lost time (L), and be late (Late).

Therefore, each queried statement is not entailed by the premises.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
