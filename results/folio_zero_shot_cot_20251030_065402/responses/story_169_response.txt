==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

1. All volunteers receive intangible benefits. Natural disaster response is given as an example of volunteers working in groups on an as-needed basis, so those participants are volunteers and thus receive intangible benefits. Conclusion: True.

2. Environmental volunteers are defined by their contribution to environmental management or conservation. The text states volunteers work in groups or individually; it does not specify that environmental volunteers always work in groups. Therefore, we cannot conclude they necessarily work in groups. Conclusion: Unknown.

3. The text states that some volunteers are trained. This does not imply that all volunteers must be trained; it remains possible that training is not required. Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
