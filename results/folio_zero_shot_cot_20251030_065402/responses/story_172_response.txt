Story ID: 172
Premises: Indonesia is a country.
In Indonesia, the prosecutor only personally investigates cases of some special crimes.
Corruption is a type of crime.
Once the police complete crime investigations, the evidence is handed to the prosecutor. 
Evidence can be either satisfactory or unsatisfactory.
If the evidence is handed to the prosecutor and the evidence is satisfactory, the prosecutor will prosecute the offender in an appropriate court.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- When police complete investigations, evidence is handed to the prosecutor.
- If the evidence is satisfactory, the prosecutor will prosecute. Evidence can be satisfactory or unsatisfactory.
- Since we donâ€™t know whether the evidence is satisfactory in a given case, we cannot conclude that prosecution will always follow police completion.
- Therefore, the statement is uncertain.

Question 2:
- The prosecutor only personally investigates cases of some special crimes.
- Corruption is a type of crime, but it is not stated to be among those special crimes.
- We cannot conclude that corruption is one of the special crimes personally investigated by the prosecutor.
- Therefore, the statement is uncertain.

Question 3:
- The prosecutor only personally investigates cases of some special crimes.
- There is no rule stating that after police complete investigations, the prosecutor personally investigates; the described next step is evidence handover and possibly prosecution, not prosecutor-led investigation.
- Without knowing the crime is among the special ones or that the prosecutor investigates at that point, we cannot assert this universally.
- Therefore, the statement is uncertain.
