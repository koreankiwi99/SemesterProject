Story ID: 180
Premises: Sam is doing a project.
A project is written either in C++ or Python.
If Sam does a project written in Python, he will not use a Mac.
Sam is using a Mac.
If Sam uses a Mac, he will play a song.
If a song is not titled "Perfect," Sam will never play it.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From "If Sam does a project written in Python, he will not use a Mac" and "Sam is using a Mac," by contrapositive Samâ€™s project is not in Python. Given "A project is written either in C++ or Python," it must be in C++. So Q1 is True.

- From "Sam is using a Mac" and "If Sam uses a Mac, he will play a song," Sam plays a song. From "If a song is not titled 'Perfect,' Sam will never play it," any song he plays must be titled "Perfect." So Q2 is True.

- "If a song is not titled 'Perfect,' Sam will never play it" does not imply the converse. We know he plays at least one Perfect song, but nothing states he plays every song titled "Perfect." Thus the conditional "If a song is titled 'Perfect', Sam will play it" is not entailed. So Q3 is Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
