Story ID: 186
Premises: If a person doesn't have enough money to buy a product, then that person can't buy it.
Monitors are products.
4k monitors are more expensive than 1080 monitors and 2k monitors.
John is a person.
John doesn't have enough money to buy a 2k monitor.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Question 1: We only know John lacks enough money for a 2k monitor. There is no stated price relationship between 2k and 1080 monitors, and the given comparisons only relate 4k to 1080 and 2k. Therefore, we cannot infer John’s ability to buy a 1080 monitor.
- Question 2: A 2k monitor is a product. Given John doesn’t have enough money to buy a 2k monitor, the rule implies he can’t buy it.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
