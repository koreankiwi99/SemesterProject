Story ID: 18
Premises: Miroslav Fiedler was a Czech mathematician.
Miroslav Fiedler is known for his contributions to linear algebra and graph theory.
Miroslav Fiedler is honored by the Fiedler eigenvalue.
Fiedler eigenvalue is the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. He is honored by the Fiedler eigenvalue, which is defined as the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian. Therefore, he is honored by that eigenvalue.
2. The text states he was a Czech mathematician, not French. So the statement is false.
3. Since Miroslav Fiedler is a Czech mathematician and is known for contributions to linear algebra and graph theory, the existential claim that a Czech mathematician is known for such contributions is true.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: True
