Story ID: 196
Premises: ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education. 
ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.
Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions. 
ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1 reasoning:
The context states that ETS develops K-12 statewide assessments and that many of its assessments are associated with entry to US tertiary and quaternary education institutions. Therefore, the statement combining both is supported.

Question 2 reasoning:
The context explicitly says ETS administers international tests. Therefore, the claim that it doesn't administer tests internationally is contradicted.

Question 3 reasoning:
While the context says ETS administers international tests including TOEFL, GRE, and subject tests, it does not specify any countries. There is no mention of China, so this cannot be concluded from the given information.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: Unknown
