The PlayStation Eye is a camera accessory for the PlayStation 3 system.
The PlayStation Camera is a camera accessory for the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 5 systems.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- The PlayStation Eye is a camera accessory for PS3, so it is compatible with PS3.
- Only the PlayStation Camera is compatible with different systems. Therefore, the PlayStation Eye cannot be compatible with more than one system.
- Hence, it cannot be compatible with both PS2 and PS3. Statement is false.

Question 2:
- The PlayStation EyeToy is a camera accessory for PS2, and accessories for a system are compatible with that system.
- Statement is true.

Question 3:
- The PlayStation Camera is a camera accessory for PS4 and PS5, so it is compatible with those.
- There is no information stating it is compatible with PS2 or PS3. Being the only one compatible with different systems does not imply compatibility with all systems.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude it works for all PlayStation consoles. Truth value is unknown.
