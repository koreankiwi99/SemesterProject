Story ID: 201
Premises: A game is played with three stages: red stage, yellow stage, and green stage.
Each player begins at the red stage.
All players must reach the yellow stage before they can reach the green stage.
The yellow stage comes after the red stage.
All players must proceed one stage at a time.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1 reasoning:
- Players must proceed one stage at a time and must reach yellow before green. Skipping yellow to get to green is disallowed.
- Conclusion: It is not possible.

Question 2 reasoning:
- From red, a player can proceed one stage to yellow. There is no rule that forces continuing to green.
- Conclusion: It is possible.

Question 3 reasoning:
- A game with three stages (red → yellow → green) implies completion requires reaching the final stage, green.
- Conclusion: Completing the game without reaching green is not possible.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: False
