Story ID: 207
Premises: TOra is a GUI.
GUIs are software.
Software can be free or paid.
Paid Software is not under the GNU General Public License.
TOra is under the GNU General Public License.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- TOra is a GUI, and GUIs are software, so TOra is software.
- Paid software is not under the GNU GPL, and TOra is under the GNU GPL. Therefore, TOra is not paid software.

Question 1:
- Since TOra is not paid software, the statement "TOra is a paid software" is false.

Question 2:
- From the given information, we only know TOra is not paid. The statement "Software can be free or paid" does not guarantee that all non-paid software is free, nor is there any rule linking GPL status to being free in this context. Therefore, we cannot conclude it is free.
