Premises: The Great Lakes are Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario.
Some major settlements of Lake Erie are in NY, PA, OH, and MI.
NY, PA, OH, and MI are states in the US.
ON is a state of Canada.
There is a major settlement of Lake Huron in ON. 
All states are in their country.
The US is in North America.
The Great Lakes began to form at the end of the Last Glacial Period.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) The text states, "Some major settlements of Lake Erie are in NY, PA, OH, and MI." This implies Lake Erie has at least one major settlement. Therefore, the statement is true.

2) The text says, "The Great Lakes began to form at the end of the Last Glacial Period." This indicates the start of their formation, not necessarily that they were fully formed at that time. The claim asserts existence of a Great Lake that did not form at that time; the provided information doesn't determine this either way. Therefore, it is unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
