Story ID: 210
Premises: The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.
Platypuses are not hyrax.
Echidnas are not hyrax.
No mammals are invertebrates.
All animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates.
Mammals are animals.
Hyraxes are mammals.
Grebes lay eggs.
Grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

1) Hyraxes are mammals. Only mammals that lay eggs are platypuses or echidnas. From “Platypuses are not hyrax” and “Echidnas are not hyrax,” by contrapositive, hyraxes are neither platypuses nor echidnas. Therefore, hyraxes cannot be mammals that lay eggs. So “Hyraxes lay eggs” is false.

2) Grebes lay eggs and are neither platypuses nor echidnas. If a mammal lays eggs, it must be a platypus or an echidna. Thus, if grebes were mammals, they would have to be one of those, which they are not. Therefore grebes are not mammals. The statement is true.

3) From the given information we cannot conclude that platypuses are mammals or even animals. Without that, we cannot derive that they are vertebrates. So this is unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: Unknown
