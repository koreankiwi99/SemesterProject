Story ID: 214
Premises: If a class has prerequisites, the student must take the prerequisites to take the class.
If a class has no prerequisites, then the student can take the class
CPSC 201 and CPSC 223 are prerequisites for CPSC 323.
Intro Microeconomics is the only prerequisite for Intermediate Microeconomics.
Intro Geology has no prerequisites.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

1. We are told CPSC 201 is a prerequisite for CPSC 323, but nothing is said about whether CPSC 201 itself has prerequisites. Therefore, we cannot determine if it has none. Unknown.

2. CPSC 323 requires both CPSC 201 and CPSC 223. A student who took 201 but not 223 has not met all prerequisites, so they cannot take CPSC 323. The statement claiming they can is false.

3. Intro Geology has no prerequisites. By the rule, if a class has no prerequisites, the student can take it. Therefore, the claim that a student cannot take Intro Geology is false.

4. We are told Intro Microeconomics is the only prerequisite for Intermediate Microeconomics, which means exactly one prerequisite. True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: False
4: True
