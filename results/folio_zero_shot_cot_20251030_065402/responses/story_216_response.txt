Premises: Olivia doesn't prefer warm temperatures during the day.
When Olivia sleeps, she prefers a cool temperature.
Olivia sleeps during the night.
Olivia works during the day.
Olivia either works or sleeps.
It is either the day or the night.
Olivia either prefers warm temperatures or prefers cool temperatures.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- It is either day or night at any time.
- Night: Olivia sleeps at night, and when she sleeps, she prefers a cool temperature. So at night, she prefers cool.
- Day: Olivia doesnâ€™t prefer warm during the day. Given she either prefers warm or prefers cool, not warm implies cool. So during the day, she prefers cool.
- Therefore, in both possible times (day or night), Olivia prefers a cool temperature.
