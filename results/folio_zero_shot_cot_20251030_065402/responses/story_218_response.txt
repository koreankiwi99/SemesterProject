==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) “Maya would only play the violin if her fingers could never be injured” means: If Maya plays the violin, then it must be impossible for her fingers to be injured.
2) “Volleyball players can injure their ankles, fingers, or shoulder” means a volleyball player’s fingers can be injured (it’s possible).
3) Maya is a volleyball player, so it’s possible for her fingers to be injured. Therefore, it’s not true that her fingers could never be injured.
4) By contrapositive of the first statement, since the necessary condition (fingers could never be injured) is not met, Maya will not play the violin.
