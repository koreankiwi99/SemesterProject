Story ID: 21
Premises: The Golden State Warriors are a team from San Francisco.
The Golden State Warriors won the NBA finals.
All teams attending the NBA finals have won many games.
Boston Celtics are a team that lost the NBA finals.
If a team wins the NBA finals, then they will have more income.
If a team wins or loses at the NBA finals, then they are attending the finals.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
Q1: We know only that the Golden State Warriors are from San Francisco. We have no information about the Boston Celtics’ location. Losing the finals implies attending, and attending implies having won many games, but nothing about city. Therefore, we cannot determine the Celtics’ city.

Q2: There is no information about the Boston Celtics’ years of experience, so this cannot be determined.

Q3: The Warriors won the NBA finals, and winners will have more income (unspecified source). The claim specifies “from gate receipts,” which is not stated or implied by the given information. Thus we cannot conclude this specific source of increased income.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
