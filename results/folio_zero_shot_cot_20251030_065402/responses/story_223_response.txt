Story ID: 223
Premises: David Ha'ivri is a political strategist. 
If you are born in Israel to at least one Israeli parent, you receive Israeli citizenship at birth. 
David Ha'ivri emigrated to the United States from Israel, where he was born to Israeli parents. 
Several Zionist leaders have been elected to the Shomron Regional Municipal council. 
David Ha'ivri is a Zionist leader.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. He was born in Israel to Israeli parents. The rule states that being born in Israel to at least one Israeli parent grants Israeli citizenship at birth. Therefore, he is an Israeli citizen.
2. He emigrated to the United States, but emigration does not imply citizenship. There is no information about naturalization or birthright citizenship in the U.S. Therefore, we cannot conclude he is a U.S. citizen.
3. While several Zionist leaders have been elected to the Shomron Regional Municipal council, this does not imply that every Zionist leader, including David Ha'ivri, has been elected. No direct evidence is given for his election.
