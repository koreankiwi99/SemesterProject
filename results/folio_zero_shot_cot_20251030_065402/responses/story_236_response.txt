Story ID: 236
Premises: Cancer biology is finding genetic alterations that confer a selective advantage to cancer cells. 
Cancer researchers have frequently ranked the importance of substitutions to cancer growth by the P value.
P values are thresholds for belief, not metrics of effect. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) The context says researchers have frequently ranked importance by P value, not by cancer effect size. Therefore, the statement that they tend to use effect size is contradicted.
2) The context states P values are thresholds for belief, not metrics of effect. Selection intensity is a metric of effect, so P value does not represent it.
3) Since researchers frequently use P values to rank importance, it does not indicate that cancer effect size is their preferred metric.
4) The text explicitly states P values are not metrics of effect.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: False
3: False
4: True
