Story ID: 238
Premises: Daniel is a software engineer, and he works at Palantir Technologies.
Daniel studied bioengineering during his undergraduate at Rice University.
Daniel’s older sister works at Meta as a technical sourcer. 
Daniel’s dad and older sister both graduated from Stanford University.
Daniel’s dad is a doctor practicing internal medicine at a veteran’s hospital in Minneapolis.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1 reasoning:
The text states that Daniel’s dad and older sister are Stanford alumni, but it provides no information about whether Daniel applied to Stanford or was rejected. Therefore, the claim about him applying and not getting in is not supported by the given information.

Question 2 reasoning:
The text explicitly says Daniel studied bioengineering during his undergraduate at Rice University. This directly supports the statement.

Question 3 reasoning:
The text mentions Daniel’s dad practices internal medicine at a veteran’s hospital in Minneapolis, but it does not state where Daniel and his sister grew up. A parent’s current work location does not establish the children’s upbringing location.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
