Story ID: 241
Premises: All students learning piano can strike the right notes. 
All students who can strike the right note can get the rhythms right. 
If a student can get the rhythms right, he will start working on coordination between the left and the right hands. 
Some students who start working on coordination between the left and the right hands become good at it, while other students find it challenging. 
If John can strike the right notes, get the rhythms right, and is good at coordination between right and left hands, then he puts emotions into his playing. 
John is a student learning piano. 
John does not find coordination between the left and the right hands challenging. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- John is a student learning piano.
- All students learning piano can strike the right notes.
- All who can strike the right notes can get the rhythms right.
- Therefore, John can get the rhythms right.
Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- If John can strike the right notes, get the rhythms right, and is good at coordination, then he puts emotions into his playing.
- We have established John can strike the right notes and get the rhythms right.
- From getting rhythms right, John starts working on coordination.
- We know some who start working become good, others find it challenging. John does not find it challenging, but this does not logically entail that he is good (the statement is not strictly exhaustive).
- Thus, we cannot conclude he is good at coordination, so we cannot trigger the sufficient condition for “puts emotions.”
- Also, the conditional does not give a necessary condition; he might still put emotions even if not good.
Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
