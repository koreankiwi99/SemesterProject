Story ID: 24
Premises: If a Leetcode problem is at the easy level, then its AC rate is lower than 20 percent. 
All Leetcode problems that are recommended to novices are easy. 
A Leetode problem is either easy or hard.
Leetcode problems that are starred by more than one thousand users are hard.
2Sum is recommended to novices. 
4Sum is starred by more than 1,000 users.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) From "All problems recommended to novices are easy" and "2Sum is recommended to novices," it follows that 2Sum is easy. So the statement is true.

2) From "Problems starred by more than 1,000 users are hard" and "4Sum is starred by more than 1,000 users," 4Sum is hard. Given "A problem is either easy or hard," being hard implies not easy. Since "recommended to novices -> easy," by contrapositive, not easy -> not recommended. Therefore, 4Sum is not recommended to novices. The statement is false.

3) From (1), 2Sum is easy. Using "If a problem is easy, then its AC rate is lower than 20%," 2Sumâ€™s AC rate is < 20%. Therefore, the claim that it is higher than 20% is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: False
