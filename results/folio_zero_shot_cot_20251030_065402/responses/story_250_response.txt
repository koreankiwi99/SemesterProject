Story ID: 250
Premises: All people who repay their loans on time have a high credit score.
Some people with high credit scores and high salaries are approved for mortgages.
John has a high salary.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "All people who repay their loans on time have a high credit score," if John repays on time, then he has a high credit score.
- John has a high salary.
- The second statement says only that some people with both high credit scores and high salaries are approved for mortgages; it does not say all such people are approved.
- Therefore, even if John repays on time (thus has high credit and high salary), we cannot conclude he will be approved. It remains uncertain.
