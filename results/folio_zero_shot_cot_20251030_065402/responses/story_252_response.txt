Premises: For a country, if effective monetary policy is possible, it must have successful inflation control and a strong national currency.
A country cannot simultaneously regulate the exchange rate and successfully control inflation.
The introduction of an embargo on foreign trade goods in a country leads to a sharp decrease in exports.
If exports fall sharply, this country's national currency cannot be strong.
Inflation control is required to have a strong national currency. 
There is an embargo on Russian foreign trade goods.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- There is an embargo on Russian foreign trade goods. By premise 3, embargo -> sharp decrease in exports. Thus, Russia’s exports fall sharply.

- Premise 1: If effective monetary policy is possible, the country must have successful inflation control and a strong national currency. Since Russia’s currency is not strong, the necessary condition fails; thus effective monetary policy is not possible in Russia.
