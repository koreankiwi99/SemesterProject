All snakes are reptiles.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Premise 1: No reptile has fur. This means for any x, if x is a reptile, then x does not have fur.
- Premise 2: All snakes are reptiles. This means for any x, if x is a snake, then x is a reptile.
- From these, if x is a snake, then x is a reptile, and thus x does not have fur. Therefore, no snake has fur.
- The statement "Some snake has fur" asserts the existence of at least one snake with fur, which contradicts the derived conclusion.

Therefore, the statement is false.

ANSWERS:
1: False
