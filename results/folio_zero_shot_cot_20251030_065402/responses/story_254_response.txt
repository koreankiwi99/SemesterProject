Story ID: 254
Premises: All rabbits have fur
Some pets are rabbits.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- All rabbits have fur means every rabbit is a furred animal.
- Some pets are rabbits means there exists at least one pet that is a rabbit.
- Therefore, at least one pet has fur (the pet(s) that are rabbits).
- The statement "Some pets do not have fur" is not entailed by the premises; it could be true or false depending on whether there exist non-rabbit pets without fur. The premises do not settle this.
