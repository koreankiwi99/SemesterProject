Premises: No homework is fun.
Some reading is homework.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Premises:
  - No homework is fun. So all homework is not fun.
  - Some reading is homework. So there exists at least one reading that is homework, hence not fun.

- From these, we can conclude: Some reading is not fun.
- The statement "Some reading is fun" does not follow. It could be true (if there are other readings that are not homework and are fun) or false (if no reading is fun). Therefore, it is not determined by the premises.
