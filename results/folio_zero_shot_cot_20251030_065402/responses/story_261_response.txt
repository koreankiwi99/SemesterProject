Premises: All nuclear-powered submarines are warships.
No nuclear-powered submarines are commercial vessels.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let N = nuclear-powered submarines, W = warships, C = commercial vessels.
- Given: N ⊆ W and N ∩ C = ∅.
- The claim “No warships are commercial vessels” means W ∩ C = ∅.
- Knowing only that a subset of W (namely N) is disjoint from C does not imply that all of W is disjoint from C. Other warships (W \ N) could potentially be commercial.
- Therefore, the statement does not logically follow from the premises, nor is its negation established.
