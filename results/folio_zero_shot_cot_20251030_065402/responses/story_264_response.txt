Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Premise 1: No television stars are certified public accountants. So if someone is a television star, they are not a CPA.
- Premise 2: All CPAs have good business sense. So being a CPA implies having good business sense.
- The conclusion asks whether all television stars have good business sense. The premises only tell us that CPAs have good business sense; they say nothing about people who are not CPAs. Since all television stars are non-CPAs, we cannot infer anything about their business sense from the given information.
