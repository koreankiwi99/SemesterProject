Story ID: 265
Premises: All Senate Republicans are elected officials.
Some elected officials are not conservatives.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Premises:
  - All Senate Republicans (SR) are elected officials (E): SR ⊆ E.
  - Some elected officials are not conservatives (C): ∃x (x ∈ E ∧ x ∉ C).
- These do not guarantee the existence of any conservatives, nor do they constrain where conservatives (if any) fall relative to SR.
- Possible model where the statement is false: No conservatives exist (C = ∅), E contains at least one non-conservative; then “Some conservatives are not SR” is false.
- Possible model where the statement is true: There exists a conservative who is not SR; still have at least one elected official who is not conservative to satisfy the second premise.

Conclusion: The statement is not entailed nor contradicted—it's undetermined.
