Story ID: 268
Premises: No people who do not admit a mistake are good teachers.
Some well-informed people are people who do not admit a mistake.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let D = people who do not admit a mistake, G = good teachers, W = well-informed people.
- Premise 1: No D are G → G ∩ D = ∅ (equivalently, all G are not D).
- Premise 2: Some W are D → there exists x with x ∈ W ∩ D.
- From Premise 1, that x is not in G, so some well-informed people are not good teachers. However, this gives no information about whether some good teachers are not well-informed.
- It is consistent with the premises that:
  - All good teachers are well-informed (then the statement is false), or
  - Some good teachers are not well-informed (then the statement is true).
- Therefore, the truth of the statement cannot be determined from the premises.
