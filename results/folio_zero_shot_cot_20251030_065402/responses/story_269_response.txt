All enzymes are organic compounds.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Given: Proteins ⊆ Organic compounds; Enzymes ⊆ Organic compounds.
- We are asked if Enzymes ⊆ Proteins.
- From two subsets of the same superset, we cannot infer one subset is contained in the other.
- Counterexample: Let organic compounds include proteins and non-protein compounds; enzymes could be non-protein organic compounds. Premises hold while conclusion fails.
