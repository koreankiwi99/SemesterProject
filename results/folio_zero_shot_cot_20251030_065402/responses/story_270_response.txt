Premises: No sports cars are vehicles intended to be driven at moderate speeds.
All automobiles designed for family use are vehicles intended to be driven at moderate speeds.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
From the premises:
- No sports cars are vehicles intended to be driven at moderate speeds (S ⊆ not M).
- All automobiles designed for family use are vehicles intended to be driven at moderate speeds (F ⊆ M).

If something were both a sports car and a family-use automobile, it would have to be in M (from F ⊆ M) and not in M (from S ⊆ not M), which is impossible. Therefore, S and F are disjoint, so no sports cars are automobiles designed for family use.

1: True
