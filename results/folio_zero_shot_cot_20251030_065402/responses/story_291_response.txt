Some streets are roads.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Premise 1: No road is dustless. So any road cannot be dustless.
- Premise 2: Some streets are roads. Therefore, those particular streets that are roads are not dustless.
- The statement "Some streets are dustless" would require existence of at least one street that is dustless. This could be true if there are streets that are not roads and are dustless, but the premises do not provide information about such streets.
- It is also possible that all streets are roads, in which case no streets are dustless.
- Therefore, the truth of the statement cannot be determined from the given information.
