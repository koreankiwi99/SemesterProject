Story ID: 297
Premises: If a person is hungry, the person is uncomfortable.
If a person is uncomfortable, the person is unhappy.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Premises: Hungry -> Uncomfortable; Uncomfortable -> Unhappy. Therefore, Hungry -> Unhappy.
- The query is about: Not Hungry -> Unhappy.
- This does not follow from the premises. Countermodel: a person who is not hungry and not unhappy satisfies both premises (both conditionals hold vacuously) but makes the statement false.
- Since there are models where the statement is true (e.g., not hungry and unhappy) and models where it is false, it is not determined by the premises.
