Story ID: 302
Premises: Not all art pieces require talent.
Everything that requires talent requires practice.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “Not all art pieces require talent,” there exists at least one art piece that does not require talent.
- From “Everything that requires talent requires practice,” we have T → P, and its contrapositive ¬P → ¬T.
- However, from ¬T we cannot infer ¬P. An art piece that does not require talent may or may not require practice.
- Both scenarios (all art pieces require practice, or some do not) are consistent with the premises.
