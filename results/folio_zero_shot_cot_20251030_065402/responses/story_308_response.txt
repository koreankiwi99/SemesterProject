Story ID: 308
Premises: No video games released by Nintendo support the PS4 platform.
All video games in the Pokemon series are released by Nintendo. 
All video games in the FIFA series support the PS4 platform. 
All video games that allow users to simulate playing online soccer using licensed players are in the FIFA series.
The video game named “Be Lionel” is in the Pokemon series, or it allows users to simulate playing online soccer games using licensed players.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- If a game is released by Nintendo, it does not support PS4.
- All Pokemon games are released by Nintendo, so Pokemon ⇒ not PS4.
- All FIFA games support PS4, so FIFA ⇒ PS4.
- If a game allows licensed online soccer, then it is FIFA, so Allows ⇒ FIFA.
- For Be Lionel (BL): Pokemon(BL) or Allows(BL). Hence Pokemon(BL) or FIFA(BL).

Question 1:
We only know BL is either Pokemon or FIFA (via Allows ⇒ FIFA), but not which. So whether BL is Pokemon is not determined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
Consider two cases.
- If BL is FIFA, then PS4 holds; first disjunct (FIFA and PS4) is true.
- If BL is not FIFA, then not Allows (contrapositive of Allows ⇒ FIFA). From Pokemon or Allows, we get Pokemon, hence not PS4. Thus second disjunct (not FIFA and not PS4) is true.
In all cases, the statement holds. Answer: True.

Question 3:
Again two cases.
- If BL is FIFA, then the disjunction (FIFA or PS4) is true.
- If BL is Pokemon, then not PS4 and (by consistency with the rules) not FIFA, making the disjunction false.
Since both are possible under the premises, the truth is not determined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 4:
From Pokemon(BL) or Allows(BL) and Allows ⇒ FIFA, we get Pokemon(BL) or FIFA(BL). So BL cannot be in neither series. The statement “not in FIFA or Pokemon” is therefore false. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: Unknown
4: False
