Story ID: 309
Premises: Tipped employees are not entitled to be paid the federal minimum wage by their employees. 
If a person is a white-collar worker, they are entitled to be paid the federal minimum wage by their employees. 
All lawyers are white-collar workers.
Every advocate is a lawyer.
Mary is not a lawyer or a tipped employee.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let T = tipped employee, E = entitled to federal minimum wage, W = white-collar, L = lawyer, A = advocate.
- Given: T -> ¬E; W -> E; L -> W; A -> L.
- "Mary is not a lawyer or a tipped employee" is read as neither: ¬L(Mary) and ¬T(Mary).
- From A -> L and ¬L(Mary), by contrapositive, ¬A(Mary).

Question 1: From ¬L we cannot infer ¬W; W remains undetermined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: From ¬L and A -> L (contrapositive), ¬A. So "Mary is an advocate" is false. Answer: False.

Question 3: From above, ¬A is true. Answer: True.

Question 4: A ∨ T is false since both ¬A and ¬T. Answer: False.

Question 5: The statement is ¬(A ∧ E) -> ¬T. Since ¬T is true, the implication is true. Answer: True.

Question 6: (A ∨ T) -> A. Antecedent is false (both ¬A and ¬T), so implication is true. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
4: False
5: True
6: True
