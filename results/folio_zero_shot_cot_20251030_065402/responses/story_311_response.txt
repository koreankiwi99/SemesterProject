Story ID: 311
Premises: No payment cards issued by Russian banks can be used with ApplePay.
All MIR payment cards are issued by Russian banks.
Some international payment cards can be used with ApplePay.
Social payments in Russia can only be transferred to MIR payment cards.
Bank of America payment cards can be used with ApplePay.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Bank of America (BoA) cards can be used with ApplePay.
- Some international cards can be used with ApplePay, but not all ApplePay-eligible cards must be international.
- Russian-issued cards can’t be used with ApplePay, so BoA cards are not issued by Russian banks, but that alone doesn’t imply they are international.
- Conclusion: Cannot determine if BoA cards are international.

Question 2:
- Only MIR cards can receive social payments in Russia.
- All MIR cards are issued by Russian banks, and no Russian-issued cards can be used with ApplePay.
- BoA cards can be used with ApplePay, so they cannot be MIR.
- Therefore, BoA cards cannot be used to transfer (receive) social payments in Russia. The conjunction “international and can be used to transfer social payments in Russia” is false because the second part is false.

Question 3:
- The statement is of the form: If (P and Q) then P, which is a tautology.
- Therefore it is true regardless of the facts about BoA cards.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
