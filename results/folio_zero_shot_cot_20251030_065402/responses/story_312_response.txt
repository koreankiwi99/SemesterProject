==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “Every who studies in the United States as a foreigner has the authorization to study in the U.S.” and “To have the authorization to study in the United States as a foreigner, you must be enrolled in an academic program,” it follows: if someone studies in the U.S. as a foreigner, then they are enrolled.
- From “If Tom does not study in the United States as a foreigner, he is enrolled in an academic program,” whether Tom studies as a foreigner or not, Tom is enrolled. So Tom is enrolled.
- From “Those who are enrolled in an academic program can not work full-time,” Tom cannot work full-time.
- From “All PhD graduate can work full-time,” contraposition gives: if someone cannot work full-time, then they are not a PhD graduate. So Tom is not a PhD graduate.
- There is no information about Tom’s desires; thus nothing can be concluded about whether he wants to study abroad.
