Story ID: 313
Premises: Some of those who apply for a Schengen visa get it.
To apply for a Schengen Visa, you need to provide financial guarantees.
If you need to provide financial guarantees, you must request documents from the bank.
Do not close your bank account if you request documents from the bank.
Philip closed his bank account.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Let A = Philip applied for a Schengen visa; F = Philip needed to provide financial guarantees; R = Philip requested documents from the bank; C = Philip closed his bank account; G = Philip got a Schengen visa.

From the premises:
- A -> F
- F -> R
- R -> ¬C
- C

By contraposition chaining: C -> ¬R -> ¬F -> ¬A. So Philip did not request documents and did not apply.

Question 1:
We have no rule linking G to A except “some applicants get it” (existential, not about Philip). From ¬A we cannot conclude ¬G. Therefore Unknown.

Question 2:
“Philip applied and got it” requires A, but we have ¬A. Therefore False.

Question 3:
Antecedent is “¬R or G.” Since ¬R is true, the antecedent is true. Consequent “¬A” is also true. Therefore the implication is True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
