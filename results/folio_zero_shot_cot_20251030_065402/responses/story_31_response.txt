==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. The text states naive cynicism was proposed by Justin Kruger and a colleague, and that Thomas Gilovich is a colleague of Kruger. However, it does not specify that Gilovich is the particular colleague who co-proposed it. Therefore, we cannot conclude he proposed it.
2. Naive cynicism is a philosophy of mind, and Justin Kruger proposed naive cynicism (with a colleague). Hence, he proposed a philosophy of mind.
3. The text gives no information about Thomas Gilovich working on philosophies of mind; being a colleague of Kruger does not imply this.
