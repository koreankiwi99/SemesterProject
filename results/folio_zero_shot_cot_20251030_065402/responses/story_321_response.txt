Story ID: 321
Premises: No people who have corporate jobs are taking more than normal financial risks.
All entrepreneurs are taking more than normal financial risks.
All risk-averse working people are people who have corporate jobs.
All working people who hate working for others want to be entrepreneurs.
If Mark Zuckerberg is neither an entrepreneur nor a person who hates working for others, then Mark Zuckerberg is not a risk-averse working person.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: Entrepreneurs take more than normal financial risks; people with corporate jobs do not. Therefore, no entrepreneur has a corporate job. Risk-averse working people have corporate jobs, so they do not take more than normal risks and cannot be entrepreneurs. Working people who hate working for others merely want to be entrepreneurs (does not imply they are entrepreneurs).
- The only statement about Mark is conditional: If Mark is neither an entrepreneur nor someone who hates working for others, then he is not a risk-averse working person. This does not assert whether he is an entrepreneur, whether he hates working for others, or whether he is risk-averse in general.

Question 1: There is no information establishing that Mark is an entrepreneur. Unknown.

Question 2: Nothing establishes that Mark is risk-averse; the conditional only rules out him being both risk-averse and working under a specific condition. Unknown.

Question 3: We also cannot conclude that Mark is not risk-averse; the conditional does not imply that, nor do other premises. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
