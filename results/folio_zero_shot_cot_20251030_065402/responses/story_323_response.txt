Premises: No disposable products can help slow down global warming. 
All eco-friendly brands can help slow down global warming. 
All sustainable fashion brands are eco-friendly brands.
All fast fashion products are disposable products.
If Reformation is not helping slow down global warming, then Reformation is an eco-friendly brand or a sustainable fashion brand.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
First, derive what we can:
- From All sustainable fashion brands are eco-friendly and All eco-friendly brands can help, we get: sustainable fashion brand ⇒ eco-friendly brand ⇒ helps.
- Given If Reformation is not helping, then Reformation is eco-friendly or sustainable, and since both eco-friendly and sustainable imply helps, we have: not helps(Reformation) ⇒ helps(Reformation). Hence helps(Reformation) must be true. However, helps does not imply eco-friendly.

- From All fast fashion products are disposable products, if a brand produces fast fashion products, then it produces disposable products (PF → PD). The converse (PD → PF) is not supported.

Now answer each question:

Question 1: Is Reformation an eco-friendly brand?
- We know Reformation helps, but helps does not imply eco-friendly. No further information ties Reformation to being eco-friendly. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Does Reformation produce fast fashion products?
- No information about Reformation’s production is given. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3: Does Reformation not produce fast fashion products?
- Same as Q2; no information to conclude the negation either. Answer: Unknown.

Question 4: Reformation does not produce fast fashion products or does not produce disposable products (¬PF ∨ ¬PD).
- Since PF → PD, this disjunction is equivalent to ¬PF, which remains undetermined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 5: If Reformation produces disposable products, then Reformation produces fast fashion products (PD → PF).
- We only have PF → PD, not its converse. The statement is not entailed nor contradicted. Answer: Unknown.

Question 6: If Reformation produces fast fashion products or helps slow down global warming, then Reformation produces fast fashion products ((PF ∨ H) → PF).
- We know H is true, so the antecedent is true, and the statement reduces to PF, which is undetermined. Answer: Unknown.
