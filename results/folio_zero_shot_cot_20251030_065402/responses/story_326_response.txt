Stephen Curry is an NBA player.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- All NBA players are professional basketball players; Stephen Curry is an NBA player, so he is a professional basketball player.
- No soccer players are professional basketball players; therefore Stephen Curry is not a soccer player.
- All soccer defenders are soccer players; therefore Stephen Curry is not a soccer defender.

Question 1:
- The premises do not state that all center-backs are soccer defenders or soccer players; we only know some soccer defenders are center-backs.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether Stephen Curry is a center-back from the given information.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Since Stephen Curry is not a soccer defender, he cannot be both a centerback and a soccer defender.
- Answer: True.

Question 3:
- Antecedent: “Stephen Curry is not both a centerback and a soccer defender” is true (as he is not a soccer defender).
- Consequent: “Stephen Curry is neither a soccer player nor a professional basketball player” is false because he is a professional basketball player.
- A true antecedent and false consequent make the conditional false.
- Answer: False.
