Premises: No professional basketball players are soccer players.
All NBA players are professional basketball players.
All soccer defenders are soccer players.
All centerbacks are soccer defenders.
Roger Federer is either both an NBA player and a soccer defender, or neither.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the premises: 
  - All NBA players are professional basketball players (NBA ⊆ PB).
  - No professional basketball players are soccer players (PB ∩ SP = ∅).
  - All soccer defenders are soccer players (SD ⊆ SP).
  - All centerbacks are soccer defenders (CB ⊆ SD ⊆ SP).
  - Roger Federer: NBA iff SD (either both or neither).

- If Roger were both NBA and SD, then he would be PB (from NBA) and SP (from SD), which is impossible because no PB are SP. Therefore, the “both” option is impossible. Given “either both or neither,” it follows that Roger is neither NBA nor SD.

- Since Roger is not SD and CB implies SD, Roger cannot be a centerback.

- Whether Roger is a soccer player is not determined: not being an SD does not rule out being a soccer player in another position, and not being NBA does not tell us whether he is a professional basketball player (which would preclude being a soccer player). So his soccer-player status remains unknown.
