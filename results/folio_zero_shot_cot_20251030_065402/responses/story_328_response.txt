Premises: No soccer players are professional basketball players.
All NBA players are professional basketball players.
All soccer defenders are soccer players.
All centerback players are soccer defenders.
If Stephen Curry is an NBA player or a soccer player, then he is a professional basketball player.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
First, derive a key fact:
- If Stephen Curry were a soccer player, then by the last statement he would be a professional basketball player. But “No soccer players are professional basketball players” says any soccer player is not a professional basketball player. Hence assuming he is a soccer player leads to a contradiction, so Stephen Curry is not a soccer player.

Question 1:
- No premise asserts he is an NBA player, and the conditional does not assert its antecedent. From “not a soccer player” we still cannot conclude NBA. So this is unknown.

Question 2:
- All centerbacks are soccer defenders, and all soccer defenders are soccer players; thus centerback implies soccer player. Since Stephen Curry is not a soccer player, he cannot be a centerback. So the statement “Stephen Curry is a centerback player” is false.

Question 3:
- The negation of Question 2: since he is not a centerback, “Stephen Curry is not a centerback player” is true.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
