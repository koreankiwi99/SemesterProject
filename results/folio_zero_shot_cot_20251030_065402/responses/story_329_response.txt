Story ID: 329
Premises: All young working professionals who have regular 9-5 jobs have stable jobs.
Some people living in Manhattan are young professionals with regular 9-5 jobs.
All people who have stable jobs are people who work regularly.
People who work regularly do not frequently disobey their bosses.
Mary either frequently disobeys her bosses and works regularly, or that she neither frequently disobeys her bosses nor works regularly.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “People who work regularly do not frequently disobey their bosses” and “Mary either (frequently disobeys and works regularly) or (neither disobeys nor works regularly),” the first option (disobeys and works regularly) is impossible. Therefore, Mary does not work regularly and does not frequently disobey.
- From “All young working professionals with regular 9-5 jobs have stable jobs” and “All with stable jobs work regularly,” we get: if someone is a young working professional with a regular 9-5 job, then they work regularly.
- Since Mary does not work regularly, she cannot be a young working professional with a regular 9-5 job.
- The statement about some Manhattan residents being young professionals with 9-5 jobs does not mention Mary specifically.

Question 1: Nothing links Mary to Manhattan. Unknown.

Question 2: This asserts Mary lives in Manhattan and is a young working professional with a regular 9-5 job. But Mary cannot be such a professional (as that would imply she works regularly). Hence the conjunction is false. False.

Question 3: If Mary were a young working professional with a regular 9-5 job, she would work regularly, which contradicts what we derived. So the antecedent is false, making the implication true. True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
