==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. The statement combines two claims: he is one of the world's leading lighting designers, and he is from the UK. Both are explicitly stated, so the conjunction is true.
2. The text says he has lit more than 160 productions. This does not specify exactly 170, so we cannot conclude this precise number from the information given.
3. He attended a school where he is from, and he is from the UK. Therefore, the school would be in the UK, not in the United States. The statement is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
