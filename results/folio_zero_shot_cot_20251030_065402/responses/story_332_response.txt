Premises: If people don't often clean their homes, then they do not have tidy houses.
If people don't prioritize cleaning, then they do not often clean their homes.
If people hire a maid or cleaning service, then they have tidy houses.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the disjunction “(HireMaid and not CleanOften) or (not HireMaid and not CleanOften)”, we can conclude not CleanOften.
- From not CleanOften and “not CleanOften -> not Tidy,” we get not Tidy.
- From “HireMaid -> Tidy” and not Tidy, by contrapositive, we get not HireMaid.
- About caring/prioritizing: we only have one-way implications (not Care -> not Prioritize -> not CleanOften). From not CleanOften we cannot infer not Prioritize or not Care, nor Care.
- There is no information about suburbs, being too busy, or overburdened.

Question 1: Jack doesn't care about cleanliness.
- We cannot infer Care or not Care from the given information. Unknown.

Question 2: Jack does care about cleanliness.
- Same as above. Unknown.

Question 3: Jack has a tidy house.
- We derived not Tidy. Therefore this statement is false.

Question 4: Jack neither lives in the suburbs nor is too busy to clean.
- No premises about suburbs or being too busy. Unknown.

Question 5: Jack is overburdened and lives in the suburbs.
- No premises about being overburdened or suburbs. Unknown.
