Story ID: 337
Premises: No athletes never exercise.
All professional basketball players are athletes. 
All NBA players are professional basketball players. 
All Knicks players are NBA players. 
Either John is a professional basketball player and he never exercises, or he is not a professional basketball player and he sometimes exercises.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: Knicks player -> NBA player -> professional basketball player -> athlete. Also, no athlete never exercises (so athletes do not have the property “never exercises”).
- The disjunction about John resolves to: John is not a professional basketball player and he sometimes exercises, because the alternative contradicts "No athletes never exercise." This concerns John only and provides no information about Jim.
- There is no information at all about Jim, so none of the statements about Jim can be determined from the premises.
