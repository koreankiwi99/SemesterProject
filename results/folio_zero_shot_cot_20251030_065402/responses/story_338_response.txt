Premises: No iPhones are standalone desktops. 
All Apple-made cellphones are iPhones.  
All phones with A15 Bionic chips are Apple-made cell phones. 
All phones equipped with four core-GPU made by Apple are phones with A15 Bionic chips. 
If an unannounced Huawei phone is either a phone with A15 Bionic chips or equipped with four core-GPU made by Apple, then unannounced Huawei phone is neither a phone with A15 Bionic chips nor a standalone desktop.
