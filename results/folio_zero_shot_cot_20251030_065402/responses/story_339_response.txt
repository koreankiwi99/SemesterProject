Reasoning:
- From All Grand Slam champions -> World Tour players and World Tour players -> professional tennis players, both WT and GSC imply PTP.

- From All Grand Slam umpires -> professional tennis umpires: GSU -> PTU, so by contrapositive ¬PTU -> ¬GSU. Hence Nadal is not a Grand Slam umpire (¬GSU).
