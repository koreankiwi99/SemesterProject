Story ID: 341
Premises: No battery-powered watch is automatic.
All digital watches are battery-powered.
Some mechanical watches are automatic.
All smart watches are digital.
Moonwatch is either a digital watch and an automatic, or it is neither.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: Digital -> Battery-powered; Battery-powered -> not Automatic; hence Digital -> not Automatic. Also Smart -> Digital -> not Automatic.
- The Moonwatch statement is: (Digital and Automatic) or (not Digital and not Automatic). But Digital and Automatic is impossible, so Moonwatch must be not Digital and not Automatic. Therefore, by contrapositive of Smart -> Digital, Moonwatch is not Smart.

Question 1: We know Moonwatch is not digital and not automatic, but nothing relates this to being mechanical. So it could be mechanical or not; undetermined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: Since Moonwatch is not smart, it cannot be both smart and mechanical. Answer: False.

Question 3: The antecedent “Moonwatch is a smartwatch and a mechanical watch” is false (Moonwatch is not smart), so the conditional is true. Answer: True.

Question 4: The consequent “Moonwatch is not a smartwatch” is already true (Moonwatch is not smart), so the conditional is true regardless of the antecedent. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
4: True
