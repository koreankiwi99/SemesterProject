Story ID: 342

No loud cars are electric.
If a car is a Ferrari, then it is a sports car.
All cars made in Maranello are Ferraris.
The Toyota Prius is made in Maranello or is a loud car, or both.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: M(x) -> F(x) -> S(x) -> L(x); and L(x) -> not E(x).
- The Prius satisfies M(P) or L(P). In either case, L(P) holds. Hence, not E(P).

Question 1:
- Prius is electric? Since L(P) and no loud cars are electric, E(P) is false.

Question 2:
- Prius is not electric? As above, not E(P) is entailed. True.

Question 3:
- Prius has a Ferrari V12 engine? No information about engines is given; cannot be deduced or refuted. Unknown.

Question 4:
- If Prius is a Ferrari or loud, then it is electric?
  Antecedent (Ferrari or loud) is true because L(P) is true; consequent E(P) is false. The implication is therefore false.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: Unknown
4: False
