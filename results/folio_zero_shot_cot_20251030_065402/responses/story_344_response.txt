Story ID: 344
Premises: All students are members of the university.
All graduate students are students.
All PhD students are graduate students.
Some PhD students are Teaching Fellows.
If John is not a PhD student, then he is not a member of the university.
If John is a Teaching Fellow, then he is a PhD student or a graduate student.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: student -> member; graduate -> student -> member; PhD -> graduate -> student -> member.
- Some PhD students are Teaching Fellows (existential; does not mention John).
- If John is not PhD, then John is not a member.
- If John is a Teaching Fellow, then John is a PhD student or a graduate student. But if John were a graduate but not a PhD, he would be a member, contradicting "if not PhD then not member." Thus, if John is a Teaching Fellow, he must be a PhD student. However, nothing implies that John is a Teaching Fellow.
- There are consistent scenarios where John is a Teaching Fellow (and hence a PhD), and scenarios where John is not a Teaching Fellow (and not a member, not a PhD). Therefore, each queried statement about Johnâ€™s TF or PhD status is not determined by the information.
