Premises: All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.
All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.
No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.
All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.
Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.
If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From O → P and P → S, we get O → S.
- From ¬N → ¬O (equivalently O → N), N → F, and F → ¬S, we get O → N → F → ¬S, so O → ¬S.
- Thus O implies both S and ¬S, so ¬O.
- From (S ∨ O) and ¬O, we get S.
- From F → ¬S, contrapose to S → ¬F; with S, we get ¬F.
- From N → F, contrapose to ¬F → ¬N; with ¬F, we get ¬N.

Question 1:
- We have ¬O, but nothing implies S → P; thus we cannot conclude P. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- We derived ¬F and ¬O; the conjunction holds. Answer: True.

Question 3:
- The statement is (¬O → N). We have ¬O true and ¬N true, so the implication is false. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
