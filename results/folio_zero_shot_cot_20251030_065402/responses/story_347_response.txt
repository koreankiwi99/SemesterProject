Story ID: 347
Premises: All mammals are living beings.
All elephants are mammals.
All baby elephants are elephants.
Some baby elephants are sleepy.
If Jumbo is a living being, then Jumbo is not both an elephant and a mammal.
If Jumbo is sleepy, then Jumbo is either a baby elephant or a mammal.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From All elephants are mammals and All mammals are living beings, we have E(x) -> M(x) -> L(x).
- Given If Jumbo is a living being, then Jumbo is not both an elephant and a mammal, assume E(J): then M(J) and L(J), which yields ¬(E(J) ∧ M(J)), contradicting E(J) ∧ M(J). Hence ¬E(J).
- From All baby elephants are elephants, B(J) -> E(J); with ¬E(J), we get ¬B(J).
- If Jumbo is sleepy, then Jumbo is either a baby elephant or a mammal: S(J) -> (B(J) ∨ M(J)). Since ¬B(J), S(J) would imply M(J), and thus L(J), but this does not force S(J) to be true or false.

Question 1: We cannot deduce whether Jumbo is sleepy. Unknown.
Question 2: We also cannot deduce that Jumbo is not sleepy. Unknown.
Question 3: L(J) is not entailed (it would follow if S(J) -> M(J) and S(J) held, but S(J) is unknown). Unknown.
Question 4: ¬B(J) is true, but ¬S(J) is unknown; the conjunction is therefore unknown. Unknown.
Question 5: “Jumbo is not sleepy or an elephant” is ¬S(J) ∨ E(J). Since ¬E(J), this reduces to ¬S(J), which is unknown. Unknown.
