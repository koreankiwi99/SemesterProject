Story ID: 348
Premises: All young adults at the event like independence.
All college students at the event are young adults.
All Yale students at the event are college students.
Everyone at the event is a Yale student or a Harvard student.
All Harvard students at the event are diligent.
Susan is at the event, and if Susan is a Harvard student, then she is a young adult.
If Susan is a Yale student, then she does not like independence.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- If Susan were a Yale student, then: Yale -> College (3), College -> Young adult (2), Young adult -> Likes independence (1). Also given: Yale -> Not like independence (7). So Yale would imply both likes and not likes independence, a contradiction. Therefore, Susan is not a Yale student.
- Everyone at the event is Yale or Harvard (4), and Susan is at the event; with not Yale, it follows that Susan is a Harvard student.
- Harvard students are diligent (5), so Susan is diligent. Also, if Susan is Harvard, then she is a young adult (6); young adults like independence (1). Hence, Susan likes independence.

Question 1: We know Susan is Harvard, but we have no rule that Harvard students are college students. Yale -> College does not apply since Susan is not Yale. Therefore, whether Susan is a college student is not determined.
Question 2: From above, Susan is diligent and likes independence. So the conjunction holds.
Question 3: Since she is both diligent and likes independence, the statement that she is not both is false.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
