Story ID: 349
Premises: All disposables are designed to be used only once.
Some items used in Tom's house are eco-friendly.
Every item used in Tom's house is either disposable or reusable. 
If something is made from metal, then it is not made from plastic. 
All reusable items used in Tom's house are made from metal.
The chopsticks used in Tom's house are either made from metals and plastics, or that they are neither made from metals nor plastics.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Metal implies not plastic. Therefore, plastic implies not metal as well. So nothing can be both metal and plastic.
- The chopsticks are either both metal and plastic, or neither metal nor plastic. Since both is impossible, the chopsticks are neither metal nor plastic.
- All reusable items used in Tom’s house are metal. Since the chopsticks are used in Tom’s house and not metal, they are not reusable.
- Every item used in Tom’s house is disposable or reusable. Therefore, the chopsticks (not reusable) must be disposable, i.e., designed to be used only once.
- Nothing given links eco-friendliness to disposability or material, so we cannot determine whether the chopsticks are eco-friendly.

Question 1: We cannot determine eco-friendliness of the chopsticks. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: The chopsticks are designed to be used only once, so “eco-friendly or designed to be used only once” is true. Answer: True.

Question 3: Antecedent “made from plastic or designed to be used only once” is true (they are designed to be used only once). Consequent “made from plastic and eco-friendly” is false (not plastic; eco-friendly unknown). Thus the implication is false. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
