Story ID: 353
Premises: If Max listens to music, he either listens to classical music or rap.
All the classical songs that Max listens to are from the 12th century. 
If Max is listening to a rap song, then the song is by Kanye West. 
All songs by Kanye West are full of lyrics. 
All songs that are full of lyrics need to be written with words
It is not true that “As it was” by Harry Styles is classical music that Max listens to and is from the 12th century.
Max listens to "As it was" by Harry Styles.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Max listens to "As it was" (AW). From "If Max listens to music, he either listens to classical or rap," AW is classical or rap.
- From "All the classical songs that Max listens to are from the 12th century" and "It is not true that AW is classical and from the 12th century" (given he listens to it), AW cannot be classical. Hence, AW is rap.
- If AW is rap and Max listens to it, then it is by Kanye West. All Kanye West songs are full of lyrics, and all songs full of lyrics need to be written with words. Therefore, AW needs to be written with words.
- About being from the 12th century: only classical listened-to songs are guaranteed 12th-century. AW is not classical, and we have no rule about rap being (not) 12th-century. So this cannot be determined.
- Since AW is by Kanye West and needs to be written with words, the claim that it is not both is false.
