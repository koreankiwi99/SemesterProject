Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Let B(x): x believes in Santa, M(x): x thinks Santa is made up, E(x): x expects presents, X(x): x is excited for Christmas, S(x): x would be surprised to see Santa, C(x): x leaves cookies out.
- Given for all people:
  - B ∨ M
  - B → E
  - M → S
  - E → X
  - S → ¬C
- From M → S and S → ¬C, we get M → ¬C. Thus C ∧ M is impossible for any person.

Question 1:
- For Marcy, from B ∨ M:
  - If B, then B ∨ ¬C is true.
  - If M, then ¬C, so B ∨ ¬C is true.
- Therefore the statement is true.

Question 2:
- Since M → ¬C, ¬(C ∧ M) holds for Marcy. Hence ¬(C ∧ M) ∨ B is true regardless of B.
- Therefore the statement is true.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
