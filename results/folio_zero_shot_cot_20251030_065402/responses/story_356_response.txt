Story ID: 356
Premises: If people work well in teams in the workplace, then they get along with all their colleagues at their work.
If people come to work every day with a positive attitude, then they work well in teams in the workplace.
People either come to work every day with a positive attitude or are always tired every morning.
If people are always tired in the morning, then they are criticized by their boss.
If people are criticized by their boss, then they do not receive positive feedback from teams at work.
Kat either is a person who works well in teams in the workplac and is always tired every morning, or she is neither.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let P = comes with a positive attitude, W = works well in teams, G = gets along with colleagues, T = always tired, C = criticized by boss, F = receives positive feedback from teams.
- Given: W → G; P → W; P ∨ T; T → C → ¬F.
- Kat: (W ∧ T) ∨ (¬W ∧ ¬T), i.e., W ↔ T.

Deduction:
- If Kat were in the (¬W ∧ ¬T) case, then since T is false and P ∨ T holds, P must be true; but P → W then forces W true, contradicting ¬W. So that case is impossible.
- Therefore Kat has W and T true.
- Hence G is true (from W → G). And F is false (from T → C → ¬F).

Question 1:
- We know W is true but only have P → W, not W → P. Also P ∨ T is satisfied by T. So P is not determined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- G is true and F is false, so G ∧ F is false. Answer: False.

Question 3:
- G is true, so G ∨ F is true. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
