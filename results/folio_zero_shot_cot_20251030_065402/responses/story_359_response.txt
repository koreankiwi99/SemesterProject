Story ID: 359
Premises: Everyone who chooses what they want to do with their time has flexible schedules.
Everyone with a lot of free time chooses what they want to do with their time.
People either have a lot of free time or they invest in a career in which they are willing to spend the rest of their lives.
If people invest in a career in which they are willing to spend the rest of their lives, then they are hardworking individuals with high ambitions and goals for the future.  
If people are hardworking individuals with high ambitions and goals for the future, then they are not short sighted.
John is not either a hardworking individual with high ambitions and goals for the future or has a flexible schedule.

Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

Given:
1) If someone chooses what they want to do with their time (C), then they have a flexible schedule (F): C → F.
2) If someone has a lot of free time (L), then they choose what they want to do (C): L → C.
3) Everyone has either a lot of free time or invests in a lifelong career: L ∨ I.
4) If someone invests in such a career (I), then they are hardworking with high ambitions (H): I → H.
5) If someone is hardworking with high ambitions (H), then they are not short sighted (¬S): H → ¬S.
6) John is not either hardworking or flexible: ¬(H ∨ F), so ¬H and ¬F.

From 1 and 2, we get L → C and C → F, hence L → F. By contrapositive, ¬F → ¬L. Since John has ¬F, we get ¬L.

From 3 (L ∨ I) and ¬L, we get I. Then from 4, I → H, so H. This contradicts ¬H from 6, indicating the premises are inconsistent. Despite this, we can still assess the specific questions:

- For choosing (C): From ¬F and C → F, by contrapositive we get ¬C. So John does not choose what he wants to do with his time.
- For short sightedness (S): We have H → ¬S, but we also have ¬H. From ¬H alone we cannot infer S. No other premise determines S, so it remains undetermined.
- For “H or S”: We know ¬H, and S is undetermined, so we cannot conclude the disjunction.
