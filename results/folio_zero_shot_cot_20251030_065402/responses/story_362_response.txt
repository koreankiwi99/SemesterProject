Story ID: 362
Premises: People who like financial risks invest in the public stock market regularly or enjoy gambling regularly.
If people invest in the public stock market regularly, then they read the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers regularly to keep updated on financial metrics.
All people who enjoy enjoy gambling regularly spend a lot of money at casinos or other betting games.
People who spend a lot of money at casinos and other betting games would enjoy visiting the Las Vegas Strip.
People who spend a lot of money at casinos and other betting games are at risk of gambling addiction.
Matt does not invest in the public stock market regularly. 
Matt likes financial risks.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “People who like financial risks invest in the public stock market regularly or enjoy gambling regularly” and “Matt likes financial risks” with “Matt does not invest in the public stock market regularly,” we infer Matt enjoys gambling regularly.
- From “enjoy gambling regularly” → “spend a lot of money at casinos or other betting games” → “at risk of gambling addiction,” we infer Matt is at risk of a gambling addiction.
- From “invests in the public stock market regularly” → “reads WSJ regularly,” and given Matt does not invest, we cannot deduce whether he reads WSJ. No link from gambling to reading is given.

Question 1:
- We only have S → W and ¬S; this does not determine W. So it’s unknown whether Matt reads WSJ.

Question 2:
- Antecedent: (A ∧ S) ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬S). With A true and S false, both disjuncts are false; antecedent is false. A material conditional with a false antecedent is true. So the statement is true.

Question 3:
- The claim is (¬A(Matt)) ∧ ¬(W(Mike) ∧ V(Mike)). Since A(Matt) is true, ¬A(Matt) is false, making the whole conjunction false regardless of Mike.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
