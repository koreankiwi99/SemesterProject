Story ID: 364
Premises: If people in this neighborhood visit a coffee shop regularly, then they are addicted to coffee. 
People in this neighborhood visit a coffee shop regularly or order takeout at least once a day.
If people in this neighborhood make a lot of their own food at home using recipes and online guides, then they order takeout at least once a day.
If people in this neighborhood own at least one coffeemaker and one blender in their home, then they do not order takeout at least once a day.
All people in this neighborhood who lead very busy lives that include 12-hour work hours make a lot of their own food at home using recipes and online guides.
Sam is living in this neighborhood, and he is either addicted to coffee or other caffeinated drinks and leads a very busy life that include 12-hour work hours, or is not addicted to coffee and does not lead a very busy life that include 12-hour work hours

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
Let R = visits coffee shop regularly; A = addicted to coffee; T = orders takeout daily; H = makes a lot of food at home using recipes/online guides; C = owns a coffeemaker and a blender; B = leads very busy 12-hour work life; O = addicted to other caffeinated drinks.

Given:
- R -> A
- For everyone: R ∨ T
- H -> T; B -> H, so B -> T
- C -> ¬T, hence by contrapositive T -> ¬C
- Sam: [(A ∨ O) ∧ B] ∨ (¬A ∧ ¬B)
- Sam lives in this neighborhood.

Question 1:
- If first Sam-case holds: (A ∨ O) ∧ B. He might be A or only O; not guaranteed A.
- If second Sam-case holds: ¬A.
Thus A is not entailed and not contradicted; Unknown.

Question 2:
- If first Sam-case (B): B -> T -> ¬C, so not C.
- If second Sam-case (¬A ∧ ¬B): From R ∨ T and R -> A, R would contradict ¬A, so R is false and T is true; then T -> ¬C, so not C.
Thus in all cases, ¬C. The claim that he owns both appliances is False.

Question 3:
- In first Sam-case: B -> T, so T true.
- In second Sam-case: as above, R must be false, so T true.
Therefore T is true in all cases; hence (C ∨ T) is true. Sam lives in the neighborhood, so the conjunction is True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
