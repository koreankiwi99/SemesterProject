Story ID: 367
Premises: All people who went to Clay's school and who make their own matcha teas every morning with ceremonial-grade matcha powder do not wake up late and start their schedules past noon regularly.
All people who went to Clay's school, who live in California, and attend yoga classes regularly, make their own matcha teas every morning with ceremonial-grade matcha powder.
All people who went to Clay's school, and work in the entertainment industry as high-profile celebrities, wake up late and start their schedules past noon regularly.
All people who went to Clay's school that do not have regular 9-5 jobs, work in the entertainment industry as high-profile celebrities.
All people who went to Clay's school and prefer working at home over going to the office daily do not have regular 9-5 jobs.
Bunny went to Clay's school, and she either prefers to work at home over going to the office and makes her own matcha teas every morning with ceremonial-grade matcha powder, or does not prefer to work at home over going to the office every day and does not make her own matcha teas every morning with ceremonial-grade matcha powder.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let School = went to Clay’s school; M = makes ceremonial matcha every morning; Late = wakes up late; CA = lives in California; Yoga = attends yoga regularly; Celeb = high-profile entertainment celebrity; No9to5 = does not have a regular 9-5 job; WFHpref = prefers working at home.

Given:
1) School ∧ M → ¬Late
2) School ∧ CA ∧ Yoga → M
3) School ∧ Celeb → Late
4) School ∧ No9to5 → Celeb
5) School ∧ WFHpref → No9to5
6) School(Bunny), and either [WFHpref ∧ M] or [¬WFHpref ∧ ¬M].

Assume first disjunct WFHpref ∧ M for Bunny:
- From 5 and 4 and 3: WFHpref → No9to5 → Celeb → Late.
- From 1: School ∧ M → ¬Late.
Contradiction (Late and ¬Late). So the first disjunct is impossible; thus Bunny has ¬WFHpref ∧ ¬M.

From 2, contrapositive: ¬M → ¬(School ∧ CA ∧ Yoga). With School true, this implies ¬(CA ∧ Yoga).

Question 1: Does Bunny not have a regular 9-5 job?
- We only get No9to5 from WFHpref, but Bunny has ¬WFHpref. No rule gives No9to5 otherwise. So Unknown.

Question 2: Is Bunny School ∧ CA ∧ Yoga?
- From ¬M, contrapositive of 2 gives ¬(School ∧ CA ∧ Yoga). Hence this conjunction is false. So False.

Question 3: Is Bunny School ∧ [neither WFHpref nor (CA ∧ Yoga)]?
- We have School, ¬WFHpref, and ¬(CA ∧ Yoga). So True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
