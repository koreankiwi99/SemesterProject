Premises: Everybody in Emma's family who upgrade to the newest iPhone model every year, are not saving money for a down payment on a new house.
Everybody in Emma's family who enjoy reading about tech specs and keeping up to date on the latest technology upgrade to the newest iPhone model every year.
Everybody in Emma's family is saving money for a down payment on a new house, or lives in an apartment in a big metropolitan cities.
Everybody in Emma's family live with at least one roommate, does not own any pets.
Everybody in Emma's family who owns at least one pet lives with at least one roommate.
Emily is in Emma's family.
If Emily does not both own at least one pet and lives in apartments in big metropolitan cities, then Emily either owns at least one pet and lives in an apartment in big metropolitan cities, or she neither owns a pet nor lives in an apartment in big metropolitan cities. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Emily is in Emma’s family (given).
- Everyone in Emma’s family lives with at least one roommate (premise 4).
- Therefore, Emily lives with at least one roommate. The statement is true.

Question 2:
- From premise 4, Emily does not own any pets.
- Then the antecedent of premise 7 holds (she does not both own a pet and live in an apartment), so the consequent applies: either she both owns a pet and lives in an apartment, or she neither owns a pet nor lives in an apartment. Given she does not own a pet, it follows she does not live in an apartment.
- From premise 3 (everyone saves or lives in an apartment), since Emily does not live in an apartment, she must be saving money.
- If Emily enjoyed reading tech (premise 2), she would upgrade yearly, and by premise 1, then she would not be saving money—contradicting the above. Hence she does not enjoy reading tech. The statement is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
