Story ID: 370
Premises: If Robin's friends practice coding questions, then they are not studying to go to medical school to become a doctor.
If Robin's friends want to work in the software engineering industry, then they practice coding questions.
If Robin's friends enjoy healthcare fields and want to help people with medical issues, then they are studying to go to medical school to become a doctor.
If Robin's friends grew up with parents who worked as doctors, then they enjoy healthcare fields and want to help people with medical issues.
If Robin's friends study hard, then they grew up with parents who worked as doctors.
Mark is Robin's friend.
If Mark neither enjoys healthcare fields and wants to help people with medical issues nor grew up with parents who worked as doctors, then Mark is either a person who studies hard or grew up with parents who worked as doctors.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given rules (for any of Robin’s friends, including Mark):
- W ⇒ C (If wants to work in software engineering, then practices coding)
- C ⇒ ¬M (If practices coding, then not studying for medical school)
- H ⇒ M (If enjoys healthcare/helping medically, then studying for medical school)
- P ⇒ H (If parents were doctors, then enjoys healthcare/helping)
- S ⇒ P (If studies hard, then parents were doctors)
Contrapositives that may be useful:
- M ⇒ ¬C; ¬M ⇒ ¬H; ¬H ⇒ ¬P; ¬P ⇒ ¬S; ¬C ⇒ ¬W.

Also a Mark-specific conditional:
- If ¬H ∧ ¬P, then S ∨ P. This does not let us conclude S or P unless the antecedent ¬H ∧ ¬P is known, which it isn’t.

No facts are given about Mark other than that he is Robin’s friend. Thus:
- We cannot deduce S(m) or ¬S(m).
- We cannot deduce W(m) or ¬W(m), nor C(m) or ¬C(m).

Question 1: “Mark is Robin’s friend and he studies hard.” Friend is true; S(m) is not entailed nor contradicted. Overall: Unknown.

Question 2: “Mark is Robin’s friend and he practices coding questions and wants to work in software engineering.” Friend is true; W(m) and C(m) are not entailed (though W ⇒ C). Overall: Unknown.

Question 3: “Mark is Robin’s friend and he neither practices coding questions nor wants to work in software engineering.” Friend is true; ¬C(m) and ¬W(m) are not entailed (though ¬C ⇒ ¬W). Overall: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
