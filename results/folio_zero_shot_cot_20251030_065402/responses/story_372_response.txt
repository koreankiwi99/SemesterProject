Story ID: 372
Premises: If Emily's friends publish journals, then they do not work in the entertainment industry.
All of Emily's friends who are award-winning novelists publish journals.
Emily's friends work in the entertainment industry or are highly acclaimed in their profession.
If Emily's friends are highly acclaimed in their profession, then they often hold tenured and high-ranking positions at their workplace.
If Emily's friends are highly acclaimed in their profession, then they often receive glowing feedback and recommendations from their colleagues.
Taylor is Emily's friend.
It is not true that Taylor both holds highly acclaimed in her profession and often holds tenured and high-ranking positions at her workplace.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From F(Taylor) and (F ∧ A -> T) plus ¬(A ∧ T), we deduce ¬A(Taylor). If Taylor were highly acclaimed, she would have T, contradicting ¬(A ∧ T).
- From F(Taylor) and (F -> E ∨ A) with ¬A, we get E(Taylor).
- From F(Taylor), E(Taylor), and (F ∧ P -> ¬E), we infer ¬P(Taylor).
- From F(Taylor), ¬P(Taylor), and (F ∧ N -> P), we infer ¬N(Taylor).
- G(Taylor) and T(Taylor) remain undetermined.

Question 1: F(Taylor) is true; T(Taylor) is unknown. Therefore the conjunction is Unknown.

Question 2: F(Taylor) is true; N(Taylor) is false; G(Taylor) is unknown. The conjunction includes a false conjunct (N), so it is False.

Question 3: F(Taylor) is true; P(Taylor) and N(Taylor) are both false, so P ∧ N is false, hence ¬(P ∧ N) is true. The conjunction is True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
