Story ID: 373
Premises: All hodophiles who enjoy eating gelato ice cream would enjoy a vacation to Italy.
No hodophiles can resist the hallmark delectable desserts famous in Italy.
Hodophiles enjoy eating gelato ice cream or love to travel and vacation often, or both.
No hodophiles who study abroad in Europe regret their college experiences.
If hodophiles love to travel and vacation often, then they study abroad in Europe.
Robert is a hodophile, and he either enjoys eating gelato ice cream and loves to travel and vacation often, or does not enjoy eating gelato ice cream and does not love to travel and vacation often.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From “Hodophiles enjoy eating gelato ice cream or love to travel and vacation often, or both” and Robert’s condition “either both enjoy gelato and love to travel, or neither,” together with the fact that Robert is a hodophile, we conclude Robert must both enjoy gelato and love to travel (he cannot be in the “neither” case because hodophiles must have at least one of the two).
- Therefore: G(Robert) and T(Robert).
- If hodophiles love to travel, they study abroad: hence S(Robert).
- No hodophiles who study abroad regret college: thus Reg(Robert) is false.
- No hodophiles can resist the Italian desserts: thus Resist(Robert) is false.
- Hodophiles who enjoy gelato would enjoy a vacation to Italy: thus Ivac(Robert) is true.

Question 1:
- Claim: Robert can resist the hallmark delectable desserts in Italy.
- We have Resist(Robert) = false. Therefore the claim is false.

Question 2:
- Antecedent: (Ivac ∧ Reg) ∨ (¬Ivac ∧ ¬Reg). With Ivac = true and Reg = false, the antecedent is false.
- Consequent: Ivac ∨ Resist = true ∨ false = true.
- A false antecedent implies the whole implication is true.

Question 3:
- Antecedent: ¬(Resist ∧ Reg). Since both Resist and Reg are false, the antecedent is true.
- Consequent: G ∨ Ivac = true ∨ true = true.
- True antecedent and true consequent make the implication true.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
