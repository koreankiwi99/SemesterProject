Story ID: 374
Premises: 
All functions that represent straight lines on the coordinate plane are linear functions. 
No linear functions are non-convex functions.
A function is either a non-convex fuction or a convex function.
All quasi-convex functions are real-valued functions.
All convex functions are quasi-convex functions. 
The maximum of quasiconvex functions is a function.
The maximum of quasiconvex functions is a function that represents straight lines on the coordinate plane or it is a convex function or it is not a non-convex function.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let F be “the maximum of quasiconvex functions.” From the disjunction: F is straight-line or convex or not non-convex. If F is straight-line, then by “straight-line -> linear” and “no linear are non-convex,” F is not non-convex; by “either non-convex or convex,” F is convex. If the second disjunct holds, F is convex directly. If the third disjunct holds (not non-convex), then by “either non-convex or convex,” F is convex. Hence in all cases, F is convex.
- By “all convex -> quasi-convex” and “all quasi-convex -> real-valued,” F is quasi-convex and real-valued.

Question 1: Not entailed that F is straight-line; it could be convex without being straight-line. So Unknown.
Question 2: Since F is real-valued, “F is not real-valued” is False.
Question 3: Since F is quasi-convex, the disjunction “quasi-convex or not real-valued” is True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
