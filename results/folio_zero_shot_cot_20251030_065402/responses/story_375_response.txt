==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let G = grows own vegetables; A = has ample space; Y = young working professional living in large cities; T = orders takeout often; R = enjoys going out to restaurants often; H = touts benefits of homegrown/homecooked meals.
- Given implications:
  - G -> A
  - Y -> ¬A, hence by contrapositive A -> ¬Y
  - T -> G
  - R -> T
  - H -> R
- Therefore chains:
  - R -> T -> G -> A
  - H -> R -> T -> G -> A
- Given: Peter satisfies G ∨ H.

Q1: Does Peter enjoy going out to restaurants often (R)?
- If H, then H -> R, so R true. If only G, no rule gives R. Thus R is not entailed nor contradicted. Answer: Unknown.

Q2: Is Peter Y?
- From G ∨ H, in either case Peter has A (since G -> A; H -> ... -> A). From A -> ¬Y, we get ¬Y. So Y is false. Answer: False.

Q3: Is G ∨ Y?
- From H -> G, G ∨ H implies G. Hence G is true, so G ∨ Y is true. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
