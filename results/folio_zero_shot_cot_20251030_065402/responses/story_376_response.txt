Story ID: 376
Premises: All people in this tech company who are consistent and enjoy sticking to their regular routines do not like surprises.
People in this tech company who wear the same flannel shirts every day are consistent and enjoy sticking to their regular routines.
People in this tech company who do not like shopping for clothes wear the same flannel shirts every day.
Old people living in stable homes do not like surprises.
People in this tech company who have very high energy and are impulsive like surprises.
Mike works in this tech company.
If Mike is not a person who wears the same flannel shirts every day, has very high energy, and is impulsive, then Mike either is very consistent and enjoys sticking to his regular routines or does not like surprises.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given facts within the tech company:
- If someone wears the same flannel shirts every day (W), then they are consistent/routine (CR); if CR, then they do not like surprises (DLS). So InTC ∧ W → CR → DLS.
- If someone does not like shopping for clothes (DShop), then they wear the same flannel shirts every day (W). So InTC ∧ DShop → W.
- If someone has very high energy and is impulsive (HE ∧ IMP), then they like surprises (LS).
- Old person living in a stable home (OldStable) → DLS (global, not restricted to company).
- Mike is in the tech company.

Question 1:
We have no information implying Mike is an old person living in a stable home. OldStable only implies DLS, not vice versa, and nothing asserts OldStable(Mike). So this cannot be concluded.
Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
Antecedent: W(Mike) or DShop(Mike). Since InTC, DShop → W, so the antecedent effectively reduces to W(Mike).
From W(Mike), we can infer CR and then DLS, but we cannot infer DShop(Mike) nor not OldStable(Mike). A model where W is true and DShop is false is consistent with the premises, making the consequent (not OldStable ∧ DShop) false while the antecedent is true. Thus the statement is not guaranteed by the information.
Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
The statement is of the tautological form: If (not OldStable(Mike) ∧ DShop(Mike)), then DShop(Mike). This is logically valid regardless of other facts.
Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: True
