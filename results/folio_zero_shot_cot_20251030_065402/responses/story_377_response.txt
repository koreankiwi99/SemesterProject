Story ID: 377
Premises: Everything is either outside the solar system or in the solar system. 
Nothing outside the solar system has the Sun as its star.
Everything in the solar system is gravitationally bound by the Sun.
No planets gravitationally bound by the Sun are rogue planets. 
All orphan planets are rogue planets.
If PSO J318.5−22 is not both a rogue planet and a planet gravitationally bound by the Sun, then it is a rogue planet.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Let p = PSO J318.5−22.
- From the conditional: If not(Rogue(p) and Planet(p) and BoundSun(p)), then Rogue(p). This is equivalent to Rogue(p) (since ¬(R∧P∧B) -> R ≡ R ∨ (R∧P∧B) ≡ R). So Rogue(p) is true.
- Orphan(x) -> Rogue(x). No converse is given.
- Nothing outside the solar system has the Sun as its star: Outside(x) -> ¬SunStar(x).
- Everything is either outside or in the solar system, and everything in the solar system is BoundSun: In(x) -> BoundSun(x). Also, SunStar(x) -> In(x) -> BoundSun(x).
- No planets that are BoundSun are rogue: (Planet(x) ∧ BoundSun(x)) -> ¬Rogue(x). With Rogue(p) true, this only yields ¬(Planet(p) ∧ BoundSun(p)).

Question 1:
- We have Rogue(p) true, but only Orphan -> Rogue, not Rogue -> Orphan. Cannot conclude Orphan(p) or its negation. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement is Orphan(p) ∨ ¬SunStar(p).
- We cannot derive Orphan(p). From Rogue(p) and given rules, we also cannot derive ¬SunStar(p) (since Rogue does not imply not bound unless we also know Planet(p), which we don’t). Thus the disjunction is not entailed nor refuted. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The statement (Orphan(p) ∨ ¬SunStar(p)) -> (¬Orphan(p) ∧ ¬SunStar(p)) is logically equivalent to ¬Orphan(p).
- We have no information to decide Orphan(p). Therefore the implication’s truth value cannot be determined. Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
