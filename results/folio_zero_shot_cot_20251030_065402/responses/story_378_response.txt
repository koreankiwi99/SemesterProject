Premises: All people who attend weddings are getting married or know the people who are getting married.
No preteens or young children are getting married or know the people who are getting married.
People who enjoy celebrating life milestone events with other people attend weddings.
People who are fond of large group functions enjoy celebrating life milestone events with other people.
All people who are outgoing and spirited are fond of large group functions.
If Carol is not both a pre-teen or young child and attends a wedding, then Carol is not getting married or knows the people who are getting married.  

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let A = attends wedding; M = getting married; K = knows the couple; E = enjoys celebrating such events; F = fond of large group functions; O = outgoing and spirited; P = preteen/young child.
- Given: A -> (M ∨ K); P -> ¬(M ∨ K) hence P -> ¬A; E -> A; F -> E; O -> F -> E -> A -> (M ∨ K).
- From P -> ¬A, we get ¬(P ∧ A). Using the special Carol condition [¬(P ∧ A)] -> (¬M ∨ K), we can conclude for Carol: (¬M ∨ K). This does not determine O, P, or E.

Question 1: Nothing implies Carol is O, nor that she isn’t. Unknown.

Question 2: Nothing implies Carol is P, nor that she isn’t. Unknown.

Question 3: Claim is ¬E ∧ ¬O. We cannot derive ¬E or ¬O; nor can we derive E or O to refute it. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
