Story ID: 382
Premises: All people in this midwest town who own horse ranches regularly ride horses for pleasure and sport.
All people in this midwest town with a lot of disposable income have a horse ranch.
If people in this midwest town compete in horse dressage shows, then they have a lot of disposable income.
If people in this midwest town compete in horse dressage shows, then they have invested in high-quality equestrian gear and equipment.
If people in this midwest town regularly ride horses for pleasure and sport, then they do not live in cramped residential buildings.
Manny is in this midwest town, and she either has a horse ranch and lives in a cramped residential building, or she does neither.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let HR = has a horse ranch, R = regularly rides, C = lives in cramped building, DI = has a lot of disposable income, Comp = competes in dressage, Gear = invested in high-quality gear.
- Given: HR -> R; DI -> HR; Comp -> DI; Comp -> Gear; R -> not C.
- Manny: (HR and C) or (not HR and not C).
- Since HR -> R -> not C, the first disjunct (HR and C) is impossible. Thus Manny has not HR and not C.
- From not HR and DI -> HR, by contrapositive, not DI. From not DI and Comp -> DI, by contrapositive, not Comp.

Question 1: We have not HR and not C, but nothing entails R or not R. So Unknown.

Question 2: Manny does not compete, so “Comp and Gear” is false regardless of Gear. So False.

Question 3: Antecedent “HR or Comp” is false (she has neither), so the conditional is vacuously true. So True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
