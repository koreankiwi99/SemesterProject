Story ID: 383
Premises: People who work at Jess's company and go to the spa frequently are not people who are miserly and need to save a large portion of their income.
People who work at Jess's company are either miserly and need to save a large portion of their income, or frivolously spend a lot of money.
If people who work at Jess's company frivolously spend a lot of money when they go out, then they value quality manufacturing and luxury items.
If people who work at Jess's company value quality manufacturing and luxury items, then they enjoy shopping for materialistic items in their free time.
Thomas works at Jess's company.
If Thomas is not miserly and needs to save a large portion of his income, then Thomas does not value quality manufacturing and luxury items.
Thomas values quality manufacturing and luxury items or he is not miserly.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From W(Thomas).
- Assume ¬M(Thomas). Then by (6) ¬V(Thomas). But W and (2) give M ∨ F; with ¬M we get F. Then W ∧ F -> V by (3), contradicting ¬V. Hence ¬M is impossible, so M(Thomas) is true.
- From (7) V ∨ ¬M and ¬M false, V(Thomas) is true.
- From W ∧ V -> E by (4), E(Thomas) is true.
- From W ∧ S -> ¬M by (1) and M true, S(Thomas) is false.
- F(Thomas) remains undetermined (could be either).

Question 1:
- F(Thomas) is not determined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement is E ∨ (¬E -> S), which is equivalent to E ∨ S. Since E is true (and S is false), it is true. Answer: True.

Question 3:
- Antecedent E ∨ (¬E -> S) is true (as above). Consequent ¬V ∧ ¬S is false because V is true and S is false. True -> False makes the implication false. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
