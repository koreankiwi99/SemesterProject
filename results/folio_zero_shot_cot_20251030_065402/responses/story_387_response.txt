Story ID: 387
Premises: If some diseases require a medical diagnosis, then lab tests or imaging is required. 
All rare diseases require a medical diagnosis.
If a disease is mild, then no lab tests or imaging is required. 
All blood cancers are rare diseases.
All types of leukemia are diseases and blood cancers. 
Bladder cancer is a disease and is blood cancer or Leukemia.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Leukemia is a type of blood cancer. So “blood cancer or leukemia” implies bladder cancer is a blood cancer in any case.
- All blood cancers are rare diseases. Therefore bladder cancer is a rare disease.
- All rare diseases require a medical diagnosis, and anything that requires a medical diagnosis requires lab tests or imaging. Hence bladder cancer requires lab tests or imaging.
- If a disease is mild, then it does not require lab tests or imaging. Contrapositive: if lab tests or imaging are required, then the disease is not mild. Therefore bladder cancer is not mild.

Question 1: Since bladder cancer requires lab tests or imaging, it cannot be mild. So the statement “Bladder cancer is a mild disease” is false.

Question 2: From “blood cancer or leukemia” and “leukemia implies blood cancer,” we can conclude bladder cancer is a blood cancer, but we cannot conclude it is leukemia specifically. So it is uncertain.

Question 3: We established bladder cancer is a rare disease, so “rare or mild” is true (even though it’s not mild).

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: Unknown
3: True
