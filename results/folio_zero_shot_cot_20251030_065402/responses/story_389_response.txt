Story ID: 389
Premises: A diseases affect females or males.
No women have prostate cancer.
A cancer is either prostate cancer or non-prostate cancer. 
No type of cancer is without mutations.
All non-prostate cancers are a type of cancer.
If adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer or without mutations or both, then adenocarcinoma is in women or without mutations or both.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Facts:
  - Every cancer is either prostate cancer (PC) or non-prostate cancer (NonPC).
  - All NonPC are cancers.
  - No cancer is without mutations.
  - No women have prostate cancer (so PC diseases are not in women).
  - For adenocarcinoma A: (Cancer(A) ∨ WithoutMut(A)) → (InWomen(A) ∨ WithoutMut(A)).

Question 1:
- Nothing in the premises asserts that adenocarcinoma is a cancer, let alone that it is specifically a prostate cancer.
- Therefore we cannot conclude it is a prostate cancer, nor can we conclude it is not.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- If adenocarcinoma were a cancer, then by “no cancer is without mutations,” WithoutMut(A) is false, and the given conditional would force InWomen(A) to be true. But we do not know that adenocarcinoma is a cancer.
- If it is not a cancer, nothing forces InWomen(A).
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The consequent requires WithoutMut(A) ∧ NonPC(A).
- But NonPC(A) → Cancer(A) and all cancers are not without mutations, so NonPC(A) implies ¬WithoutMut(A). Thus the consequent is impossible.
- The antecedent (InWomen(A) ∨ WithoutMut(A)) is not guaranteed by the premises; it may be true or false in different models.
- Because there are models where the antecedent is true (e.g., WithoutMut(A) true while A is not a cancer) making the implication false, and others where the antecedent is false making the implication vacuously true, the overall truth cannot be determined from the premises.
- Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
