Story ID: 390
Premises: There are no elements with atomic number between 61-63 that are not scarce in China.
Non-rare earth elements are not scarce in China.
All elements are either non-rare earth elements or rare earth elements. 
All rare earth elements can be used for industry.
All rare earth elements are essential for exploring future directions of electronics.
Lithium is either a non-rare earth element and essential for exploring future directions of electronics, or is not a non-rare earth element and is not essential for exploring future directions of electronics.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Q1:
- Given: For Lithium, either (non-rare earth and essential) or (not non-rare earth and not essential), so NREE(Li) iff F(Li).
- Also: REE(x) -> F(x).
- Nothing in the premises determines whether Lithium is REE or not REE. Both are consistent with the given equivalence.
- Conclusion: Cannot determine if Lithium is a rare earth element.

Q2:
- Assume: Lithium is an element with atomic number 61–63. Then by premise 1, Lithium is scarce in China.
- From premise 3, if Lithium is an element, then it is NREE or REE. If it were NREE, premise 2 would make it not scarce, contradicting scarcity; hence NREE(Li) is false, so REE(Li) must be true.
- From premise 5, REE(Li) -> F(Li). Then by the Lithium equivalence, F(Li) -> NREE(Li), contradicting NREE(Li) false.
- Thus Lithium cannot be an element with atomic number 61–63. Therefore the whole statement (which also mentions batteries) is false.

Q3:
- The antecedent is: not essential (¬F(Li)) or (element and atomic number 61–63). As shown in Q2, the second disjunct (E(Li) ∧ A(Li)) cannot be true under the premises, so the antecedent effectively reduces to ¬F(Li).
- From the Lithium equivalence, ¬F(Li) implies ¬NREE(Li).
- The consequent is ¬NREE(Li) or U(Li); since ¬NREE(Li) holds when the antecedent holds, the implication is true.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
