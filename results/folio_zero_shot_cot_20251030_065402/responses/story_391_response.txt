Story ID: 391
Premises: All imaginative processes that Dan knows are results of creative processes.
All science fiction that Dan knows comes from an imaginative process.
Everthing that Dan knows comes from either science-fiction or realistic fiction.
No facts that Dan knows have proven to be false.
Dan knows that Dune is science fiction or has proven to be false.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
Let SF(x): x is science fiction; RF(x): x is realistic fiction; IP(x): x came from an imaginative process; CP(x): x is a result of creative processes; False(x): x has proven false; Fact(x): x is a fact; Know(x): Dan knows x.

From the premises:
- Know(Dune). Also, SF(Dune) ∨ False(Dune).
- Know(Dune) → (SF(Dune) ∨ RF(Dune)).
- If SF(Dune), then IP(Dune) (since Know(Dune)).
- If IP(Dune), then CP(Dune) (since Know(Dune)).
Thus: SF(Dune) ⇒ IP(Dune) ⇒ CP(Dune).

Two consistent cases:
A) SF true ⇒ IP true ⇒ CP true. RF and False unspecified.
B) SF false ⇒ from Know ⇒ RF true; False true (from SF ∨ False). IP and CP not determined.

Evaluate each statement:
1) RF(Dune): true in case B, not guaranteed in case A → Unknown.
2) CP ∧ IP: holds in case A, not guaranteed in case B → Unknown.
3) CP ∨ IP: true in case A, not guaranteed in case B → Unknown.
4) CP ∧ SF: true in case A, false in case B → Unknown.
5) CP ∨ SF: true in case A, not guaranteed in case B → Unknown.
6) (CP ∧ IP) → ¬(CP ∧ SF): fails in case A when SF holds; but SF not forced → Unknown.
7) [(Fact ∧ CP) ∨ (¬Fact ∧ ¬CP)] → (CP ∧ SF): can fail in a model with ¬Fact, ¬CP, RF, False → Unknown.
8) SF → ¬(CP ∧ SF): would fail if SF holds (since then CP too), but SF not forced → Unknown.
9) ¬(CP ∧ SF) → (¬IP ∧ ¬False): can fail in a model with RF, False, and no CP or SF → Unknown.
10) (¬IP ∧ ¬SF) → (¬CP ∧ ¬IP): can fail in a model with ¬SF, ¬IP, CP → Unknown.
