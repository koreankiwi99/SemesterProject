Story ID: 392
Premises: All prime numbers are natural numbers.
All integers are real numbers. 
All real numbers are complex numbers. 
One is a prime number or a natural number or both.
If one is not a complex number, then one is a prime number and an integer.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “All prime numbers are natural numbers,” P → N.
- From “All integers are real numbers,” Z → R.
- From “All real numbers are complex numbers,” R → C.
- From “One is a prime number or a natural number or both,” P(1) ∨ N(1).
- From “If one is not a complex number, then one is a prime number and an integer,” ¬C(1) → (P(1) ∧ Z(1)).

Derived facts:
- From P → N and P(1) ∨ N(1), we conclude N(1) is true.
- From ¬C(1) → Z(1), Z → R, and R → C, we get ¬C(1) → C(1), hence C(1) is true.
- We have no premise linking N → Z or N → R, and C does not imply R. So R(1) is not derivable. P(1) remains undetermined.

Question 1: “One is a real number.” We cannot derive R(1) from the premises. Unknown.

Question 2: “One is a prime number and a natural number.” N(1) is true, but P(1) is undetermined. Unknown.

Question 3: “One is either a prime number or a natural number.” This is exactly given as true. True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: True
