Story ID: 393
Premises: All inductive reasoning processes derive general principles from a body of observations.
Two major types of reasoning rules are inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. 
All deductive reasoning processes are only based on facts and rules. 
Nothing only based on facts and rules is used for statistical generalization. 
Modus Ponens is not both used in inductive reasoning and used for statistical generalization. 
Modus Ponens is a component of a major part of reasoning rule.

Step-by-step reasoning:

Premises distilled:
- If a process is inductive, then it derives general principles from observations.
- The two major types of reasoning rules are inductive and deductive.
- If a process is deductive, then it is only based on facts and rules.
- Nothing only based on facts and rules is used for statistical generalization.
- Modus Ponens (MP) is not both used in inductive reasoning and used for statistical generalization.
- MP is a component of a major type of reasoning rule (either inductive or deductive), but it is not specified which.

Question 1:
To conclude “Reasoning with MP is based on facts and rules,” we would need MP to be a deductive reasoning process (then the “only based on facts and rules” property would follow). The premises do not state that MP is deductive (only that it is a component of a major type) nor that components inherit the “deductive process” property. So we cannot conclude it is based on facts and rules, nor can we conclude it is not. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
The statement asserts both that MP derives general principles from observations and is used for statistical generalization. The premises do not assert either of these about MP. The constraint that “nothing only based on facts and rules is used for statistical generalization” does not settle whether MP is used for statistical generalization, since we do not know whether MP is only based on facts and rules. Thus the conjunction is neither entailed nor contradicted. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
The antecedent says A and S have the same truth value (both true or both false), where A = “derives general principles from observations” and S = “used for statistical generalization.” The consequent says MP is neither used in inductive reasoning nor used for statistical generalization. The premises allow a consistent case where A and S are both true, MP is not used in inductive reasoning, and MP is not only based on facts and rules (so no conflict with the premises). In that case the antecedent is true while the consequent is false, so the implication is not entailed. It is also not contradicted outright because other assignments can make it true. Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
