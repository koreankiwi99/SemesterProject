==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Here is the logical setup:
- Let V = has a velvet finish; S = has a satin finish; R = has “rosewood” in the description; F = refillable.
- Premises for any lipstick in the set:
  - V ⇒ F.
  - V ∨ S (each lipstick has at least one of these finishes).
  - S ⇒ R.
- For 999 specifically: R ∨ V.

Reasoning per question:

1) We only know R ∨ V. 999 could be velvet (then not necessarily satin) or could be satin (if not velvet). Not determined. Answer: Unknown.

2) S ∧ R: While S ⇒ R, we don’t know S. Not determined. Answer: Unknown.

3) From R ∨ V and V ⇒ F, we get R ∨ F. So the statement holds. Answer: True.

4) The statement is ¬(V ∧ F) ⇒ (¬F ∧ ¬R). Since V ⇒ F, (V ∧ F) is equivalent to V, so antecedent is ¬V. If ¬V, then S is true (from V ∨ S), hence R is true (S ⇒ R), making the consequent false. If V is true, the antecedent is false and the implication is vacuously true. Since we don’t know V, the overall truth is not determined. Answer: Unknown.

5) If F ∧ R, then V ∨ R follows immediately (from R). Tautologically true. Answer: True.

6) (¬R ∨ F) ⇒ R. This can fail if R is false and V is true: then F is true (V ⇒ F), antecedent true, consequent false. It can also be true when R is true. Not determined. Answer: Unknown.

7) (¬R ∨ F) ⇒ (¬S ∧ ¬R). With V true, R true, F true, the antecedent is true but the consequent is false. It can be vacuously true in other cases. Not determined. Answer: Unknown.

8) (F ∨ R) ⇒ (F ∨ R) is a tautology. Answer: True.
