Story ID: 397
Premises: All brain study designs are either block designs or event-related designs. 
All event-related brain study designs are brain image acquisition.
All brain image acquisition in brain study designs is preceded by data processing.
Nothing in brain study designs preceded by data processing analyzes data.
Picture memory is a type of brain study design that is not either event-related or analyzing data.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From "All brain study designs are either block designs or event-related designs" and "Picture memory is a brain study design that is not event-related," we conclude Picture memory is a block design.
- Event-related implies brain image acquisition, which implies being preceded by data processing. But Picture memory is not event-related, so we cannot conclude it is preceded by data processing.
- Picture memory is not analyzing data (given).

Question 1:
- Being preceded by data processing is only entailed for event-related designs via brain image acquisition. Since Picture memory is not event-related, there’s no basis to infer it is preceded by data processing. Unknown.

Question 2:
- From the disjunction (block or event-related) and not event-related, it follows that Picture memory is a block design. True.

Question 3:
- Since Picture memory is a block design, the disjunction “block design or analyzing data” holds. True.

Question 4:
- Antecedent “Picture memory is not analyzing data” is true (given). Consequent “Picture memory is a block design and analyzing data” is false because “analyzing data” is false. A true antecedent and false consequent makes the conditional false. False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: True
4: False
