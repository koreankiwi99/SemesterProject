Story ID: 398
Premises: All mind-reading is either brain reading or brain decoding. 
All brain decoding that is mind-reading is extracting information from BOLD signals.
No studies that are mind-reading and extract information from BOLD signals are without statistical pattern analysis. 
Writing a novel is without statistical pattern analysis.
If multivoxel (pattern) analysis is without statistical pattern analysis and a brain reading, then multivoxel (pattern) analysis is without statistical pattern analysis and brain decoding.
Multivoxel (pattern) analysis is a type of mind-reading.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- MVPA is a type of mind-reading.
- All mind-reading is either brain reading or brain decoding.
- If MVPA were without SPA:
  - If it were brain decoding, then (mind-reading ∧ brain decoding) ⇒ extracts BOLD ⇒ by the “no mind-reading that extract BOLD are without SPA” rule, not without SPA, contradiction.
  - If it were brain reading, then by the given conditional, (MVPA ∧ without SPA ∧ brain reading) ⇒ brain decoding, reducing to the previous contradiction. Hence MVPA is not without SPA.
- Writing a novel ⇒ without SPA. By contrapositive, not without SPA ⇒ not writing a novel. Thus MVPA is not writing a novel.

Question 1: We only know MVPA is mind-reading, hence brain reading or brain decoding; we cannot determine which. So Unknown.

Question 2: MVPA is not writing a novel. So False.

Question 3: MVPA is not without SPA, so it cannot be both without SPA and writing a novel. False.

Question 4: Both disjuncts (without SPA, writing a novel) are false for MVPA. So False.

Question 5: Same disjunction as Q4 in effect; both disjuncts are false. False.

Question 6: Antecedent (MVPA is writing a novel) is false; the conditional is vacuously true. True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: False
4: False
5: False
6: True
