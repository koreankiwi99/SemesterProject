Story ID: 401
Premises: Everyone at 'Board Game night' is interested in puzzles, or they are bad at chess, or both.
If a person at 'Board Game night' is bad at chess, then they don't play a lot of chess.
There is a person at 'Board Game night' who is either a planner or a creative person.
Erica is at 'Board Game night,' and she is someone who plays a lot of chess.
If Erica is neither bad at chess nor creative, then Erica is either someone who plans and is creative, or she is neither of these things.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
First, derive what we can about Erica:
- Erica plays a lot of chess (L). From “bad → not L,” contraposition gives L → not bad, so Erica is not bad (¬B).
- From “puzzles or bad” and ¬B, we conclude Erica is interested in puzzles (P).
- From the conditional about Erica: (¬B ∧ ¬Crea) → ¬Plan. Since ¬B holds, we get (¬Crea → ¬Plan), equivalently (Plan → Crea).
- We have no determination of whether Erica is creative (Crea) or plans (Plan).

Now evaluate each statement:

1) Erica plans.
- Only have Plan → Crea; Plan itself is undetermined. Answer: Unknown.

2) Erica is interested in puzzles and is creative.
- P true; Crea unknown; conjunction undetermined. Answer: Unknown.

3) Erica is either interested in puzzles or is creative.
- P true, so disjunction true. Answer: True.

4) If Erica plans ahead or plays a lot of chess matches, then Erica is not interested in puzzles and creative.
- L true makes antecedent true. Consequent requires ¬P ∧ Crea, but P is true, so false. Answer: False.

5) If Erica is creative, then Erica is not interested in puzzles and creative.
- With P true, this is Crea → (false ∧ Crea), i.e., Crea → false, equivalent to ¬Crea. Crea is unknown. Answer: Unknown.

6) If Erica is interested in puzzles and is creative, then Erica is not creative.
- With P true, this is Crea → ¬Crea, equivalent to ¬Crea. Unknown. Answer: Unknown.

7) If Erica either plays a lot of chess matches or is creative, then Erica is neither interested in puzzles nor a person who plays a lot of chess matches.
- L true makes antecedent true; consequent ¬P ∧ ¬L is false (P and L are true). Answer: False.

8) If Erica is interested in puzzles and plays a lot of chess matches, then Erica is either a person who plays a lot of chess matches or a person that is creative.
- P ∧ L true; L ∨ Crea is true (since L true). Answer: True.

9) If Erica plans ahead or is interested in puzzles, then Erica is creative.
- P true makes antecedent true; reduces to Crea, which is unknown. Answer: Unknown.

10) If Erica is either bad at chess or interested in puzzles, then Erica is not a person who plays a lot of chess matches and creative.
- P true makes antecedent true; consequent ¬L ∧ Crea is false since L true. Answer: False.
