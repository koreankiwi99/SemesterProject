==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From "Fabien does not both study Spanish and also like eating cheese" and "Fabien studies Spanish," it follows that Fabien does not like eating cheese.

Question 1:
- We just derived that Fabien does not like eating cheese. So the statement "Fabien likes eating cheese" is false.

Question 2:
- Statement: (Fabien likes cheese or is a francophile) → (Fabien neither studies Spanish nor is a francophile).
- We know Fabien does not like cheese and does study Spanish.
- The antecedent reduces to "Fabien is a francophile" (since he does not like cheese).
- The consequent is false because it claims he does not study Spanish, but he does.
- Thus the implication reduces to "If Fabien is a francophile then false," i.e., ¬(Fabien is a francophile).
- We do not know whether Fabien is a francophile; both cases are consistent with the premises. Therefore, the truth of the implication is unknown.

Question 3:
- Statement: (Fabien’s favorite country is Spain or he is a francophile) → (Fabien studies Spanish or his favorite country is Spain).
- We know Fabien studies Spanish, so the consequent is true regardless of the antecedent. Hence the implication is true.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: Unknown
3: True
