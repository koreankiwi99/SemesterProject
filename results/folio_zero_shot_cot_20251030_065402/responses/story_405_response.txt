Story ID: 405
Premises: Everyone who works in the office is a commuter. 
People either work in the office or work from home.
Everyone who works from home has a relaxed schedule.
George is either a commuter or has a home office setup. 
If George is either a person who works from home or has a home office setup, then George is a commuter and is not a person who works from home.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Let O = works in the office, H = works from home, C = commuter, R = has a relaxed schedule, S = has a home office setup.

Given:
- O → C.
- O ∨ H.
- H → R.
- For George: C ∨ S.
- For George: (H ∨ S) → (C ∧ ¬H).

Derivations for George:
- From H ⇒ (H ∨ S) and (H ∨ S) → ¬H, we get H → ¬H, hence ¬H.
- From (C ∨ S) and (S → C) (implied by (H ∨ S) → C), we get C.
- From O ∨ H and ¬H, we get O.
- R and S remain undetermined.

Question 1: Is George a person who works from home?
- We derived ¬H. So the statement “George works from home” is false.

Question 2: If George is not H and is O, then George is neither C nor R.
- Antecedent (¬H ∧ O) is true; but C is true, so the consequent (¬C ∧ ¬R) is false. Hence the conditional is false.

Question 3: If (S ∧ O) or (¬S ∧ ¬O), then (H ∨ R).
- Since O is true, the antecedent reduces to S; with ¬H, the consequent reduces to R. So the statement is S → R, which is not determined by the premises (S and R are both undetermined, and a consistent model has S true and R false). Therefore uncertain.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: False
3: Unknown
