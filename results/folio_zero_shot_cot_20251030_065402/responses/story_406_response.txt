Story ID: 406
Premises: All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine.
People regularly drink coffee, or they don't want to be addicted to caffeine, or both.
No one who doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
Rina is either a student who is unaware that caffeine is a drug, or she is not a student and is she aware that caffeine is a drug.
Rina  is either a student who is dependent on caffeine, or she is not a student and not dependent on caffeine.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let RC(x): regularly drinks coffee; D(x): dependent on caffeine; W(x): doesn't want to be addicted; A(x): aware caffeine is a drug; S(x): student.
- Given:
  1) ∀x (RC→D)
  2) ∀x (RC ∨ W)
  3) ∀x (W→A)
  4) For Rina: (S ∧ ¬A) ∨ (¬S ∧ A) and (S ∧ D) ∨ (¬S ∧ ¬D)
- From 4: For Rina, A ↔ ¬S and D ↔ S, hence D ↔ ¬A.
- From 1 and 2: ∀x (RC ∨ W) and (RC→D) entail ∀x (D ∨ W). So for Rina, D ∨ W holds.

Question 1: W ∨ ¬A. Since for Rina ¬A ↔ D, this is W ∨ D, which holds by D ∨ W. Therefore True.

Question 2: Same content as Q1 despite the typo, so True.

Question 3: RC ∨ ¬A ≡ RC ∨ D (because ¬A ↔ D). Not entailed: there is a consistent case with S false giving D false, A true, RC false, W true, making RC ∨ ¬A false; and another with S true making it true. Therefore Unknown.

Question 4: Antecedent is (W ∧ ¬A) ∨ (¬W ∧ A). W ∧ ¬A is impossible by W→A. If A then D false, so RC must be false (from RC→D), hence by RC ∨ W we get W true; thus ¬W ∧ A is also impossible. Antecedent is always false, so the implication is vacuously true. Therefore True.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
4: True
