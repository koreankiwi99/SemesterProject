Story ID: 407
Premises: No touring musicians who perform at the New Haven Symphony Orchestra are permanent members of the orchestra.
Musicians who perform at the New Haven Symphony Orchestra are permanent members of an orchestra, or they have temporary roles at the orchestra.
All touring musicians who perform at the New Haven Symphony Orchestra have temporary roles at the orchestra.
All musicians performing at the New Haven Symphony Orchestra who have temporary roles at the orchestra are interesting soloists.
All musicians performing at New Haven Symphony Orchestra who are interesting soloists are capable of attracting audiences.
Ryan is performing at New Haven Symphony Orchestra.
If Ryan is an interesting soloist and has a temporary role at the orchestra, then he is capable of attracting large audiences if and only if he is a touring soloist musician. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Let Perform(x) mean x performs at NHSO; TempRole(x) mean x has a temporary role at NHSO; PermSomeOrch(x) mean x is a permanent member of some orchestra; Interesting(x) mean x is an interesting soloist; Touring(x) mean x is a touring musician; TouringSoloist(x) mean x is a touring soloist musician.
- Given: Perform(Ryan).
- Rule A: Perform(x) -> [PermSomeOrch(x) OR TempRole(x)].
- Rule B: [Perform(x) AND TempRole(x)] -> Interesting(x).
- Rule C: [Perform(x) AND Interesting(x)] -> CanAttractAudiences(x) (not “large”).
- Rule D: [Touring(x) AND Perform(x)] -> TempRole(x).
- Ryan-specific: If [Interesting(Ryan) AND TempRole(Ryan)], then [LargeAttract(Ryan) iff TouringSoloist(Ryan)].

Question 1: If Ryan has TempRole, then by Rule B he is interesting. But Rule A allows the alternative that he is instead PermSomeOrch without TempRole, in which case nothing entails he is interesting. Hence not entailed nor refuted. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2: From Perform(Ryan) we know PermSomeOrch(Ryan) OR TempRole(Ryan). The statement asks for PermSomeOrch(Ryan) OR TouringSoloist(Ryan). TempRole does not imply TouringSoloist (Rule D is one-way), and the Ryan-specific biconditional only links TouringSoloist to LargeAttract under assumptions we don’t establish. So the disjunction in Q2 is not guaranteed; it can be false in a model where Ryan has TempRole, is not PermSomeOrch, and is not TouringSoloist. Also it could be true in other models. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3: Directly from Perform(Ryan) and Rule A, we have PermSomeOrch(Ryan) OR TempRole(Ryan). Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: True
