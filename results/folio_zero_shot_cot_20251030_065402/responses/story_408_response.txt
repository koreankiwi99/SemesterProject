Story ID: 408
Premises: No trick-shot artist in Yale's varsity team struggles with half court shots.
Everyone on Yale's varsity team is someone who struggles with half court shots or who successfully shoots a high percentage of 3-pointers.  
Everyone on Yale's varsity team who successfully shoots a high percentage of 3-pointers is solid at shooting 2-pointers.  
No one on Yale's varsity team who is solid at shooting 2-pointers is bad at mid-range shots.  
Jack is on Yale's varsity team, and he is either a trick-shot artist or he successfully shoots a high percentage of 3-pointers.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Let T = trick-shot artist; H = struggles with half court shots; S3 = successfully shoots a high percentage of 3-pointers; S2 = solid at 2-pointers; M = bad at mid-range.
- Premises for team members:
  - T → ¬H
  - H ∨ S3
  - S3 → S2
  - S2 → ¬M
- Jack is on the team and T ∨ S3.
- Hence S3 is guaranteed: if T then ¬H and H ∨ S3 forces S3; if not T, S3 holds by assumption.
- Therefore S3, S2, and ¬M are all true for Jack. H and T remain undetermined.

Answers by question:
1) H is undetermined → Unknown.
2) M is false → False.
3) S2 ∨ M is true since S2 is true → True.
4) Same disjunction as Q3 → True.
5) T ∨ M with M false and T unknown → Unknown.
6) Same as Q5 → Unknown.
7) S3 ∨ M with S3 true → True.
8) (¬S2 ∧ M) → (¬S2 ∧ S3). Antecedent is false (since S2 true and M false), so implication is true → True.
9) (S2 ∨ S3) → (H ∧ M). Antecedent is true (S3 true), consequent is false (M false), so implication is false → False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
4: True
5: Unknown
6: Unknown
7: True
8: True
9: False
