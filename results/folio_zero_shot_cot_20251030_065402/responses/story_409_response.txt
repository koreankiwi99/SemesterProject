Story ID: 409
Premises: All red fruits that grow in Ben's yard contain some Vitamin C.
All apples that grow in Ben's yard are red fruits.
All fruits that grow in Ben's yard and contain some Vitamin C are healthy. 
No fruits that grow in Ben's yard and are healthy are on a warning list.
The cherries grow in Ben's yard.
If cherries are not apples and are not healthy, then they are red fruits.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From G(cherries).
- If cherries were not apples and not healthy, rule 6 gives Red; with G, rule 1 gives Vitamin C; with G, rule 3 gives Healthy, contradicting not healthy. So not (not-apple and not-healthy), hence Apple(cherries) or Healthy(cherries).
- But if Apple(cherries), then with G rule 2 gives Red; with G rule 1 gives Vitamin C; with G rule 3 gives Healthy. So in all cases, cherries are Healthy.
- From G and Healthy, rule 4 gives not on a warning list.
- We cannot conclude Apple, Red, or Vitamin C outright; Red and Vitamin C remain undetermined unless Apple or Red is established.

Question 1: Are the cherries apples?
- We proved cherries are Healthy, but Apple remains undetermined. So Unknown.

Question 2: Do the cherries either contain Vitamin C or are on a warning list? (C ∨ Warning)
- We know not Warning; C is undetermined. So Unknown.

Question 3: Are the cherries either on a warning list or red? (Warning ∨ Red)
- Not Warning; Red is undetermined. So Unknown.

Question 4: If the cherries are either healthy or on a warning list, then they are not red? ((Healthy ∨ Warning) → ¬Red)
- Healthy is true, so this reduces to ¬Red, which is undetermined. So Unknown.

Question 5: If the cherries are either on a warning list or red, then they are not healthy and have no Vitamin C? ((Warning ∨ Red) → (¬Healthy ∧ ¬C))
- Not Warning, so this reduces to Red → (¬Healthy ∧ ¬C). But with G, Red implies C and Healthy (rules 1 and 3), so if Red then the consequent is false. Since Red is not entailed, the whole implication is not determined. So Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
