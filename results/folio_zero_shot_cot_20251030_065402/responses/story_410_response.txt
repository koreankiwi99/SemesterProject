Story ID: 410
Premises: All products designed by Apple are sold at Apple Stores.
All products with Apple logos are designed by Apple.
All Macbooks have Apple logos.
All products with Apple M2 chips are Mackbooks.
A Thinkpad X1 is not both sold in Apple Stores and is a Macbook.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Chain of implications: Macbook → AppleLogo → Designed-by-Apple → Sold-in-Apple-Stores. So any Macbook is sold in Apple Stores.
- Given ¬(Sold(T) ∧ Macbook(T)) and Macbook → Sold, we must have ¬Macbook(T) to avoid contradiction.
- Given M2 → Macbook and ¬Macbook(T), we conclude ¬M2(T).
- Sold(T) remains undetermined; it could be sold without being a Macbook.

Question 1: Since ¬M2(T), the statement “T has an Apple M2 chip” is false.

Question 2: We cannot determine Sold(T); thus it is uncertain.

Question 3: Since both ¬M2(T) and ¬Macbook(T), the conjunction is false.

Question 4: Since both disjuncts are false, the disjunction is false.

Question 5: The antecedent (M2(T) ∧ Macbook(T)) is false, so the implication is true.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: Unknown
3: False
4: False
5: True
