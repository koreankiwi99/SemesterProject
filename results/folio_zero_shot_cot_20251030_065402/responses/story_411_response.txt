Story ID: 411
Premises: If a game is one of the top-3 best selling video-games, then it is multiplatform.
If a game has sold more than 100 million copies, then it is one of the top-3 best-selling video games.
Some games that support Windows are developed by Nintendo.
All multiplatform games can be played on a wide range of devices.
Pokemon Diamond version is neither developed by Nintendo nor can be played on a wide range of devices.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- Top-3 best selling -> Multiplatform.
- Sold >100M -> Top-3.
- Some Windows-supporting games are developed by Nintendo (existential; no universal link).
- Multiplatform -> Playable on a wide range of devices.
- Pokemon Diamond (P): not developed by Nintendo and not playable on a wide range of devices.

Deductions:
- From Multiplatform -> Wide range and P not wide range, conclude P is not multiplatform (contraposition).
- From Top-3 -> Multiplatform and P not multiplatform, conclude P is not Top-3 (contraposition).
- From Sold >100M -> Top-3 and P not Top-3, conclude P did not sell >100M (contraposition).

Question 1:
No premise links Windows support to wide range, multiplatform, or Nintendo in a way that determines P’s Windows support. The existential about some Windows-supporting games being Nintendo-made does not apply to P (and P is not Nintendo-made). So status is undetermined.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
Conjunction “supports Windows and sold >100M.” We established P did not sell >100M. Thus the conjunction is false regardless of Windows support.
Answer: False.

Question 3:
If P supports Windows or sold >100M, then P either is both multiplatform and Top-3, or is neither multiplatform nor Top-3.
We have established P is neither multiplatform nor Top-3. Hence the consequent is true, making the implication true regardless of the antecedent.
Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
