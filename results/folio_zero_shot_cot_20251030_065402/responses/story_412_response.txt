Story ID: 412
Premises: All fruits sold at Nica's market are shipped from Colombia. 
Some fruits sold in New Haven are shipped from Mexico.
No fruits shipped from Colombia are sold at the local farmers market in New Haven. 
Avocados are a kind of fruit sold at the local farmers market in New Haven or at Nica's market. 
Avocados are either shipped from Colombia and sold in New Haven, or neither.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: Nica → Colombia; Colombia → not(FM-in-New-Haven). Also, sold at the local farmers market in New Haven (FM) implies sold in New Haven (NH).
- Avocados: FM or Nica; and either (Colombia and NH) or (neither Colombia nor NH).
- The “neither” branch (¬Colombia ∧ ¬NH) is impossible: if ¬Colombia, then not Nica; but then FM must be true, which implies NH, contradicting ¬NH.
- Therefore avocados are Colombia and NH. Then by Colombia → ¬FM, FM is false; by FM or Nica, Nica is true.

Conclusions:
- Q1: FM is false.
- Q2: FM ∨ NH is true (NH is true).
- Q3: NH ∨ Nica is true (both are true).
- Q4: ¬(FM ∧ Colombia) holds, but (¬FM ∧ ¬NH) is false (NH is true), so the implication is false.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
4: False
