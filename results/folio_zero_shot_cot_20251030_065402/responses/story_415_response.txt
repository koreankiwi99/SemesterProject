Story ID: 415
Premises: All books written by Neil Gaiman have sold more than one thousand copies.
Some books that have won Hugo Awards are written by Neil Gaiman.
Tomas has read all books written by Tolkien. 
Either Tomas has read Hamlet, or it has sold more than one thousand copies.
Hamlet has either sold more than one thousand copies or it is written by Neil Gaiman.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Q1: Nothing states Hamlet won a Hugo; the statement about some Hugo winners being by Neil Gaiman doesn’t identify Hamlet. Undetermined.
- Q2: There’s no information that Hamlet won a Hugo or was written by Tolkien; neither is implied or contradicted. Undetermined.
- Q3: The antecedent could be true (e.g., Hamlet both won a Hugo and is by Tolkien), while the consequent would then be false. This scenario is consistent with the premises, so the implication is not determined.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
