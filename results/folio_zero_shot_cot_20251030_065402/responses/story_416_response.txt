Story ID: 416
Premises: Some students in the class who are good at math are also good at chemistry.
All students in the class who are good at chemistry enjoy conducting experiments. 
All students in the class that enjoy conducting experiments are good at planning. 
None of the students who are good at planning failed the class.
James is a student in the class; he is either good at chemistry and failed the class, or bad at chemistry and passed the class.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
First, derive implications from the context:
- Good at chemistry -> Enjoy experiments -> Good at planning -> Not failed. So C -> E -> P -> ¬F, hence C -> ¬F. By contraposition chain, F -> ¬C.
- Given: James is either (C ∧ F) or (¬C ∧ ¬F). Since C ∧ F is impossible (because C -> ¬F), James must be ¬C and ¬F.

Question 1 reasoning:
- From ¬C and ¬F, we cannot infer P. P -> ¬F does not reverse to ¬F -> P. So James may or may not be good at planning.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2 reasoning:
- James is not good at chemistry (¬C). Therefore he cannot be both good at math and chemistry, regardless of math.
Answer: False.

Question 3 reasoning:
- James did not fail (¬F). Thus he cannot have failed the class, regardless of math.
Answer: False.

Question 4 reasoning:
- The antecedent (C ∨ F) is false for James (since ¬C and ¬F). A conditional with a false antecedent is true.
Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: False
4: True
