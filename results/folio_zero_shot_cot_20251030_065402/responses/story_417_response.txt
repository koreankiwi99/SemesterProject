Story ID: 417
Premises: Some monitors made by LG have a type-c port.
Monitors that have a type-c port were not made before 2010.
All monitors in the library are made before 2010. 
The L-2021 monitor is either used in the library or has a type-c port.
The L-2021 monitor is either both produced before 2010 and made by LG, or neither is true.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- TypeC → ¬Before2010; contrapositive: Before2010 → ¬TypeC.
- InLibrary → Before2010, thus InLibrary → ¬TypeC.
- For L-2021: InLibrary ∨ TypeC. Also (Before2010 ∧ LG) ∨ (¬Before2010 ∧ ¬LG), i.e., LG ↔ Before2010.

This yields exactly two consistent cases for L-2021:
1) InLibrary T → Before2010 T → LG T → TypeC F.
2) TypeC T → Before2010 F → LG F → InLibrary F.

Evaluate statements:
1) InLibrary? True in case 1, false in case 2 → Unknown.
2) InLibrary ∨ LG? True in case 1, false in case 2 → Unknown.
3) TypeC ∨ LG? True in both cases → True.
4) Antecedent (InLibrary ∧ LG) ∨ (¬InLibrary ∧ ¬LG) holds in both cases; consequent (¬TypeC ∧ ¬LG) is false in both cases → implication is False.
5) Antecedent (LG ∧ Before2010) ∨ (¬LG ∧ ¬Before2010) is guaranteed true; consequent (InLibrary ∨ LG) is Unknown (as in Q2) → implication Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: True
4: False
5: Unknown

Questions and Results:
==================================================
Q1: The monitor L-2021 is in the library.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: The monitor L-2021 is either in the library or produced by LG.
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: No

Q3: The L-2021 monitor either has a type-c port or is produced by LG.
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes

Q4: If the L-2021 monitor is either in the library and produced by LG, or neither in the library nor produced by LG,  then L-2021 neither has a type-c port nor is produced by LG.
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes

Q5: If the monitor L-2021 is either produced by LG and produced before 2010 or neither produced by LG nor produced before 2010,  then L-2021 is either in the library or produced by LG.
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: No
