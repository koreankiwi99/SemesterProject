Story ID: 418
Premises: Some monitors equipped in the library are produced by AOC. 
All monitors equipped in the library are cheaper than 800 dollars. 
All monitors cheaper than 800 dollars are with a resolution lower than 1080p. 
If a monitor has a resolution lower than 1080p, then it does not support the type-c port. 
A-2017 supports the type-c port. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: Equipped-in-library → Cheaper-than-800 → Resolution-lower-than-1080p → Not-Type-C. Therefore, Equipped-in-library → Not-Type-C.
- A-2017 supports Type-C, so by contrapositive, A-2017 is not equipped in the library.

Question 1:
- The only info about manufacturer is that some library-equipped monitors are AOC. Since A-2017 is not in the library and we have no other manufacturer info, we cannot conclude it’s AOC. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement requires A-2017 to be both AOC and equipped in the library. We have established it is not equipped in the library, so the conjunction is false. Answer: False.

Question 3:
- Regardless of whether the antecedent about 1080p and AOC holds, we already know A-2017 is not equipped in the library. Hence the implication is true. Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
