Story ID: 419
Premises: Some employees in James's town who work in business analysis are good at math. 
All of the employees in James's town who work in business analysis are working for this company. 
None of the employees in James's town who work for this company are from China. 
All of the employees in James's town working in software engineering are from China. 
Leif is an employee in James's town, and he is working in software engineering.  

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “All of the employees in James’s town working in software engineering are from China” and “Leif … is working in software engineering,” we get: Leif is from China.
- From “None of the employees … who work for this company are from China,” contraposition gives: If from China, then not working for this company. So Leif is not working for this company.
- From “All … who work in business analysis are working for this company,” any BA employee is not from China (by the previous point). Since SE employees are from China, no one can be both BA and SE. Thus Leif is not in business analysis.

Question 1: Whether Leif is good at math is not entailed by any premise; it’s independent of being SE. Therefore Unknown.

Question 2: Since Leif is not in business analysis, he cannot be both good at math and in business analysis. Therefore True.

Question 3: The antecedent “Leif is not both good at math and in business analysis” is true (from Q2). The consequent says “he is neither working in this company nor working in software engineering.” We have: not working in this company (true) but he is working in software engineering (true), so “nor working in software engineering” is false, making the whole consequent false. Hence the implication is False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
