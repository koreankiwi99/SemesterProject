Story ID: 422
Premises: All customers in James' family who subscribe to AMC A-List are eligible to watch three movies every week without any additional fees. 
Some of the customers in James' family go to the cinema every week.
Customers in James' family subscribe to AMC A-List or HBO service. 
Customers in James' family who prefer TV series will not watch TV series in cinemas.
All customers in James' family who subscribe to HBO services prefer TV series to movies. 
Lily is in James' family; she watches TV series in cinemas. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “Customers … who prefer TV series will not watch TV series in cinemas” and “Lily … watches TV series in cinemas,” we infer Lily does not prefer TV series (W → ¬T).
- From “All … who subscribe to HBO … prefer TV series” (H → T), contrapositive gives ¬T → ¬H, so Lily is not an HBO subscriber.
- From “Customers … subscribe to AMC A-List or HBO service,” and ¬H, Lily must subscribe to AMC A-List (A).
- From “All … who subscribe to AMC A-List are eligible to watch three movies every week without any additional fees,” Lily is eligible/available to watch 3 movies weekly without fees (E).
- Nothing ties “watches TV series in cinemas” to “goes every week,” so weekly attendance (G) remains unknown.

Q1: Whether Lily goes to cinemas every week (G) is not determined. Unknown.

Q2: The negation of weekly attendance (¬G) is also not determined. Unknown.

Q3: “Goes every week or watches 3 movies every week without fees.” We only know Lily is eligible (E), not that she actually watches 3 movies weekly. Neither disjunct is established true or false. Unknown.

Q4: If not (goes every week and HBO), then (available to watch 3 weekly or prefers TV). Since Lily is not HBO (¬H), the antecedent is true. She is available (E), so the consequent is true. The conditional is True.

Q5: If (available and watches TV series in cinemas) then (goes every week and prefers TV). Antecedent is true (E and W). But Lily does not prefer TV (¬T), so the consequent is false, making the conditional False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
4: True
5: False
