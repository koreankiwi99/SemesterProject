None of those at the business conference who enjoy the opportunity of starting a business prefer a planned economy. 
All entrepreneurs at the business conference enjoy the opportunity of starting a business. 
Everyone at the business conference who enjoys state ownership of means of production prefers a planned economy. 
Everyone at the business conference who is an ardent communist prefers state ownership of the means of production.
Ho is at the business conference and prefers state ownership of the means of production. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “Everyone at the business conference who supports state ownership of the means of production prefers a planned economy” and “Ho prefers state ownership of the means of production,” we infer Ho prefers a planned economy.
- From “All entrepreneurs at the business conference enjoy the opportunity of starting a business” and “None of those at the business conference who enjoy the opportunity of starting a business prefer a planned economy,” it follows that no entrepreneur at the conference prefers a planned economy. Therefore, since Ho prefers a planned economy, Ho is not an entrepreneur.
- From “Everyone at the business conference is either an investor or an entrepreneur” and Ho is not an entrepreneur, we conclude Ho is an investor.
- The rule about ardent communists only goes one way: being an ardent communist implies preferring state ownership, but preferring state ownership does not imply being an ardent communist. Hence we cannot determine whether Ho is an ardent communist.

Question 1: We cannot determine whether Ho is an ardent communist. Unknown.

Question 2: Ho is an investor (as shown), so “Ho is an investor or is not an ardent communist” is true.
