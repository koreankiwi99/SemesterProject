Story ID: 424
Premises: Customers choose a Prime Video plan or an HBO Max Plan, or both. 
All customers who choose a Prime Video Plan are rewarded with a $30 gift card. 
There are no customers who do not choose any plan. 
None of the customers who are rewarded with a $30 gift card are older than 80.
All the customers are either older than 80 or between the ages of 60 and 80.
James is a customer who is not between the ages of 60 and 80. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “All customers are either older than 80 or between 60 and 80” and “James is not between 60 and 80,” James is older than 80.
- “None of the customers who are rewarded with a $30 gift card are older than 80” implies if older than 80 then not rewarded.
- “All customers who choose a Prime Video Plan are rewarded” implies if Prime then rewarded; combining with not rewarded gives James did not choose Prime.
- “There are no customers who do not choose any plan” and “Customers choose a Prime Video plan or an HBO Max Plan, or both” together imply every customer picks at least one plan; since James did not choose Prime, he must choose HBO Max.

Question 1:
- The claim that James chooses no plans contradicts the rule that every customer chooses at least one plan and our deduction that James chooses HBO Max. False.

Question 2:
- The statement is “Prime or no plan.” We have established James did not choose Prime and also does not have no plan. So both disjuncts are false; the disjunction is false. False.

Question 3:
- If James chose Prime, then he would be rewarded, making the consequent “rewarded or HBO Max” true.
- If James chose no plan, that contradicts the given constraints, making the antecedent impossible; the conditional holds vacuously. Hence the conditional is true given the premises. True.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: False
3: True
