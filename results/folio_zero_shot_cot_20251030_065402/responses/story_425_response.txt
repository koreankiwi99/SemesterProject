Story ID: 425
Premises: Everyone working at Meta has a high income. 
A person with a high income will not take a bus to their destination.
People will either take a bus or drive to their destination. 
Everyone who has a car will choose to drive to their destination. 
No students drive to their destination. 
James has a car or works at Meta.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From: High income -> not bus; and (bus or drive), we get: High income -> drive.
- From: No students drive, we get contrapositive: drive -> not student.
- From: Has a car -> drive.
- From: Works at Meta -> high income -> drive.
- Given: James has a car or works at Meta. In either case, James drives. Therefore James drives, and by drive -> not student, James is not a student. We cannot determine whether James has a high income because that follows only if he works at Meta, which is not certain.

Question 1: James has a high income.
- Only guaranteed if he works at Meta; since he might only have a car, this is not entailed. Unknown.

Question 2: James does not have a high income.
- Not entailed; could work at Meta. Unknown.

Question 3: James is a student.
- From James drives and no students drive, James is not a student. So this is false.

Question 4: James drives to his destination or he is a student.
- James drives, so the disjunction is true.

Question 5: James either drives to their destination or is a student.
- Same disjunction; true.

Question 6: If James either drives to his destination or is a student, then he has a high income and is a student.
- Antecedent is true (he drives). Consequent requires student, which is false. Thus the implication is false.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: False
