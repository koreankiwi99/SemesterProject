Premises: If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country. 
Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary. 
Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.
Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison. 
Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record.
James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.
James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From "Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison" and "Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record," and "James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison," we can conclude James has been to prison and thus has a criminal record.
- From "James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes," knowing he has a criminal record does not allow us to conclude he pays his taxes.
- From "If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country," contribution follows from paying taxes. Also, "Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department" and "Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary" imply that if James is in the army, he pays taxes and thus contributes.
- However, we have no information that James pays taxes or that he serves in the army. Therefore, whether he contributes is undetermined, and so are the conjunctions involving army service.
