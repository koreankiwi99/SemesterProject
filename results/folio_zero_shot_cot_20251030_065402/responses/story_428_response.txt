All of the devices belonging to employees can be connected to the company's wifi. 
All of the devices connected to Google Home are controlled by managers. 
All of the devices that connect to the company's wifi are easy to operate. 
All of the devices that are easy to operate were produced after a new CTO is appointed. 
ModelXX was not produced after a new CTO was appointed.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From Easy -> After and the fact that ModelXX was not produced after the new CTO (¬After), we get ¬Easy (contrapositive).
- From Wifi -> Easy and ¬Easy, we get ¬Wifi (contrapositive).
- From Employee -> Wifi and ¬Wifi, we get ¬Employee (contrapositive).
- From (Logo or Employee) and ¬Employee, we get Logo.
- From Logo -> Company, Company -> GoogleHome, and GoogleHome -> Managers, we get that ModelXX is controlled by managers.

Question 1:
- As shown, ModelXX is controlled by managers. True.

Question 2:
- After(ModelXX) is false, but ModelXX is controlled by managers, so the disjunction (After or Managers) is true. True.

Question 3:
- We have Logo true and Managers true, so “not logo and not controlled” is false. False.

Question 4:
- “Logo or controlled by managers” is true since both are true. True.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: False
4: True
