Premises: None of the easy Leetcode problems have an AC rate lower than 20 percent. 
All Leetcode problems recommended to novices are easy. 
Leetcode problems either have an AC rate lower than 20 percent or are starred by more than 1 thousand users. 
All hard Leetcode problems are starred by more than 1,000 users. 
No Leetcode problems published after 2022 are starred by more than 1,000 users. 
'2Sum' is not both hard and also recommended to novices.
'4Sum' is either starred by more than 1,000 users and published after 2022, or it is neither. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises:
  - Easy -> not Low-AC (E -> ¬L).
  - Low-AC or Starred (L ∨ S). Hence, ¬L -> S and E -> S.
  - Hard -> Starred (Hard -> S).
  - Published-after-2022 -> not Starred (P -> ¬S). Thus P -> L (using L ∨ S) and then L -> ¬E (contrapositive of E -> ¬L), so P -> ¬E and also P -> ¬Hard (since Hard -> S).
- For 2Sum: Only given ¬(Hard ∧ Nov). Since Nov -> E, if Nov were true then E would be true and Hard false; but we are not told whether Nov holds. So whether 2Sum is easy cannot be determined.
- For 4Sum: (S ∧ P) ∨ (¬S ∧ ¬P), and P -> ¬S, so the first disjunct is impossible; thus ¬S ∧ ¬P. From ¬S and (L ∨ S), we get L. From L and E -> ¬L, we get ¬E; from Nov -> E, we get ¬Nov; and from Hard -> S with ¬S, we get ¬Hard.

Answers to questions:
1) 2Sum is easy: Not entailed; could be easy (if Nov), but also could be not easy. Unknown.
2) 2Sum is not easy: Also not entailed. Unknown.
3) 4Sum is Nov or Hard: We have ¬Nov and ¬Hard, so the disjunction is False.
4) 4Sum is neither Nov nor Hard: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: False
4: True
