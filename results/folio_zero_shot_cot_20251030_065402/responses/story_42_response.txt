Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. James Cocks is a lawyer and sat in the House of Commons, which contradicts “No lawyer ever sat in the House of Commons,” so the statement is false.
2. James Cocks is British (hence European) and a lawyer; any lawyer is familiar with laws. Therefore, there exists a European familiar with laws.
3. We only know that some Whigs speak French; this does not entail that James Cocks, a Whig, speaks French.
