Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Q1:
- From "Not(Ferrari ∧ made in Maranello)" and "made in Maranello ⇒ Ferrari," we deduce the Lamborghini SUV is not made in Maranello.
- "Made in Maranello ⇒ made in Italy," but the converse is not given. So we cannot conclude whether it is made in Italy.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Q2:
- As above, we only know it is not made in Maranello. That does not imply it is not made in Italy.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Q3:
- Birkin ⇒ Hermès; Hermès bags are not made in Italy.
- Made in Maranello ⇒ Ferrari ⇒ made in Italy.
- Therefore, nothing can be both a Birkin bag and made in Maranello. Hence the statement that a Kelly bag is a Birkin bag made in Maranello is false.
- Conclusion: False.

Q4:
- As shown, no Birkin bag can be made in Maranello.
- Therefore, a Kelly bag is not both made in Maranello and a Birkin bag.
- Conclusion: True.
