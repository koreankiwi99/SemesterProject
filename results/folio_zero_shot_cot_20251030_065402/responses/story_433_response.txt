Story ID: 433
Premises: There are no buildings in New Haven higher than 400 meters. 
All buildings managed by Yale Housing are in New Haven. 
All Manhattan skyscrapers are higher than 400 meters. 
All buildings owned by Bloomberg are in Manhattan. 
All buildings with the Bloomberg logo are buildings owned by Bloomberg. 
Tower A is neither a building in New Haven nor a skyscraper in Manhattan.
Tower B is a skyscraper building in Manhattan with a Bloomberg logo. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Facts:
  - No building in New Haven is higher than 400 m.
  - If managed by Yale Housing, then in New Haven.
  - If a skyscraper in Manhattan, then higher than 400 m.
  - If owned by Bloomberg, then in Manhattan.
  - If has Bloomberg logo, then owned by Bloomberg (hence in Manhattan).
  - Tower A is not in New Haven and is not a skyscraper in Manhattan.

Question 1:
- The given height constraints apply only to New Haven buildings (A is not there) or Manhattan skyscrapers (A is not one). No rule constrains A’s height otherwise. Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- As above, nothing implies A is ≤400 m; New Haven constraint doesn’t apply to A. Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- Managed by Yale Housing would imply being in New Haven, but A is not in New Haven, so A is not managed by Yale Housing.
- Having the Bloomberg logo would place A in Manhattan, which is consistent with A not being a Manhattan skyscraper (it could be a non-skyscraper). No evidence whether A has the logo.
- Disjunction = (unknown) OR (false) → Unknown.

Question 4:
- “Neither logo nor managed by Yale” = (not logo) AND (not managed by Yale).
- Not managed by Yale is true (as above). Not logo is unknown. Conjunction with one unknown and one true → Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
4: Unknown
