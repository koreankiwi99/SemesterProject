Story ID: 436
Premises: All of this brand's products are either produced in China or in the US. 
All of this brand's products produced in China are labeled. 
All of this brand's products produced in the US are sold in the US. 
The products of this brand that are labeled are cheaper.
All of this brand's products sold in the US are sold at Walmart. 
All products of this brand displayed on the homepage are sold at Walmart. 
None of this brand's products that are returned by customers are sold at Walmart. 
G-910 is a product of this brand, and it is either displayed on the homepage and is cheaper, or it is neither displayed on the homepage nor is it cheaper.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- For G-910, the statement “either displayed and cheaper, or neither displayed nor cheaper” means Displayed (D) if and only if Cheaper (Ch).
- Every product is either produced in China (C) or in the US (U).
- If C, then Labeled (L); L -> Ch; with D <-> Ch, this gives D, and D -> Sold at Walmart (SW).
- If U, then Sold in US (SU); SU -> SW. D remains unconstrained by U (except D <-> Ch), so D could be either true or false. Still, SW holds.
- Therefore, in all cases, G-910 is sold at Walmart (SW).
- Returned (R) products are not sold at Walmart (R -> not SW). Since SW is true for G-910, R must be false.

Now the questions:
1) D is not determined (could be true if C, or either true/false if only U). Unknown.
2) Not D likewise is not determined. Unknown.
3) R is false because SW is true and R -> not SW. False.
4) R or SW is true since SW is true. True.
5) “Either returned or sold at Walmart” is true as well; R is false and SW is true (also exclusive or would be satisfied). True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: False
4: True
5: True
