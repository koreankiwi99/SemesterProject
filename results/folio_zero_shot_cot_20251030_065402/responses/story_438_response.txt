Story ID: 438
Premises: None of the kids in our family love the opera.
All of the adults in our family love the opera.
If someone in our family is a scientist, then they are an adult.
Some students in our family are kids.
Billy is a kid in our family.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “Billy is a kid” and “None of the kids love the opera,” we get that Billy does not love the opera.
- From “All adults love the opera,” contrapositive gives: if someone does not love the opera, they are not an adult. So Billy is not an adult.
- From “If someone is a scientist, then they are an adult,” contrapositive gives: if someone is not an adult, they are not a scientist. So Billy is not a scientist.
- “Some students in our family are kids” does not imply that Billy specifically is a student.

Question 1: We cannot conclude whether Billy is a student. Unknown.

Question 2: Since Billy is not a scientist, the conjunction “student and scientist” is false. False.

Question 3: Antecedent is “Billy is a student or a scientist.” Since Billy is not a scientist, this reduces to “Billy is a student.” The consequent is “Billy is a student and a kid,” and Billy is a kid, so this reduces to “Billy is a student.” Thus the implication is “S -> S,” which is true. True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
