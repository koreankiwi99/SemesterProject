Story ID: 440
Premises: All tigers are cats.
No cats are dogs.
All Bengal tigers are tigers.
All huskies are dogs.
Fido is either a Bengal tiger or a cat.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- All Bengal tigers are tigers, and all tigers are cats, so all Bengal tigers are cats.
- No cats are dogs, and all huskies are dogs.
- “Fido is either a Bengal tiger or a cat” implies Fido is a cat (either way).

Question 1: If Fido were a husky, he’d be a dog; but no cats are dogs and Fido is a cat. So Fido cannot be a husky. The statement “Fido is a husky” is false.

Question 2: From the above, Fido is not a husky. True.

Question 3: We only know Fido is a cat; he may or may not be a Bengal tiger. Uncertain.

Question 4: Since Fido is a cat and no cats are dogs, Fido is not a dog. Huskies are dogs, so not a dog implies not a husky. Thus Fido is neither a dog nor a husky. True.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: Unknown
4: True
