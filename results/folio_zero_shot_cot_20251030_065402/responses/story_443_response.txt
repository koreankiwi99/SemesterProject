Story ID: 443
Premises: Some teachers who work at pools are not nice.
All teachers working at pools are pool managers.
All pool managers are lifeguards.
If someone is a lifeguard, then they work at a pool.
Mary does not work at a pool.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “If someone is a lifeguard, then they work at a pool” and “All pool managers are lifeguards,” we know lifeguards (and thus pool managers) work at pools. However, Mary does not work at a pool, so she is not a lifeguard and not a pool manager. Nothing in the premises constrains her niceness or whether she is a teacher, except that she cannot be a teacher who works at a pool.

Question 1:
- No information determines Mary’s niceness. Unknown.

Question 2:
- “Mary is not a nice teacher working at a pool” is the negation of being “a nice teacher who works at a pool.” Since Mary does not work at a pool, she cannot be such a person; thus the negated statement is true. True.

Question 3:
- This asserts Mary is a nice teacher who works at a pool. Since Mary does not work at a pool, the conjunction is false. False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
