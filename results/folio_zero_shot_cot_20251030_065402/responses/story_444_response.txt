Story ID: 444
Premises: All birds have wings.
Animals with wings aren't reptiles.
Some animals that fly are birds.
If something is an iguana, then it is a reptile. Simeng: All iguanas are reptiles. 
John is either both an iguana and a bird, or he is neither. 
John is an animal. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- All birds have wings. Animals with wings aren’t reptiles. Iguanas are reptiles. John is an animal. John is either both an iguana and a bird, or neither. If John were both an iguana (hence a reptile) and a bird (hence an animal with wings, thus not a reptile), that is a contradiction. Therefore, the “both” option is impossible, so the “neither” option holds: John is neither an iguana nor a bird.

Question 1:
- From “neither,” John is not an iguana and not a bird. Nothing else determines whether he is a reptile (he could be a non-iguana reptile without wings). So John being a reptile is not determined. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- “John is not both an iguana and an animal that can fly.” Since John is not an iguana, the conjunction “iguana and can fly” is false, making the negation true. Answer: True.

Question 3:
- “John is an animal that can fly and John is a bird.” We know John is not a bird, so this conjunction is false regardless of whether he can fly. Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
