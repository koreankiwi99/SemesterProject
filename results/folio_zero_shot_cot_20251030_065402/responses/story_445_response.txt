Story ID: 445
Premises: Anything lazy is unproductive.
No one unproductive is energetic.
If something is a sloth, then it is lazy.
Some animals are sloths.
Sid is neither an energetic person nor a sloth.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: Sloth -> Lazy -> Unproductive -> Not Energetic. Also, Some animals are sloths (existential, not about Sid). Sid is not an energetic person and not a sloth.
- Q1: Nothing links Sid to being an animal; knowing some animals are sloths and Sid is not a sloth doesn’t determine Sid’s animal status. Unknown.
- Q2: The claim requires Sid to be an energetic person, but we are told Sid is not an energetic person. Therefore the conjunction is false. False.
- Q3: The consequent “Sid is not an energetic person” is already given true, so the conditional holds regardless of whether Sid is an animal or unproductive. True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
