==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: Grown-in-garden -> Flower -> Plant -> Not cute animal. So if something is grown in a garden, it is not a cute animal.
- Every kitten is a cute animal: Kitten -> Cute animal.
- Piper is a kitten or a cute animal. Using Kitten -> Cute animal, this implies Piper is a cute animal (either directly, or via being a kitten).
- Since Piper is a cute animal, by contrapositive of Grown-in-garden -> Not cute animal (i.e., Cute animal -> Not grown-in-garden), Piper was not grown in a garden.

Question 1: Piper grown in a garden contradicts Piper being a cute animal, so False.
Question 2: From above, True.
Question 3: We only know Piper is a cute animal; we cannot conclude Piper is specifically a kitten. Unknown.

1: False
