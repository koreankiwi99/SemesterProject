Story ID: 447
Premises: No planet in the solar system relies on nuclear fusion to generate light.
All stars in the solar system rely on nuclear fusion to generate light. 
All celestial bodies in the solar systems that have greater than 0.08 solar masses are stars. 
If a celestial body in the solar system has cleared its orbit of other debris and has a nearly spherical shape due to its own gravity, then it is a planet.
If Europa is a celestial body in the solar system that has cleared its orbit of other debris and has a nearly spherical shape due to its own gravity or relies on nuclear fusion to generate light, then Europa is a celestial body in the solar system. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- We have a rule: if a celestial body in the solar system has cleared its orbit and is nearly spherical, then it is a planet.
- We are not given that Europa satisfies those properties. The conditional involving Europa only says that if Europa has those properties (or relies on fusion), then Europa is a celestial body in the solar system; it does not assert the antecedent is true.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude the statement is true or false from the given information.

Question 2:
- The only mass-related rule given is: any celestial body in the solar systems with mass > 0.08 solar masses is a star.
- There is no information that Europa has > 0.08 solar masses, nor any premise about “solar systems that have greater than 0.08 solar masses.”
- We also cannot establish from the premises that Europa is in any solar system at all.
- Therefore, the statement cannot be determined from the given information.

Question 3:
- This is essentially the negation of Question 2’s claim.
- Since Question 2 is undetermined from the premises, we also cannot conclude its negation.
- Therefore, this also remains undetermined.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
