Story ID: 448
Premises: Everyone that knows about breath-first-search knows how to use a queue. 
If someone is a seasoned software engineer interviewer at Google, then they know what breath-first-search is. 
Someone is either a seasoned software engineer interviewer at Google, has human rights, or both. 
Every person who has human rights is entitled to the right to life and liberty. 
Everyone that knows how to use a queue knows about the first-in-first-out data structure. 
Everyone that is entitled to the right to life and liberty cannot be deprived of their rights without due process of law. 
Jack is entitled to the right to life and liberty, has human rights, or knows about the first-in-first-out data structure. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Rules:
  - Google-seasoned-interviewer -> knows BFS -> knows how to use a queue -> knows FIFO.
  - Has human rights -> entitled to right to life and liberty.
  - Entitled to right to life and liberty -> cannot be deprived of rights without due process.
  - Two disjunctions:
    - There exists someone who is either a Google-seasoned-interviewer or has human rights (or both). This is existential and does not specify Jack.
    - Jack is either entitled to right to life and liberty, has human rights, or knows FIFO.

Question 1:
- No premise directly states Jack is a seasoned interviewer (Google or otherwise).
- The Jack-specific disjunction does not include being a seasoned interviewer.
- Therefore, cannot conclude; not contradicted either. Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- If Jack is entitled to life and liberty, then Jack cannot be deprived without due process.
- From the Jack-specific disjunction, Jack has at least one of: entitled, human rights, or knows FIFO.
- If Jack has human rights, then Jack is entitled; if Jack knows FIFO only, entitlement does not follow.
- The disjunction doesnâ€™t guarantee entitlement. Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- This is the negation of the protection in Question 2.
- We have no rule implying Jack can be deprived; and since entitlement is possible, we also cannot declare it true.
- Hence not determined. Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
