Story ID: 450
Premises: Those who can fly over a vast distance glide in the air. 
Flightless birds cannot fly over a vast distance. 
Penguins are flightless birds. 
Nonflying birds in Antarctica are penguins. 
Fido is a penguin, or flies over a vast distance. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- If someone can fly over a vast distance, then they glide in the air. (FlyVast -> Glide)
- Flightless birds cannot fly over a vast distance. (Flightless -> ¬FlyVast), hence contrapositively FlyVast -> ¬Flightless.
- Penguins are flightless birds. (Penguin -> Flightless -> ¬FlyVast)
- Nonflying birds in Antarctica are penguins. (NFLAnt -> Penguin)
- Fido is a penguin or flies over a vast distance. (Penguin(Fido) ∨ FlyVast(Fido))

Question 1:
- If Fido is a penguin, then he is flightless. If Fido flies over a vast distance, then he is not flightless. Since we only know Penguin(Fido) ∨ FlyVast(Fido), we cannot determine which disjunct holds. Therefore, whether Fido is flightless is not determined.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Claim: ¬NFLAnt(Fido) ∧ ¬Glide(Fido).
- From the premises, we cannot infer ¬NFLAnt(Fido); we only know NFLAnt -> Penguin, not the converse.
- We also cannot infer ¬Glide(Fido); we only have FlyVast -> Glide, and lack of FlyVast does not imply lack of Glide.
- Moreover, in the case FlyVast(Fido) holds (consistent with the disjunction), Glide(Fido) would be true, making the second conjunct false. But this is not forced by the premises. Hence the conjunction is neither entailed nor contradicted.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The antecedent “Fido either can fly over a vast distance or cannot fly over a vast distance” is a tautology (FlyVast ∨ ¬FlyVast). Thus the conditional is equivalent to asserting NFLAnt(Fido).
- The premises do not entail NFLAnt(Fido), nor its negation. Therefore the conditional is not determined.
Answer: Unknown.

1: Unknown
