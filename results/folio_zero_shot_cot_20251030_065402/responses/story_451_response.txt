Story ID: 451
Premises: People on the payroll are being paid by the school.
If someone has a job at a school, then they are on the payroll.
All faculty members have a job at a school.
If someone teaches students, they are a faculty member or a teacher.
Every teacher has students.
If Nancy is a teacher, then they are on the payroll.
If Nancy is not a teacher, then they are not paid by the school.
Nancy teaches students.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Nancy teaches students. From this, she is either a faculty member or a teacher.
- In either case she is paid:
  - If teacher: Teacher(Nancy) -> OnPayroll(Nancy) -> Paid(Nancy).
  - If faculty: Faculty(Nancy) -> JobAtSchool(Nancy) -> OnPayroll(Nancy) -> Paid(Nancy).
- Thus Paid(Nancy). From (~Teacher -> ~Paid), by contrapositive Paid -> Teacher, so Teacher(Nancy).
- From Every teacher has students, HasStudents(Nancy).
- We have no rule that forces Faculty(Nancy); knowing she is a teacher does not imply she is faculty.

Question 1: We cannot conclude faculty; Unknown.
Question 2: Paid and has students are both true; True.
Question 3: “Not paid or not have students” is false since both conjuncts are true; False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
