Story ID: 454
Premises: Functional brainstems are necessary for breath control.
All humans that can swim can control their breath. 
Humans can swim or walk. 
Humans who can walk can stand on the ground by themselves. 
Humans whose brainstems are functional can control their balance.
Every human who can stand on the ground by themselves has functional leg muscles. 
George and Archie are humans.
George can control his balance and can swim.
Archie can walk if and only if he has functional brainstems.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- George is human and can swim, so he can control his breath, hence he has functional brainstems.
- Having functional brainstems (for humans) implies he can control his balance, which matches the given.
- To have functional leg muscles, we would need that he can stand by himself, which follows from walking. We have no information that George walks; “humans can swim or walk” plus the fact he swims does not imply he walks.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude George has functional leg muscles. Unknown.

Question 2:
- Archie is human, so he can swim or walk.
- If Archie swims, then he can control his breath, hence has functional brainstems; by the biconditional, having functional brainstems implies he walks. Thus swimming implies walking.
- From “swim or walk” and “swim implies walk,” we conclude Archie walks.
- Walking implies he can stand by himself, which implies he has functional leg muscles.
- From walking and the biconditional, Archie has functional brainstems; as a human with functional brainstems, he can control his balance.
- So Archie has functional leg muscles and can control his balance. True.

Question 3:
- From Question 2, Archie can control his balance and has functional leg muscles.
- Therefore, the claim that he cannot control his balance and doesn’t have functional leg muscles is false.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
