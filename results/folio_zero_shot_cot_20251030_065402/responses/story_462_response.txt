Story ID: 462
Premises: All classrooms in William L. Harkness Hall that are used for lectures are booked during the day. 
None of the classrooms in William L. Harkness Hall are private study spots.
All classrooms in William L. Harkness Hall are used for lectures or used for office hours.
If a classroom in William L. Harkness Hall is booked in the evening, then it is not freely usable at night.
If a classroom in William L. Harkness Hall is used for office hours, then it is booked in the evening.
Room 116 is a classroom in William L. Harkness Hall that is either both used for lecture and used for office hours or not used for either.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: Every WLH classroom is either used for lectures or office hours (3). Room 116 is either both or neither (6). The “neither” option contradicts (3), so Room 116 is both used for lectures and for office hours. Therefore: Lecture(116) and OfficeHours(116).
- Then: Lecture → Booked during the day (1), so BookedDay(116). Office hours → Booked in the evening (5), and Booked evening → not freely usable at night (4), so ¬FreelyUsableNight(116).
- No WLH classroom is a private study spot (2), so ¬PrivateStudy(116).

Question 1:
- ¬PrivateStudy(116). So the statement “Room 116 is a private study spot” is False.

Question 2:
- Antecedent: (BookedDay ∧ FreelyUsableNight) ∨ (¬BookedDay ∧ ¬FreelyUsableNight). With BookedDay true and FreelyUsableNight false, both disjuncts are false, so antecedent is false.
- Consequent: OfficeHours ∨ PrivateStudy is true (OfficeHours true).
- Implication with false antecedent (and in fact true consequent) is True.

Question 3:
- Antecedent: ¬(PrivateStudy ∧ FreelyUsableNight) is true (both conjuncts are false).
- Consequent: Lecture ∨ BookedDay is true (both are true).
- Therefore the implication is True.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
