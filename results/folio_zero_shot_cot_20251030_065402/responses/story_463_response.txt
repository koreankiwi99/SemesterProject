Story ID: 463
Premises: All eels are fish. 
No fish are plants. 
Everything displayed in the collection is either a plant or an animal.
All multicellular animals are not bacteria.
All animals displayed in the collection are multicellular.
A sea eel is displayed in the collection.
The sea eel is an eel or an animal or not a plant.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “Everything displayed in the collection is either a plant or an animal” and “A sea eel is displayed,” the sea eel is a plant or an animal.
- Assume the sea eel is not an animal. Then, since it’s displayed, it must be a plant. Given “The sea eel is an eel or an animal or not a plant,” with not animal and plant, it must be an eel. All eels are fish, and no fish are plants, so it would be not a plant, contradicting that it is a plant. Hence, the sea eel must be an animal.
- All animals displayed are multicellular, so the sea eel is multicellular. All multicellular animals are not bacteria, so the sea eel is not bacteria.

Question 1: We established the sea eel is an animal, but nothing forces it to be an eel; the disjunction allows animal without eel. So this is unknown.

Question 2: As shown, the sea eel is not bacteria. So “the sea eel is bacteria” is false.

Question 3: The sea eel is multicellular (as a displayed animal), so “multicellular or bacteria” is true.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
