Story ID: 465
Premises: Everyone who took the bar exam can read. 
All lawyers took the bar exam. 
Everyone who took the bar exam is knowledgeable about criminal procedures. 
All people who got a score of 180 on the LSAT can read. 
No elephants can read. 
If Mike can not read or is not an elephant, then Mike either took the bar exam or can read. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

Shared deductions about Mike:
- Suppose Mike cannot read. Then by the conditional, Mike either took the bar exam or can read. Since he cannot read in this supposition, he must have taken the bar exam; but everyone who took the bar exam can read, a contradiction. Therefore, Mike can read.
- Since no elephants can read, and Mike can read, Mike is not an elephant.

Question 1:
- From “LSAT 180 → can read” and the fact we only know Mike can read, we cannot infer he got 180 on the LSAT. The converse is not given. So this is unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement is “Mike did not take the bar exam AND is not both knowledgeable and someone who got 180.”
- We do not know whether Mike took the bar exam. If he did, he would be knowledgeable; we still wouldn’t know about LSAT 180. Since both parts of the conjunction are undetermined, the whole statement is not entailed nor contradicted by the premises. So unknown.

Question 3:
- From the conditional and our deduction that Mike can read, we cannot conclude he took the bar exam (the conditional is satisfied by his reading alone). So this is unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
