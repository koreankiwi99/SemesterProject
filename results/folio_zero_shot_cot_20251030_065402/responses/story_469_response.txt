Story ID: 469
Premises: All members of the university faculty are professors.
All principal investigators are members of the university faculty.
No professor is also an undergraduate student.
Anyone pursuing a bachelor's degree is an undergraduate student.
Leon is not pursuing a bachelor's degree, and he is not a principal investigator.
If Leon is not pursuing a bachelor's degree, then he is a professor.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “If Leon is not pursuing a bachelor's degree, then he is a professor” and “Leon is not pursuing a bachelor's degree,” Leon is a professor.
- From “No professor is also an undergraduate student,” Leon is not an undergraduate student.
- From “He is not a principal investigator,” Leon is not a PI.
- From “All members of the university faculty are professors,” we only get Faculty -> Professor, not the converse. So being a professor does not imply being faculty.

Question 1:
- We know Leon is a professor, but that does not imply he is faculty. Not enough information to conclude faculty status.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- We have established Leon is not an undergraduate student and not a principal investigator.
- Answer: True.

Question 3:
- The antecedent “Leon is not a principal investigator” is true. The consequent “Leon is an undergraduate student” is false (since Leon is a professor and professors are not undergraduates).
- A true antecedent and false consequent makes the implication false.
- Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
