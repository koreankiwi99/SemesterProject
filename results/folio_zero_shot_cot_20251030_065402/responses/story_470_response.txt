Story ID: 470
Premises: A Unix operating system used in the lab computers is a piece of software.
All versions of MacOS used in the lab computer are based on Unix operating systems.
A lab computer uses either MacOS or Linux. 
All Linux computers in the lab are convenient.
All software used in the lab computers is written with code.
If something is convenient in the lab computer, then it is popular.
Burger is used in the lab computer, and it is written with code and a new version of MacOS.
PyTorch is used in the lab computer, and PyTorch is neither a Linux system nor a piece of software.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Popularity only follows from convenience: If something is convenient in the lab computer, then it is popular.
- The only given source of convenience is for Linux computers: All Linux computers in the lab are convenient.
- Burger is a new version of MacOS used in the lab computer and is written with code. There is no statement that Burger (a MacOS version) or the MacOS-using computer is convenient, so we cannot infer Burger is popular. Nothing states Burger is not popular either.
- PyTorch is used in the lab computer and is explicitly neither a Linux system nor a piece of software. The rule that all software used is written with code does not apply to PyTorch (since itâ€™s not software), and there is no other rule implying it is written with code. There is also no information that PyTorch is convenient, so we cannot infer it is popular. Likewise, we cannot infer it is not popular or not written with code.
