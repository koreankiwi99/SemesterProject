Story ID: 473
Premises: All pets in my house are either cats or dogs.
All the dogs in my house bark.
Ghosts do not exist.
If some pet in my house barks, then it is not dead.
All of the pets in my house are either dead or alive.
Jojo is a pet in my house, and it is not alive.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Q1:
- Premise: Ghosts do not exist → nothing is a ghost.
- Therefore, Jojo is not a ghost.
- So the statement “Jojo is a ghost” is false.

Q2:
- Jojo is a pet → by “all pets are cats or dogs,” Jojo is a cat or a dog.
- Jojo is not alive; with “pets are either dead or alive,” Jojo is dead.
- From “dogs bark” and “if a pet barks then it is not dead,” dogs are not dead; contrapositive gives: dead → not dog. Hence Jojo is not a dog, so Jojo is a cat.
- Therefore “Jojo is a cat or a ghost” is true (cat is true).

Q3:
- Antecedent “Jojo is a cat or a ghost” is true (Jojo is a cat).
- Jojo is dead, so by contrapositive of “if a pet barks then it is not dead,” Jojo does not bark; and as above, dead → not dog.
- Thus the consequent “Jojo barks or is a dog” is false.
- True antecedent and false consequent make the conditional false.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: False
