==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “Hulu is a multicellular creature that is autotrophic or digests food internally” and “All multicellular creatures that are autotrophic or digest food internally are plants and animals,” we conclude: Hulu is a plant and an animal.
- From “Plants are not capable of abstract thoughts,” we conclude: Hulu is not capable of abstract thoughts.
- From “Dirt is not an animal” and “Hulu is an animal,” we conclude (by contrapositive) that Hulu is not dirt.

Question 1: Hulu is capable of abstract thoughts.
- Since Hulu is a plant and plants are not capable of abstract thoughts, this is False.

Question 2: Hulu is not capable of abstract thoughts.
- As just noted, this is True.

Question 3: Hulu is dirt.
- Dirt implies not animal, but Hulu is an animal; therefore False.

Question 4: Hulu is an animal or dirt.
- Hulu is an animal; thus the disjunction is True.

Question 5: Hulu is either an animal or dirt, but not both.
- Hulu is an animal and not dirt; exclusive-or is True.

Question 6: If Hulu is either an animal or dirt, then Hulu is capable of abstract thoughts and is dirt.
- Antecedent is True (Hulu is an animal). Consequent is False (Hulu is not capable and not dirt). Therefore the implication is False.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: False
4: True
5: True
