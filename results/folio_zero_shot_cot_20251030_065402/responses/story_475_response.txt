Story ID: 475
Premises: Everyone who is entitled to national social insurance coverage can have their medical bills partially covered. 
All PRC nationals are entitled to national social insurance coverage.
Everyone in the Franco-China diplomatic conference is either a PRC national or a French national, but not both. 
All French nationals are citizens of the European Union. 
All Spanish nationals are citizens of the European Union. 
No North Korean nationals are citizens of the European Union. 
Mei is at the Franco-China diplomatic conference. 
Either Mei is a North Korean and can have medical bills partially covered, or neither is true.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- PRC ⇒ Entitled ⇒ Covered.
- At the conference, Mei is PRC xor French.
- French ⇒ EU.
- Spanish ⇒ EU.
- North Korean ⇒ not EU.
- For Mei: (North Korean and Covered) or (neither), which means North Korean ↔ Covered.

Deductions specific to Mei:
- If PRC, then Covered, hence North Korean, hence not EU. So PRC ⇒ not EU. Also, PRC is incompatible with Spanish (since Spanish ⇒ EU).
- If French, then EU. French is incompatible with North Korean (since that would force both EU and not EU). By North Korean ↔ Covered, in the French case Covered is false.

Question 1:
Mei is either PRC or French (exclusively). Both cases are consistent with the premises. Therefore, whether Mei is PRC is not determined.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
Likewise, whether Mei is not PRC is also not determined from the premises.
Answer: Unknown.

Question 3:
We must check: If (Mei is North Korean or Spanish) then (either both French and EU, or neither French nor EU).
- If North Korean: then Mei cannot be French (due to EU vs not EU), so she must be PRC; thus French is false and EU is false. Consequent “neither French nor EU” holds.
- If Spanish: she cannot be PRC (since PRC ⇒ not EU and Spanish ⇒ EU), so she must be French; thus French is true and EU is true. Consequent “both French and EU” holds.
In all consistent cases where the antecedent holds, the consequent holds. Therefore the implication is true.
Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: True
