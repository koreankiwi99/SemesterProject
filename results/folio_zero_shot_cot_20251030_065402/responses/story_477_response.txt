All social media applications that allow users to send messages to each other have chat features. 
All social media applications have chat features or video features. 
All social media applications that have video features allow users to upload videos. 
All software that is social media applications are computer programs.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Question 1 reasoning:
- We know TikTok is a social media application.
- Every social media application has chat or video features. If it has chat, then it is software, and since it’s both software and a social media application, it is a computer program. If it only has video, nothing given implies it’s software or a computer program.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude it is a computer program.

Question 2 reasoning:
- The statement is: ideal for preteens or a computer program.
- TikTok is not ideal for preteens, so the statement reduces to “TikTok is a computer program,” which is not established.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude the disjunction is true.

Question 3 reasoning:
- The statement is: not chat or not a computer program.
- If TikTok has chat, then it is software and thus a computer program; in that case both disjuncts are false, making the statement false. If it lacks chat or isn’t a computer program, the statement would be true.
- Since we can’t determine which case holds, the truth is undetermined.

Question 4 reasoning:
- The statement is: chat or computer program.
- From the premises, TikTok could have only video and not be a computer program (nothing implies video-only apps are software). In that scenario, both disjuncts are false.
- It could also have chat, making the statement true. Hence, undetermined.
