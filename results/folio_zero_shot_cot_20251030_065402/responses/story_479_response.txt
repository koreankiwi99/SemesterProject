Story ID: 479
Premises: Grass is not food
All meadows are grass.
All edible things are food. 
All fruits are edible.
All lemons are fruit.
Grapes are not both edible and lemons.
Bananas are grasses or fruits. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: Fruit -> Edible -> Food. Lemon -> Fruit -> Food. Grass -> not Food. Meadow -> Grass -> not Food. Hence nothing can be both Fruit and Grass (would imply Food and not Food).
- From “Grapes are not both edible and lemons” and Lemon -> Fruit -> Edible, if Grapes were Lemon they would be Edible, contradicting the premise. So Grapes are not Lemons. But whether Grapes are Edible (and thus Food) remains undetermined.

Question 1:
- Could Grapes be Food? Yes, if they are Edible (not excluded, since they are not Lemons). Could they be not Food? Also possible. Therefore Unknown.

Question 2:
- Whether Grapes are not Food is likewise undetermined. Unknown.

Question 3:
- If Bananas were both Lemons and Meadows, they would be both Fruit and Grass, which is impossible. Therefore False.

Question 4:
- As above, nothing can be both a Lemon (Fruit) and a Meadow (Grass). Therefore True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: False
4: True
