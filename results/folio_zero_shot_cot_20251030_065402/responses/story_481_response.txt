Story ID: 481
Premises: All biodegradable things are environment-friendly. 
All woodware is biodegradable.
All paper is woodware. 
Nothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.
All environment-friendly things are good.
A worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: Paper ⊆ Woodware ⊆ Biodegradable ⊆ Environment-friendly ⊆ Good.
- Also: Nothing is both Good and Bad, so Good implies not Bad.
- “A worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.” Since Paper implies Environment-friendly, in either case the worksheet is Environment-friendly, hence Good, hence not Bad.
- However, Environment-friendly does not imply Biodegradable (only the converse is given), so we cannot conclude the worksheet is biodegradable unless it is paper, which is not guaranteed by the disjunction.

Question 1: If the worksheet is paper, it’s biodegradable; if it is merely environment-friendly, we don’t know. Therefore Unknown.

Question 2: There is a possible case (if it is paper) where it is biodegradable, so we cannot assert it’s not biodegradable. Therefore Unknown.

Question 3: The worksheet is Environment-friendly → Good, and nothing is both Good and Bad; hence it is not Bad. Therefore the statement “worksheet is bad” is False.

Question 4: As above, the worksheet is Good, so it is not Bad. Therefore True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: False
4: True
