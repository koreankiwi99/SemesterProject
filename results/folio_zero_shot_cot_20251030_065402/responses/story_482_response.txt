Story ID: 482
Premises: If someone in Potterville yells, then they are not cool.
If someone in Potterville is angry, then they yell.
If someone in Potterville flies, then they are cool.
Every person in Potterville that knows magic flies.
All wizards in Potterville know magic.
Harry, who lives in Potterville either yells or flies. 
Potter, who lives in Potterville, is a wizard and flies.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- We know: If flies then cool; if yells then not cool; and Harry either yells or flies.
- From the disjunction, either outcome is possible, leading to cool or not cool respectively.
- We cannot determine which disjunct holds. So whether Harry is cool is uncertain.

Question 2:
- Similar to Q1: if he yells, he’s not cool; if he flies, he’s cool.
- We can’t determine which holds. So whether Harry is not cool is uncertain.

Question 3:
- “Harry is a wizard or angry.”
- We have no information that Harry is a wizard. Angry would imply yelling, but we only know he yells or flies; yelling does not imply angry.
- So we cannot conclude wizard or angry; nor can we refute it. Uncertain.

Question 4:
- “Harry is neither a wizard nor angry” means not wizard and not angry.
- We cannot prove either negation from the premises.
- It’s consistent that he could be neither (e.g., a non-wizard who flies), but not entailed. Uncertain.
