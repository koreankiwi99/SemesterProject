Story ID: 484
Premises: No songs are visuals. 
All folk songs are songs.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the hierarchy: sci-fi movie -> movie -> video -> visual. So Inception is a video and thus a visual.
- No songs are visuals, so anything that is a visual is not a song (contradiction if it were).
- All folk songs are songs, so if something is not a song, it cannot be a folk song.
- Mac is only specified as not a folk song and not a sci-fi movie; nothing implies Mac is a video.

Question 1: If Inception were a folk song, it would be a song, but Inception is a visual; no songs are visuals. Contradiction. So false.
Question 2: Therefore, Inception is not a folk song. True.
Question 3: Inception is a video, so the disjunction “video or folk song” is true. True.
Question 4: We have no information implying Mac is a video. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
4: Unknown
