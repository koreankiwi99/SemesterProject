All small things in Size Town are light.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- In Size Town: big -> heavy -> still. Small -> light -> unstable -> changing and unpredictable.
- Bird: not (heavy and still). Since heavy implies still, if it were heavy it would be both; thus the bird is not heavy.
- From "everything is big or small" and not heavy, and big -> heavy, the bird is not big; hence it must be small.
- Therefore the bird is light, unstable, changing, and unpredictable.
- Nothing given links unstable/changing with stillness, so stillness remains undetermined.

Question 1: Is the bird still?
- Not derivable. Unknown.

Question 2: Is the bird not still?
- Not derivable. Unknown.

Question 3: Is the bird unpredictable and changing?
- Yes, from unstable. True.

Question 4: Is the bird unpredictable or changing?
- Yes (it is both). True.

Question 5: Is the bird either unpredictable or changing?
- Interpreting “either … or” inclusively, yes (it is both). True.

Question 6: If the bird is small or still, then it is either unpredictable or changing.
- The bird is small, hence unpredictable and changing; implication holds. True.
