Story ID: 59
Premises: Some monitors equipped in the lab are produced by the company named AOC. 
All monitors equipped in the lab are cheaper than their original prices. 
If a monitor is cheaper than its original price, then its resolution is 1080p. 
If a monitor has a resolution of 1080p, then it does not support the type-c port. 
LG34 is equipped in the lab.  

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) We only know that some monitors in the lab are AOC, not all. Also, it is not stated that LG34 is a monitor. So we cannot conclude LG34 is produced by AOC. Answer: Unknown.

2) From the rules: monitor in lab → cheaper → 1080p → no type-c. But we are never told LG34 is a monitor, only that it is equipped in the lab. Therefore we cannot apply the chain. Answer: Unknown.

3) If LG34 were a monitor, we would derive it has 1080p. But we don’t know it is a monitor, and we have no information that it is not 1080p. So the claim that LG34 is not 1080p cannot be established. Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
