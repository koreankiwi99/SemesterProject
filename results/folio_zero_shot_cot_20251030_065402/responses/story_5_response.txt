==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- If Thor is happy, then the Hulk is angry (given).
- If the Hulk is angry, he wakes up (given).
- Therefore, if Thor is happy, the Hulk wakes up.
- By contrapositive, if the Hulk does not wake up, then Thor is not happy.
- Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- If Thor is happy, then the Hulk is angry, so he wakes up and will break a bridge.
- The Hulk is a destroyer; thus a destroyer is breaking a bridge.
- If a destroyer is breaking a bridge, Peter Parker is not a civilian.
- Peter Parker is either a superhero or a civilian; with not a civilian, he must be a superhero.
- If Peter Parker is a superhero, he wears a uniform.
- Therefore, if Thor is happy, Peter Parker wears a uniform.
- Conclusion: True.

Question 3:
- If Thor is not happy, the premises do not rule out that the Hulk might still be angry, wake up, and break a bridge for other reasons.
- Also, “Thor will break a bridge when he is happy” is one-way; it does not say he or others cannot break a bridge when he is not happy.
- Thus, we cannot conclude that no bridge will be broken.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
