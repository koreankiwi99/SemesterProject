Story ID: 60
Premises: All buildings in New Haven are not high.
All buildings managed by Yale Housing are located in New Haven. 
All buildings in Manhattans are high. 
All buildings owned by Bloomberg are located in Manhattans. 
All buildings with the Bloomberg logo are owned by Bloomberg. 
Tower A is managed by Yale Housing.
Tower B is with the Bloomberg logo.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Tower A is managed by Yale Housing -> Tower A is in New Haven.
- All buildings in New Haven are not high -> Tower A is not high.
- The premises never state that "not high" means "low." Without that equivalence, we cannot conclude A is low.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Tower B has the Bloomberg logo -> owned by Bloomberg -> located in Manhattans.
- Therefore "Tower B is not located in Manhattans" contradicts the derived fact.
- Conclusion: False.

Question 3:
- From above, Tower B is in Manhattans -> all buildings in Manhattans are high -> Tower B is high.
- From "All buildings in New Haven are not high," the contrapositive implies: if a building is high, then it is not in New Haven.
- Therefore Tower B is not in New Haven; the statement that it is in New Haven is false.
- Conclusion: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: False
