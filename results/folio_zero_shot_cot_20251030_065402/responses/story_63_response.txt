==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- Premises:
  - If a student attends in person, then they have registered.
  - Students attend either in person or remotely.
  - No students from China attend remotely.
  - James attends and does not attend remotely.
  - Jack attends and is a student from China.

Question 1:
- We know James attends and not remotely.
- We are not told James is a student, so the “either in person or remotely” dichotomy is only guaranteed for students.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude whether James attends in person or not; the claim “not in person” is not entailed nor contradicted by the given info.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Jack is a student from China and attends.
- Students from China do not attend remotely; thus Jack is not remote.
- For students, attendance is either in person or remote; thus Jack must be in person.
- Conclusion: True.

Question 3:
- All students who attend in person have registered.
- Jack is a student and (from Q2) attends in person, so he has registered.
- Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: True
