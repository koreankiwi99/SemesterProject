==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

1. The text states: "One of the tutors of Hippocrates was Herodicus," which means Herodicus tutored Hippocrates. So this is true.

2. The text does not state that Hippocrates tutored Herodicus; it only states the reverse. There is no information confirming this, so it is unknown.

3. Herodicus was born in Selymbria, which is stated to be a colony of the city-state Megara. Being born in the colony, not the city-state itself, makes the claim false.

4. The text explicitly says "Massages were recommended by Herodicus," so the negation is false.

5. Since Selymbria is a colony of a city-state and Herodicus was born there, this is true.
