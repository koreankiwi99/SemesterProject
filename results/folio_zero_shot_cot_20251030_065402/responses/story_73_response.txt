Story ID: 73
Premises: Ambiortus is a prehistoric bird genus.
Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus.
Mongolia was where Ambiortus Dementjevi lived.
Yevgeny Kurochkin was the discoverer of Ambiortus.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) Ambiortus is a bird genus, and Yevgeny Kurochkin is stated to be its discoverer. Discovering a genus implies discovering a new genus to science. So the statement is supported.
2) The only known species (A. dementjevi) lived in Mongolia. The text does not rule out the existence of unknown species elsewhere. Thus we cannot conclude there exists a species that doesn’t live in Mongolia, nor that there isn’t; the claim is not established.
3) The text only states Kurochkin discovered Ambiortus; it says nothing about where he lived. So we cannot infer he lived in Mongolia.
4) Since only the known species is specified and it lived in Mongolia, we cannot conclude that all species (including any unknown ones) live in Mongolia. The universal claim isn’t supported.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
4: Unknown
