Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Given: Eight equals seven plus one.
- Rule: If a real number equals another real number plus one, the first is larger.
- Therefore: Eight is larger than seven. True.

Question 2:
- Given: Two is positive.
- Rule: If a number is positive, the double of it is also positive.
- From two positive → double of two is positive; given Four is the double of two → Four is positive.
- From four positive → double of four is positive; given Eight is the double of four → Eight is positive. True.

Question 3:
- Given: Seven equals six plus one → by the rule, Seven is larger than Six.
- Rule: If x is larger than y, then y is not larger than x.
- Therefore: Six is not larger than Seven, so the statement “Six is larger than seven” is false.
