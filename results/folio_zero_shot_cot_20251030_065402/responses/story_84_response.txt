People died in the December 1999 earthquake in Luzon.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1. The context only states that Luzon is an island in the Philippines; it says nothing about Leyte. So we cannot conclude this from the given information.
2. The context states that people died in the December 1999 earthquake in Luzon. Since Luzon is in the Philippines, this directly contradicts the claim that no one has ever died in an earthquake that struck the Philippines.
3. The context states that in December 1999 an earthquake struck Luzon, which is in the Philippines. Therefore, there was at least one earthquake in the Philippines in 1999.
