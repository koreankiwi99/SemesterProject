1. The showrunner of Witches of East End is Maggie Friedman. She developed Eastwick, which is an ABC series. Therefore, there exists an ABC series developed by the showrunner of Witches of East End.
2. Since there exists at least one ABC series (Eastwick) developed by the showrunner of Witches of East End, the statement that no ABC series was developed by her is false.
