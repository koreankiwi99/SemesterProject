-- We work in classical first-order logic over a type of persons.
universe u
axiom Person : Type u

-- Predicates
axiom Employee : Person → Prop
axiom SchedulesWithCustomers : Person → Prop
axiom GoesToCompanyBuildingToday : Person → Prop
axiom LunchInCompanyBuilding : Person → Prop
axiom LunchAtHome : Person → Prop
axiom RemoteFromHome : Person → Prop
axiom InOtherCountries : Person → Prop
axiom Manager : Person → Prop
axiom AppearsInCompanyToday : Person → Prop

-- A distinguished individual
axiom James : Person

-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom A1 : ∀ x, Employee x ∧ SchedulesWithCustomers x → GoesToCompanyBuildingToday x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, LunchInCompanyBuilding x → SchedulesWithCustomers x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, Employee x → (LunchInCompanyBuilding x ∨ LunchAtHome x)
-- Optional exclusivity (not logically forced by the English, included if one reads "either ... or" exclusively)
axiom A3_exclusive : ∀ x, Employee x → ¬ (LunchInCompanyBuilding x ∧ LunchAtHome x)
axiom A4 : ∀ x, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → RemoteFromHome x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → RemoteFromHome x
axiom A6 : ∀ x, Manager x → ¬ RemoteFromHome x
axiom A7 : AppearsInCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- The three queried statements as Lean propositions
def Q1 : Prop := LunchInCompanyBuilding James
def Q2 : Prop := ¬ LunchInCompanyBuilding James
def Q3 : Prop :=
  ((Manager James ∨ InOtherCountries James) → ¬ (LunchAtHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James)) ∧
  ((LunchAtHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James) → (¬ Manager James ∧ ¬ InOtherCountries James))

-- Some consequences we can derive (for reference)
lemma remote_implies_not_manager {x : Person} (hR : RemoteFromHome x) : ¬ Manager x :=
by
  intro hM
  have : ¬ RemoteFromHome x := A6 x hM
  exact this hR

-- We cannot derive Q1, nor its negation, from the given axioms without
-- additional assumptions about James (e.g., that James is an employee).
-- Likewise, we cannot derive Q3 or its negation from the given axioms.
