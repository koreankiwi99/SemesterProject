-- Facts from the text
axiom hWinner : Winner steinhauer
axiom hSteinPart : Participated steinhauer
axiom hDescampeBelg : FromBelgium descampe
axiom hDescampeOnLb : OnLeaderboard descampe

axiom hLeaderboardParticipated : ∀ p, OnLeaderboard p → Participated p

-- Q1: “Steinhauer was not the winner”
def Q1_stmt : Prop := ¬ Winner steinhauer

-- We can prove the negation of Q1_stmt from hWinner
theorem Q1_neg : ¬ Q1_stmt := by
  intro h
  exact h hWinner

-- Q2: “Descampe is in the six-way tie”
def Q2_stmt : Prop := InSixWayTie descampe
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive Q2_stmt nor its negation.


Answers:

- Question 1: The text states explicitly that the winner was Steinhauer, so “Steinhauer was not the winner” is false. False

- Question 2: We only know there exists at least one Belgian in the six-way tie and that Descampe is Belgian and on the leaderboard; nothing entails that Descampe is the Belgian in the tie, nor that he isn’t. Unknown
