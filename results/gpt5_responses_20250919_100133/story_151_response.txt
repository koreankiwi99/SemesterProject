-- Transitivity of "located in"
axiom locatedIn_trans {A B C : Place} : LocatedIn A B → LocatedIn B C → LocatedIn A C

-- A derivable consequence

-- The three questions as propositions
def Q1 : Prop := ∀ x : Place, Island x ∧ LocatedIn x Antarctica → NamedAfter BarutinCove x

def Q2 : Prop := ∃ x : Place, Cove x ∧ LocatedIn x Antarctica ∧ (∃ y : Place, InBulgaria y ∧ NamedAfter x y)

def Q3 : Prop := ¬ LocatedIn BarutinCove Antarctica

-- Attempt status:
-- From these axioms, we cannot derive Q1, nor its negation; we also cannot derive Q2 or its negation,
-- and we cannot derive Q3 or its negation. The data allow us to place Barutin Cove in the South Shetland
-- Islands but give no link from South Shetland Islands to Antarctica (only the reverse), so nothing about
-- “in Antarctica” can be concluded.
-- Therefore all three questions are Unknown from the given information.
