==================================================
Lean formalization and proofs:

constant Person : Type
constant Airport : Type

constant Susan John : Person
constant LGA : Airport

constant dep : Person → Airport
constant arr : Person → Airport

-- Axiom: departure and arrival cannot be the same airport
axiom dep_ne_arr : ∀ p : Person, dep p ≠ arr p

-- Facts from the context
axiom susan_to_LGA : arr Susan = LGA
axiom john_from_LGA : dep John = LGA

-- Question 1 target: dep Susan = LGA (we prove its negation)
theorem Q1_false : dep Susan ≠ LGA := by
  intro hdep
  have hda : dep Susan = arr Susan := by
    calc
      dep Susan = LGA := hdep
      _ = arr Susan := susan_to_LGA.symm
  exact (dep_ne_arr Susan) hda

-- Question 2 target: arr John = LGA (we prove its negation)
theorem Q2_false : arr John ≠ LGA := by
  intro harr
  have hda : dep John = arr John := by
    calc
      dep John = LGA := john_from_LGA
      _ = arr John := harr
  exact (dep_ne_arr John) hda

Answers:
- Question 1: Susan flies from LGA airport. False
