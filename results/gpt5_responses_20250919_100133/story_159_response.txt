-- All students who want a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.
axiom rule : ∀ p, Student p → WantsLongVacation p → fav p = Summer

-- Emma's favorite season is summer.
axiom emma_fav : fav Emma = Summer

-- Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.
axiom mia_diff_emma : fav Mia ≠ fav Emma

-- James wants to have a long vacation.
axiom james_wants : WantsLongVacation James

-- Useful consequence: Mia does not have Summer as her favorite season.
lemma mia_not_summer : fav Mia ≠ Summer := by
  intro h
  have : fav Mia = fav Emma := Eq.trans h emma_fav.symm

-- What we can prove about James: if he is a student, then his favorite is Summer.
lemma james_summer_if_student : Student James → fav James = Summer := by
  intro hstu
  exact rule James hstu james_wants

-- We cannot prove fav James = Summer outright (Student James is not given).
-- We also cannot prove its negation from the given axioms.

-- We also cannot prove fav Mia = Spring; we only know fav Mia ≠ Summer.


Answers:

Question 1: From the rule we need James to be a student to conclude his favorite season is summer, but we are not given that. Therefore the statement cannot be determined from the information. Unknown

Question 2: We only know Mia’s favorite season is not Summer; it could be Spring, Fall, or Winter. Therefore the statement cannot be determined from the information. Unknown
