namespace Reasoning

universe u

constant Show : Type u
constant ST : Show
constant BM : Show

constant N : Show → Prop      -- is a Netflix show
constant P : Show → Prop      -- is popular
constant B : Show → Prop      -- Karen binge-watches it
constant D : Show → Prop      -- Karen downloads it
constant S : Show → Prop      -- Karen shares it with Lisa

-- Given facts and rules:
axiom ax1 : N ST
axiom ax2 : P ST
axiom ax3 : ∀ x : Show, N x ∧ P x → B x
axiom ax4 : ∀ x : Show, N x → (D x ↔ B x)
axiom ax5 : ¬ D BM
axiom ax6 : N BM
axiom ax7 : ∀ x : Show, N x → (B x → S x)

-- Q1: Karen will share "Stranger Things" with Lisa.
theorem Q1 : S ST := by
  have hB : B ST := ax3 ST ⟨ax1, ax2⟩
  exact ax7 ST ax1 hB

-- Q2: "Black Mirror" is popular. We can prove its negation.
theorem not_pop_BM : ¬ P BM := by
  intro hP
  have hB : B BM := ax3 BM ⟨ax6, hP⟩
  have hD : D BM := (Iff.mpr (ax4 BM ax6)) hB
  exact ax5 hD

-- Derived helper: Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror".
theorem not_binge_BM : ¬ B BM := by
  intro hB
  have hD : D BM := (Iff.mpr (ax4 BM ax6)) hB
  exact ax5 hD

-- From the given axioms we cannot derive S BM nor its negation.

end Reasoning

Answers:
1) Yes. From popularity and being a Netflix show, Karen binge-watches "Stranger Things"; then she shares any Netflix show she binge-watches with Lisa. True
2) No. If "Black Mirror" were popular then, since it’s a Netflix show, Karen would binge-watch and thus download it, contradicting that she does not download it. False
3) Uncertain. We only know Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror"; sharing is only implied by binge-watching, so we cannot conclude whether she shares it. Unknown
