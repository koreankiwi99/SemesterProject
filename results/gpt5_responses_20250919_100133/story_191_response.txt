Premises: A natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.
If the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.
Machine translation is a natural language processing task.
The output of machine translation is a text sequence.

Lean formalization and proof attempt

I model tasks, predicates, and the given premises explicitly, prove Q1, and show Q2 is not entailed by giving two concrete models (one where it’s true and one where it’s false).

Lean code:

namespace NLPTasks

universe u

-- A world of discourse with the relevant predicates and axioms
structure World where
  Task : Type u
  NLP LGen LUnd OutputText : Task → Prop
  MachineTranslation : Task
  -- Premises from the problem:
  ax1 : ∀ t, NLP t → (LGen t ∨ LUnd t)
  ax2 : ∀ t, OutputText t → LGen t
  ax3 : NLP MachineTranslation
  ax4 : OutputText MachineTranslation

-- Q1: From ax2 and ax4, MachineTranslation is a language generation task.
theorem Q1 (w : World) : w.LGen w.MachineTranslation :=
  w.ax2 _ w.ax4

-- Independence of Q2 (not determined by the premises):

-- Model where MachineTranslation is NOT a language understanding task
def worldGenOnly : World where
  Task := Unit
  NLP := fun _ => True
  LGen := fun _ => True
  LUnd := fun _ => False
  OutputText := fun _ => True
  MachineTranslation := ()
  ax1 := by intro _ _; exact Or.inl trivial
  ax2 := by intro _ _; exact trivial
  ax3 := trivial
  ax4 := trivial

lemma worldGenOnly_not_understanding :
  ¬ worldGenOnly.LUnd worldGenOnly.MachineTranslation := by
  intro h; exact h

-- Model where MachineTranslation IS a language understanding task
def worldBoth : World where
  Task := Unit
  NLP := fun _ => True
  LGen := fun _ => True
  LUnd := fun _ => True
  OutputText := fun _ => True
  MachineTranslation := ()
  ax1 := by intro _ _; exact Or.inl trivial
  ax2 := by intro _ _; exact trivial
  ax3 := trivial
  ax4 := trivial

lemma worldBoth_understanding :
  worldBoth.LUnd worldBoth.MachineTranslation := trivial

end NLPTasks

Reasoning summary

- From “If the output is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task” and “The output of machine translation is a text sequence,” we can directly conclude that machine translation is a language generation task. This is proved as Q1 in Lean.
- The premise “an NLP task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task” is taken as an inclusive or (no exclusivity is stated). Hence, even knowing that machine translation is a generation task does not rule out it also being an understanding task. The two constructed models show that the premises are consistent both with “machine translation is a language understanding task” and with its negation, so Q2 is not determined by the given information.
