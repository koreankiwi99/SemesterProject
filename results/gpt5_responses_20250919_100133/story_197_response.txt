-- "It costs $205 ... which is cheaper than $300."
axiom h_cost_eq : costGRE = 205
axiom h_cost_lt300 : costGRE < 300

-- "ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship."
axiom rule_aid : ∀ x, Applicant x ∧ ProveHardship x → ProvidesAid ETS x

-- "Those living in single-parent families or having few resources ... can prove economic hardship."

-- Q2: It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test.

-- From the given assumptions, we cannot derive Q3_stmt, nor can we derive its negation,
-- because we have no link between TakingGRE and Applicant.


Answers:
- Question 1: Yes. Tom is a GRE applicant and proves economic hardship (single-parent family), so by the policy ETS provides him financial aid. True
- Question 2: Yes. The cost is $205, which is below $300. True
- Question 3: Uncertain. We know applicants with hardship can receive aid (e.g., Tom), but we are not told that anyone who is taking the GRE is receiving aid, nor that Tom is actually taking (as opposed to applying). Unknown
