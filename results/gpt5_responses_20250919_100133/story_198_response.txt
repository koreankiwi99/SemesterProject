Lean formalization and attempt at proofs (Lean 4):

universe u

constant Being : Type u

-- Predicates on beings
constant Animal : Being → Prop
constant Mammal : Being → Prop
constant Human : Being → Prop
constant Person : Being → Prop

constant MPV_occurs : Being → Prop          -- Monkeypox virus occurs (actually occurs)
constant MPV_can_occur : Being → Prop       -- Monkeypox virus can occur (possibility)
constant MayGetMonkeypox : Being → Prop
constant GetsFlu : Being → Prop
constant FeelsTired : Being → Prop

-- Symptoms universe
inductive SymptomName where

deriving DecidableEq

constant SymptomOfMonkeypox : SymptomName → Prop

-- Axioms extracted from the text
axiom humans_are_mammals : ∀ x, Human x → Mammal x
axiom mammals_are_animals : ∀ x, Mammal x → Animal x

-- “When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox.”
axiom virus_occurs_implies_may_get : ∀ x, MPV_occurs x → MayGetMonkeypox x

-- “Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals.”
axiom mpv_can_occur_in_certain_animals : ∃ x, Animal x ∧ MPV_can_occur x

-- “Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.”
axiom symptom_fever        : SymptomOfMonkeypox SymptomName.fever
axiom symptom_headache     : SymptomOfMonkeypox SymptomName.headache
axiom symptom_muscle_pains : SymptomOfMonkeypox SymptomName.muscle_pains
axiom symptom_tiredness    : SymptomOfMonkeypox SymptomName.tiredness

-- “People feel tired when they get the flu.”
axiom flu_implies_tired_for_people : ∀ x, Person x → GetsFlu x → FeelsTired x

-- Optional bridge: people are humans (not strictly needed for these questions)
axiom people_are_humans : ∀ x, Person x → Human x

-- Question 1 target: “There is an animal.”
-- We formalize it as ∃ x, Animal x.
theorem Q1 : ∃ x, Animal x := by
  rcases mpv_can_occur_in_certain_animals with ⟨a, ha⟩
  exact ⟨a, ha.left⟩

-- Question 2 target: “No one gets the flu.”
-- We formalize it as ¬ ∃ x : Being, GetsFlu x.
def Q2 : Prop := ¬ ∃ x : Being, GetsFlu x

-- With the given axioms, neither Q2 nor its negation is provable.

-- Question 3 target: “Symptoms of Monkeypox include coughing.”
-- We formalize it as SymptomOfMonkeypox SymptomName.coughing.
def Q3 : Prop := SymptomOfMonkeypox SymptomName.coughing

-- With the given axioms, neither Q3 nor its negation is provable.



Answers:
1) Yes. From “Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals” we get existence of at least one animal. True
2) Cannot be determined from the premises; no information rules out flu cases. Unknown
3) Cannot be determined; the listed symptoms are not stated to be exhaustive. Unknown
