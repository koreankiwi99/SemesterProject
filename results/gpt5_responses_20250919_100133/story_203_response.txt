  have hs : Sucks duster := h duster duster_is_household
  exact duster_doesnt_suck hs


Answers:
1) From space_is_vacuum and vacuums_suck, we derive Sucks space. True
2) There is no information linking being a vacuum to being a vampire (nor its negation), so the status of Vampire space is undetermined. Unknown
3) The duster is a household appliance that does not suck, so the universal claim is false. False
