  -- A Japanese game company created The Legend of Zelda.

  -- All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
  (h2 : ∀ g : Game, OnTop10 g → MadeByJapaneseCompany g)
  -- If a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be included in the Top 10 list.
  (h3 : ∀ g : Game, SoldOver1M g → OnTop10 g)
  -- The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.
  (h4 : SoldOver1M Zelda)

-- From h3 and h4, The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.
theorem Zelda_on_top10 : OnTop10 Zelda := h3 Zelda h4

-- Sanity check: either premise gives LoZ made by a Japanese company.
theorem Zelda_made_by_JP_from_top10 : MadeByJapaneseCompany Zelda := h2 Zelda Zelda_on_top10
theorem Zelda_made_by_JP_from_fact  : MadeByJapaneseCompany Zelda := h1

-- If FIFA22 is on the Top 10 list, then it is made by a Japanese company.

Answers:
- Question 1: Yes. From SoldOver1M(LoZ) and the rule that any game selling over one million is on the Top 10 list, LoZ is on the Top 10 list. True
- Question 2: We have no information about FIFA 22 being on the Top 10 list or selling over one million in the given context, so we cannot conclude it was made by a Japanese company. Unknown
- Question 3: No. Since LoZ is on the Top 10 list (from Q1), the statement that it is not on the Top 10 list is false. False

True
