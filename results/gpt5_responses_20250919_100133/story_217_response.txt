Predicates
- L: George likes music
- W: George wants to compose
- A: George has access to a program
- C: George can compose
- P: George will compose

Premises
- h1: L → W
- h2: A → C
- h3: C ∧ W → P

Lean formalization and proofs

namespace George

-- Q1: From the premises, (L ∧ A) → P is derivable.
theorem Q1_valid :
  ∀ {L A W C P : Prop}, (L → W) → (A → C) → (C ∧ W → P) → (L ∧ A → P) := by
  intro L A W C P hLW hAC hCWP hLA
  rcases hLA with ⟨hL, hA⟩
  have hW : W := hLW hL
  have hC : C := hAC hA
  exact hCWP ⟨hC, hW⟩

-- Q2: The entailment (¬P → ¬C) does not follow from the premises (countermodel).
theorem Q2_not_valid :
  ¬ (∀ (L A W C P : Prop), (L → W) → (A → C) → (C ∧ W → P) → (¬P → ¬C)) := by
  intro h
  -- instantiate with L=False, A=True, W=False, C=True, P=False
  have hinst := h False True False True False
  have h1 : False → False := by intro f; exact f
  have h2 : True → True := by intro _; exact True.intro
  have h3 : (True ∧ False) → False := by
    intro hcf
    exact hcf.2
  have concl := hinst h1 h2 h3
  have hnP : ¬False := by intro p; exact p
  have hnC : ¬True := concl hnP
  exact hnC True.intro

end George

Answers
- Question 1: From L ∧ A, we get W by h1 and C by h2, hence C ∧ W, so P by h3. True
- Question 2: From ¬P we only get ¬(C ∧ W), which does not imply ¬C. The Lean countermodel above shows the entailment is invalid. Unknown
