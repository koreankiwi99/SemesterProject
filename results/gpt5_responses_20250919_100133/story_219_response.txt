Lean formalization and attempted proofs:

-- We model entities and predicates
universe u
constant Entity : Type u

-- Constants for specific entities
constant Beethoven : Entity
constant Symphony9 : Entity
constant ViennaMusicSociety : Entity

-- Predicates/relations
constant MusicPiece  : Entity → Prop
constant Composer    : Entity → Prop
constant Wrote       : Entity → Entity → Prop
constant Premiered   : Entity → Entity → Prop
constant Orchestra   : Entity → Prop
constant Leads       : Entity → Entity → Prop
constant Conductor   : Entity → Prop

-- Facts from the context
axiom Symphony9_is_music      : MusicPiece Symphony9
axiom composers_write_some    : ∀ x, Composer x → ∃ y, MusicPiece y ∧ Wrote x y
axiom Beethoven_wrote_S9      : Wrote Beethoven Symphony9
axiom VMS_premiered_S9        : Premiered ViennaMusicSociety Symphony9
axiom VMS_is_orchestra        : Orchestra ViennaMusicSociety
axiom Beethoven_leads_VMS     : Leads Beethoven ViennaMusicSociety
axiom leaders_of_orchestras_are_conductors :
  ∀ p o, Orchestra o → Leads p o → Conductor p

-- The three statements (as Props)
def Q1_stmt : Prop := Composer Beethoven
def Q2_stmt : Prop := ∃ o p, Orchestra o ∧ MusicPiece p ∧ Premiered o p
def Q3_stmt : Prop := ¬ Conductor Beethoven

-- Q2 can be proved directly using the given witnesses
theorem Q2_proved : Q2_stmt := by
  refine Exists.intro ViennaMusicSociety ?_
  refine Exists.intro Symphony9 ?_
  exact And.intro VMS_is_orchestra (And.intro Symphony9_is_music VMS_premiered_S9)

-- From “Orchestras are led by conductors” and “Beethoven leads VMS (an orchestra)”,
-- we can derive that Beethoven is a conductor.
theorem Beethoven_is_conductor : Conductor Beethoven := by
  exact leaders_of_orchestras_are_conductors Beethoven ViennaMusicSociety
    VMS_is_orchestra Beethoven_leads_VMS

-- Therefore, the negation of Q3 (which asserts Beethoven is not a conductor) is provable.
theorem not_Q3 : ¬ Q3_stmt := by
  intro h
  exact h Beethoven_is_conductor

-- We cannot derive Q1_stmt or its negation from the given axioms.

Answers:
- Q1: From “Composers write music pieces” and “Beethoven wrote Symphony No. 9,” we cannot infer that only composers write music. So we cannot conclude Beethoven is a composer. Unknown
- Q2: Vienna Music Society is an orchestra and it premiered Symphony No. 9, a music piece; hence some orchestras premiered music pieces. True
- Q3: Since Beethoven leads an orchestra and orchestras are led by conductors, Beethoven is a conductor. Therefore, “Beethoven is not a conductor” is false. False
