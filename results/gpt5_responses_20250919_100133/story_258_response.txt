Lean translation and attempt:

We model a universe U with predicates Human, Greek, Mortal : U → Prop. The premises are:
- h₁: ∀ x, Human x → Mortal x
- h₂: ∀ x, Greek x → Human x

Goal: ∃ x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x.

Lean code:

section

variable (U : Type) (Human Greek Mortal : U → Prop)
variable (h₁ : ∀ x, Human x → Mortal x)
variable (h₂ : ∀ x, Greek x → Human x)

-- From the premises we can derive that all Greeks are mortal
theorem all_greeks_mortal : ∀ x, Greek x → Mortal x := by
  intro x gx
  exact h₁ x (h₂ x gx)

-- If we also assume that some Greek exists, then some Greek is mortal
theorem some_greek_mortal_of_exists (hx : ∃ x, Greek x) : ∃ x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x := by
  cases hx with
  | intro x gx =>
    refine ⟨x, ?_⟩
    exact And.intro gx (all_greeks_mortal U Human Greek Mortal h₁ h₂ x gx)

-- Countermodel showing the existential does not follow from the premises alone
example :
  ∃ (U : Type) (Human Greek Mortal : U → Prop),
    (∀ x, Human x → Mortal x) ∧
    (∀ x, Greek x → Human x) ∧
    ¬ ∃ x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x := by
  refine ⟨Unit, (λ _ => True), (λ _ => False), (λ _ => True), ?_, ?_, ?_⟩
  · intro x hx; trivial
  · intro x gx; trivial
  · intro h
    cases h with
    | intro x hx =>
      cases hx.left

end

Conclusion:
From the given premises we can prove “All Greeks are mortal,” and we can prove “Some Greeks are mortal” only if we additionally assume that some Greek exists. Since existence of a Greek is not given, neither the statement nor its negation is derivable from the premises alone.
