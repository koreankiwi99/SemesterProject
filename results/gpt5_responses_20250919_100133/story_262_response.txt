Premises: All fir trees are evergreens.
Some objects of worship are fir trees.

GPT-5 Full Response:
==================================================
Natural-language reasoning:
- Premises:
  1) All fir trees are evergreens. (∀x, Fir(x) → Evergreen(x))
  2) Some objects of worship are fir trees. (∃x, Worship(x) ∧ Fir(x))
- Claim: Some evergreens are not objects of worship. (∃x, Evergreen(x) ∧ ¬Worship(x))

From the premises we only know there exists a fir that is worshiped, hence there exists an evergreen that is worshiped. We have no information guaranteeing the existence of any evergreen that is not worshiped. It is consistent that all evergreens are worshiped, and also consistent that some are not. Therefore the truth of the claim is not determined by the premises.

Lean formalization and attempt:

universe u

section

variable (U : Type u) (Fir Evergreen Worship : U → Prop)
variable (h1 : ∀ x, Fir x → Evergreen x)
variable (h2 : ∃ x, Worship x ∧ Fir x)

-- Target statement: “Some evergreens are not objects of worship.”
def Statement : Prop := ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ Worship x

-- There is no derivation of Statement from just h1 and h2.
-- Below we show the statement is not logically valid given only the premises
-- by providing a countermodel (a one-element universe where all three predicates are True).
end

theorem not_valid :
  ¬ (∀ (U : Type) (Fir Evergreen Worship : U → Prop),
       (∀ x, Fir x → Evergreen x) →
       (∃ x, Worship x ∧ Fir x) →
       (∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ Worship x)) :=

  let Worship : U → Prop := fun _ => True
