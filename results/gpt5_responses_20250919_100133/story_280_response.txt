Lean translation and proof attempt:

- Domain: events
- Predicates: Happy, Sad
- Assumptions:
  1) Every event is either happy or sad, but not both (exclusive or).
  2) There exists at least one happy event.
- Goal: Determine whether ∀ e, Sad e holds.

Lean code:

universe u

constant Event : Type u
constant Happy : Event → Prop
constant Sad   : Event → Prop

-- "Either ... or" taken as exclusive or
axiom either_exclusive : ∀ e : Event, (Happy e ∨ Sad e) ∧ ¬ (Happy e ∧ Sad e)
axiom exists_happy     : ∃ e : Event, Happy e

def AllEventsSad : Prop := ∀ e : Event, Sad e

-- We prove the negation of the target statement.
theorem not_AllEventsSad : ¬ AllEventsSad := by
  intro h_all_sad
  rcases exists_happy with ⟨e0, he0_happy⟩
  have he0_sad : Sad e0 := h_all_sad e0
  have h_not_both : ¬ (Happy e0 ∧ Sad e0) := (either_exclusive e0).2
  exact h_not_both ⟨he0_happy, he0_sad⟩

Conclusion: Since we can prove the negation of “All events are sad,” the statement is false.

False
