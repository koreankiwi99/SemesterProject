Informal predicates:
- Bird x: x is a bird
- Hawk x: x is a hawk
- Swims x: x swims

Premises:
1. ∀ x, Hawk x → ¬ Swims x        -- A hawk never swims
2. ∃ x, Bird x ∧ Hawk x            -- Some birds are hawks

Claim to assess: ∀ x, Bird x → Swims x  -- “All birds swim”

Lean code:
universe u

section
variable {Animal : Type u}
variable (Bird Hawk Swims : Animal → Prop)

  (hawk_never_swims : ∀ x, Hawk x → ¬ Swims x)
  (some_birds_are_hawks : ∃ x, Bird x ∧ Hawk x) :
  ¬ ∀ x, Bird x → Swims x := by
  intro hAll
  rcases some_birds_are_hawks with ⟨a, ha⟩
  rcases ha with ⟨haBird, haHawk⟩
  have hNot : ¬ Swims a := hawk_never_swims a haHawk
  have hYes : Swims a := hAll a haBird
  exact hNot hYes
end

Explanation: From the existence of a bird that is a hawk and the fact that hawks never swim, there exists a bird that does not swim. Hence “All birds swim” is false.

False
