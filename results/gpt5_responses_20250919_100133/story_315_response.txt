Premises: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. 
If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.

Lean formalization and attempted proofs:

constant Car : Type u
constants
  MultiPassenger : Car → Prop
  OneSeater : Car → Prop
  TM3 : Car → Prop
  SingleSeatElectricCar : Car → Prop
  SoloEV : Car → Prop
constant j : Car

axioms
  (A1 : ∀ x, MultiPassenger x → ¬ OneSeater x)
  (A2 : ∀ x, TM3 x → MultiPassenger x)
  (A3 : ∀ x, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x)
  (A4 : ∀ x, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x)
  (A5 : ¬ TM3 j → (¬ TM3 j ∨ SingleSeatElectricCar j))

-- Useful derived lemmas
lemma TM3_not_OneSeater : ∀ x, TM3 x → ¬ OneSeater x := by
  intro x hx
  have hmp : MultiPassenger x := A2 x hx
  exact A1 x hmp

lemma SoloEV_OneSeater : ∀ x, SoloEV x → OneSeater x := by
  intro x hx
  have hss : SingleSeatElectricCar x := A4 x hx
  exact A3 x hss

-- They cannot be both TM3 and SoloEV
lemma not_both_TM3_and_SoloEV : ¬ (TM3 j ∧ SoloEV j) := by
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨htm3, hsol⟩
  have hno : ¬ OneSeater j := TM3_not_OneSeater j htm3
  have ho : OneSeater j := SoloEV_OneSeater j hsol
  exact hno ho

-- Targets of the questions:
def Q1 := TM3 j
def Q2 := SoloEV j
def Q3 := ¬ SoloEV j

-- None of Q1, Q2, or Q3 (nor their negations) are derivable from the given axioms alone.
-- We proved only the incompatibility: ¬(TM3 j ∧ SoloEV j).


Answers:
