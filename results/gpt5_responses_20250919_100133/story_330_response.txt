universe u

constant Person : Type u

constant MakesPlans    : Person → Prop
constant Engaged       : Person → Prop
constant InvitesOthers : Person → Prop
constant WellAttended  : Person → Prop

-- Axioms from the text
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, MakesPlans x → Engaged x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, InvitesOthers x → MakesPlans x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, WellAttended x → InvitesOthers x
axiom A4 : ∃ x : Person, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InvitesFriends John ∧ MakesPlans John)
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InvitesFriends John)

-- Some derived lemmas (provable)
lemma well_attended_engaged (x : Person) : WellAttended x → Engaged x := by
  intro h
  exact A1 x (A2 x (A3 x h))

lemma john_large_implies_engaged_or_invitesfriends :
  LargerFamily John → Engaged John ∨ InvitesFriends John := by
  intro h
  cases A6 h with
  | inl hw =>
      left; exact well_attended_engaged John hw
  | inr hf =>
      right; exact hf

lemma john_large_and_wellattended_implies_not_invitesfriends :
  LargerFamily John → WellAttended John → ¬ InvitesFriends John := by
  intro hL hW
  have hE : Engaged John := well_attended_engaged John hW
  have hM : MakesPlans John := A2 John (A3 John hW)
  intro hF
  exact (A5 hE) ⟨hF, hM⟩

Attempted proofs of the four queried statements (or their negations) do not go through from these axioms; there is no way to derive any of them or their negations about John. Hence each is Undetermined.
