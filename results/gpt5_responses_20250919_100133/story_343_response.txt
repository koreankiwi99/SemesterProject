Premises: No digital media are analog.
Every printed text is analog media.
All streaming services are digital media.
If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.

Lean formalization and proofs:

-- Universe and objects
universe u
constant Obj : Type u

-- Predicates
constant Digital Analog Printed Streaming Hardcover : Obj → Prop

-- Constant for the object "1984"
constant b1984 : Obj

-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom no_digital_are_analog : ∀ x, Digital x → ¬ Analog x
axiom printed_are_analog    : ∀ x, Printed x → Analog x
axiom streaming_are_digital : ∀ x, Streaming x → Digital x
axiom hardcover_implies_printed : ∀ x, Hardcover x → Printed x
axiom streaming1984_implies_hardcover : Streaming b1984 → Hardcover b1984

-- Derived lemmas
theorem streaming_1984_implies_analog : Streaming b1984 → Analog b1984 := by
  intro hs
  have hh : Hardcover b1984 := streaming1984_implies_hardcover hs
  have hp : Printed b1984 := hardcover_implies_printed b1984 hh
  exact printed_are_analog b1984 hp

theorem streaming_1984_implies_digital : Streaming b1984 → Digital b1984 :=
  fun hs => streaming_are_digital b1984 hs

-- Main consequence: 1984 is not a streaming service
theorem not_streaming_1984 : ¬ Streaming b1984 := by
  intro hs
  have ha : Analog b1984 := streaming_1984_implies_analog hs
  have hd : Digital b1984 := streaming_1984_implies_digital hs
  have hna : ¬ Analog b1984 := no_digital_are_analog b1984 hd
  exact hna ha

Answers:
- Question 1: We cannot derive that 1984 is printed text, nor can we derive that it is not. Unknown
- Question 2: From the proof above, 1984 is not a streaming service, so the statement “1984 is a streaming service” is false. False
- Question 3: As shown, ¬ Streaming 1984 holds. True
