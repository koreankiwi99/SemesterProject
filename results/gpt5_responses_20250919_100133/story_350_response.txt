Premises: All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.

-- All Zaha styles Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom h1 : ∀ x, ZahaStyle x → Adores x → Interesting x
-- No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom h2 : ∀ x, Brutalist x → Adores x → ¬ Interesting x
-- Every style that Max adores is either Zaha's or Kelly's.
axiom h3 : ∀ x, Adores x → (ZahaStyle x ∨ KellyStyle x)
-- All Kelly styles Max adores are evocative.
axiom h4 : ∀ x, KellyStyle x → Adores x → Evocative x
-- All Kelly styles Max adores are dreamy.
axiom h5 : ∀ x, KellyStyle x → Adores x → Dreamy x
-- If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then it is brutalist and evocative.
axiom h6 : ∀ x, DesignByMax x → Adores x → Interesting x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- Consequences we can prove:
-- No design by Max that he adores can have interesting geometries (would be a contradiction).
lemma no_adored_interesting_design_by_max :
  ∀ x, DesignByMax x → Adores x → Interesting x → False := by
  intro x dx ax ix
  have hb : Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x := h6 x dx ax ix
  have hni : ¬ Interesting x := h2 x hb.left ax
  exact hni ix

-- Anything Zaha and adored by Max cannot be brutalist.
lemma adored_zaha_not_brutalist :
  ∀ x, Adores x → ZahaStyle x → ¬ Brutalist x := by
  intro x ax zx
  intro bx
  have hni : ¬ Interesting x := h2 x bx ax
  have hi : Interesting x := h1 x zx ax
  exact hni hi

-- Anything Kelly and adored by Max is both evocative and dreamy.
lemma adored_kelly_evocative_and_dreamy :
  ∀ x, Adores x → KellyStyle x → Evocative x ∧ Dreamy x := by
  intro x ax kx
  have e : Evocative x := h4 x kx ax
  have d : Dreamy x := h5 x kx ax

-- Target statements (existential readings of the questions):
def Q1 : Prop := ∃ x, DesignByMax x ∧ Brutalist x
def Q2 : Prop := ∃ x, DesignByMax x ∧ Evocative x ∧ Dreamy x
def Q3 : Prop := ∃ x, DesignByMax x ∧ (Evocative x ∨ Dreamy x)

-- From the given axioms, neither Q1, nor Q2, nor Q3 is derivable or refutable.
