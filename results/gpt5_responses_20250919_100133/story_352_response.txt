Lean formalization and proofs for the shared context:

-- Universe and basic setup
universe u

constant Entity : Type u

constant BusinessOrganization : Entity → Prop
constant Company : Entity → Prop
constant PrivateCompany : Entity → Prop
constant LegalEntity : Entity → Prop
constant CreatedUnderLaw : Entity → Prop
constant HasLegalObligations : Entity → Prop

constant hwb : Entity  -- Harvard Weekly Book Club

-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom A1 : ∀ x, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom A6 : CreatedUnderLaw hwb → ¬ PrivateCompany hwb

-- Useful derived lemmas
lemma private_to_legal : ∀ x, PrivateCompany x → LegalEntity x := by
  intro x hpc
  exact A1 x (A2 x (A3 x hpc))

lemma not_private_hwb : ¬ PrivateCompany hwb := by
  intro hpc
  have hlegal : LegalEntity hwb := private_to_legal hwb hpc
  have hcul   : CreatedUnderLaw hwb := A4 hwb hlegal
  have hnp    : ¬ PrivateCompany hwb := A6 hcul
  exact hnp hpc


Question 1:
Target statement in Lean: HasLegalObligations hwb

Attempt: From the axioms, we can derive HasLegalObligations x only for those x that are LegalEntity x (by A5). We have no premise that hwb is a company, business organization, or legal entity. Hence neither the statement nor its negation is derivable from the given axioms.

Conclusion: Unknown

Question 2:
Target statement in Lean: HasLegalObligations hwb ∧ PrivateCompany hwb

Lean proof of its negation:

theorem Q2_neg : ¬ (HasLegalObligations hwb ∧ PrivateCompany hwb) := by
  intro h
  exact not_private_hwb h.right

Therefore the conjunction cannot hold.

Conclusion: False

Question 3:
Target statement in Lean: PrivateCompany hwb → (HasLegalObligations hwb ∨ CreatedUnderLaw hwb)

Lean proof:

theorem Q3 : PrivateCompany hwb → (HasLegalObligations hwb ∨ CreatedUnderLaw hwb) := by
  intro hpc
  have hlegal : LegalEntity hwb := private_to_legal hwb hpc
  have hcul   : CreatedUnderLaw hwb := A4 hwb hlegal
  -- We could also derive HasLegalObligations hwb via A5; either disjunct suffices.
  exact Or.inr hcul

Conclusion: True
