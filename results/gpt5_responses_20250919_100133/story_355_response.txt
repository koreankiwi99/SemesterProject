Premises: All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.
All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.
All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.

constant HCHome : Person → Prop
constant Fulfills : Person → Prop
constant Disregards : Person → Prop
constant VisitsGymDaily : Person → Prop

-- Axioms from the text

axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, HCHome x → EatSalads x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, Fulfills x → HCHome x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, Disregards x → ¬ VeryConscious x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, VisitsGymDaily x → Fulfills x

-- Individual
constant Taylor : Person

-- Given disjunction about Taylor
axiom T1 : (HCHome Taylor ∧ Disregards Taylor) ∨ (¬ HCHome Taylor ∧ ¬ Disregards Taylor)

-- Eliminate the impossible disjunct
lemma not_hc_and_disregards : ¬ (HCHome Taylor ∧ Disregards Taylor) := by
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨hh, hd⟩
  have vc : VeryConscious Taylor := A1 Taylor (A2 Taylor hh)
  have nvc : ¬ VeryConscious Taylor := A4 Taylor hd
  exact nvc vc

lemma taylor_not_hc_and_not_disregards : ¬ HCHome Taylor ∧ ¬ Disregards Taylor := by
  exact Or.resolve_left T1 not_hc_and_disregards

-- Q2: Taylor does not visit the gym daily
theorem taylor_not_visits : ¬ VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by
  intro hv
  have nhc : ¬ HCHome Taylor := (taylor_not_hc_and_not_disregards).left
  have hc  : HCHome Taylor := A3 Taylor (A5 Taylor hv)

-- Q3: Taylor neither HCHome nor visits daily
theorem taylor_neither_hchome_nor_visits : ¬ HCHome Taylor ∧ ¬ VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by

  · exact taylor_not_visits

end Reasoning
-- End Lean

Conclusions:
- From the axioms, the disjunct (HCHome Taylor ∧ Disregards Taylor) is impossible, hence we get ¬HCHome Taylor ∧ ¬Disregards Taylor. Then VisitsGymDaily Taylor → Fulfills Taylor → HCHome Taylor, contradicting ¬HCHome Taylor, so ¬VisitsGymDaily Taylor. There is no way to conclude EatSalads Taylor or its negation from the given information.

Answers:
Question 1: Taylor eats salads regularly. Unknown
Question 2: Taylor visits the gym at least once a day. False
Question 3: Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day. True
