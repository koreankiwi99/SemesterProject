Premises: If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly

Lean formalization and attempted proofs:

We model a domain of people with predicates:
- Spills : Person → Prop         -- spills a lot of food on their clothing
- Tidy   : Person → Prop         -- notably tidy
- Clean  : Person → Prop         -- cleanly
- Values : Person → Prop         -- values order and spotlessness
- Family : Person → Prop         -- family prioritizes order and spotlessness
- Goer   : Person → Prop         -- clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try

Constants:
- Person : Type
- Peter  : Person

Axioms from the text:
- a1: ∀ x, Spills x → ¬ Tidy x
- a2: ∀ x, Goer x → Spills x
- a3: ∀ x, Clean x → Tidy x
- a4: ∀ x, Values x → Clean x
- a5: ∀ x, Family x → Values x
- a6: (Spills Peter ∧ Clean Peter) ∨ (¬ Spills Peter ∧ ¬ Clean Peter)

constant Spills : Person → Prop

axiom a1 : ∀ x, Spills x → ¬ Tidy x
axiom a2 : ∀ x, Goer x → Spills x
axiom a3 : ∀ x, Clean x → Tidy x
axiom a4 : ∀ x, Values x → Clean x
axiom a5 : ∀ x, Family x → Values x
axiom a6 : (Spills Peter ∧ Clean Peter) ∨ (¬ Spills Peter ∧ ¬ Clean Peter)

-- 1) From a1 and a3, (Spills ∧ Clean) is impossible for Peter
lemma not_spills_and_clean : ¬ (Spills Peter ∧ Clean Peter) := by
  intro h
  have s : Spills Peter := h.left
  have c : Clean Peter  := h.right
  have t  : Tidy Peter  := a3 Peter c
  have nt : ¬ Tidy Peter := a1 Peter s
  exact nt t

-- 2) Therefore, from a6 we must have ¬Spills Peter ∧ ¬Clean Peter
lemma not_spills_and_not_clean : ¬ Spills Peter ∧ ¬ Clean Peter := by
  cases a6 with
  | inl sc => exact False.elim (not_spills_and_clean sc)
  | inr nsnc => exact nsnc

lemma not_spills : ¬ Spills Peter := (not_spills_and_not_clean).left
lemma not_clean  : ¬ Clean Peter  := (not_spills_and_not_clean).right

-- 3) Propagate negations back through the given implications
lemma not_goer  : ¬ Goer Peter := by
  -- a2 Peter : Goer Peter → Spills Peter
  -- not_spills : ¬ Spills Peter
  exact mt (a2 Peter) not_spills

lemma not_values : ¬ Values Peter := by
  -- a4 Peter : Values Peter → Clean Peter
  -- not_clean : ¬ Clean Peter
  exact mt (a4 Peter) not_clean

lemma not_family : ¬ Family Peter := by
  -- a5 Peter : Family Peter → Values Peter
  -- not_values : ¬ Values Peter
  exact mt (a5 Peter) not_values

-- Q2: Peter is either a Goer or Family
-- We can prove the negation (False), since we have ¬Goer and ¬Family
theorem Q2_false : ¬ (Goer Peter ∨ Family Peter) := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hg => exact not_goer hg
  | inr hf => exact not_family hf

-- Q3: (Goer ∧ Family) ∨ (¬Goer ∧ ¬Family) holds; we prove the right disjunct
theorem Q3_true : (Goer Peter ∧ Family Peter) ∨ (¬ Goer Peter ∧ ¬ Family Peter) := by
  exact Or.inr ⟨not_goer, not_family⟩

-- Q1 (Tidy Peter) is not derivable from the axioms above; we do not have a proof of Tidy Peter or its negation.

end

Conclusions:
- From the axioms we derive ¬Spills Peter and ¬Clean Peter, and consequently ¬Goer Peter and ¬Family Peter.
- Q1 (Peter is notably tidy): We cannot derive Tidy Peter nor its negation from the given information. Unknown
- Q2 (Peter is either a clumsy foodie goer or someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness): We proved its negation. False
- Q3 (Peter is either both a clumsy foodie goer and someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or neither): We proved the second disjunct. True

Answers:
- Question 1: Unknown
- Question 2: False
- Question 3: True
