Premises: People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.
If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.
If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. 
Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers

-- Axioms from the text
axiom ax1 : ∀ x : Person, MultipleBirth x → SpendTimeWithSibs x
axiom ax2 : ∀ x : Person, HaveSibsBornTogether x → MultipleBirth x
axiom ax3 : ∀ x : Person, ComplainOften x → HaveSibsBornTogether x
axiom ax4 : ∀ x : Person, LiveAtHome x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x
axiom ax5 : ∀ x : Person, SpendTimeWithSibs x → LiveAtHome x
axiom ax6 :
  (Baby Luke ∧ MultipleBirth Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) ∨
  (¬ (Baby Luke ∧ MultipleBirth Luke) ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke)

-- Useful derived facts
lemma M_implies_not_LWS (x : Person) : MultipleBirth x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x :=
by
  intro hM
  have hS : SpendTimeWithSibs x := ax1 x hM
  have hH : LiveAtHome x := ax5 x hS
  exact ax4 x hH

lemma no_left_disjunct :
  ¬ (Baby Luke ∧ MultipleBirth Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) :=
by
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨_, hM, hLWS⟩
  exact (M_implies_not_LWS Luke hM) hLWS

lemma right_disjunct :

by
  cases ax6 with
  | inl h => exact False.elim (no_left_disjunct h)
  | inr h => exact h

lemma luke_not_LWS : ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke := right_disjunct.2

lemma complain_implies_not_LWS (x : Person) :
  ComplainOften x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x :=
by
  intro hc
  have hM : MultipleBirth x := ax2 x (ax3 x hc)
  exact M_implies_not_LWS x hM

-- Observations:
-- • From ax6 and the other axioms we can prove ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke.
-- • We cannot derive MultipleBirth Luke, SpendTimeWithSibs Luke, or ComplainOften Luke,
--   nor their negations, from the given premises.

Answers:

1) Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings. Unknown

2) Luke complains often about annoying siblings. Unknown

3) Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings. Unknown
