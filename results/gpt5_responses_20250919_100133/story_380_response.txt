Lean formalization and attempt at proofs

We model the domain with a type of people and predicates capturing the properties mentioned. Bonnie is a constant individual. The premises are axioms; we then derive useful lemmas and try to prove the three questions.

Informal conclusions

- Q1: From the premises we know Bonnie is either Performs or Inactive. If she is Inactive, then she Chaperones and is not a Student; using (Engaged ↔ Student) and “Performs → Engaged,” this implies she does not Perform. If she is not Inactive, then by the disjunction she Performs. Both cases are consistent with the premises; we cannot determine which holds. Unknown

- Q2: For Bonnie, from “Club → (Performs ∨ Inactive)”, “Performs → Engaged”, and (Engaged ↔ Student), we get Student ∨ Inactive unconditionally. Hence the implication holds regardless of the antecedent. True

- Q3: From “Club → (Performs ∨ Inactive)” and “Inactive → Chaperone” we know the antecedent (Chaperone ∨ Performs) is always true for Bonnie. The conclusion requires YoungTeen ∧ Wishes ∧ Inactive, which is neither forced by the premises nor refutable; indeed, if Bonnie Performs then she is not Inactive. Therefore the implication is not determined. Unknown

Final answers:
- Question 1: Unknown
- Question 2: True
- Question 3: Unknown
