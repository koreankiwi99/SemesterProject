Answers:

1) From RG Coco and the gender disjunction, the male case leads to a contradiction via the Nadal rule and the special Coco constraint, so Coco must be in the safe branch that yields Lost-to-Iga → High → Most; hence she is among the most active Grand-Slam players. True

2) We only know all male RG players lost to Nadal, and Coco is not male-at-RG (from the special constraint together with our derivations), but nothing states that non-male players did not or did lose to Nadal; thus this cannot be concluded. Unknown

3) We proved Coco_lostIga_and_most, so the statement “Coco is not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 and one of the most active players in major tennis” is false. False

True
