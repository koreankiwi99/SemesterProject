Premises: If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.

-- Axioms from the text
axiom deadly_low : ∀ x, Deadly x → LowSurvival x
axiom severe_deadly : ∀ x, SevereCancer x → Deadly x
axiom bile_severe : ∀ x, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x
axiom chol_bile : ∀ x, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x
axiom mild_low : ∀ x, MildFlu x → LowSurvival x
axiom colorectal_not_bile_and_low : ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvival ColorectalCancer)

-- Derived: bile duct cancer implies low survival
lemma bile_low : ∀ x, BileDuctCancer x → LowSurvival x := by
  intro x hb
  exact deadly_low x (severe_deadly x (bile_severe x hb))

-- Therefore, colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer
lemma not_bile_colorectal : ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer := by
  intro hb
  have hl : LowSurvival ColorectalCancer := bile_low ColorectalCancer hb
  exact colorectal_not_bile_and_low ⟨hb, hl⟩

-- And thus not a cholangiocarcinoma either
lemma not_chol_colorectal : ¬ Cholangiocarcinoma ColorectalCancer := by
  intro hc
  have hb : BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer := chol_bile ColorectalCancer hc
  exact not_bile_colorectal hb

-- Question 1 statement (we cannot prove or refute it from the axioms):
def Q1 : Prop := SevereCancer ColorectalCancer

-- Question 2 statement and proof: it is true (vacuously, since the antecedent is impossible)
def Q2 : Prop :=
  (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∨ Cholangiocarcinoma ColorectalCancer) →
  (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ MildFlu ColorectalCancer)

theorem Q2_true : Q2 := by
  intro h
  have : False := by
    cases h with
    | inl hb => exact not_bile_colorectal hb
    | inr hc =>
      have hb : BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer := chol_bile ColorectalCancer hc
      exact not_bile_colorectal hb
  exact False.elim this

-- Question 3 statement (interpreting “or all of the above” as adding the full conjunction)
-- This reduces to a disjunction of two cases, both requiring Cholangiocarcinoma ColorectalCancer.
def Q3 : Prop :=
  (Cholangiocarcinoma ColorectalCancer ∧ (MildFlu ColorectalCancer ∨ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer)) ∨
  (Cholangiocarcinoma ColorectalCancer ∧ MildFlu ColorectalCancer ∧ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer)

-- We can prove the negation of Q3 from the axioms (hence Q3 is false).
theorem Q3_false : ¬ Q3 := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl h1 => exact not_chol_colorectal h1.1
  | inr h2 => exact not_chol_colorectal h2.1


Answers:

- Question 1: We cannot derive that colorectal cancer is a severe cancer, nor can we derive its negation, from the given information. Unknown

- Question 2: From the axioms we get ¬(BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer) and hence also ¬(Cholangiocarcinoma ColorectalCancer). Therefore the antecedent is impossible, making the implication true. True

- Question 3: Both disjuncts require Cholangiocarcinoma ColorectalCancer, which we proved false; thus the whole statement is false. False
