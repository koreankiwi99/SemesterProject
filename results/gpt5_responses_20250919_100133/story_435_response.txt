Here is a faithful Lean formalization of the predicates and facts, followed by proofs for the four queried statements (or their negations).

Lean code:
```
universe u

section

variable {U : Type u}
variable (Library CS PT DB David Lab : U → Prop)
variable (James : U)

-- Facts from the problem
variable (h1 : ∀ x, Library x → ¬ CS x)      -- None working in library are CS
variable (h2 : ∀ x, PT x → Library x)         -- All with PT jobs work in library
variable (h3 : ∀ x, DB x → CS x)              -- All taking DB are CS
variable (h4 : ∀ x, David x → DB x)           -- All with David take DB
variable (h5 : ∀ x, Lab x → David x)          -- All in lab take David's class
variable (h6 : Lab James)                     -- James works in the lab
variable (h7 : ¬ Lab James ∧ ¬ PT James)      -- James does not work in lab and does not have a PT job

-- The four statements to evaluate
def S1 : Prop := PT James
def S2 : Prop := ¬ PT James
def S3 : Prop := DB James ∨ PT James
def S4 : Prop := DB James

-- Q4: James takes the database course.
theorem Q4_proved : S4 Lab David DB James h5 h4 h6 := by
  -- From Lab James, get David James, then DB James
  have hDavid : David James := h5 James h6
  exact h4 James hDavid

-- Q3: James either takes DB or has a PT job.
theorem Q3_proved : S3 Library CS PT DB David Lab James h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 h7 := by
  -- Left disjunct holds because Q4 holds
  exact Or.inl (Q4_proved Lab David DB James h5 h4 h6)

-- Q2: James does not have a PT job.
theorem Q2_proved : S2 Library CS PT DB David Lab James h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 h7 := by
  -- From the given conjunction, take the right conjunct ¬ PT James
  exact (And.right h7)

-- Q1: James has a PT job is false (we prove its negation).
theorem Q1_neg : ¬ S1 Library CS PT DB David Lab James h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 h7 := by
  -- Same as Q2_proved
  exact (And.right h7)

end
```

Explanation of the reasoning:
- From “Lab → David” and “David → DB” and the fact that James is in the lab, we get that James takes the database course (DB James).
- From “James doesn’t … have a part-time job,” we directly get ¬ PT James.
- Therefore:
  - “James has a PT job” is false (since ¬ PT James).
  - “James does not have a PT job” is true.
  - “James takes DB or has a PT job” is true (the left side holds).
  - “James takes the database course” is true.

Answers:
- Question 1: False
- Question 2: True
- Question 3: True
- Question 4: True
