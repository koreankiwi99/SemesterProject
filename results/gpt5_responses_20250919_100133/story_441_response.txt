-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom H1 : ∀ x : Person, Nice x → ¬ Mean x                      -- No one nice to animals is also mean to animals
axiom H2 : ∃ x : Person, Grumpy x ∧ Mean x                      -- Some grumpy people are mean to animals
axiom H3 : ∀ x : Person, Lover x → Nice x                       -- All animal lovers are nice to animals
axiom H4 : ∀ x : Person, PetOwner x → Lover x                   -- All pet owners love animals
axiom H5 : PetOwner Tom                                         -- Tom is a pet owner

-- Derived facts about Tom
lemma lover_Tom : Lover Tom := H4 Tom H5
lemma nice_Tom : Nice Tom := H3 Tom lover_Tom
lemma not_mean_Tom : ¬ Mean Tom := H1 Tom nice_Tom

-- Q2: Tom is not both grumpy and mean to animals (provable)
lemma Q2 : ¬ (Grumpy Tom ∧ Mean Tom) := by
  intro h
  exact not_mean_Tom h.right

-- Q3: The given implication is false; we prove its negation
lemma not_consequent : ¬ (¬ Grumpy Tom ∧ ¬ Lover Tom) := by
  intro h
  have hNotL : ¬ Lover Tom := h.right
  exact hNotL lover_Tom

lemma Q3_neg :
  ¬ ( (¬ (Grumpy Tom ∧ Mean Tom)) → (¬ Grumpy Tom ∧ ¬ Lover Tom) ) := by
  intro h
  have ante : ¬ (Grumpy Tom ∧ Mean Tom) := Q2
  have cons : (¬ Grumpy Tom ∧ ¬ Lover Tom) := h ante
  exact not_consequent cons


Answers with justification:

- Question 1: From the premises we can derive Lover Tom, Nice Tom, and ¬Mean Tom, but nothing about whether Tom is Grumpy. So we cannot determine if Tom is grumpy. Unknown

- Question 2: Since Tom is an animal lover, he is nice to animals, hence not mean to animals; therefore he cannot be both grumpy and mean. True

- Question 3: The antecedent (Tom is not both grumpy and mean) is true, but the consequent (Tom is neither grumpy nor an animal lover) is false because Tom is an animal lover. Hence the implication is false. False
