Answers:
- Q1: Unknown. The premises do not constrain Yuri’s nationality. Unknown
- Q2: True. From ¬ActivatesLegs(Yuri) and the chain Pro → Jump → Leap → ActivatesLegs, we get ¬Pro(Yuri), hence ¬(American(Yuri) ∧ Pro(Yuri)). True
- Q3: False. Being an American professional basketball player implies Pro(Yuri), but we proved ¬Pro(Yuri). False
- Q4: False. We have ¬LeapsStraightUp(Yuri) from ¬ActivatesLegs(Yuri) and Leap → ActivatesLegs; the implication would then assert American(Yuri) ∧ Pro(Yuri), contradicting ¬Pro(Yuri). False
- Q5: False. Since ¬Pro(Yuri), the antecedent ¬(American(Yuri) ∧ Pro(Yuri)) holds, but the consequent Pro(Yuri) is false. False

True/False/Unknown status justified by the Lean proofs above:
- Q1: Unknown
- Q2: True
- Q3: False
- Q4: False
- Q5: False
