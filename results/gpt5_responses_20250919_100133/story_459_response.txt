Premises: Jane does not like any animals that bark.
All dogs are animals that bark.
Jane likes all animals that jump.
If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.

Lean formalization of the context:

universe u

constant Entity : Type u

constants Animal Dog Barks Jumps HasLegs Terricolous : Entity → Prop
constant Likes : Entity → Entity → Prop

constants Jane KiKi : Entity

axiom A1 : ∀ x, (Animal x ∧ Barks x) → ¬ Likes Jane x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Dog x → (Animal x ∧ Barks x)
axiom A3 : ∀ x, (Animal x ∧ Jumps x) → Likes Jane x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, (Animal x ∧ HasLegs x) → Jumps x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, (Animal x ∧ Terricolous x) → HasLegs x
axiom A6 : Animal KiKi
axiom A7 : (¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi) → (Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi)

Attempted theorems (not provable from the axioms; neither their negations are provable either):

-- Q1: Terricolous KiKi
-- Not derivable: from A6–A7 we cannot conclude Terricolous KiKi without further premises.
-- theorem Q1 : Terricolous KiKi := by sorry

-- Q2: Dog KiKi ∧ Barks KiKi
-- Not derivable: we have no information that KiKi is a dog.
-- theorem Q2 : Dog KiKi ∧ Barks KiKi := by sorry

-- Q3: ¬ Barks KiKi ∧ ¬ Dog KiKi
-- Not derivable: nothing rules out KiKi being a barking dog.
-- theorem Q3 : ¬ Barks KiKi ∧ ¬ Dog KiKi := by sorry

Answers:

1) KiKi is terricolous.
Reason: Not entailed by the premises; the special conditional about KiKi does not force terricolous, and there is no other rule implying it. Unknown

2) KiKi is a barking dog.
Reason: We have no information that KiKi is a dog (and hence barks). Unknown

3) KiKi does not bark and he is not a dog.
Reason: Also not entailed; nothing rules out KiKi being a dog that barks. Unknown
