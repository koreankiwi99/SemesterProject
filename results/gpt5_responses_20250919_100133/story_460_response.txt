Lean formalization and derivations:

universe u

constant Obj : Type u

-- Predicates
constant Film : Obj → Prop
constant AppropriateAllAges : Obj → Prop
constant ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance : Obj → Prop
constant ExcessiveEroticViolent : Obj → Prop
constant RatedGA : Obj → Prop
constant FamilyFriendlyAnimated : Obj → Prop
constant InFrozenSeries : Obj → Prop

-- Constant for the specific film
constant Hachi : Obj

-- Axioms (from the textual context)
axiom ax1 : ∀ f : Obj, AppropriateAllAges f → ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance f
axiom ax2 : ∀ f : Obj, ExcessiveEroticViolent f → ¬ ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance f
axiom ax3 : ∀ f : Obj, RatedGA f → AppropriateAllAges f
axiom ax4 : ∀ f : Obj, FamilyFriendlyAnimated f → RatedGA f
axiom ax5 : ∀ f : Obj, InFrozenSeries f → FamilyFriendlyAnimated f
axiom ax6 : Film Hachi
axiom ax7 : FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateAllAges Hachi

-- Useful derived facts
lemma appropriate_Hachi : AppropriateAllAges Hachi :=
  Or.elim ax7
    (fun hffa => ax3 _ (ax4 _ hffa))
    (fun happ => happ)

lemma canWatch_Hachi : ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi :=
  ax1 _ appropriate_Hachi

lemma not_excessive_Hachi : ¬ ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi :=
  fun hEx => (ax2 _ hEx) canWatch_Hachi

-- From not_excessive_Hachi we also get that the conjunction with Frozen is impossible
lemma not_excessive_and_frozen_Hachi : ¬ (ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi ∧ InFrozenSeries Hachi) :=
  fun h => not_excessive_Hachi h.left

-- What we cannot prove (and also cannot refute) from the given axioms:
-- 1) RatedGA Hachi      (neither provable nor refutable)
-- 2) ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi ∨ InFrozenSeries Hachi
-- 3) (ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi ∧ InFrozenSeries Hachi) ∨ (¬ ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi ∧ ¬ InFrozenSeries Hachi)
--    We can prove ¬ ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi, but we have no information about InFrozenSeries Hachi or its negation.


Answers:

- Question 1: "Hachi: A dog's Tale" is rated General Audience.
  From the axioms we can derive AppropriateAllAges Hachi, but we cannot derive RatedGA Hachi (the converse of axiom 3 is not given), nor can we refute it. Unknown

- Question 2: "Hachi: A dog's Tale" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the "Frozen" series or both.
  We have proved ¬ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi, so the statement reduces to InFrozenSeries Hachi, which we neither can prove nor refute. Unknown

- Question 3: "Hachi: A dog's Tale" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the "Frozen" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the "Frozen" series.
  The first disjunct is false because ¬ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi; the second requires ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi, which is not derivable. Unknown
