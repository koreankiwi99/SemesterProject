axiom A3 : ∀ x, Pet x → (Monkey x ∨ Bird x)                            -- Peter's pets are either monkeys or birds
axiom A4 : ∀ x, Pet x → Bird x → CanFly x                              -- Peter's birds can fly
axiom A5 : ∀ x, Pet x → Animal x → CanBreathe x                        -- Peter's pet animals can breathe

axiom A8 : CanFly Rock ∨ Bird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock                 -- Given disjunction

-- Attempt to prove the questions:
-- Q1: Monkey Rock          (not derivable from A1–A8)
-- Q2: HasWings Rock        (not derivable from A1–A8, since A8 might hold via ¬CanBreathe Rock)
-- Q3: ¬ HasWings Rock      (also not derivable)
