-- Axioms from the text
-- Breeding back is a form of artificial selection
axiom A1 : ∀ x:U, BredBack x → ArtificiallySelected x
-- Heck cattle are animals
axiom A2 : ∀ x:U, HeckCattle x → Animal x
-- Aurochs are animals
axiom A3 : ∀ x:U, Aurochs x → Animal x
-- Heck cattle were bred back (to resemble the aurochs)
axiom A4 : ∃ x y:U, HeckCattle x ∧ Aurochs y ∧ BredBack x ∧ Resembles x y
-- Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals
axiom A5 : ∃ x y:U, Animal x ∧ ToBeBredBack x ∧ Animal y ∧ Extinct y ∧ Resembles x y

-- Q1: Some Heck cattle are artificially selected.
theorem Q1 : ∃ x:U, HeckCattle x ∧ ArtificiallySelected x := by
  rcases A4 with ⟨x, y, hx, hy, hbb, hres⟩
  have hAS : ArtificiallySelected x := A1 x hbb
  exact ⟨x, ⟨hx, hAS⟩⟩

-- Q2 formalization (cannot be proved from the axioms):
def AurochsAreExtinct : Prop := ∀ y:U, Aurochs y → Extinct y

Answers:

- Question 1: From “Heck cattle were bred back …” and “Breeding back is a form of artificial selection,” there exists a Heck cattle that is artificially selected. True

- Question 2: The premises do not state or entail that aurochs are extinct; we only know some bred-back animals resemble extinct animals. Unknown
