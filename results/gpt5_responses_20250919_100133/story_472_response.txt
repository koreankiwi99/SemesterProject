Here is a faithful Lean formalization of the statements and an attempt at the three questions.

Lean formalization:

- Universe of discourse: U
- Predicates on U:
  - Animal, Vertebrate, Invertebrate, Backbone, MF (reproduces by male-and-female mating), Bee, QueenBee
- Constant: harry : U

Axioms, as given by the text:
- A1: All animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates:
  ∀ x, Animal x → (Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x)
- A2: All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating:
  ∀ x, Animal x → Backbone x → MF x
- A3: All vertebrate animals have a backbone:
  ∀ x, Animal x → Vertebrate x → Backbone x
- A4: All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating:
  ∀ x, Bee x → ¬ MF x
- A5: All queen bees are bees:
  ∀ x, QueenBee x → Bee x
- A6: Harry is a bee:
  Bee harry

Attempted proofs and conclusions:

- For Q1 (Harry is a queen bee): From A5 and A6 we only get that if Harry is a queen bee then he is a bee, but not conversely. There is no information to prove QueenBee harry or its negation. Unknown

- For Q2 (Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee): We cannot use A1 to classify Harry as invertebrate or vertebrate because we do not have Bee → Animal in the premises. Nor do we have any premise implying Harry is a queen bee. We cannot prove the disjunction or its negation. Unknown

- For Q3 (If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee): We can show the left disjunct of the antecedent leads to a contradiction (it would force MF harry, contradicting A4 and A6). Thus the antecedent, if true, reduces to the right disjunct. From the right disjunct alone, there is no way to derive ¬Invertebrate harry ∧ ¬QueenBee harry from the given axioms, nor can we force the negation of the implication. Unknown
