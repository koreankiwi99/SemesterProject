namespace Reasoning

universe u

constant U : Type u

-- Entities
constant SummerOlympicGames : U
constant LastSummerOlympics : U
constant Tokyo : U
constant UnitedStates : U
constant WorldChampionships : U

-- Predicates/relations
constant SportingEvent : U → Prop
constant WonMostMedalsIn : U → U → Prop

-- Facts from the text
axiom summer_olympics_is_sporting : SportingEvent SummerOlympicGames
axiom last_summer_olympics_is_Tokyo : LastSummerOlympics = Tokyo
axiom us_won_most_medals_in_Tokyo : WonMostMedalsIn UnitedStates Tokyo

-- Queries as propositions
def Q1 : Prop := SportingEvent WorldChampionships
def Q2 : Prop := LastSummerOlympics ≠ Tokyo
def Q3 : Prop := WonMostMedalsIn UnitedStates LastSummerOlympics

-- Q2 is false given last_summer_olympics_is_Tokyo
theorem Q2_neg : ¬ Q2 := by
  intro h
  exact h last_summer_olympics_is_Tokyo

-- Q3 is true by rewriting with last_summer_olympics_is_Tokyo
theorem Q3_true : Q3 := by
  simpa [Q3, last_summer_olympics_is_Tokyo] using us_won_most_medals_in_Tokyo

-- Q1 cannot be derived (nor its negation) from the given axioms.
