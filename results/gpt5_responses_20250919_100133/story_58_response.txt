Lean formalization and attempted proofs:

universe u

constant Person : Type u
constant Book   : Type u

constant ContainsKnowledge   : Book → Prop
constant Reads               : Person → Book → Prop
constant GainsKnowledge      : Person → Prop
constant SmarterThanBefore   : Person → Prop

axiom BooksContainKnowledge    : ∀ b : Book, ContainsKnowledge b
axiom ReadingGivesKnowledge    : ∀ p : Person, ∀ b : Book, Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p
axiom KnowledgeMakesSmarter    : ∀ p : Person, GainsKnowledge p → SmarterThanBefore p

constant Harry  : Person
constant Walden : Book
axiom HarryReadWalden : Reads Harry Walden

-- Q1
theorem Q1_WaldenContainsKnowledge : ContainsKnowledge Walden :=
  BooksContainKnowledge Walden

-- Q2
theorem Q2_HarrySmarterThanBefore : SmarterThanBefore Harry :=
by
  apply KnowledgeMakesSmarter
  exact ReadingGivesKnowledge Harry Walden HarryReadWalden

-- Q3 (attempt): From the given axioms we only have GainsKnowledge → SmarterThanBefore,
-- not the converse. We cannot derive ∀ p, SmarterThanBefore p → GainsKnowledge p,
-- nor can we derive its negation from the given information.

Answers:
1) Walden contains knowledge. True
2) Harry is smarter than before. True
3) A smarter person has gained knowledge. Unknown
