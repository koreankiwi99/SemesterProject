Lean formalization and proofs:

-- Types and predicates
universe u
constant Person : Type u
constant Club   : Type u

constant PlaysFor     : Person → Club → Prop
constant FootballClub : Club → Prop
constant Brazilian    : Person → Prop
constant LoanedTo     : Person → Club → Prop

-- Entities
constant AiltonSilva Ailton : Person
constant Nautico Braga Fluminense : Club

-- Facts from the context
axiom h_alias  : Ailton = AiltonSilva
axiom h_loan   : LoanedTo Ailton Braga
axiom h_play   : PlaysFor AiltonSilva Nautico
axiom h_brazil : Brazilian AiltonSilva
axiom h_fc_N   : FootballClub Nautico
axiom h_fc_B   : FootballClub Braga
axiom h_fc_F   : FootballClub Fluminense

-- Q1: "No one playing for Nautico is Brazilian."
def Q1 : Prop := ∀ p : Person, PlaysFor p Nautico → ¬ Brazilian p

-- We can refute Q1 with the counterexample AiltonSilva.
theorem Q1_false : ¬ Q1 := by
  intro h
  have hb : ¬ Brazilian AiltonSilva := h AiltonSilva h_play
  exact hb h_brazil

-- Q2: "Ailton Silva does not play for a football club."
def Q2 : Prop := ¬ ∃ c : Club, FootballClub c ∧ PlaysFor AiltonSilva c

-- We can refute Q2 using Nautico.
theorem Q2_false : ¬ Q2 := by
  intro h
  exact h ⟨Nautico, h_fc_N, h_play⟩

-- Q3: "Ailton was not loaned out to a football club."
def Q3 : Prop := ¬ ∃ c : Club, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedTo Ailton c

-- We can refute Q3 using Braga.
theorem Q3_false : ¬ Q3 := by
  intro h
  exact h ⟨Braga, h_fc_B, h_loan⟩

-- Q4: "Ailton Silva played for Fluminense."
def Q4 : Prop := PlaysFor AiltonSilva Fluminense
-- From the given facts, neither Q4 nor its negation is derivable.

-- Q5: "Ailton Silva was loaned out to a football club."
def Q5 : Prop := ∃ c : Club, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedTo AiltonSilva c

-- We can prove Q5 using the alias and the loan to Braga.
theorem Q5_true : Q5 := by
  have h_loan_silva : LoanedTo AiltonSilva Braga := by simpa [h_alias] using h_loan
  exact ⟨Braga, h_fc_B, h_loan_silva⟩


Answers:
1) False
2) False
3) False
4) Unknown
5) True

Since we proved the negations for Q1–Q3, could not prove Q4 nor its negation, and proved Q5, the per-question results are as above.
