-- Q2: Juan visited a mountain range in Texas.
-- Not provable from given axioms (could be other visits unknown).
-- We do not assert a theorem here.

-- Q3: “The Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico.”
-- That statement is false. We prove its negation by exhibiting Picuris in NM containing the mine.
