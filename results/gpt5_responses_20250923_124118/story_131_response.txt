Lean translation and proof attempt:

-- We formalize the setting
universe u

constant Algorithm : Type

-- Learning categories (predicates on algorithms)
constant Supervised : Algorithm → Prop
constant Unsupervised : Algorithm → Prop
constant Reinforcement : Algorithm → Prop

-- Property: requires labeled data
constant RequiresLabels : Algorithm → Prop

-- The specific ML algorithm used to train the SOTA text summarization model
constant alg : Algorithm

-- Assumptions from the textual context:

-- 1) Categorization: every ML algorithm is (exactly one of) supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement
axiom partition :
  ∀ a : Algorithm, Supervised a ∨ Unsupervised a ∨ Reinforcement a

axiom disjoint_SU : ∀ a, ¬ (Supervised a ∧ Unsupervised a)
axiom disjoint_SR : ∀ a, ¬ (Supervised a ∧ Reinforcement a)
axiom disjoint_UR : ∀ a, ¬ (Unsupervised a ∧ Reinforcement a)

-- 2) Unsupervised algorithms do not require labeled data
axiom unsup_no_labels : ∀ a, Unsupervised a → ¬ RequiresLabels a

-- 3) The ML algorithm used to train the SOTA model requires labeled data
axiom alg_requires_labels : RequiresLabels alg

-- 4) Reinforcement learning is not used to train the SOTA model
axiom not_reinforcement_alg : ¬ Reinforcement alg

-- From these, we prove the two questions.

-- Q1: Supervised learning is used to train the SOTA model.
theorem Q1_supervised_used : Supervised alg := by
  -- First, show alg is not unsupervised (it requires labels, while unsupervised do not)
  have not_unsup : ¬ Unsupervised alg := by
    intro hU
    have hNL : ¬ RequiresLabels alg := unsup_no_labels alg hU
    exact hNL alg_requires_labels
  -- Use the partition and exclusions to deduce supervised
  have hpart := partition alg
  rcases hpart with hS | hU | hR
  · exact hS
  · exact False.elim (not_unsup hU)
  · exact False.elim (not_reinforcement_alg hR)

-- Q2: Unsupervised learning is used to train the SOTA model. (We show this is false.)
theorem Q2_unsupervised_used_false : ¬ Unsupervised alg := by
  intro hU
  have hNL : ¬ RequiresLabels alg := unsup_no_labels alg hU
  exact hNL alg_requires_labels
