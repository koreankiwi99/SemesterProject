-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom a1 : Winner Steinhauer
axiom a2 : Participated Steinhauer
axiom a3 : ∃ x : Person, InSixWayTie x ∧ FromBelgium x
axiom a4 : FromBelgium Descampe ∧ OnLeaderboard Descampe
axiom a5 : ∀ x : Person, OnLeaderboard x → Participated x
-- “One six-way tie was on the leaderboard”
axiom a6 : ∀ x : Person, InSixWayTie x → OnLeaderboard x

-- Question 1 statement: ¬ Winner Steinhauer
-- We cannot prove this, but we can prove its negation (namely Winner Steinhauer) directly from a1.
theorem Q1_negation_of_statement : Winner Steinhauer := a1

-- Alternatively, we can show ¬¬Winner Steinhauer
theorem Q1_not_not : ¬ ¬ Winner Steinhauer :=

-- Question 2 statement: InSixWayTie Descampe
-- From the axioms we know:
--   • ∃x, InSixWayTie x ∧ FromBelgium x      (a3)
--   • FromBelgium Descampe                    (a4.left)
--   • OnLeaderboard Descampe                  (a4.right)
--   • InSixWayTie x → OnLeaderboard x         (a6)
-- But nothing equates “the Belgian in the six-way tie” with Descampe.
-- Hence neither InSixWayTie Descampe nor its negation is derivable from these axioms.

Answers:
1) Steinhauer was not the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic. False
2) Descampe is in the six-way tie in the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic. Unknown

Final status of proofs:
- Q1: We proved the negation of the statement (Winner Steinhauer) from a1. Therefore: False
- Q2: We could not prove the statement nor its negation from the given axioms. Therefore: Unknown
