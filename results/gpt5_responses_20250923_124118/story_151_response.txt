Premises: Barutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.
Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island.
Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands.
Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands. 
If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.

-- Facts from the text
axiom h1 : Cove BarutinCove
axiom h2 : BulgarianSettlement Barutin
axiom h3 : NamedAfter BarutinCove Barutin
axiom h4 : LocatedIn BarutinCove SnowIsland
axiom h5 : LocatedIn SnowIsland SouthShetlandIslands
axiom h6 : LocatedIn GreenwichIsland SouthShetlandIslands
axiom h7 : LocatedIn DeceptionIsland SouthShetlandIslands
axiom h8 : LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetlandIslands

-- Transitivity of location
axiom loc_trans : ∀ {A B C : Place}, LocatedIn A B → LocatedIn B C → LocatedIn A C

-- What we can prove from the above:
lemma BarutinCove_in_SSI : LocatedIn BarutinCove SouthShetlandIslands :=
  loc_trans h4 h5

-- Note: From the given (somewhat unusual) premise h8 (Antarctica is located in the South Shetland Islands),
-- we cannot deduce that South Shetland Islands are located in Antarctica, so we cannot place BarutinCove in Antarctica.

-- Questions formalized:

-- Q1: “Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica.”
-- ∀ i, Island i ∧ LocatedIn i Antarctica → NamedAfter BarutinCove i
def Q1 : Prop := ∀ i : Place, Island i ∧ LocatedIn i Antarctica → NamedAfter BarutinCove i

-- Q2: “There is at least one cove in Antarctica named after a place in Bulgaria (a Bulgarian settlement).”
-- ∃ c y, Cove c ∧ LocatedIn c Antarctica ∧ BulgarianSettlement y ∧ NamedAfter c y
def Q2 : Prop :=
  ∃ c y : Place, Cove c ∧ LocatedIn c Antarctica ∧ BulgarianSettlement y ∧ NamedAfter c y

-- Q3: “Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica.”
-- ¬ LocatedIn BarutinCove Antarctica
def Q3 : Prop := ¬ LocatedIn BarutinCove Antarctica

-- Attempted proofs:
-- From the provided axioms, Q1 cannot be derived (no info relating islands in Antarctica to being namesakes of Barutin Cove).
-- Its negation also cannot be derived (we have no inhabited example of an island in Antarctica).
-- Hence Q1 is not provable here.

-- For Q2, we can prove existence in South Shetland Islands (using BarutinCove_in_SSI, h1, h2, h3),
-- but not in Antarctica due to lack of a premise that South Shetland Islands ⊆ Antarctica.
-- Hence Q2 is not provable (nor is its negation provable from these axioms).

-- For Q3, we have no information to prove LocatedIn BarutinCove Antarctica or its negation.
-- Hence Q3 is not provable (nor is its negation provable) from these axioms.
