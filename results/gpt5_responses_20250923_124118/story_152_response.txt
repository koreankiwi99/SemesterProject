GPT-5 Full Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and proof attempt:

-- Types and basic functions
constant Person : Type
constant Airport : Type
constant from : Person → Airport
constant to : Person → Airport

-- Constants for entities
constant LGA : Airport
constant Susan : Person
constant John : Person

-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom dep_ne_arr : ∀ p : Person, from p ≠ to p
axiom sus_to : to Susan = LGA
axiom john_from : from John = LGA

-- Question 1 target: from Susan = LGA
-- We can prove its negation.
theorem not_q1 : from Susan ≠ LGA := by
  intro h
  have h1 : from Susan = to Susan := by
    calc
      from Susan = LGA := h
      _ = to Susan := sus_to.symm
  exact (dep_ne_arr Susan) h1

-- Question 2 target: to John = LGA
-- We can prove its negation.
theorem not_q2 : to John ≠ LGA := by
  intro h
  have h1 : from John = to John := by
    calc
      from John = LGA := john_from
      _ = to John := h.symm
  exact (dep_ne_arr John) h1

Conclusions:
- Q1 (Susan flies from LGA airport): From to Susan = LGA and from ≠ to for any flight, it follows that from Susan ≠ LGA. Therefore the statement is false. False
- Q2 (John flies to LGA airport): From from John = LGA and from ≠ to for any flight, it follows that to John ≠ LGA. Therefore the statement is false. False

True
