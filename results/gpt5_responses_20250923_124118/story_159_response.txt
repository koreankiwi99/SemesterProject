axiom A1 : ∀ s : Person, Student s ∧ WantsLongVacation s → favorite s = Summer
axiom A2 : favorite Emma = Summer
axiom A3 : favorite Mia ≠ favorite Emma
axiom A4 : WantsLongVacation James

-- A consequence we can prove: Mia’s favorite is not Summer
lemma mia_not_summer : favorite Mia ≠ Summer := by
  intro h
  have : favorite Emma = Summer := A2
  -- From h and A2, we get favorite Mia = favorite Emma, contradicting A3
  have : favorite Mia = favorite Emma := by simpa [A2] using h

-- Target 1 (cannot be proved from given axioms without knowing James is a Student):
-- theorem q1 : favorite James = Summer := by
--   -- We would need Student James to use A1; not derivable from given axioms.

-- Target 2 (cannot be proved from given axioms; we only know Mia’s favorite ≠ Summer):
-- theorem q2 : favorite Mia = Spring := by
--   -- Not derivable; could be Fall or Winter as well.
