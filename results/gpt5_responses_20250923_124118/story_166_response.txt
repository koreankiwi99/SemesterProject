Story ID: 166
Premises: Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.

Here is a faithful Lean 4 formalization of the given scenario, together with attempted proofs of the three questions. I model buildings, people, animals, rents, deposits, and the relevant policies.

Lean code:

import Mathlib.Data.Nat.Basic

namespace Scenario

-- Basic domains
constant Person : Type

-- Facts from the text

-- Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
axiom some_managed_allows_pets : ∃ b : Building, Managed b ∧ AllowsPets b

-- A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
-- (We do not need to formalize mere "requirement" for these questions.)

-- The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
axiom deposit_at_least_rent : ∀ b : Building, Managed b → MonthlyRent b ≤ SecurityDeposit b

-- Fluffy is Tom's cat.
axiom fluffy_is_a_cat : Cat Fluffy

-- Cats are pets.
axiom cats_are_pets : ∀ a : Animal, Cat a → Pet a

-- The Olive Garden is a managed building.
axiom olive_is_managed : Managed OliveGarden

-- The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
axiom olive_rent_2000 : MonthlyRent OliveGarden = 2000

-- $2000 is more than $1500.
axiom two_thousand_gt_1500 : 1500 < 2000

-- Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy,
-- and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
axiom tom_rents_if_allowed_and_deposit_small :
  ∀ b : Building, Managed b →
    (AllowedMoveInWithPet Tom b Fluffy ∧ SecurityDeposit b ≤ 1500) →
    WillRent Tom b

-- If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.
axiom allows_pets_implies_allowed_move_in :
  ∀ b : Building, Managed b → AllowsPets b →
    ∀ p : Person, ∀ a : Animal, Pet a → AllowedMoveInWithPet p b a

-- Useful derived lemma: At Olive Garden, the deposit is at least 2000.
theorem deposit_at_least_2000 :
  2000 ≤ SecurityDeposit OliveGarden := by
  have h1 : MonthlyRent OliveGarden ≤ SecurityDeposit OliveGarden :=
    deposit_at_least_rent OliveGarden olive_is_managed
  simpa [olive_rent_2000] using h1

-- Useful derived lemma: The deposit at Olive Garden is not ≤ 1500.
theorem deposit_not_le_1500 :
  ¬ (SecurityDeposit OliveGarden ≤ 1500) := by
  -- From 1500 < 2000 and 2000 ≤ deposit, we get 1500 < deposit, hence not (deposit ≤ 1500).
  have hlt : 1500 < SecurityDeposit OliveGarden :=
    Nat.lt_of_lt_of_le two_thousand_gt_1500 deposit_at_least_2000
  exact Nat.not_le_of_lt hlt

-- Question 3 target: "The security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more."
-- This is naturally formalized as SecurityDeposit OliveGarden ≥ 2000, which we can prove.
theorem Q3 : 2000 ≤ SecurityDeposit OliveGarden :=
  deposit_at_least_2000

-- For Question 2, to prove Tom is allowed to move into Olive Garden with Fluffy,
-- we would need AllowsPets OliveGarden (plus Managed OliveGarden, which we have),
-- then use cats_are_pets to show Fluffy is a Pet, and apply allows_pets_implies_allowed_move_in.
-- But we only know that "some" managed building allows pets; we do not know it's Olive Garden.
-- Hence we cannot derive AllowedMoveInWithPet Tom OliveGarden Fluffy from the given axioms.

-- For Question 1, Tom's sufficient condition fails at Olive Garden because deposit ≤ 1500 is false,
-- but that does not let us conclude ¬ WillRent Tom OliveGarden (the rule is only one-way "if").
-- So we cannot prove WillRent Tom OliveGarden nor its negation from the given axioms.

end Scenario

Answers:

1) Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden.
Reasoning: The sufficient condition (allowed with Fluffy and deposit ≤ 1500) fails since the deposit at Olive Garden is ≥ 2000, but that does not imply he will not rent (no “only if” given). Therefore not provable either way. Unknown

2) Tom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy.
Reasoning: We only know some managed building allows pets; we do not know Olive Garden allows pets. Hence we cannot conclude allowance at Olive Garden. Unknown

3) The security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more.
Reasoning: From “deposit is at least the monthly rent” and “rent at Olive Garden is $2000”, we get deposit ≥ $2000. True
