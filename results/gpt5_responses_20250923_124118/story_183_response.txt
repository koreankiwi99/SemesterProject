Premises: If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z
Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.

Lean translation and attempted proofs:

-- We model people, predicates, and the named individuals.
universe u

constant Person : Type u
constant Man : Person → Prop
constant Taller : Person → Person → Prop          -- Taller x y means x is taller than y
constant CanBlock : Person → Person → Prop        -- CanBlock x y means x can block y's shooting
constant InMClass : Person → Prop                 -- InMClass y means y is in Michael's class
constant Jumps : Person → Prop                    -- Jumps y means y can jump when shooting
constant Great : Person → Prop                    -- Great y means y is a great shooter

-- Axioms extracted from the textual context.

-- 1) If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
axiom H_man_block :
  ∀ {x y : Person}, Man x → Man y → Taller x y → CanBlock x y

-- 2) Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
axiom H_Michael_man : Man Michael
axiom H_Michael_taller_class :
  ∀ {y : Person}, InMClass y → y ≠ Michael → Taller Michael y

-- 3) Taller is transitive.
axiom H_taller_trans :
  ∀ {x y z : Person}, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z

-- 4) Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
axiom H_Peter : Man Peter ∧ Taller Peter Michael

-- 5) Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
axiom H_Michael_blocks_if_not_jump :
  ∀ {p : Person}, ¬ Jumps p → CanBlock Michael p

-- 6) Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
axiom H_Michael_cannot_block_Windy : ¬ CanBlock Michael Windy

-- 7) Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.
axiom H_jump_implies_great : ∀ {p : Person}, Jumps p → Great p

-- A useful derived lemma: Peter is taller than every member of Michael's class.
lemma Peter_taller_of_Mclass {y : Person} (hc : InMClass y) : Taller Peter y := by
  classical
  by_cases h : y = Michael
  · -- y = Michael
    simpa [h] using H_Peter.right
  · -- y ≠ Michael
    exact H_taller_trans H_Peter.right (H_Michael_taller_class hc h)

-- Question 2: Windy is a great shooter.
-- Proof: From ¬CanBlock(Michael, Windy) and (¬Jumps → CanBlock), we get Jumps Windy.
-- Then by (Jumps → Great), Great Windy holds.
theorem Q2_Windy_is_great : Great Windy := by
  classical
  have hJ : Jumps Windy := by
    by_contra hNJ
    have : CanBlock Michael Windy := H_Michael_blocks_if_not_jump hNJ
    exact H_Michael_cannot_block_Windy this
  exact H_jump_implies_great hJ

-- Question 1 and Question 3 are not provable from the given axioms alone:
-- For Q1, although we can show Peter is taller than every member of Michael's class (lemma above),
-- we have not assumed asymmetry of Taller, so we cannot refute the existence of someone taller than Peter.
-- For Q3, we lack any height relation or gender info about Windy, so the blocking rule for "man taller than man"
-- cannot be applied, and nothing else implies Peter can block Windy.

Answers:
- Question 1: Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class. Unknown
