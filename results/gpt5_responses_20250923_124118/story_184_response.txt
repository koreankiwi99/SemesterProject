Lean translation and proofs:

universe u

constant Show : Type u
constant st : Show    -- "Stranger Things"
constant bm : Show    -- "Black Mirror"

-- Predicates about shows (with respect to Karen and Lisa where relevant)
constant popular  : Show → Prop
constant netflix  : Show → Prop
constant binge    : Show → Prop          -- Karen binge-watches the show
constant download : Show → Prop          -- Karen downloads the show
constant share    : Show → Prop          -- Karen shares the show with Lisa

-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom popular_st : popular st
axiom netflix_st : netflix st
axiom pop_netflix_implies_binge : ∀ s, (netflix s ∧ popular s) → binge s
axiom binge_iff_download_on_netflix : ∀ s, netflix s → (binge s ↔ download s)
axiom not_download_bm : ¬ download bm
axiom netflix_bm : netflix bm
axiom binge_implies_share_on_netflix : ∀ s, netflix s → (binge s → share s)

-- Q1: Karen will share "Stranger Things" with Lisa.
theorem Q1_share_st : share st := by
  have hbinge : binge st := by
    exact pop_netflix_implies_binge st ⟨netflix_st, popular_st⟩
  exact binge_implies_share_on_netflix st netflix_st hbinge

-- Helper: derive ¬ binge bm from the download biconditional and not_download_bm
lemma not_binge_bm : ¬ binge bm := by
  intro hb
  have hbiff : binge bm ↔ download bm := binge_iff_download_on_netflix bm netflix_bm
  have hd : download bm := (hbiff.mp) hb
  exact not_download_bm hd

-- Q2: "Black Mirror" is popular. We derive a contradiction, so it's false.
theorem Q2_not_popular_bm : ¬ popular bm := by
  intro hpop
  have hb : binge bm := pop_netflix_implies_binge bm ⟨netflix_bm, hpop⟩
  exact not_binge_bm hb

-- Q3: We cannot prove share bm nor its negation from the given axioms.
-- We do know ¬ binge bm, and only have (binge → share), so neither direction yields share bm or ¬ share bm.


Answers:
- Question 1: Yes, because Stranger Things is a popular Netflix show, so Karen binge-watches it, and then shares it with Lisa. True
- Question 2: No, because if it were popular (and it is a Netflix show), Karen would binge-watch it, which would imply she downloaded it, contradicting that she did not download it. False
- Question 3: Uncertain, because we only know that if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she shares it; here we know she does not binge-watch Black Mirror, but that does not imply she does not share it. Unknown

True
