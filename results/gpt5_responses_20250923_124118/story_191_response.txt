Story ID: 191
Premises: A natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.
If the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.
Machine translation is a natural language processing task.
The output of machine translation is a text sequence.

Lean translation and attempt at proof:

-- We model tasks and their properties
universe u
constant Thing : Type u

constant Task       : Thing → Prop           -- NLP task
constant LG         : Thing → Prop           -- language generation
constant LU         : Thing → Prop           -- language understanding
constant OutputText : Thing → Prop           -- outputs a text sequence

constant MT : Thing                           -- machine translation

-- Axioms from the textual context
axioms
  (ax1 : ∀ x, Task x → (LG x ∨ LU x))         -- every NLP task is either generation or understanding (possibly both)
  (ax2 : ∀ x, OutputText x → LG x)            -- if output is a text sequence, it is generation
  (ax3 : Task MT)                              -- machine translation is an NLP task
  (ax4 : OutputText MT)                        -- machine translation outputs a text sequence

-- Question 1: Machine translation is a language generation task.
theorem Q1 : LG MT :=
  ax2 MT ax4

-- Question 2: Machine translation is a language understanding task.
-- From the given axioms we have Task MT, hence LG MT ∨ LU MT by ax1.
-- Together with ax2 and ax4, we know LG MT holds. However, nothing given allows us to conclude LU MT,
-- nor to refute it. Therefore, this statement is not derivable from the axioms.
-- (No theorem provided; independence with respect to the given axioms.)
