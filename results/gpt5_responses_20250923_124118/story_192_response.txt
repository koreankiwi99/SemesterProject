Premises: International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
Mike is an international student.
Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.

Lean formalization attempt:

-- We work in a simple first-order setting with persons and predicates
universe u
constant Person : Type u
constant Mike : Person

-- Predicates
constant InternationalStudent : Person → Prop
constant InUS : Person → Prop
constant HasF1 : Person → Prop
constant HasJ1 : Person → Prop
constant WantsWorkUS : Person → Prop
constant NeedsCPT : Person → Prop
constant NeedsOPT : Person → Prop

-- Axioms from the text

-- 1) Every international student in the US has either an F1 or a J1 visa.
axiom intl_inUS_has_F1_or_J1 :
  ∀ p : Person, InternationalStudent p ∧ InUS p → HasF1 p ∨ HasJ1 p

-- 2) Any international student in the US with an F1 visa who wants to work in the US
--    needs to apply for CPT or OPT.
axiom F1_workers_need_CPT_or_OPT :
  ∀ p : Person, InternationalStudent p ∧ InUS p ∧ HasF1 p ∧ WantsWorkUS p → (NeedsCPT p ∨ NeedsOPT p)

-- 3) Mike is an international student.
axiom Mike_is_international : InternationalStudent Mike

-- 4) Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.
axiom Mike_wants_work_implies_needs_CPT : WantsWorkUS Mike → NeedsCPT Mike

-- Note:
-- We are NOT given InUS Mike, nor any statement that equates “NeedsCPT if wants to work”
-- with having an F1 visa. Thus, we cannot derive HasF1 Mike, nor HasJ1 Mike, from the axioms.

-- What we can prove: If Mike is in the US and has F1 and wants to work,
-- then (trivially) he needs CPT or OPT, which is already covered by the axioms.
