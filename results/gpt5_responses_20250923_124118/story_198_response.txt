-- Axioms from the textual context

-- 1) When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox.
axiom ax_occurs_implies_mayget : ∀ x : Being, OccursVirus x → MayGetMonkeypox x

-- 2) Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals. (Existence of some animals with the virus)
axiom ax_exists_animal_with_virus : ∃ x : Being, Animal x ∧ OccursVirus x

-- 3) Humans are mammals.
axiom ax_human_mammal : ∀ x : Being, Human x → Mammal x

-- 4) Mammals are animals.
axiom ax_mammal_animal : ∀ x : Being, Mammal x → Animal x

-- 5) Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.
axiom ax_monkeypox_symptoms :
  ∀ x : Being, HasMonkeypox x → Fever x ∧ Headache x ∧ MusclePain x ∧ Tired x

-- 6) People feel tired when they get the flu.
axiom ax_flu_tired : ∀ x : Being, Flu x → Tired x

-- Question 1: There is an animal.
theorem Q1 : ∃ x : Being, Animal x := by
  rcases ax_exists_animal_with_virus with ⟨x, hxA, _hxV⟩
  exact ⟨x, hxA⟩

-- Question 2: No one gets the flu. (i.e., ∀ x, ¬ Flu x)
theorem Q2 : ∀ x : Being, ¬ Flu x := by
  -- Not derivable from the given axioms.
  sorry

-- Question 3: Symptoms of Monkeypox include coughing. (i.e., ∀ x, HasMonkeypox x → Coughing x)
theorem Q3 : ∀ x : Being, HasMonkeypox x → Coughing x := by
  -- Not derivable from the given axioms.
  sorry

-- We proved Q1. We could not prove Q2 or Q3, nor their negations, from the given axioms.
