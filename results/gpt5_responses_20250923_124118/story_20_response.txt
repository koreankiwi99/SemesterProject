Answers:
1) Yes. From “sold more than one million copies” and “if a game sells more than one million copies, then it’s on the Top 10 list,” it follows that The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list. True
2) Uncertain. We have no information about FIFA 22’s sales or Top 10 status; thus we cannot conclude it is made by a Japanese company. Unknown
3) No. Since The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list, the statement that it is not on the Top 10 list is false. False
