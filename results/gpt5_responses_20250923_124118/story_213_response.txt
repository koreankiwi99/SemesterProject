Here is a Lean formalization of the scenario and proofs of what can be derived.

universe u

constant Language : Type u
constant Romance : Language → Prop
constant IndoEuro : Language → Prop
constant Related : Language → Language → Prop
constant French Spanish German Basque : Language

-- Premises:
-- 1) All Romance languages are Indo-European.
axiom A1 : ∀ x, Romance x → IndoEuro x

-- 2) Romance is a language family, and languages in a family are all related to each other.
--    We specialize this to: any two distinct Romance languages are related.
axiom A2 : ∀ x y, Romance x → Romance y → x ≠ y → Related x y

-- 3) French and Spanish are Romance languages.
axiom A3F : Romance French
axiom A3S : Romance Spanish

-- 4) German is related to Spanish.
axiom A4 : Related German Spanish

-- 5) Basque is not related to any other language (no relation from Basque to any distinct y).
axiom A5 : ∀ y, y ≠ Basque → ¬ Related Basque y

-- Distinctness of the named languages (needed to use “any other” rigorously)
axiom distinct_BF : Basque ≠ French
axiom distinct_BS : Basque ≠ Spanish

-- Q1 target: Basque is a Romance language. We prove its negation.
theorem Q1_false : ¬ Romance Basque := by
  intro hB
  have hRF : Related Basque French :=
    A2 Basque French hB A3F distinct_BF
  -- Need French ≠ Basque to use A5; derive from Basque ≠ French
  have hFB : French ≠ Basque := ne_comm.mp distinct_BF
  have hNRF : ¬ Related Basque French := A5 French hFB
  exact hNRF hRF

-- Q3 target: French is an Indo-European language. Directly from A1 and A3F.
theorem Q3_true : IndoEuro French :=
  A1 French A3F

-- For Q2 (German is a Romance language), neither Romance German nor its negation
-- follows from the given premises: being related to a Romance language does not imply being Romance.
