Lean translation of the premises:
- Let L, W, A, C, P be propositions meaning, respectively: George likes music, George wants to compose, George has access to a program, George can compose, George will compose.
- Assumptions:
  h1 : L → W
  h2 : A → C
  h3 : (C ∧ W) → P

Question 1: Target: (L ∧ A) → P.
Lean proof sketch:
- From L ∧ A, get L and A.
- From h1 and L, get W.
- From h2 and A, get C.
- From h3 and (C ∧ W), get P.

Therefore, the statement is provable.

Answer 1: True

Question 2: Target: (¬P) → (¬C).
From h3 we can contrapose to get ¬P → ¬(C ∧ W), which yields only ¬P → (¬C ∨ ¬W). This does not entail ¬C. Indeed, the premises are consistent with a situation where C is true, W is false, and P is false; in such a case ¬P → ¬C is false. On the other hand, if P is true, then ¬P → ¬C holds vacuously. Thus the statement is not derivable nor is its negation derivable from the given premises alone.

Answer 2: Unknown

Summary of Lean attempts:
- Q1 was proved from the premises. True
- Q2 could neither be proved nor refuted from the premises. Unknown
