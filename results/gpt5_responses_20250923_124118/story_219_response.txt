-- We model a simple domain of entities and predicates/relations.
universe u

constant Entity : Type u

-- Predicates
constant MusicPiece   : Entity → Prop
constant Composer     : Entity → Prop
constant Orchestra    : Entity → Prop
constant Conductor    : Entity → Prop

-- Relations
constant writes    : Entity → Entity → Prop      -- person writes piece
constant premiered : Entity → Entity → Prop      -- organization premiered piece
constant leads     : Entity → Entity → Prop      -- person leads organization

-- Named entities
constant Beethoven : Entity
constant VMS       : Entity                      -- Vienna Music Society
constant Sym9      : Entity                      -- Symphony No. 9

-- Facts from the textual context
axiom A1 : MusicPiece Sym9
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Composer x → ∃ y, MusicPiece y ∧ writes x y
axiom A3 : writes Beethoven Sym9
axiom A4 : premiered VMS Sym9
axiom A5 : Orchestra VMS
axiom A6 : leads Beethoven VMS
-- Orchestras are led by conductors: if someone leads an orchestra, they are a conductor.
axiom A7 : ∀ p o, leads p o → Orchestra o → Conductor p

-- Question 1: Is Beethoven a composer?
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive Composer Beethoven, nor its negation.

  -- Placeholder to indicate we do not have a proof of Composer Beethoven or its negation.
  -- We leave this as a trivial tautology to keep the environment consistent.
