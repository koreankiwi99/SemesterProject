Below is a Lean formalization of the given textual context, followed by formal statements and proofs (when possible) for each question.

Lean setup (shared context and axioms extracted from the text):
- We model Beijing as a city and introduce predicates for the relevant properties.
- We include the facts stated in the text as axioms.
- We also include a natural geography axiom that a city located in Northern China is not located in Southern China.

-- Universe and basic entities
universe u
constant City : Type u
constant Beijing : City

-- Predicates
constant CapitalOfPRC : City → Prop
constant CapitalOfMostPopulousNation : City → Prop
constant LocatedNorthernChina : City → Prop
constant LocatedSouthernChina : City → Prop
constant Hosted2008SummerOlympics : City → Prop
constant Hosted2008SummerParalympics : City → Prop
constant HostedWinterOlympics : City → Prop
constant HostedWinterParalympics : City → Prop
constant ManyTopUniversities : City → Prop

-- Facts from the text
axiom fact_capital_PRC : CapitalOfPRC Beijing
axiom fact_capital_most_populous : CapitalOfMostPopulousNation Beijing
axiom fact_loc_north : LocatedNorthernChina Beijing
axiom fact_host_2008_summer_olympics : Hosted2008SummerOlympics Beijing
axiom fact_host_2008_summer_paralympics : Hosted2008SummerParalympics Beijing
axiom fact_host_winter_olympics : HostedWinterOlympics Beijing
axiom fact_host_winter_paralympics : HostedWinterParalympics Beijing
axiom fact_many_top_universities : ManyTopUniversities Beijing

-- Background geography principle (disjointness of Northern vs Southern)
axiom north_not_south : ∀ c : City, LocatedNorthernChina c → ¬ LocatedSouthernChina c


Question 1
Natural language claim: “Beijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.”

Formalization in Lean:
def Q1 : Prop := Hosted2008SummerOlympics Beijing ∧ HostedWinterOlympics Beijing

Proof of Q1 from the axioms:
theorem Q1_true : Q1 :=
  And.intro fact_host_2008_summer_olympics fact_host_winter_olympics

Conclusion for Q1: True


Question 2
Natural language claim: “Beijing is located in southern China.”

Formalization in Lean:
def Q2 : Prop := LocatedSouthernChina Beijing

From the text we have LocatedNorthernChina Beijing, and by the geography axiom, that implies not LocatedSouthernChina Beijing. Hence we can prove ¬Q2.

theorem Q2_false : ¬ Q2 :=
  north_not_south Beijing fact_loc_north

Conclusion for Q2: False


Question 3
Natural language claim: “Beijing is the second largest Chinese city.”

We introduce the predicate but have no supporting facts in the provided text.

constant SecondLargestChineseCity : City → Prop
def Q3 : Prop := SecondLargestChineseCity Beijing

There is no information in the provided axioms to prove Q3 or its negation. Therefore, we cannot derive a proof of Q3 nor a proof of ¬Q3 from the given context.

Conclusion for Q3: Unknown

Final answers:
- Question 1: True
- Question 2: False
- Question 3: Unknown
