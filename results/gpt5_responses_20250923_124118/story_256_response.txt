Lean translation and attempt:

We model a universe U with predicates Cat, Mammal, Pet : U → Prop.

Premises:
- H1: ∀ x, Cat x → Mammal x        -- All cats are mammals
- H2: ∃ x, Pet x ∧ ¬ Mammal x       -- Some pets are not mammals

Claim to decide:
- C: ∀ x, Pet x → ¬ Cat x           -- No pets are cats

In general, C does not follow from H1 and H2. We can show this by constructing a countermodel in Lean where H1 and H2 hold but C fails.

Lean code:

-- A concrete countermodel showing the conclusion does not follow from the premises
theorem countermodel :
  ∃ (U : Type) (Cat Mammal Pet : U → Prop),
    (∀ x, Cat x → Mammal x) ∧
    (∃ x, Pet x ∧ ¬ Mammal x) ∧
    ¬ (∀ x, Pet x → ¬ Cat x) := by
  refine ⟨Bool, (fun b => b = true), (fun b => b = true), (fun _ => True), ?_, ?_, ?_⟩
  · -- All cats are mammals
    intro x hx; simpa [hx]
  · -- Some pet is not a mammal (take b = false)
    refine ⟨false, ?_, ?_⟩
    · exact True.intro
    · -- ¬ (false = true)
      intro h; cases h
  · -- The conclusion "no pets are cats" fails (since b = true is both a pet and a cat)
    intro h
    have hPt_imp := h true
    have hPet : True := True.intro
    have hCat : true = true := rfl
    have : False := (hPt_imp hPet) hCat
    exact this.elim

Explanation:
- This exhibits U = Bool with Mammal b := (b = true), Cat b := (b = true), Pet b := True.
- Then H1 holds trivially, H2 holds by b = false, but C fails because b = true is both a pet and a cat.

Therefore, from the given premises, the statement “No pets are cats” is not determined.
