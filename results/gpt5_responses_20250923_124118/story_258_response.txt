universe u

constant U : Type u
constant Human : U → Prop
constant Mortal : U → Prop
constant Greek : U → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : U, Human x → Mortal x          -- All humans are mortal.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : U, Greek x → Human x           -- All Greeks are humans.

-- From the axioms we can derive that all Greeks are mortal.
lemma Greeks_are_mortal : ∀ x : U, Greek x → Mortal x :=
  fun x hg => A1 x (A2 x hg)

-- If there exists a Greek, then some Greek is mortal.
theorem some_Greek_mortal_of_exists : (∃ x : U, Greek x) → (∃ x : U, Greek x ∧ Mortal x) :=
  fun ⟨x, hxG⟩ => ⟨x, And.intro hxG (Greeks_are_mortal x hxG)⟩

-- However, without assuming the existence of a Greek, we cannot prove ∃ x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x
-- from A1 and A2 alone, nor can we prove its negation. So the original statement
-- "Some Greeks are mortal" is not derivable from the given premises.
