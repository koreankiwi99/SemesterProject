Lean translation and attempt:

We formalize:
- Universe of discourse U : Type
- Predicates: Fir, Evergreen, Worship : U → Prop
- Premises:
  1) h1 : ∀ x, Fir x → Evergreen x
  2) h2 : ∃ x, Worship x ∧ Fir x
- Target statement (the “theorem” to try to prove): ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ Worship x

Lean code:

/- Setup -/
universe u

section

variable {U : Type u} (Fir Evergreen Worship : U → Prop)

-- Premises
variable (h1 : ∀ x, Fir x → Evergreen x)
variable (h2 : ∃ x, Worship x ∧ Fir x)

-- What we can derive: there exists an evergreen that is an object of worship.
lemma exists_evergreen_and_worship :
  ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ Worship x :=
by
  rcases h2 with ⟨x, hxW, hxF⟩
  have hxE : Evergreen x := h1 x hxF
  exact ⟨x, And.intro hxE hxW⟩

-- Target (claimed) conclusion: ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ Worship x
-- This does not follow from the premises in general.

end

/- Countermodel to show non-entailment (h1 and h2 true while the target is false) -/
section Countermodel

-- Take a one-element domain
def U₀ := Unit

-- Interpret all three predicates as always true
def Fir₀ (_ : U₀) : Prop := True
def Evergreen₀ (_ : U₀) : Prop := True
def Worship₀ (_ : U₀) : Prop := True

-- Premise 1 holds
theorem h1₀ : ∀ x, Fir₀ x → Evergreen₀ x :=
by
  intro x hx
  trivial

-- Premise 2 holds (there exists x with Worship and Fir)
theorem h2₀ : ∃ x, Worship₀ x ∧ Fir₀ x :=
by
  refine ⟨(), And.intro ?_ ?_⟩ <;> trivial

-- The target conclusion is false in this model
theorem target_false_in_model : ¬ (∃ x, Evergreen₀ x ∧ ¬ Worship₀ x) :=
by
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨x, hxE, hxNotW⟩
  -- But Worship₀ x is True by definition, contradiction
  exact hxNotW trivial

end

-- Summary: From the premises we can derive that some evergreen is an object of worship,
-- but there is a concrete model where the premises hold and the target conclusion fails.
-- Therefore, the statement is not entailed by the premises.
