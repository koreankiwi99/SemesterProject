Lean formalization and proof attempt

Informal predicates and assumptions:
- Universe: Event
- Predicates: happy : Event → Prop, sad : Event → Prop
- Assumptions:
  1) Exhaustive: ∀ e, happy e ∨ sad e
  2) Exclusive: ∀ e, ¬(happy e ∧ sad e)
  3) At least one happy event: ∃ e, happy e

Claim to check (Q1): ∀ e, sad e

In Lean:

universe u

variable (Event : Type u) (happy sad : Event → Prop)

theorem not_all_events_are_sad
  (exhaustive : ∀ e : Event, happy e ∨ sad e)
  (exclusive : ∀ e : Event, ¬ (happy e ∧ sad e))
  (exists_happy : ∃ e : Event, happy e) :
  ¬ (∀ e : Event, sad e) := by
  intro all_sad
  rcases exists_happy with ⟨e₀, he₀⟩
  have hs₀ : sad e₀ := all_sad e₀
  exact (exclusive e₀) ⟨he₀, hs₀⟩

This proves the negation of the statement “All events are sad,” given the assumptions (in particular, using exclusivity of “either … or”).
