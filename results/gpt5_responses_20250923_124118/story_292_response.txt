Lean translation and proof:

-- Domain and predicates
universe u
constant U : Type u
constants Bird Hawk Swims : U → Prop

-- Premises from the textual context
axiom hawk_never_swims : ∀ x : U, Hawk x → ¬ Swims x          -- "A hawk never swims."
axiom some_birds_are_hawks : ∃ x : U, Bird x ∧ Hawk x          -- "Some birds are hawks."

-- Target statement for Question 1: "All birds swim." i.e., ∀ x, Bird x → Swims x
-- We prove its negation from the premises.
theorem not_all_birds_swim : ¬ (∀ x : U, Bird x → Swims x) := by
  intro hAll
  rcases some_birds_are_hawks with ⟨x, hxB, hxH⟩
  have hx_not_swims : ¬ Swims x := hawk_never_swims x hxH
  have hx_swims : Swims x := hAll x hxB
  exact hx_not_swims hx_swims

-- (Optional) Derived consequence: there exists a bird that does not swim.
theorem exists_bird_not_swimming : ∃ x : U, Bird x ∧ ¬ Swims x := by
  rcases some_birds_are_hawks with ⟨x, hxB, hxH⟩
  exact ⟨x, hxB, hawk_never_swims x hxH⟩
