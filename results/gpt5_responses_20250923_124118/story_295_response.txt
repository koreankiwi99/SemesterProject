Lean translation and attempt:

We model a domain U with predicates Affection, Love, Positive : U → Prop.
Premises:
- h1 : ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Love x        -- “Some affection is love.”
- h2 : ∃ x, Love x ∧ Positive x         -- “Some love is positive.”
Conclusion to prove:
- ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x         -- “Some affection is positive.”

In general, this does not follow from the premises (the witnesses for the two existentials may be different). We can show a countermodel in Lean.

Lean code:

universe u
open Classical

-- The (unprovable) target sequent:
theorem desired (U : Type u) (Affection Love Positive : U → Prop)
  (h1 : ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Love x)
  (h2 : ∃ x, Love x ∧ Positive x) :
  ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x := by
  -- This is not derivable in general.
  sorry

lemma h2 : ∃ x, Love x ∧ Positive x := by

end Counter

theorem not_valid :
  ¬ (∀ (U : Type) (Affection Love Positive : U → Prop),
       (∃ x, Affection x ∧ Love x) →
       (∃ x, Love x ∧ Positive x) →
       (∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x)) := by
  intro h
  have hconcl := h Two Counter.Affection Counter.Love Counter.Positive Counter.h1 Counter.h2
  exact Counter.not_concl hconcl

Conclusion: The statement “Some affection is positive” is not entailed by the premises; it is consistent but not forced.
