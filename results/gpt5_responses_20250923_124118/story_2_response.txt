Story ID: 2
Premises: Billings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.
The state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.
White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.
The city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.
Any city in Butte is not in St Pierre.
A city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.

GPT-5 Full Response:
==================================================
Here is a Lean 4 formalization of the given context and the three questions, along with proofs where they are derivable from the premises.

namespace StatesCities

universe u

-- Basic types
constant City : Type u
constant State : Type u

-- Predicates and relations
constant InState : City → State → Prop
def SameState (c₁ c₂ : City) : Prop := ∃ s : State, InState c₁ s ∧ InState c₂ s

-- Named states and cities
constant Montana : State

constant Billings Butte Helena Missoula WhiteSulphurSprings StPierre Bismarck : City
constant Bristol Texarkana Texhoma UnionCity : City

-- Exceptional cities (allowed to be in more than one state)
constant Exceptional : City → Prop

-- Axioms extracted from the textual context

-- Billings is in Montana
axiom H_Billings_Montana : InState Billings Montana

-- Montana includes Butte, Helena, Missoula
axiom H_Butte_Montana   : InState Butte   Montana
axiom H_Helena_Montana  : InState Helena  Montana
axiom H_Missoula_Montana: InState Missoula Montana

-- White Sulphur Springs and Butte are in the same state
axiom H_WSS_Butte_same : SameState WhiteSulphurSprings Butte

-- St Pierre is not in Montana
axiom H_StPierre_not_Montana : ¬ InState StPierre Montana

-- Uniqueness of state for non-exceptional cities
axiom H_unique_state_nonexceptional :
  ∀ c : City, (¬ Exceptional c) → ∀ s₁ s₂ : State, InState c s₁ → InState c s₂ → s₁ = s₂

-- The cities here (that matter to our proofs) are not exceptional
axiom H_Butte_not_exceptional : ¬ Exceptional Butte
axiom H_StPierre_not_exceptional : ¬ Exceptional StPierre
axiom H_Missoula_not_exceptional : ¬ Exceptional Missoula

-- Question 1: Are Butte and St Pierre in the same state?
-- Formal target: ¬ SameState Butte StPierre
theorem Q1_false : ¬ SameState Butte StPierre :=
by
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨s, hB, hS⟩
  -- By uniqueness for Butte (non-exceptional), any state Butte is in must be Montana.
  have huniq := H_unique_state_nonexceptional Butte H_Butte_not_exceptional s Montana hB H_Butte_Montana
  -- So s = Montana, hence StPierre would be in Montana, contradiction.
  have : InState StPierre Montana := by simpa [huniq] using hS
  exact H_StPierre_not_Montana this

-- Question 2: Are St Pierre and Bismarck in the same state?
-- With the given information, there is no premise about Bismarck's state, so this is not derivable either way.
-- Hence we do not have a proof of SameState StPierre Bismarck nor of its negation from the provided axioms.

-- Question 3: Is Montana home to the city of Missoula?
-- Formal target: InState Missoula Montana
theorem Q3_true : InState Missoula Montana := H_Missoula_Montana

end StatesCities
