Here is a Lean 4 formalization of the setting and proofs for Questions 1 and 2. Question 3 cannot be derived (nor can its negation) from the given premises.

-- Lean 4 code

universe u

namespace Restaurants

-- Domain of discourse: restaurants
constant Restaurant : Type u

-- Predicates
constant Listed : Restaurant → Prop               -- listed in Yelp’s recommendations
constant ManyNeg : Restaurant → Prop              -- has received many negative reviews
constant RatingGT4 : Restaurant → Prop            -- rating greater than four
constant TakeOut : Restaurant → Prop              -- provides take-out service
constant Popular : Restaurant → Prop              -- popular among local residents

-- A specific restaurant: the Hamden Plaza Subway store
constant hps : Restaurant

-- Premises
axiom listed_no_manyneg : ∀ r : Restaurant, Listed r → ¬ ManyNeg r
axiom rating_implies_listed : ∀ r : Restaurant, RatingGT4 r → Listed r
axiom some_no_takeout_manyneg : ∃ r : Restaurant, ¬ TakeOut r ∧ ManyNeg r
axiom popular_implies_rating : ∀ r : Restaurant, Popular r → RatingGT4 r
axiom hps_rating_or_pop : RatingGT4 hps ∨ Popular hps

open Classical

-- From the last two axioms, we can deduce hps has rating > 4.
lemma hps_has_rating : RatingGT4 hps :=
  Or.elim hps_rating_or_pop
    (fun hr => hr)
    (fun hp => popular_implies_rating hps hp)

-- Therefore hps is listed, hence has not received many negative reviews.
lemma hps_not_manyneg : ¬ ManyNeg hps :=
  by
    have hlisted : Listed hps := rating_implies_listed hps hps_has_rating
    exact listed_no_manyneg hps hlisted

-- Question 1:
-- If hps provides take-out and receives many negative reviews,
-- then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out.
theorem Q1 :
  (TakeOut hps ∧ ManyNeg hps) → (RatingGT4 hps ∧ ¬ TakeOut hps) :=
by
  intro h
  refine And.intro ?left ?right
  · -- left: RatingGT4 hps
    exact hps_has_rating
  · -- right: ¬ TakeOut hps
    -- show TakeOut hps → False, using the contradiction with ManyNeg hps
    intro _
    exact hps_not_manyneg h.right

-- Question 2:
-- hps provides take-out service or does not receive many negative reviews.
theorem Q2 : TakeOut hps ∨ ¬ ManyNeg hps :=
  Or.inr hps_not_manyneg

-- Note on Question 3:
-- From the given premises we cannot deduce ¬ TakeOut hps, nor can we deduce TakeOut hps.
-- Hence neither the statement nor its negation is provable from the assumptions.
