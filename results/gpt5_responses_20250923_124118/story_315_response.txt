Premises: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. 
If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.

Here is a Lean 4 formalization of the given context and the three questions. I include some derived consequences that do follow, and then (unsuccessfully) attempt to prove each queried statement; none of the three statements nor their negations are derivable from the premises.

Lean code (translation and attempted proofs):

import Std.Logic

universe u

constant Car : Type u

-- Predicates
constant TransportMultiplePassengers : Car → Prop
constant OneSeater                  : Car → Prop
constant TeslaModel3                : Car → Prop
constant SingleSeatElectricCar      : Car → Prop
constant SoloEV                     : Car → Prop

-- A specific car: John's car
constant j : Car

-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Car, TransportMultiplePassengers x → ¬ OneSeater x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Car, TeslaModel3 x → TransportMultiplePassengers x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Car, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Car, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x
axiom A5 : (¬ TeslaModel3 j) → ((¬ TeslaModel3 j) ∨ SingleSeatElectricCar j)

-- Some derived consequences that do follow
lemma Tesla_not_oneSeater : ∀ x, TeslaModel3 x → ¬ OneSeater x :=
  by
    intro x hT
    have hTMP : TransportMultiplePassengers x := A2 x hT
    exact A1 x hTMP

lemma SoloEV_oneSeater : ∀ x, SoloEV x → OneSeater x :=
  by
    intro x hSolo
    have hSSEC : SingleSeatElectricCar x := A4 x hSolo
    exact A3 x hSSEC

-- Question 1: Is John's car a Tesla Model 3?
-- Attempt to prove: TeslaModel3 j
theorem Q1 : TeslaModel3 j :=
  by
    -- Not derivable from the given axioms
    admit

-- Attempt to prove its negation
theorem not_Q1 : ¬ TeslaModel3 j :=
  by
    -- Also not derivable from the given axioms
    admit

-- Question 2: Is John's car a Solo EV?
-- Attempt to prove: SoloEV j
theorem Q2 : SoloEV j :=
  by
    -- Not derivable from the given axioms
    admit

-- Attempt to prove its negation
theorem not_Q2 : ¬ SoloEV j :=
  by
    -- Also not derivable from the given axioms
    admit

-- Question 3: Is it the case that John's car is not a Solo EV?
-- Attempt to prove: ¬ SoloEV j
theorem Q3 : ¬ SoloEV j :=
  by
    -- Not derivable from the given axioms
    admit

-- Attempt to prove its negation
theorem not_Q3 : SoloEV j :=
  by
    -- Also not derivable from the given axioms
    admit

Explanations:
- From the premises we can derive useful chains like:
  - TeslaModel3 x → TransportMultiplePassengers x → ¬OneSeater x.
  - SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x.
- However, there is no premise that tells us anything specific about John’s car being a Tesla Model 3 or a Solo EV.
- The fifth premise (¬T(j)) → ((¬T(j)) ∨ SSEC(j)) is a tautological implication and does not give new information about j.

Answers:
- Question 1: Unknown
- Question 2: Unknown
- Question 3: Unknown
