Here is a Lean formalization of the problem and proofs of what can be derived.

Lean code:

-- We work in classical logic for case analysis and contraposition
open Classical

universe u

-- Domain and predicates
variable (U : Type u)
variable (BakedSweet Spicy Cupcake MalaHotpot FromBBM : U → Prop)
variable (DTC : U)

-- Axioms from the textual context
variable
  (h1 : ∀ x, BakedSweet x → ¬ Spicy x)                -- No baked sweets are spicy
  (h2 : ∀ x, Cupcake x → BakedSweet x)                -- All cupcakes are baked sweets
  (h3 : ∀ x, MalaHotpot x → Spicy x)                  -- All mala hotpots are spicy
  (h4 : ∀ x, FromBBM x → Cupcake x)                   -- All products from BBM are cupcakes
  (h5 : Spicy DTC ∨ MalaHotpot DTC ∨ ¬ BakedSweet DTC) -- Dried Thai chilies: S ∨ M ∨ ¬B

-- Useful derived lemma: Spicy implies not BakedSweet (by contraposition of h1)
lemma spicy_implies_not_baked (x : U) (hs : Spicy x) : ¬ BakedSweet x := by
  intro hb
  have hnS : ¬ Spicy x := h1 x hb
  exact hnS hs

-- From the disjunction about DTC, we can conclude DTC is not a baked sweet
lemma not_baked_DTC : ¬ BakedSweet DTC := by
  rcases h5 with hS | hM | hNB
  · exact spicy_implies_not_baked U BakedSweet Spicy Cupcake MalaHotpot FromBBM DTC h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 DTC hS
  · have hS' : Spicy DTC := h3 DTC hM
    exact spicy_implies_not_baked U BakedSweet Spicy Cupcake MalaHotpot FromBBM DTC h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 DTC hS'
  · exact hNB

-- From not_baked_DTC and BBM→Cupcake→BakedSweet, we get DTC is not from BBM
lemma not_fromBBM_DTC : ¬ FromBBM DTC := by
  intro hF
  have hC : Cupcake DTC := h4 DTC hF
  have hB : BakedSweet DTC := h2 DTC hC
  exact not_baked_DTC U BakedSweet Spicy Cupcake MalaHotpot FromBBM DTC h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 hB

-- Q1: Dried Thai chilies are products of Baked by Melissa. (False)
-- We can prove the negation: ¬ FromBBM DTC.
theorem Q1_false : ¬ FromBBM DTC :=
  not_fromBBM_DTC U BakedSweet Spicy Cupcake MalaHotpot FromBBM DTC h1 h2 h3 h4 h5

-- Q2: Dried Thai chilies are not products of Baked by Melissa. (True)
theorem Q2_true : ¬ FromBBM DTC :=
  not_fromBBM_DTC U BakedSweet Spicy Cupcake MalaHotpot FromBBM DTC h1 h2 h3 h4 h5

-- Q3: Dried Thai chilies are a mala hotpot. (Unknown: neither provable nor refutable from the given axioms)
-- No theorem provided: both MalaHotpot DTC and ¬ MalaHotpot DTC are consistent with the axioms.

-- Q4: Dried Thai chilies are neither products of Baked by Melissa nor baked sweets. (True)
theorem Q4_true : ¬ FromBBM DTC ∧ ¬ BakedSweet DTC := by
  exact And.intro
    (not_fromBBM_DTC U BakedSweet Spicy Cupcake MalaHotpot FromBBM DTC h1 h2 h3 h4 h5)
    (not_baked_DTC U BakedSweet Spicy Cupcake MalaHotpot FromBBM DTC h1 h2 h3 h4 h5)

-- Q5: Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes and products of Baked by Melissa. (False)
-- Since ¬ FromBBM DTC, the conjunction Cupcake DTC ∧ FromBBM DTC is false.
theorem Q5_false : ¬ (Cupcake DTC ∧ FromBBM DTC) := by
  intro h
  exact (Q1_false U BakedSweet Spicy Cupcake MalaHotpot FromBBM DTC h1 h2 h3 h4 h5) h.right
