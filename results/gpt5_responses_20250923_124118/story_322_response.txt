Premises: All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.

Here is a Lean 4 formalization of the problem and proofs.

Lean code:

section

universe u

constant Entity : Type u
constant Stock Growth Bought Suitable Mature Volatile : Entity → Prop
constant KO : Entity

-- Premises
axiom A1 : ∀ x, (Stock x ∧ Growth x) → Bought x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Bought x → ¬ Suitable x
axiom A3 : ∃ x, Stock x ∧ Growth x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, (Stock x ∧ Mature x) → Suitable x
axiom A5 : Stock KO ∧ Mature KO

-- Useful derived facts
lemma KO_stock : Stock KO := A5.left
lemma KO_mature : Mature KO := A5.right
lemma KO_suitable : Suitable KO := A4 KO ⟨KO_stock, KO_mature⟩

lemma not_KO_growth : ¬ Growth KO := by
  intro hG
  have hB : Bought KO := A1 KO ⟨KO_stock, hG⟩
  have hNotS : ¬ Suitable KO := A2 KO hB
  exact hNotS KO_suitable

lemma not_KO_bought : ¬ Bought KO := by
  intro hB
  have hNotS : ¬ Suitable KO := A2 KO hB
  exact hNotS KO_suitable

-- Question 1: KO is a stock.
-- Provable directly from A5.
theorem Q1 : Stock KO := KO_stock

-- Question 2: KO is a stock and a growth stock.
-- This is false because KO is not a growth stock (as shown above).
theorem Q2_false : ¬ (Stock KO ∧ Growth KO) := by
  intro h
  exact not_KO_growth h.right

-- Question 3: If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation,
-- then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.
-- The antecedent is impossible (both disjuncts are false), so the implication holds vacuously.
theorem Q3 : (Growth KO ∨ Bought KO) → (¬ Stock KO ∧ ¬ Volatile KO) := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hG => exact (False.elim ((not_KO_growth) hG))
  | inr hB => exact (False.elim ((not_KO_bought) hB))

end

Answers:

1) True
