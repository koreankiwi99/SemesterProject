Here is a faithful Lean formalization of the predicates and premises, followed by attempts to derive the four queried statements.

Lean formalization:

-- We work in an arbitrary nonempty type of people, with a distinguished constant John.
universe u

constant Person : Type u
constant John : Person

-- Predicates:
-- M x: x makes wedding plans
-- E x: x is engaged
-- I x: x invites others to come to their ceremony
-- W x: x has a well-attended wedding
-- L x: x has a larger family
-- F x: x invites friends to their ceremony
constant M E I W L F : Person → Prop

-- Axioms (from the textual context):
axiom A1 : ∀ x, M x → E x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, I x → M x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, W x → I x
axiom A4 : ∃ x, W x ∧ L x
axiom A5 : E John → ¬ (F John ∧ M John)
axiom A6 : L John → (W John ∨ F John)

-- Useful derived facts:
lemma I_implies_E : ∀ x, I x → E x :=
by
  intro x hx
  exact A1 x (A2 x hx)

lemma W_implies_E : ∀ x, W x → E x :=
by
  intro x hx
  exact I_implies_E x (A3 x hx)

-- Targets (questions):
-- Q1: L John
-- Q2: ¬ L John
-- Q3: E John
-- Q4: (¬ L John) ∧ (¬ I John)

-- Attempts:
-- From the given axioms, none of Q1–Q4 (nor their negations) can be derived directly.
-- In particular:
-- • A4 only asserts the existence of some person with W ∧ L, not necessarily John.
-- • The chain W → I → M → E applies to whoever has W, but we have no premise that John has W.
-- • A6 only gives that if L John then (W John ∨ F John); this does not force L John.
-- • A5 is a conditional that constrains John if he is engaged; it does not assert that he is engaged.

-- Therefore, we cannot prove any of Q1–Q4 or their negations from A1–A6.

Explanation and answers:

- From A2 and A1, anyone who invites others (I x) is engaged (E x).
- From A3, anyone with a well-attended wedding (W x) invites others (I x), hence is engaged (E x).
- A4 gives existence of someone with both W and L, but does not identify that person as John.
- A6 says: if John has a larger family (L John), then John either has a well-attended wedding (W John) or invites friends (F John). This does not establish L John.
- A5 says: if John is engaged, then not (F John ∧ M John). This does not establish that John is engaged.

Consequently, none of the queried statements is derivable, and neither is any of their negations.
