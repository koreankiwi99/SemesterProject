-- Axioms from the text
axiom A1 : ∀ x, Mixer x → (GrandSlamChampion x ∨ OscarNominatedActor x)
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Mixer x → GrandSlamChampion x → ProfessionalTennisPlayer x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, Mixer x → OscarNominatedActor x → Celebrity x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, Mixer x → ProfessionalTennisPlayer x → Athlete x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, Mixer x → Celebrity x → WellPaid x
axiom A6 : ∀ x, Mixer x → Athlete x → Famous x
axiom A7 : ∀ x, Mixer x → WellPaid x → TaxHaven x

-- Djokovic is at the mixer
axiom Dj_at : Mixer Djokovic

-- Extra conditional: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid
axiom Dj_FA_implies_WP : (Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic) → WellPaid Djokovic

-- From the axioms, Djokovic lives in a tax haven
theorem Djokovic_tax_haven : TaxHaven Djokovic := by
  have DJM : Mixer Djokovic := Dj_at
  have disj := A1 Djokovic DJM
  cases disj with
  | inl djGSC =>
      have djPTP : ProfessionalTennisPlayer Djokovic := A2 Djokovic DJM djGSC
      have djAth : Athlete Djokovic := A4 Djokovic DJM djPTP
      have djFam : Famous Djokovic := A6 Djokovic DJM djAth
      have djWP  : WellPaid Djokovic := Dj_FA_implies_WP ⟨djFam, djAth⟩

  | inr djONA =>
      have djCel : Celebrity Djokovic := A3 Djokovic DJM djONA
      have djWP  : WellPaid Djokovic := A5 Djokovic DJM djCel
      exact A7 Djokovic DJM djWP

-- Consequently, the statement "Djokovic does not live in a tax haven" is false
theorem not_not_Djokovic_tax_haven : ¬ (¬ TaxHaven Djokovic) := by
