-- Types and predicates
universe u
constant Obj : Type u
constant Digital : Obj → Prop
constant Analog : Obj → Prop
constant Printed : Obj → Prop
constant Streaming : Obj → Prop
constant Hardcover : Obj → Prop
constant e1984 : Obj

-- Premises
axiom H1 : ∀ x : Obj, Digital x → ¬ Analog x                          -- No digital media are analog
axiom H2 : ∀ x : Obj, Printed x → Analog x                           -- Every printed text is analog media
axiom H3 : ∀ x : Obj, Streaming x → Digital x                        -- All streaming services are digital media
axiom H4 : ∀ x : Obj, Hardcover x → Printed x                        -- If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text
axiom H5 : Streaming e1984 → Hardcover e1984                         -- If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book

-- Consequences
-- From Streaming e1984 we derive a contradiction, hence ¬ Streaming e1984
theorem not_streaming_1984 : ¬ Streaming e1984 := by
  intro s
  have d : Digital e1984 := H3 e1984 s
  have hc : Hardcover e1984 := H5 s
  have p : Printed e1984 := H4 e1984 hc
  have a : Analog e1984 := H2 e1984 p
  have na : ¬ Analog e1984 := H1 e1984 d
  exact na a

-- Hence "1984 is a streaming service" is false, and "1984 is not a streaming service" is true
theorem q2_false : ¬ Streaming e1984 := not_streaming_1984
theorem q3_true  : ¬ Streaming e1984 := not_streaming_1984

-- We cannot derive Printed e1984 from the premises (we only get Streaming → Printed and ¬Streaming),
-- nor can we derive ¬ Printed e1984. Thus its truth value is undetermined from the given information.
