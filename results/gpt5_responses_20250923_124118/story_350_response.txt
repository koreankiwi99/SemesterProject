Premises: All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.

Here is a faithful first-order formalization. We use a single domain of objects (styles/designs), and unary predicates to mark properties.

Lean 4 code (translation of the premises and the three queried statements):

-- Universe of things (styles/designs)
universe u
constant Obj : Type u

-- Predicates
constant Zaha Kelly Brutalist Interesting Evocative Dreamy DesignByMax Adored : Obj → Prop

-- Premises
constant H1 : ∀ x, Zaha x ∧ Adored x → Interesting x
constant H2 : ∀ x, Brutalist x ∧ Adored x → ¬ Interesting x
constant H3 : ∀ x, Adored x → Zaha x ∨ Kelly x
constant H4 : ∀ x, Kelly x ∧ Adored x → Evocative x
constant H5 : ∀ x, Kelly x ∧ Adored x → Dreamy x
constant H6 : ∀ x, DesignByMax x ∧ Adored x ∧ Interesting x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- The three questions, formalized as existential claims about some design by Max
def Q1 : Prop := ∃ x, DesignByMax x ∧ Brutalist x
def Q2 : Prop := ∃ x, DesignByMax x ∧ Evocative x ∧ Dreamy x
def Q3 : Prop := ∃ x, DesignByMax x ∧ (Evocative x ∨ Dreamy x)

-- Note: From H1–H6 alone, none of Q1, Q2, Q3 is derivable, nor is its negation.


Reasoning and answers:

- About existence: The premises never assert that there exists any object that is a design by Max, nor any object that Max adores. So none of the existential statements Q1–Q3 can be forced true from the premises alone. They also cannot be forced false, because the premises are consistent with a model where there is such an object (e.g., an adored Kelly design by Max that is evocative and dreamy but not interesting or brutalist).

- Interaction of constraints:
  - If an adored object is Zaha, H1 makes it interesting; if it is also a design by Max, H6 makes it brutalist and evocative; then H2 would forbid it from being interesting. Hence there cannot be an adored-by-Max Zaha object that is also a design by Max and interesting. This shows some combinations are ruled out, but it still does not create any existence.

Therefore:

Question 1: A design by Max is a brutalist building.
Answer: Unknown

Question 2: A design by Max is evocative and dreamy.
Answer: Unknown

Question 3: A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy.
Answer: Unknown
