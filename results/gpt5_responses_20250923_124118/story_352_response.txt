  intro h
  exact not_private_H h.right

-- Q3: the implication is true (indeed, both disjuncts hold under the antecedent)
theorem q3_true : PrivateCompany H → (HasLegalObligations H ∨ CreatedUnderLaw H) := by
  intro hp
  have hob : HasLegalObligations H := private_implies_obligations H hp
  -- alternatively we could use CreatedUnderLaw H := private_implies_created H hp
  exact Or.inl hob

-- Q1 cannot be proved from the given axioms, nor can its negation, since we have no premise making H a legal entity (or otherwise linking H to obligations) without assuming it is a private company, which we showed is impossible. So Q1 remains undetermined here.

Answers:
- Q1: We cannot derive that the Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations, nor its negation, from the premises. Unknown
- Q2: From the premises we derive ¬ PrivateCompany H, so the conjunction “has legal obligations and is a private company” is false. False
- Q3: If it is a private company, then it is a legal entity, hence both created under law and has legal obligations; therefore the “either … or …” statement holds. True
