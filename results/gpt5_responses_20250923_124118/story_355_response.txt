Premises: All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.
All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.
All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.

Lean translation and attempted proof:

universe u

constant Person : Type u
constants (S C H N D G : Person → Prop)  -- S: eats salads; C: very conscious; H: health-conscious home; N: fulfills nutrition; D: disregards physical well-being; G: visits gym daily
constant t : Person  -- Taylor

axioms
  (h1 : ∀ x, S x → C x)
  (h2 : ∀ x, H x → S x)
  (h3 : ∀ x, N x → H x)
  (h4 : ∀ x, D x → ¬ C x)
  (h5 : ∀ x, G x → N x)
  (h6 : (H t ∧ D t) ∨ (¬ H t ∧ ¬ D t))  -- “either both, or neither”

lemma not_HD : ¬ (H t ∧ D t) := by
  intro h
  have ht : H t := h.left
  have dt : D t := h.right
  have st : S t := h2 t ht
  have ct : C t := h1 t st
  have nct : ¬ C t := h4 t dt
  exact nct ct

lemma notH_notD : ¬ H t ∧ ¬ D t := by
  cases h6 with
  | inl hhd =>
      exact False.elim (not_HD hhd)   -- the first disjunct is impossible
  | inr hnot =>
      exact hnot

-- From the lemmas we have proved:
-- 1) ¬ H t and ¬ D t.
-- Consequences:
-- - We cannot derive S t (need H t or other info).
-- - We cannot derive G t, nor ¬ G t.
-- - We can derive ¬ H t, but know nothing about G t, so ¬ H t ∧ ¬ G t is not provable.

Reasoning summary:
- If H then S, and if S then C. If D then ¬C. Hence H ∧ D is impossible.
- Given (H ∧ D) ∨ (¬H ∧ ¬D), only the second disjunct can hold, so ¬H and ¬D.
- Nothing links ¬H or ¬D to S or G, so S t and G t remain undetermined; likewise ¬G t is undetermined.
