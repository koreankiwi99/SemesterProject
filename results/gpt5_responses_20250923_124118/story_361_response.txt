Premises: If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly

Lean translation and attempt

We model people and predicates:
- Spill x: x spills a lot of food on their clothing
- Tidy x: x is notably tidy
- Cleanly x: x is cleanly
- Values x: x values order and spotlessness
- Family x: x’s family prioritizes order and spotlessness
- Clumsy x: x is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try
- Peter: a specific person

Lean code:

-- Axioms (from the textual context)
axiom spill_imp_not_tidy   : ∀ x : Person, Spill x → ¬ Tidy x
axiom clumsy_imp_spill     : ∀ x : Person, Clumsy x → Spill x
axiom cleanly_imp_tidy     : ∀ x : Person, Cleanly x → Tidy x
axiom values_imp_cleanly   : ∀ x : Person, Values x → Cleanly x
axiom family_imp_values    : ∀ x : Person, Family x → Values x
axiom peter_either         :
  (Spill Peter ∧ Cleanly Peter) ∨ (¬ Spill Peter ∧ ¬ Cleanly Peter)

-- Consequences we can prove
lemma no_spill_and_cleanly (x : Person) : ¬ (Spill x ∧ Cleanly x) :=

  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨hxS, hxC⟩
  have hxT : Tidy x := cleanly_imp_tidy x hxC
  have hxNotT : ¬ Tidy x := spill_imp_not_tidy x hxS
  exact hxNotT hxT

lemma peter_not_spill_and_not_cleanly : ¬ Spill Peter ∧ ¬ Cleanly Peter :=

  rcases peter_either with h | h
  · exact False.elim (no_spill_and_cleanly Peter h)

Discussion:
- From the axioms, (Spill x ∧ Cleanly x) is impossible for any x, hence for Peter. Therefore, from the given disjunction about Peter, we can conclude ¬Spill Peter ∧ ¬Cleanly Peter.
- However, Cleanly → Tidy does not let us infer anything from ¬Cleanly about Tidy; and Spill → ¬Tidy does not let us infer anything from ¬Spill about Tidy.
- We have no information connecting Peter to Clumsy or Family, so we cannot establish the disjunctions/equivalences in Q2 and Q3.

Answers:
- Question 1: Peter is notably tidy. Unknown
- Question 2: Peter is either a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or he is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness. Unknown
- Question 3: Peter is either both a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and is someone whose family prioritizes order and spotlessness, or he neither is a clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor does his family prioritize order and spotlessness. Unknown
