Here is a faithful translation of the natural-language premises into Lean, along with derived consequences and proofs for Questions 2 and 3. For Question 1, neither the statement nor its negation is derivable from the given axioms.

Lean code:

universe u

constant U : Type u

-- Predicates
constant Hydrocarbon : U → Prop
constant Organic : U → Prop
constant Alkane : U → Prop
constant ChemicalCompound : U → Prop
constant ContainsCarbon : U → Prop
constant OneElement : U → Prop

-- The designated object
constant mixture : U

-- Axioms from the text
axiom ax1 : ∀ x, Hydrocarbon x → Organic x
axiom ax2 : ∀ x, Alkane x → Hydrocarbon x
axiom ax3 : ∀ x, Organic x → ChemicalCompound x
axiom ax4 : ∀ x, Organic x → ContainsCarbon x
axiom ax5 : ∀ x, ChemicalCompound x → ¬ OneElement x
-- “either both … or neither”:
axiom ax6 : (ChemicalCompound mixture ∧ OneElement mixture) ∨ (¬ ChemicalCompound mixture ∧ ¬ OneElement mixture)

-- Basic consequences about the mixture
lemma not_CC_mixture : ¬ ChemicalCompound mixture := by
  have h := ax6
  cases h with
  | inl h1 =>
    -- h1 : ChemicalCompound mixture ∧ OneElement mixture
    have hcc : ChemicalCompound mixture := h1.left
    have hone : OneElement mixture := h1.right
    have : ¬ OneElement mixture := ax5 mixture hcc
    exact this.elim hone
  | inr h2 =>
    -- h2 : ¬ ChemicalCompound mixture ∧ ¬ OneElement mixture
    exact h2.left

lemma not_one_mixture : ¬ OneElement mixture := by
  have h := ax6
  cases h with
  | inl h1 =>
    -- As above this branch is impossible; derive contradiction and then anything
    have hcc : ChemicalCompound mixture := h1.left
    have hone : OneElement mixture := h1.right
    have : ¬ OneElement mixture := ax5 mixture hcc
    exact this.elim hone
  | inr h2 =>
    exact h2.right

lemma alkane_implies_CC : ∀ x, Alkane x → ChemicalCompound x := by
  intro x ha
  exact ax3 x (ax1 x (ax2 x ha))

lemma not_alkane_mixture : ¬ Alkane mixture := by
  intro hA
  exact not_CC_mixture (alkane_implies_CC mixture hA)

-- Q2: “The mixture is an alkane and contains carbon.” This is false.
theorem Q2_false : ¬ (Alkane mixture ∧ ContainsCarbon mixture) := by
  intro h
  exact not_alkane_mixture h.left

-- Q3: “If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon,
-- then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane.” This is true.
theorem Q3_true :
  (OneElement mixture ∨ ContainsCarbon mixture) →
  (¬ ChemicalCompound mixture ∧ ¬ Alkane mixture) := by
  intro _
  exact And.intro not_CC_mixture not_alkane_mixture

-- Note: From the given axioms, we can neither prove ContainsCarbon mixture
-- nor its negation, since we have no premise making the mixture organic (or otherwise relating it to carbon).

- Question 1: The mixture contains carbon. Unknown
- Question 2: The mixture is an alkane and contains carbon. False
- Question 3: If the mixture contains only one element or contains carbon, then the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor an alkane. True
