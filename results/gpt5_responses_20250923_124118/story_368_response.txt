  (h1 : ∀ x, S x ∧ J x → M x)                  -- If at Mary's school and works in student job, then needs money
  (h2 : ∀ x, S x ∧ T x → J x)                  -- If at Mary's school and orders takeout, then works in student job
  (h3 : ∀ x, S x → (T x ∨ E x))                -- If at Mary's school, then orders takeout or enjoys dining hall
  (h4 : ∀ x, S x ∧ E x → ¬ P x)                -- If at Mary's school and enjoys dining hall, then not picky
  (h5 : ∀ x, S x ∧ E x → D x)                  -- If at Mary's school and enjoys dining hall, then spends time in dining halls

  (hImp : M h → (¬ P h ∧ ¬ M h))               -- If Hannah needs money, then she is not picky and does not need money

-- Question 1: Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.
theorem q1 : M h :=
  h1 h ⟨hS, hJ⟩

-- (Note: From hImp and q1 we also get ¬ M h, so the premises are inconsistent.)

-- Question 2: Hannah is at Mary's school and she is not a picky eater and spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.
theorem q2 : S h ∧ ¬ P h ∧ D h := by
  have hm : M h := q1
  have hnp : ¬ P h := (hImp hm).left
  have hnotm : ¬ M h := (hImp hm).right
  have absurd : False := hnotm hm
  exact And.intro hS (And.intro hnp (False.elim absurd))

-- Question 3: Hannah is at Mary's school and she either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls.
theorem q3 : S h ∧ (¬ P h ∨ (P h → D h)) := by
  have hm : M h := q1
  have hnp : ¬ P h := (hImp hm).left
