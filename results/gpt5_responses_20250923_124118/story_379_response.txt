Premises: People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.
If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.
If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. 
Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers

-- Axioms from the text
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, BornMultiple x → SpendTimeWithSibs x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, HaveSibsBornTogether x → BornMultiple x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, ComplainOften x → HaveSibsBornTogether x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, LiveAtHome x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, SpendTimeWithSibs x → LiveAtHome x
-- Disjunction about Luke
axiom A6 : (BornMultiple Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) ∨ (¬ BornMultiple Luke ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke)

-- Consequences about Luke

-- Rule chain: BornMultiple → SpendTime → LiveAtHome → ¬ LiveWithStrangers
lemma born_multiple_implies_not_strangers (x : Person) :
    BornMultiple x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x :=
by
  intro hbm
  have hst : SpendTimeWithSibs x := A1 x hbm
  have hhome : LiveAtHome x := A5 x hst
  exact A4 x hhome

-- From A6 and the above, deduce the second disjunct must hold

    ¬ BornMultiple Luke ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke :=
by
  rcases A6 with h | h
  · rcases h with ⟨hb, hs⟩
    have : ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke := born_multiple_implies_not_strangers Luke hb

lemma luke_not_born_multiple : ¬ BornMultiple Luke :=
  (luke_not_born_multiple_and_not_strangers).left

lemma luke_not_live_with_strangers : ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke :=
  (luke_not_born_multiple_and_not_strangers).right

-- From ComplainOften → HaveSibsBornTogether → BornMultiple, and ¬ BornMultiple Luke, we get ¬ ComplainOften Luke
lemma complain_implies_born_multiple (x : Person) :
    ComplainOften x → BornMultiple x :=
by
  intro hc

-- What we can (and cannot) prove for the questions:
-- Q1 asks for SpendTimeWithSibs Luke. From the axioms we cannot derive SpendTimeWithSibs Luke,
-- nor its negation, so it remains undetermined in this theory.
-- Q2 asks for ComplainOften Luke. We proved ¬ ComplainOften Luke.
-- Q3 asks for (¬ BornMultiple Luke ∧ ¬ ComplainOften Luke). We proved both conjuncts.

-- For convenience, we package Q2 and Q3:
theorem Q2_false : ¬ ComplainOften Luke := luke_not_complain_often
theorem Q3_true : (¬ BornMultiple Luke ∧ ¬ ComplainOften Luke) :=
  And.intro luke_not_born_multiple luke_not_complain_often


Answers:
1) Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings. Unknown
2) Luke complains often about annoying siblings. False
3) Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings. True
