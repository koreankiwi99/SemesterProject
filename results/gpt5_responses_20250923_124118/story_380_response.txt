-- From Bonnie_link, derive the two implications AttendEngaged → Student and Student → AttendEngaged

-- Q2: The implication holds unconditionally (hence is provable)

Discussion of the three questions:

- Q1: “Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.” From A2 we only get Perform Bonnie ∨ Inactive Bonnie. If Inactive, then by A4 and A3 we get ¬Student, which is consistent with Bonnie_link’s second disjunct. If Perform, then via A1 and Bonnie_link we get Student. Both branches are consistent, so Perform Bonnie is not derivable nor refutable. Unknown

- Q2: “If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.” As shown in theorem Q2, Student Bonnie ∨ Inactive Bonnie holds unconditionally (via A2, A1, Bonnie_link), so the implication is provable. True

- Q3: “If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.” The antecedent simplifies to Chaperone Bonnie ∨ Perform Bonnie, which is always satisfied under the given axioms (A2 plus A4 yield Perform ∨ Chaperone). The consequent asserts (YT Bonnie ∧ Wish Bonnie) ∧ Inactive Bonnie, which we cannot derive from the premises, nor can we derive its negation. Hence the implication is not provable nor refutable from the given information. Unknown
