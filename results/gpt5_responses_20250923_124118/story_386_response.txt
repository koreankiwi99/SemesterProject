Premises: If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.

Here is a Lean 4 formalization of the context and the three questions. I prove Q2 (the statement is true, vacuously, because its antecedent is contradictory with the premises) and I prove the negation of Q3 (so Q3 is false). Q1 cannot be derived nor refuted from the given premises.

-- Lean 4 code

universe u

constant α : Type u

-- Predicates
constant Deadly : α → Prop
constant LowSurvival : α → Prop
constant SevereCancer : α → Prop
constant BileDuctCancer : α → Prop
constant Cholangio : α → Prop
constant MildFlu : α → Prop

-- A distinguished entity: colorectal cancer
constant colorectal : α

-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom ax1 : ∀ x, Deadly x → LowSurvival x
axiom ax2 : ∀ x, SevereCancer x → Deadly x
axiom ax3 : ∀ x, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x
axiom ax4 : ∀ x, Cholangio x → BileDuctCancer x
axiom ax5 : ∀ x, MildFlu x → LowSurvival x
axiom ax6 : ¬ (BileDuctCancer colorectal ∧ LowSurvival colorectal)

-- Useful derived lemma: bile duct cancer implies low survival
lemma bileduct_implies_low : ∀ x, BileDuctCancer x → LowSurvival x :=
  by
    intro x hB
    exact ax1 x (ax2 x (ax3 x hB))

-- From ax6 and the previous lemma, colorectal cannot be a bile duct cancer
lemma not_bileduct_colorectal : ¬ BileDuctCancer colorectal :=
  by
    intro hB
    have hL : LowSurvival colorectal := bileduct_implies_low colorectal hB
    exact ax6 ⟨hB, hL⟩

-- Also colorectal cannot be cholangiocarcinoma (since that implies bile duct)
lemma not_cholangio_colorectal : ¬ Cholangio colorectal :=
  by
    intro hC
    have hB : BileDuctCancer colorectal := ax4 colorectal hC
    exact not_bileduct_colorectal hB

-- Q1: SevereCancer colorectal
-- Not provable nor refutable from the given axioms (we give no theorem here).

-- Q2: (BileDuct colorectal ∨ Cholangio colorectal) → (BileDuct colorectal ∧ MildFlu colorectal)
-- This is vacuously true because the antecedent is false.
theorem Q2_true :
    (BileDuctCancer colorectal ∨ Cholangio colorectal) →
    (BileDuctCancer colorectal ∧ MildFlu colorectal) :=
  by
    intro h
    have hFalse : False :=
      by
        cases h with
        | inl hB => exact not_bileduct_colorectal hB
        | inr hC => exact not_cholangio_colorectal hC
    exact False.elim hFalse

-- Q3: ((Cholangio colorectal ∧ MildFlu colorectal) ∨ BileDuct colorectal ∨ (Cholangio colorectal ∧ MildFlu colorectal ∧ BileDuct colorectal))
-- This collapses to just BileDuct colorectal, which is false under the axioms; we prove its negation directly.
theorem Q3_false :
    ¬ ((Cholangio colorectal ∧ MildFlu colorectal)
       ∨ BileDuctCancer colorectal
       ∨ (Cholangio colorectal ∧ MildFlu colorectal ∧ BileDuctCancer colorectal)) :=
  by
    intro h
    cases h with
    | inl hCM =>
        have hB : BileDuctCancer colorectal := ax4 colorectal hCM.left
        exact not_bileduct_colorectal hB
    | inr h' =>
        cases h' with
        | inl hB => exact not_bileduct_colorectal hB
        | inr hCMB =>
            have hB : BileDuctCancer colorectal := hCMB.right
            exact not_bileduct_colorectal hB
