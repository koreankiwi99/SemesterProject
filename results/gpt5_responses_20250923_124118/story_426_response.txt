-- Targets (questions)

-- Q1: James has lunch in the company (building).
-- Attempt to prove: LunchInBuilding James
-- There is no way to derive LunchInBuilding James from the axioms (no information that James is an employee, etc.).
-- Likewise, its negation is not derivable from the axioms.
-- Hence unprovable in this theory.

-- theorem Q1 : LunchInBuilding James := by
--   -- No derivation available from the given axioms.
--   sorry

-- theorem Q1_neg : ¬ LunchInBuilding James := by
--   -- Also not derivable.
--   sorry


-- Q2: James does not have lunch in the company.
-- Attempt to prove: ¬ LunchInBuilding James
-- Same situation as Q1; neither statement nor its negation is derivable.

-- theorem Q2 : ¬ LunchInBuilding James := by
--   -- Not derivable.
--   sorry

-- theorem Q2_neg : ¬ (¬ LunchInBuilding James) := by
--   -- Not derivable.
--   sorry


-- Q3: (Manager James ∨ InOtherCountries James) → ¬ (LunchAtHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James)
--     ∧ (LunchAtHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James) → (¬ Manager James ∧ ¬ InOtherCountries James)
--
-- From A6 we have Manager → ¬ RemoteFromHome, but we cannot derive ¬ LunchAtHome
-- unless we also know Employee James (to use A4: LunchAtHome → RemoteFromHome).
-- We have no information that James is an Employee.
-- For InOtherCountries, we only get RemoteFromHome if Employee James (A5), which again is unknown.
-- Thus neither the claimed implication nor its negation is derivable from the axioms.

def Claim3 : Prop :=
  (Manager James ∨ InOtherCountries James) → ¬ (LunchAtHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James)
  ∧ (LunchAtHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James) → (¬ Manager James ∧ ¬ InOtherCountries James)

-- theorem Q3 : Claim3 := by
--   -- Not derivable from the given axioms.
--   sorry

-- theorem Q3_neg : ¬ Claim3 := by
--   -- Also not derivable.
--   sorry
