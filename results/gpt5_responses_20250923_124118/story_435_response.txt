constant WorkLibrary : Student → Prop
constant CS : Student → Prop
constant Job : Student → Prop
constant DB : Student → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : Student, WorkLibrary x → ¬ CS x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Student, Job x → WorkLibrary x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Student, DB x → CS x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Student, DavidClass x → DB x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Student, Lab x → DavidClass x
axiom A6 : Lab James
axiom A7 : ¬ (Lab James ∨ Job James)

-- Q1: James has a part-time job offered by the university.
theorem Q1 : Job James := by
  have hNotLab : ¬ Lab James := by
    intro hL
    exact A7 (Or.inl hL)
  have hFalse : False := hNotLab A6
  exact False.elim hFalse

-- Q2: James does not have a part-time job offered by the university.
theorem Q2 : ¬ Job James := by
  intro hJ
  exact A7 (Or.inr hJ)

-- Q3: James either takes the database course or has a part-time job offered by the university.
theorem Q3 : DB James ∨ Job James := by
  have hDB : DB James := A4 (A5 A6)
  exact Or.inl hDB

-- Q4: James takes the database course.
theorem Q4 : DB James := by
  exact A4 (A5 A6)
