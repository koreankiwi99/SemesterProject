axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, Nice x → ¬ Mean x                  -- No one nice to animals is mean to animals.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : Person, Grumpy x ∧ Mean x                  -- Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, AnimalLover x → Nice x             -- All animal lovers are nice to animals.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, PetOwner x → AnimalLover x         -- All pet owners love animals.
axiom A5 : PetOwner Tom                                     -- Tom is a pet owner.

-- Q1: Is Grumpy Tom provable?
-- We cannot derive either Grumpy Tom or ¬ Grumpy Tom from the given axioms.

-- Q2: Tom is not both grumpy and mean to animals.
theorem q2 : ¬ (Grumpy Tom ∧ Mean Tom) :=
  by
    intro h
    exact tom_not_mean h.right

-- Q3: If Tom is not both grumpy and mean, then Tom is neither grumpy nor an animal lover.
-- We prove the negation of this implication using that Tom is an animal lover.
theorem q3_false :
  ¬ ((¬ (Grumpy Tom ∧ Mean Tom)) → (¬ Grumpy Tom ∧ ¬ AnimalLover Tom)) :=
  by
    intro h
    have hconseq : ¬ Grumpy Tom ∧ ¬ AnimalLover Tom := h q2
    have hnotAL : ¬ AnimalLover Tom := hconseq.right
