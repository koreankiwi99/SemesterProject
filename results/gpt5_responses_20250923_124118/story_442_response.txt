Here is a Lean 4 formalization of the premises and proofs for the three questions.

-- Types and predicates
constant Animal : Type
constant BrownSwiss : Animal → Prop
constant Cow : Animal → Prop
constant Pet : Animal → Prop
constant Domesticated : Animal → Prop
constant Alligator : Animal → Prop
constant Ted : Animal

-- Premises
axiom ax1 : ∀ x, BrownSwiss x → Cow x                         -- All Brown Swiss cattle are cows.
axiom ax2 : ∃ x, Pet x ∧ BrownSwiss x                         -- Some pets are Brown Swiss cattle.
axiom ax3 : ∀ x, Cow x → Domesticated x                       -- All cows are domesticated animals.
axiom ax4 : ∀ x, Alligator x → ¬ Domesticated x               -- Alligators are not domesticated animals.
axiom ax5 : Alligator Ted                                     -- Ted is an alligator.

-- Useful derived lemmas
lemma not_dom_Ted : ¬ Domesticated Ted :=
by
  have h := ax4 Ted
  exact h ax5

lemma not_BS_Ted : ¬ BrownSwiss Ted :=
by
  intro hBS
  have hCow : Cow Ted := ax1 Ted hBS
  have hDom : Domesticated Ted := ax3 Ted hCow
  exact not_dom_Ted hDom

-- Q2: Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle (this conjunction is false).
theorem Q2_false : ¬ (Pet Ted ∧ BrownSwiss Ted) :=
by
  intro h
  exact not_BS_Ted h.right

-- Q3: If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet (this is true).
theorem Q3_true : BrownSwiss Ted → ¬ Pet Ted :=
by
  intro hBS
  -- From BrownSwiss Ted we derive a contradiction (Ted would be domesticated and not domesticated),
  -- thus we can conclude anything, in particular ¬ Pet Ted.
  have hCow : Cow Ted := ax1 Ted hBS
  have hDom : Domesticated Ted := ax3 Ted hCow
  have hFalse : False := not_dom_Ted hDom
  intro _
  exact False.elim hFalse

Answers:
- Question 1: Ted is a pet. Unknown
- Question 2: Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle. False
- Question 3: If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet. True
