-- Q1: Yuri is an American national.
-- From the given axioms, neither A yuri nor ¬ A yuri is derivable.
-- Hence we cannot prove this statement nor its negation.

-- Q2: Yuri is not an American professional basketball player.
-- We can prove ¬ (A yuri ∧ P yuri) since ¬ P yuri.
theorem Q2 : ¬ (A yuri ∧ P yuri) :=
  fun h => yuri_not_P h.right

-- Q3: Yuri is an American professional basketball player.
-- We cannot prove A yuri ∧ P yuri; in fact we can prove its negation:
theorem Q3_neg : ¬ (A yuri ∧ P yuri) := Q2

-- Q4: If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player.
-- This implication is false under the axioms because ¬ L yuri is true while A yuri ∧ P yuri is false.
theorem Q4_neg : ¬ (¬ L yuri → (A yuri ∧ P yuri)) :=

  -- to refute an implication, it suffices to give the antecedent and refute the consequent

-- Q5: If Yuri is not an American professional basketball player, then Yuri is a professional basketball player.
-- This implication is false under the axioms because the antecedent holds (by Q2) while P yuri is false.
