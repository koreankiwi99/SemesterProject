Lean 4 formalization and attempt:

universe u

-- Entities
constant Entity : Type u
constant Jane KiKi : Entity

-- Predicates
constant Animal Dog Bark Jumps Legs Terricolous : Entity → Prop
constant Likes : Entity → Entity → Prop

-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom A1 : ∀ x, Animal x ∧ Bark x → ¬ Likes Jane x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Dog x → Animal x ∧ Bark x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, Animal x ∧ Jumps x → Likes Jane x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, Animal x ∧ Legs x → Jumps x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, Animal x ∧ Terricolous x → Legs x
axiom A6 : Animal KiKi
axiom A7 : (¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ Legs KiKi) → (Terricolous KiKi ∨ Legs KiKi)

-- Some derivable lemmas
lemma terricolous_implies_legs (x : Entity) (hA : Animal x) :
  Terricolous x → Legs x :=
by intro ht; exact (A5 x) ⟨hA, ht⟩

lemma terricolous_implies_jumps (x : Entity) (hA : Animal x) :
  Terricolous x → Jumps x :=
by intro ht; exact (A4 x) ⟨hA, terricolous_implies_legs x hA ht⟩

lemma dog_implies_animal (x : Entity) : Dog x → Animal x :=
by intro hd; exact (A2 x hd).left

lemma dog_implies_barks (x : Entity) : Dog x → Bark x :=
by intro hd; exact (A2 x hd).right

-- Consequences for KiKi we can prove
lemma terricolous_KiKi_implies_legs : Terricolous KiKi → Legs KiKi :=
terr i colous_implies_legs KiKi A6

lemma terricolous_KiKi_implies_jumps : Terricolous KiKi → Jumps KiKi :=
terr i colous_implies_jumps KiKi A6

lemma dog_KiKi_implies_barks : Dog KiKi → Bark KiKi :=
dog_implies_barks KiKi

-- None of the following are derivable from the axioms:
-- 1) Terricolous KiKi
-- 2) Dog KiKi ∧ Bark KiKi
-- 3) ¬ Bark KiKi ∧ ¬ Dog KiKi
-- and we also cannot derive their negations from the given axioms.
