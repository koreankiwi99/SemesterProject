universe u

constant Thing : Type u

-- Predicates
constant Appropriate : Thing → Prop
constant CW : Thing → Prop                      -- Children can watch without guidance
constant Contains : Thing → Prop                -- Contains excessive erotic and violent content
constant RatedGA : Thing → Prop                 -- Rated General Audience
constant FF : Thing → Prop                      -- Family-friendly animated film
constant Frozen : Thing → Prop                  -- In the Frozen series
constant Film : Thing → Prop

-- Individual
constant hachi : Thing

-- Given rules (axioms)
axiom rule1 : ∀ x, Appropriate x → CW x
axiom rule2 : ∀ x, Contains x → ¬ CW x
axiom rule3 : ∀ x, RatedGA x → Appropriate x
axiom rule4 : ∀ x, FF x → RatedGA x
axiom rule5 : ∀ x, Frozen x → FF x

-- Given facts
axiom fact_film : Film hachi
axiom fact_disj : FF hachi ∨ Appropriate hachi

-- Useful derived facts
lemma appropriate_hachi : Appropriate hachi := by
  cases fact_disj with
  | inl h => exact rule3 _ (rule4 _ h)
  | inr h => exact h

lemma cw_hachi : CW hachi :=
  rule1 _ appropriate_hachi

lemma not_contains_hachi : ¬ Contains hachi := by
  intro hc
  have hnotcw : ¬ CW hachi := rule2 _ hc
  exact hnotcw cw_hachi

-- Simplifications for questions 2 and 3
lemma q2_iff : (Contains hachi ∨ Frozen hachi) ↔ Frozen hachi := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    cases h with
    | inl hc => exact False.elim (not_contains_hachi hc)
    | inr hf => exact hf
  · intro hf
    exact Or.inr hf

lemma q3_iff :
  ((Contains hachi ∧ Frozen hachi) ∨ (¬ Contains hachi ∧ ¬ Frozen hachi))
  ↔ ¬ Frozen hachi := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    cases h with
    | inl hcf =>
        have hc := hcf.left
        exact False.elim (not_contains_hachi hc)
    | inr hnot => exact hnot.right
  · intro hnot
    exact Or.inr ⟨not_contains_hachi, hnot⟩

-- Notes:
-- We can prove Appropriate hachi and CW hachi, and hence ¬Contains hachi.
-- However, we cannot derive RatedGA hachi, Frozen hachi, or ¬Frozen hachi from the given axioms.


Answers:
1) "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" is rated General Audience.
Conclusion: Unknown. From FF hachi ∨ Appropriate hachi and FF → RatedGA → Appropriate, we can prove Appropriate hachi but not RatedGA hachi. Unknown

2) "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the Frozen series (or both).
Conclusion: Unknown. We actually proved ¬Contains hachi, so this reduces to “Hachi is in the Frozen series,” which is not derivable. Unknown

3) "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is in the Frozen series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is in the Frozen series.
Conclusion: Unknown. Using ¬Contains hachi, this reduces to “not in the Frozen series,” which is not derivable. Unknown
