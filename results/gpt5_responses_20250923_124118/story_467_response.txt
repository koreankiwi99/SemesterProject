Lean formalization and attempt at proofs:

We work in a first-order setting with a single universe of entities and the following predicates:
- Pet x: x is Peter’s pet
- Mammal x
- Animal x
- Monkey x
- Bird x
- CanFly x
- CanBreathe x
- HasWings x

Constant:
- rock : entity

Axioms encoded from the text:
1. ∀ x, Pet x ∧ Mammal x → Animal x
2. ∀ x, Monkey x → Mammal x
3. ∀ x, Pet x → (Monkey x ∨ Bird x)
4. ∀ x, Pet x ∧ Bird x → CanFly x
5. ∀ x, Animal x ∧ Pet x → CanBreathe x
6. ∀ x, Pet x ∧ CanFly x → HasWings x
7. Pet rock
8. CanFly rock ∨ Bird rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe rock

-- Some derived lemmas that the axioms do justify.

-- If rock is a bird, then rock can fly.

  exact A4 rock this

-- If rock can fly, then rock has wings.
lemma rock_wings_of_fly : CanFly rock → HasWings rock :=
by
  intro hFly
  exact A6 rock (And.intro A7 hFly)

-- If rock is a bird, then rock has wings (bird → fly → wings).
lemma rock_wings_of_bird : Bird rock → HasWings rock :=
by
  intro hBird
  exact rock_wings_of_fly (rock_fly_of_bird hBird)

-- From the disjunction A8, we can derive that either rock has wings or ¬CanBreathe rock.
lemma wings_or_not_breathe :
  HasWings rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe rock :=
by
  -- A8: CanFly rock ∨ Bird rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe rock
  rcases A8 with hFly | hBird | hNotBreathe
  · exact Or.inl (rock_wings_of_fly hFly)
  · exact Or.inl (rock_wings_of_bird hBird)
  · exact Or.inr hNotBreathe

-- We cannot derive Monkey rock from the given axioms (independence not provable in Lean here).
-- Similarly, we cannot derive HasWings rock, nor its negation, from the axioms alone.

Conclusions:

- Question 1: Rock is a monkey.
From Pet rock and axiom A3 we only get Monkey rock ∨ Bird rock. Nothing rules out the Bird alternative, and nothing forces Monkey. Therefore Rock is a monkey is not entailed, nor is its negation. Answer: Unknown

- Question 2: Rock has wings.
From A8, if either CanFly rock or Bird rock holds, then Rock has wings (by A6 and A4). However, the third disjunct ¬CanBreathe rock is consistent with the axioms and gives no information about wings. We cannot rule out this third case (we lack a way to deduce Animal rock to force CanBreathe rock). Thus we cannot conclude HasWings rock, nor its negation. Answer: Unknown

- Question 3: Rock does not have wings.
As above, the first two disjuncts of A8 would imply Rock has wings, so we cannot conclude that Rock lacks wings. But we also cannot rule out the third disjunct, so we cannot refute that Rock lacks wings either. Answer: Unknown

Final answers:
