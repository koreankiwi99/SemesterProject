Premises: Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.
Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs.
Heck cattle are animals.
Aurochs are animals.
Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals.

Lean translation and proof attempt:

-- We model individuals as elements of a type ι.
universe u
constant ι : Type u

-- Predicates
constant Animal : ι → Prop
constant Heck : ι → Prop
constant Aurochs : ι → Prop
constant Extinct : ι → Prop
constant BredBack : ι → Prop
constant ArtificialSelection : ι → Prop
constant Resembles : ι → ι → Prop

-- Axioms from the textual context:

-- 1) Breeding back is a form of artificial selection
axiom ax1 : ∀ x, BredBack x → ArtificialSelection x

-- 2) Heck cattle are animals
axiom ax2 : ∀ x, Heck x → Animal x

-- 3) Aurochs are animals
axiom ax3 : ∀ x, Aurochs x → Animal x

-- 4) Heck cattle were bred back (we read this as: every Heck individual is a product of breeding back)
axiom ax4 : ∀ x, Heck x → BredBack x

-- 5) There exist Heck cattle (existence suggested by the historical claim)
axiom ax5 : ∃ x, Heck x

-- 6) Heck cattle resemble the aurochs (not needed for Q1, included for completeness)
axiom ax6 : ∀ x, Heck x → ∀ y, Aurochs y → Resembles x y

-- 7) Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals
-- We model only the existence of some animal resembling some extinct animal.
axiom ax7 : ∃ x, Animal x ∧ ∃ y, Extinct y ∧ Resembles x y

-- Question 1 target: ∃ x, Heck x ∧ ArtificialSelection x
theorem Q1 : ∃ x, Heck x ∧ ArtificialSelection x := by
  rcases ax5 with ⟨h, hh⟩
  have hb : BredBack h := ax4 h hh
  have ha : ArtificialSelection h := ax1 h hb
  exact ⟨h, And.intro hh ha⟩

-- Question 2 (Aurochs are extinct) cannot be derived from the given axioms.
-- We neither have ∀ x, Aurochs x → Extinct x nor its negation from the above,
-- so we do not provide a proof.
