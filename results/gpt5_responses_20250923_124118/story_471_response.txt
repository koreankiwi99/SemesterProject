Lean 4 formalization and proofs:

-- Setup
universe u

constant Animal : Type u
constant Rabbit Turtle Squirrel Near Cute Skittish Calm : Animal → Prop
constant Rockie : Animal

axiom A1 : ∀ x : Animal, Rabbit x ∧ Near x → Cute x
axiom A2 : ∃ x : Animal, Turtle x ∧ Near x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Animal, Near x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x)
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Animal, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Animal, Squirrel x ∧ Near x → Skittish x
axiom A6 : Near Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie
