Here is a faithful formalization in Lean of the domain and assumptions, followed by attempted proofs of the three questions.

Lean formalization and attempts:

-- We work classically

universe u

constant Entity : Type u

-- Predicates
constant Animal : Entity → Prop
constant Vertebrate : Entity → Prop
constant Invertebrate : Entity → Prop
constant Backbone : Entity → Prop
constant ReproByMF : Entity → Prop
constant Bee : Entity → Prop
constant QueenBee : Entity → Prop

-- Constant individual
constant Harry : Entity

-- Axioms (from the textual context)
-- 1. Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
axiom A1 : ∀ x, Animal x → (Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x)

-- 2. All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A2 : ∀ x, (Animal x ∧ Backbone x) → ReproByMF x

-- 3. All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
axiom A3 : ∀ x, Vertebrate x → Backbone x

-- 4. All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A4 : ∀ x, Bee x → ¬ ReproByMF x

-- 5. All queen bees are bees.
axiom A5 : ∀ x, QueenBee x → Bee x

-- 6. Harry is a bee.
axiom A6 : Bee Harry

-- Some easy consequences that might be useful
lemma not_repro_Harry : ¬ ReproByMF Harry :=
  by
    have : Bee Harry := A6
    exact (A4 Harry) this

-- Note: We do NOT have Animal Harry as an axiom, so we cannot trigger A1 or A2 on Harry.

-- Question 1: Is Harry a queen bee?
-- Target: QueenBee Harry
-- This is not derivable from the axioms (and its negation is also not derivable).
-- We leave it unprovable here.
def Q1 : Prop := QueenBee Harry
-- We cannot prove Q1 nor ¬Q1 from the given axioms.

-- Question 2: Is Harry an invertebrate or a queen bee?
-- Target: Invertebrate Harry ∨ QueenBee Harry
def Q2 : Prop := Invertebrate Harry ∨ QueenBee Harry
-- We cannot prove Q2 nor its negation from the given axioms.

-- Question 3: If (Harry is both a vertebrate and has a backbone) or (neither a vertebrate nor has a backbone),
-- then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.
def Q3 : Prop :=
  ((Vertebrate Harry ∧ Backbone Harry) ∨ (¬ Vertebrate Harry ∧ ¬ Backbone Harry))
  → (¬ Invertebrate Harry ∧ ¬ QueenBee Harry)
-- This implication also does not follow from the axioms, and its negation is not derivable.
