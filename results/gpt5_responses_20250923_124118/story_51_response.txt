-- Predicates
constant SportingEvent : Entity -> Prop
constant HeldIn : Entity -> Entity -> Prop
constant WonMostMedalsAtEvent : Entity -> Entity -> Prop
constant WonMostMedalsInCity : Entity -> Entity -> Prop

-- Facts from the textual context
axiom h1 : SportingEvent SummerOlympics
axiom h2 : HeldIn SummerOlympics Tokyo
axiom h3 : WonMostMedalsInCity UnitedStates Tokyo

-- Bridge principle connecting location-based and event-based medal claims
axiom medals_city_to_event {a e c : Entity} :
  HeldIn e c -> WonMostMedalsInCity a c -> WonMostMedalsAtEvent a e

-- Q1 statement
def Q1 : Prop := SportingEvent WorldChampionships
-- Not provable (nor is its negation) from the given axioms.

-- Q2 statement
def Q2 : Prop := ¬ HeldIn SummerOlympics Tokyo

-- We can prove the negation of Q2, so Q2 is false.
theorem Q2_false : ¬ Q2 := by
  intro hnot
  exact hnot h2

-- Q3 statement
def Q3 : Prop := WonMostMedalsAtEvent UnitedStates SummerOlympics

-- We can prove Q3 from the bridge and facts.
theorem Q3_true : Q3 := by
  exact medals_city_to_event h2 h3

end Reasoning

Answers:
1) We are not told anything about the world championships, so it does not follow from the context that it is a sporting event. Unknown
2) The context says the last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo, so saying they were not in Tokyo contradicts the given facts. False
3) Since the last summer Olympic games were in Tokyo and the United States won the most medals in Tokyo, it follows they won the most medals at the last summer Olympic games. True
