Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul.

Lean code translation and proofs:

-- We model entities (e.g., license plates) as elements of a type U
section
variable {U : Type} (Joe Tom : U)
variable (Begins34 Begins35 FromIstanbul : U → Prop)

-- Axioms from the textual context
variable
  (A1 : ∀ x, FromIstanbul x → Begins34 x)                -- All plates from Istanbul begin with 34
  (A2 : ∀ x, ¬ Begins34 x → ¬ FromIstanbul x)            -- Plates not beginning with 34 are not from Istanbul
  (A3 : FromIstanbul Joe)                                 -- Joe's plate is from Istanbul
  (A4 : Begins35 Tom)                                     -- Tom's plate begins with 35
  (A5 : ∀ x, Begins35 x → ¬ Begins34 x)                   -- If begins with 35 then not with 34

-- Question 1: Joe's plate begins with 34
theorem q1 : Begins34 Joe :=
  A1 Joe A3

-- Question 2: Tom's plate is from Istanbul (we prove its negation)
theorem not_q2 : ¬ FromIstanbul Tom :=
by
  have h1 : ¬ Begins34 Tom := A5 Tom (A4)
  exact A2 Tom h1

end
