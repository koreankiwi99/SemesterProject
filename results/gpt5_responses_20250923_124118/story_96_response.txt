-- Q1: There exists a professional wrestling stable led by Roderick Strong.
theorem Q1 :
  ∃ S, WrestlingStable S ∧ Leads RoderickStrong S :=
by
  exact ⟨DiamondMine, h_stable, h_leads⟩

-- Q2: We cannot derive Leads RoderickStrong CreedBrothers (nor its negation) from the given axioms.

-- Q3: There exists a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile
--     with which Imperium has a feud; hence the negation in the question is false.
