Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and proofs:

We model individuals and predicates:
- Person: type of people
- HS: the individual Heinrich Schmidt
- German, Russian, Politician: predicates on Person
- MemberPrussianSP: membership in the Prussian State Parliament
- MemberNaziReichstag: membership in the Nazi Reichstag

Facts from the context:
- HS is German and a Politician
- HS is a member of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag

Lean code:

universe u

constant Person : Type u
constant HS : Person

constant German : Person → Prop
constant Russian : Person → Prop
constant Politician : Person → Prop
constant MemberPrussianSP : Person → Prop
constant MemberNaziReichstag : Person → Prop

axiom HS_German : German HS
axiom HS_Politician : Politician HS
axiom HS_Prussian : MemberPrussianSP HS
axiom HS_Nazi : MemberNaziReichstag HS

-- Q1: HS was German or Russian or both
theorem Q1_true : German HS ∨ Russian HS ∨ (German HS ∧ Russian HS) :=
  Or.inl HS_German
-- Proven, so True.

-- Q2: Some German politician was part of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag
theorem Q2_true : ∃ x, German x ∧ Politician x ∧ MemberPrussianSP x ∧ MemberNaziReichstag x := by
  refine ⟨HS, ?_⟩
  exact And.intro HS_German (And.intro HS_Politician (And.intro HS_Prussian HS_Nazi))
-- Proven, so True.

-- Q3: No politicians are part of the Nazi Reichstag
def Q3_stmt : Prop := ∀ x, Politician x → ¬ MemberNaziReichstag x

-- We prove the negation (i.e., Q3 is false) by providing HS as a counterexample
theorem Q3_false : ¬ Q3_stmt := by
  intro h
  have : ¬ MemberNaziReichstag HS := h HS HS_Politician
  exact this HS_Nazi
-- Negation is provable, so the original statement is False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: False
