-- Claim 1: Andrew Collins was the script editor for a series with working title "The Secret Dude Society".
def Claim1 : Prop := ∃ s : Show, ScriptEditor AndrewCollins s ∧ WorkingTitle s SDS

theorem Claim1_true : Claim1 := by
  exact ⟨Badults, And.intro h4 h3⟩

-- Claim 2: No members of Pappy's have starred in a show piloting on BBC Two or BBC Three.
def Claim2 : Prop := ¬ ∃ s : Show, StarsPappys s ∧ (PilotedOnBBCTwo s ∨ PilotedOnBBCThree s)

-- We produce a counterexample (Badults), so Claim 2 is false.
theorem exists_pappys_on_bbc2or3 :
  ∃ s : Show, StarsPappys s ∧ (PilotedOnBBCTwo s ∨ PilotedOnBBCThree s) := by
  exact ⟨Badults, And.intro h1 (Or.inr h2)⟩

theorem not_Claim2 : ¬ Claim2 := by

Conclusion
- Claim 1 is provable (True).
- Claim 2 is refutable; its negation is provable (False).

1: True
2: False
