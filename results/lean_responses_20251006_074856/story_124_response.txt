Story ID: 124
Premises: The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas.
Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.
The Harding Pegmatite Mine, located in the Picuris Mountains, was donated.
There are no mountain ranges in texas that have mines that have been donated.

Model Response:

Lean formalization and attempt to prove:

universe u

-- Types
constant MountainRange : Type
constant Mine : Type
constant Person : Type

-- Entities
constant Picuris : MountainRange
constant Harding : Mine
constant Juan : Person

-- Predicates
constant InNM : MountainRange → Prop
constant InTX : MountainRange → Prop
constant LocatedIn : Mine → MountainRange → Prop
constant Donated : Mine → Prop
constant Visited : Person → MountainRange → Prop

-- Assumptions from the textual context
axiom Picuris_in_NM_or_TX : InNM Picuris ∨ InTX Picuris
axiom Juan_visited_Picuris : Visited Juan Picuris
axiom Harding_located_in_Picuris : LocatedIn Harding Picuris
axiom Harding_donated : Donated Harding
axiom no_TX_range_has_donated_mine :
  ∀ (r : MountainRange) (m : Mine), InTX r → LocatedIn m r → Donated m → False

-- Derived facts
lemma Picuris_not_in_TX : ¬ InTX Picuris := by
  intro htx
  exact no_TX_range_has_donated_mine Picuris Harding htx Harding_located_in_Picuris Harding_donated

lemma Picuris_in_NM : InNM Picuris := by

-- Questions as propositions
def Q1 : Prop := ∃ r : MountainRange, InNM r ∧ Visited Juan r
def Q2 : Prop := ∃ r : MountainRange, InTX r ∧ Visited Juan r
def Q3 : Prop := ¬ ∃ r : MountainRange, InNM r ∧ LocatedIn Harding r

-- Proofs
theorem Q1_true : Q1 := by
  refine Exists.intro Picuris ?_
  exact And.intro Picuris_in_NM Juan_visited_Picuris
-- Therefore, Q1 is True.

theorem exists_nm_location_for_harding : ∃ r : MountainRange, InNM r ∧ LocatedIn Harding r := by
  exact ⟨Picuris, And.intro Picuris_in_NM Harding_located_in_Picuris⟩

theorem not_Q3 : ¬ Q3 := by
  intro h
  exact h exists_nm_location_for_harding
-- Therefore, Q3 is False.

-- For Q2 (∃ r, InTX r ∧ Visited Juan r), from the given information we can neither prove it nor its negation.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
