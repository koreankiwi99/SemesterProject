Premises: Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms.
Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.
The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and attempt:

We model the single algorithm used to train the state-of-the-art (SOTA) text summarization model as alg.

universe u

constant Algorithm : Type u
constant Supervised : Algorithm → Prop
constant Unsupervised : Algorithm → Prop
constant Reinforcement : Algorithm → Prop
constant RequiresLabeled : Algorithm → Prop
constant alg : Algorithm

-- Premises encoded from the text:
-- 1) ML algorithms fall into exactly these three categories (we only need exhaustiveness for alg).
axiom categories_exhaustive_for_alg : Supervised alg ∨ Unsupervised alg ∨ Reinforcement alg
-- 2) Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
axiom unsupervised_no_labels : ∀ a, Unsupervised a → ¬ RequiresLabeled a
-- 3) Reinforcement learning is not used to train the SOTA model.
axiom not_reinforcement_used : ¬ Reinforcement alg
-- 4) The ML algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.
axiom requires_labels_alg : RequiresLabeled alg

-- Consequences:
-- From (2) and (4), alg cannot be unsupervised.
lemma not_unsupervised_alg : ¬ Unsupervised alg := by
  intro hU
  have h := unsupervised_no_labels alg hU
  exact h requires_labels_alg

-- From exhaustiveness (1), excluding unsupervised and reinforcement by the above and (3), alg must be supervised.
lemma supervised_alg : Supervised alg := by
  have h := categories_exhaustive_for_alg
  rcases h with hS | hUR
  · exact hS
  · rcases hUR with hU | hR
    · exact False.elim (not_unsupervised_alg hU)
    · exact False.elim (not_reinforcement_used hR)

-- Therefore:
-- Question 1 (Supervised alg) is provable: True.
-- Question 2 (Unsupervised alg) is refutable via not_unsupervised_alg: False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
