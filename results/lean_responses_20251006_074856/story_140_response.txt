-- Q1: "Steinhauer was not the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic."
-- We prove the negation of the claim.
theorem Q1_negation_of_claim : Winner E1992 Steinhauer := winner_1992

  exact h winner_1992

-- Q2: "Descampe is in the six-way tie in the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic."
-- From the axioms, this cannot be proved nor can its negation be proved.

-- A derived but unused fact: Descampe participated.
