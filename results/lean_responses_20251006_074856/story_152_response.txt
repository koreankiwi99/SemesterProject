Premises: Susan flies to LGA airport.
The departure and arrival can not be at the same airport.
John flies from LGA airport.

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and proof attempt:

-- We model people, airports, and the flies-to/from predicates.
universe u

namespace FlightNL

inductive Person
| Susan
| John
deriving DecidableEq

inductive Airport
| LGA
deriving DecidableEq

open Person Airport

-- Predicates
constant FliesTo   : Person → Airport → Prop
constant FliesFrom : Person → Airport → Prop

-- Axiom: departure and arrival cannot be the same airport (for a given person/flight).
axiom not_same_airport : ∀ p a, ¬ (FliesFrom p a ∧ FliesTo p a)

-- Facts from the text
axiom Susan_to_LGA : FliesTo Susan LGA
axiom John_from_LGA : FliesFrom John LGA

-- The statements in question
def Q1_stmt : Prop := FliesFrom Susan LGA
def Q2_stmt : Prop := FliesTo John LGA

-- We prove the negations of both statements using the incompatibility axiom.
theorem Q1_neg : ¬ Q1_stmt :=
by
  intro hfrom
  have h := not_same_airport Susan LGA
  exact h ⟨hfrom, Susan_to_LGA⟩

theorem Q2_neg : ¬ Q2_stmt :=
by
  intro hto
  have h := not_same_airport John LGA
  exact h ⟨John_from_LGA, hto⟩

end FlightNL

From the above, we have proved the negations of both queried statements.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: False
