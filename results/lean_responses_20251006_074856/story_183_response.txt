Story ID: 183
Premises: If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z
Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and attempt at proofs:

We model people and predicates:
- Person: type of individuals
- Michael, Peter, Windy: constants of type Person
- Man, Shooter, GreatShooter, InClass: Person → Prop
- Taller: Person → Person → Prop
- Jumps: Person → Prop
- CanBlock: Person → Person → Prop

Axioms from the text (plus standard properties of “taller than”):
- man_michael: Man Michael
- man_peter: Man Peter
- taller_trans: ∀ {x y z}, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z
- taller_irrefl: ∀ x, ¬ Taller x x  -- irreflexivity of “taller than”
- block_if_taller_men: ∀ x y, Man x → Man y → Taller x y → CanBlock x y
- michael_taller_than_class: ∀ x, InClass x → Taller Michael x
- peter_taller_than_michael: Taller Peter Michael
- michael_blocks_if_not_jump: ∀ x, ¬ Jumps x → CanBlock Michael x
- michael_cannot_block_windy: ¬ CanBlock Michael Windy
- shooter_windy: Shooter Windy
- great_if_shooter_and_jump: ∀ x, Shooter x → Jumps x → GreatShooter x

Lean proofs sketch:

1) Q1: “Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class” means ∃ x, Man x ∧ InClass x ∧ Taller x Peter.
Assume such x. Then:
- From InClass x, michael_taller_than_class gives Taller Michael x.
- From Taller x Peter and peter_taller_than_michael and taller_trans, get Taller x Michael.
- From Taller x Michael and Taller Michael x and taller_trans, get Taller x x, contradicting taller_irrefl.
Hence ¬ ∃ x, Man x ∧ InClass x ∧ Taller x Peter. So Q1 is False.

2) Q2: From michael_cannot_block_windy and michael_blocks_if_not_jump, by modus tollens we get Jumps Windy. Given shooter_windy and great_if_shooter_and_jump, conclude GreatShooter Windy. So Q2 is True.

3) Q3: We have no information relating Peter’s height to Windy nor Windy’s being a man, so block_if_taller_men cannot be applied, and we cannot derive either CanBlock Peter Windy or its negation from the axioms. So Q3 is Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: Unknown
