Story ID: 191
Premises: A natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.
If the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.
Machine translation is a natural language processing task.
The output of machine translation is a text sequence.

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and attempt:

universe u

constant Task : Type u
constant NLP : Task → Prop
constant Gen : Task → Prop
constant Und : Task → Prop
constant OutText : Task → Prop
constant MT : Task

axioms
  (H1 : ∀ t, NLP t → (Gen t ∨ Und t))          -- A NLP task is either generation or understanding (not assumed exclusive)
  (H2 : ∀ t, OutText t → Gen t)                 -- If output is a text sequence, then it is generation
  (H3 : NLP MT)                                  -- Machine translation is an NLP task
  (H4 : OutText MT)                              -- The output of machine translation is a text sequence

-- Q1: Machine translation is a language generation task.
theorem Q1 : Gen MT := H2 MT H4

-- Q2: Machine translation is a language understanding task.
-- From H1 and H3 we only know Gen MT ∨ Und MT, and from H2 and H4 we know Gen MT.
-- This does not entail Und MT, nor its negation, without an exclusivity axiom.
-- Therefore neither Und MT nor ¬Und MT is derivable from the given axioms.
