Story ID: 192
Premises: International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
Mike is an international student.
Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.

Lean formalization and attempt

We model the domain:

- Persons and a distinguished individual Mike.
- Predicates:
  - InternationalUS : Person → Prop
  - International : Person → Prop
  - F1, J1 : Person → Prop
  - WantsWorkUS : Person → Prop
  - NeedsCPT, NeedsOPT : Person → Prop

Axioms from the text:

- A1 (International students in the US have either F1 or J1):
  ∀ x, InternationalUS x → (F1 x ∨ J1 x)

- A2 (If an international student in the US has F1 and wants to work in the US, then they need CPT or OPT):
  ∀ x, InternationalUS x ∧ F1 x ∧ WantsWorkUS x → (NeedsCPT x ∨ NeedsOPT x)

- A3 (Mike is an international student):
  International Mike

- A4 (Mike needs CPT if he wants to work in the US):
  WantsWorkUS Mike → NeedsCPT Mike

Goals:

- Q1: F1 Mike
- Q2: J1 Mike

Lean sketch:

constant Person : Type
constant Mike : Person

constant InternationalUS : Person → Prop
constant International : Person → Prop
constant F1 : Person → Prop
constant J1 : Person → Prop
constant WantsWorkUS : Person → Prop
constant NeedsCPT : Person → Prop
constant NeedsOPT : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, InternationalUS x → (F1 x ∨ J1 x)
axiom A2 : ∀ x, InternationalUS x ∧ F1 x ∧ WantsWorkUS x → (NeedsCPT x ∨ NeedsOPT x)
axiom A3 : International Mike
axiom A4 : WantsWorkUS Mike → NeedsCPT Mike

-- Attempt Q1: F1 Mike
-- From A1 we would need InternationalUS Mike to get F1 Mike ∨ J1 Mike, but we do not have InternationalUS Mike.
-- From A2 we would need InternationalUS Mike ∧ F1 Mike ∧ WantsWorkUS Mike to conclude something about CPT/OPT, not F1 itself.
-- A4 is a conditional about CPT, independent of F1/J1 status by the given axioms.
-- Therefore Q1 is not provable from A1–A4, nor is ¬Q1 provable.

-- Attempt Q2: J1 Mike
-- Symmetric reasoning to Q1; J1 Mike is also not provable, and neither is its negation.

Conclusion of the attempt:

- We cannot prove F1 Mike from the given axioms, and we also cannot prove ¬F1 Mike.
- We cannot prove J1 Mike from the given axioms, and we also cannot prove ¬J1 Mike.

Therefore, both statements are logically undetermined from the provided information.
