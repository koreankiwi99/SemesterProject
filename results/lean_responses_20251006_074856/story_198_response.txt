Lean formalization and attempt:

We introduce a type of beings and predicates/propositions corresponding to the statements.

- Being : Type
- Animal, Mammal, Human, Person : Being → Prop
- CanOccurMonkeypoxVirus, OccursMonkeypoxVirus, MayGetMonkeypox, GetsFlu, FeelsTired : Being → Prop
- Symptom: an inductive type with constructors fever, headache, muscle_pains, tiredness, coughing
- SymptomOfMonkeypox : Symptom → Prop

Axioms from the text:

1) Humans are mammals; mammals are animals:
   ∀ x, Human x → Mammal x
   ∀ x, Mammal x → Animal x

2) Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals:
   ∃ x, Animal x ∧ CanOccurMonkeypoxVirus x

3) When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox (modeled as a weak implication to a separate predicate MayGetMonkeypox):
   ∀ x, OccursMonkeypoxVirus x → MayGetMonkeypox x

4) People feel tired when they get the flu:
   ∀ x, Person x → (GetsFlu x → FeelsTired x)

5) Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, tiredness:
   SymptomOfMonkeypox fever
   SymptomOfMonkeypox headache
   SymptomOfMonkeypox muscle_pains
   SymptomOfMonkeypox tiredness

No axiom is given for coughing.

Lean sketch:
