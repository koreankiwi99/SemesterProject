Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and attempt:

- Domain: U (things)
- Predicates: Plunger, Vacuum, Vampire, HouseholdAppliance, Sucks : U → Prop
- Constants: Space, Duster : U
- Axioms:
  1) ∀ x, Plunger x → Sucks x
  2) ∀ x, Vacuum x → Sucks x
  3) ∀ x, Vampire x → Sucks x
  4) Vacuum Space
  5) HouseholdAppliance Duster
  6) ¬ Sucks Duster

Lean-style proofs:
- Q1 (Space sucks):
  from (2) and (4): vacuums_suck Space space_is_vacuum : Sucks Space. Proven.

- Q2 (Space is a vampire):
  No axioms relate Vacuum to Vampire. Neither Vampire Space nor its negation is derivable from the given axioms. Unknown.

- Q3 (If something is a household appliance, it sucks):
  Let Statement3 := ∀ x, HouseholdAppliance x → Sucks x.
  From (5) and (6), assuming Statement3 yields Sucks Duster, contradicting ¬ Sucks Duster. Hence ¬ Statement3. We can prove the negation, so the statement is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
