Premises: If George likes music, he wants to compose.
If George has access to a program, he can compose.
If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean translation and attempt:

We model the domain with propositions:
- L: George likes music
- W: George wants to compose
- A: George has access to a program
- C: George can compose
- P: George will compose

Assumptions:
- h1: L → W
- h2: A → C
- h3: (C ∧ W) → P

Goal 1: (L ∧ A) → P
Proof in Lean:
-- Variables and assumptions
variable (L W A C P : Prop)
variable (h1 : L → W) (h2 : A → C) (h3 : C ∧ W → P)

theorem Q1 : (L ∧ A) → P := by
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨hl, ha⟩
  have hw : W := h1 hl
  have hc : C := h2 ha
  exact h3 ⟨hc, hw⟩

This is provable.

Goal 2: (¬P) → ¬C
We cannot derive this from the assumptions. What we can derive is the contrapositive form of h3:
(¬P) → (¬C ∨ ¬W)
Proof in Lean:
theorem Q2_we_can_prove : (¬ P) → (¬ C ∨ ¬ W) := by
  intro hnP
  have hnot : ¬ (C ∧ W) := by
    intro hCW
    exact hnP (h3 hCW)
  classical
  by_cases hc : C
  · right
    intro hw
    exact hnot ⟨hc, hw⟩
  · left; exact hc

Since (¬P) → ¬C does not follow and its negation also cannot be proved from the given assumptions, the status of Question 2 is Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
