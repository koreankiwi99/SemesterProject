Lean formalization and proofs:

-- Types and constants
constant City : Type
constant Beijing : City

-- Predicates
constant HostedSummer2008 : City → Prop
constant HostedWinterOlympics : City → Prop
constant LocatedNorth : City → Prop
constant LocatedSouth : City → Prop
constant SecondLargestCity : City → Prop

-- Axioms from the text
axiom ax_hosted_2008_summer : HostedSummer2008 Beijing
axiom ax_hosted_winter : HostedWinterOlympics Beijing
axiom ax_located_north : LocatedNorth Beijing
-- General geographic exclusivity (North and South are disjoint)
axiom ax_north_implies_not_south : ∀ c : City, LocatedNorth c → ¬ LocatedSouth c

-- Q1: "Beijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics."
-- Proof: both conjuncts are given by axioms.
theorem Q1 : HostedSummer2008 Beijing ∧ HostedWinterOlympics Beijing :=
And.intro ax_hosted_2008_summer ax_hosted_winter

-- Q2: "Beijing is located in southern China."
-- We cannot prove this, but we can prove its negation from ax_located_north and exclusivity.
theorem not_Q2 : ¬ LocatedSouth Beijing :=
(ax_north_implies_not_south Beijing) ax_located_north

-- Q3: "Beijing is the second largest Chinese city."
-- No information provided to prove or refute this.
-- Hence neither the statement nor its negation is derivable from the given axioms.
