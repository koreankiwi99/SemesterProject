Premises: All horses have hooves.
No humans have hooves.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Lean translation and proof:

We model a domain U with predicates Human, Horse, HasHooves. The premises are:
- ∀ x, Horse x → HasHooves x
- ∀ x, Human x → ¬ HasHooves x

The query statement is:
- SomeHumansAreHorses := ∃ x, Human x ∧ Horse x

Lean code:

variable (U : Type)
variable (Human Horse HasHooves : U → Prop)

axiom all_horses_have_hooves : ∀ x, Horse x → HasHooves x
axiom no_humans_have_hooves : ∀ x, Human x → ¬ HasHooves x

def SomeHumansAreHorses : Prop := ∃ x, Human x ∧ Horse x

theorem no_human_is_horse : ¬ SomeHumansAreHorses U Human Horse HasHooves :=
by
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨x, hx⟩
  have h_hooves : HasHooves x := all_horses_have_hooves x hx.2
  have h_no_hooves : ¬ HasHooves x := no_humans_have_hooves x hx.1
  exact h_no_hooves h_hooves

We have proven the negation of the statement “Some humans are horses,” so the statement is false.
