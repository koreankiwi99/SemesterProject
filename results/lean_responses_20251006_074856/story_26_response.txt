Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and attempt:

We model two individuals: P for platypus and H for human. Predicates: Mammal, Reptile, HasTeeth.

Premises:
- some_mammals_have_teeth: ∃ x, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
- platypus_no_teeth: ¬ HasTeeth P
- platypus_mammal: Mammal P
- human_teeth: HasTeeth H

Lean code:

-- Lean 4
universe u

constant Animal : Type u
constant P : Animal -- platypus
constant H : Animal -- human

constant Mammal : Animal → Prop
constant Reptile : Animal → Prop
constant HasTeeth : Animal → Prop

axiom some_mammals_have_teeth : ∃ x, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom platypus_no_teeth : ¬ HasTeeth P
axiom platypus_mammal : Mammal P
axiom human_teeth : HasTeeth H

-- Q1: Platypuses are mammals with no teeth: Mammal P ∧ ¬HasTeeth P
theorem Q1 : Mammal P ∧ ¬ HasTeeth P :=
  And.intro platypus_mammal platypus_no_teeth

-- Q2: Platypuses are reptiles: Reptile P
-- Not provable from the given premises, and we also cannot prove its negation.

-- Q3: Humans are mammals: Mammal H
-- Not provable from the given premises, and we also cannot prove its negation.

Therefore:
- Q1 is provable (True).
- Q2 is not derivable nor refutable from the premises (Unknown).
- Q3 is not derivable nor refutable from the premises (Unknown).

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
