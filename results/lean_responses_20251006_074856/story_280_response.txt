Premises: Events are either happy or sad.
At least one event is happy. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Lean translation and proof attempt:

-- We model events and their properties
universe u
constant Event : Type u
constant Happy Sad : Event → Prop

-- Translation of "Events are either happy or sad" as an exclusive or:
axiom cover : ∀ e : Event, Happy e ∨ Sad e
axiom exclusive : ∀ e : Event, ¬ (Happy e ∧ Sad e)

-- Translation of "At least one event is happy."
axiom exists_happy : ∃ e : Event, Happy e

-- Target statement: "All events are sad." We will prove its negation.
theorem not_all_events_are_sad : ¬ (∀ e : Event, Sad e) := by
  intro allSad
  obtain ⟨e, heHappy⟩ := exists_happy
  have heSad : Sad e := allSad e
  have both : Happy e ∧ Sad e := ⟨heHappy, heSad⟩
  exact (exclusive e) both

-- Conclusion: We have proved the negation of "All events are sad."
