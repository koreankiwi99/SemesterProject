Premises: All squares are four-sided.
All four-sided things are shapes. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and proof sketch:

- Universe and predicates:
  - Domain U : Type
  - Predicates: Square FourSided Shape : U → Prop
- Premises:
  - h1 : ∀ x, Square x → FourSided x
  - h2 : ∀ x, FourSided x → Shape x
- Goal:
  - ∀ x, Square x → Shape x

Lean code:

/- Domain and predicates -/
variable {U : Type} {Square FourSided Shape : U → Prop}

/- Premises imply conclusion -/
theorem squares_are_shapes
  (h1 : ∀ x, Square x → FourSided x)
  (h2 : ∀ x, FourSided x → Shape x) :
  ∀ x, Square x → Shape x :=
by
  intro x hx
  exact h2 x (h1 x hx)

This completes the proof, so the statement is True.

ANSWERS:
1: True
