Premises: A hawk never swims. 
Some birds are hawks.

Lean formalization and proof attempt:

- Domain: a type U of individuals.
- Predicates: Bird, Hawk, Swim : U → Prop.
- Premises:
  1) ∀ x, Hawk x → ¬ Swim x  (hawks never swim)
  2) ∃ x, Bird x ∧ Hawk x    (some birds are hawks)
- Claim being evaluated: ∀ x, Bird x → Swim x (all birds swim)

Lean code:

universe u

constant U : Type u
constant Bird Hawk Swim : U → Prop

axiom hawk_never_swims : ∀ x : U, Hawk x → ¬ Swim x
axiom some_birds_are_hawks : ∃ x : U, Bird x ∧ Hawk x

theorem Q1_false : ¬ (∀ x : U, Bird x → Swim x) := by
  intro hAll
  rcases some_birds_are_hawks with ⟨a, haB, haH⟩
  have hSwim : Swim a := hAll a haB
  have hNot : ¬ Swim a := hawk_never_swims a haH
  exact hNot hSwim

Explanation: From the existence of a bird that is a hawk and the fact that hawks never swim, we obtain a bird that does not swim, contradicting “all birds swim.” Thus we have proved the negation of the statement.
