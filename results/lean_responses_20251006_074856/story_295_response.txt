Premises: Some affection is love.
Some love is positive.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Lean translation and attempt:

- Universe of discourse: U : Type
- Predicates:
  - Affection : U → Prop
  - Love : U → Prop
  - Positive : U → Prop
- Premises:
  - h1 : ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Love x        -- “Some affection is love.”
  - h2 : ∃ x, Love x ∧ Positive x         -- “Some love is positive.”
- Goal to prove:
  - ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x         -- “Some affection is positive.”

Lean attempt (cannot be proven in general):

universe u

variable {U : Type u} (Affection Love Positive : U → Prop)

theorem some_affection_positive
  (h1 : ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Love x)
  (h2 : ∃ x, Love x ∧ Positive x) :
  ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x := by
  -- Not derivable in general: the witnesses for the two existentials may differ.
  sorry

Countermodel in Lean showing the conclusion does not follow from the premises:

example :
  ∃ (U : Type) (Affection Love Positive : U → Prop),
    (∃ x, Affection x ∧ Love x) ∧
    (∃ x, Love x ∧ Positive x) ∧
    ¬ (∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x) := by
  let U := Bool
  let Affection : U → Prop := fun b => b = true
  let Love : U → Prop := fun _ => True
  let Positive : U → Prop := fun b => b = false
  refine ⟨U, Affection, Love, Positive, ?_⟩
  refine ⟨?h1, ?h2, ?hnot⟩
  · exact ⟨true, by simp [Affection, Love]⟩
  · exact ⟨false, by simp [Love, Positive]⟩
  · intro hx
    rcases hx with ⟨x, hxA, hxP⟩
    cases x
    · simpa [Affection] using hxA
    · simpa [Positive] using hxP

Conclusion: The statement “Some affection is positive” is not entailed by the premises, nor is its negation entailed. Therefore, its truth value is uncertain given the information.
