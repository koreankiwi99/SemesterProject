Here is a Lean formalization of the problem and proofs for what can be derived.

namespace Reasoning

universe u

constant Restaurant : Type u
constant L N T R P : Restaurant → Prop
constant s : Restaurant

-- Premises
axiom ax1 : ∀ x, L x → ¬ N x
axiom ax2 : ∀ x, R x → L x
axiom ax3 : ∃ x, ¬ T x ∧ N x
axiom ax4 : ∀ x, P x → R x
axiom ax5 : R s ∨ P s

-- Deductions about s
lemma R_s : R s := by
  cases ax5 with
  | inl rs => exact rs
  | inr ps => exact ax4 s ps

lemma notN_s : ¬ N s := by
  have Ls : L s := ax2 s R_s
  exact ax1 s Ls

-- Question 1
theorem Q1 : (T s ∧ N s) → (R s ∧ ¬ T s) := by
  intro h
  have ns : N s := h.right
  have contra : False := notN_s ns
  have rs : R s := R_s
  have nts : ¬ T s := by
    intro ts
    exact False.elim contra
  exact And.intro rs nts

-- Question 2
theorem Q2 : T s ∨ ¬ N s := Or.inr notN_s

-- Question 3 cannot be derived from the premises.
