Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and proofs:

We work over a universe U of entities with predicates:
- BakedSweet, Spicy, Cupcake, MalaHotpot, BBM : U → Prop
- DTC : U is the entity “Dried Thai chilies”

Assumptions from the context:
1. h1: ∀ x, BakedSweet x → ¬ Spicy x
2. h2: ∀ x, Cupcake x → BakedSweet x
3. h3: ∀ x, MalaHotpot x → Spicy x
4. h4: ∀ x, BBM x → Cupcake x
5. h5: Spicy DTC ∨ MalaHotpot DTC ∨ ¬ BakedSweet DTC

Lean code:
