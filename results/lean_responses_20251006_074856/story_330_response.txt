Story ID: 330
Premises: All people who make wedding plans are people who are engaged.
All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans.
If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and attempt:

We model people as a type Person with predicates:
- MakesPlans, Engaged, InvitesOthers, InvitesFriends, WellAttended, LargerFamily : Person → Prop
- a constant John : Person

Axioms (from the text):
1. ∀x, MakesPlans x → Engaged x
2. ∀x, InvitesOthers x → MakesPlans x
3. ∀x, WellAttended x → InvitesOthers x
4. ∃x, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
5. Engaged John → (¬ InvitesFriends John ∧ MakesPlans John)
6. LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InvitesFriends John)

Some derived facts we can prove:
- For John, Engaged John ↔ MakesPlans John:
  • Engaged John → MakesPlans John by (5).
  • MakesPlans John → Engaged John by (1).
- ∀x, WellAttended x → Engaged x by chaining (3) → (2) → (1).
- In particular, WellAttended John → Engaged John, hence WellAttended John → ¬InvitesFriends John by (5).

Attempted goals:

Q1: LargerFamily John.
- Not derivable from the axioms. It is consistent both that John has a larger family and that he does not. Axiom (4) only asserts the existence of someone (not necessarily John) with a well-attended wedding and a larger family. Axiom (6) gives only a conditional from LargerFamily John, not the antecedent.

Q2: ¬ LargerFamily John.
- Also not derivable. No axiom rules out LargerFamily John.

Q3: Engaged John.
- Not derivable. We can show that WellAttended John implies Engaged John, and that Engaged John is equivalent to MakesPlans John for John, but we have no premise making either antecedent true for John.

Q4: ¬LargerFamily John ∧ ¬InvitesOthers John.
- Not derivable. There is no axiom implying either ¬LargerFamily John or ¬InvitesOthers John. In fact, if John had a well-attended wedding, then InvitesOthers John would follow by (3).

Conclusion: None of the four statements can be proved or refuted from the given axioms in this formalization.
