-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom H1 : ∀ x, At x → (GSC x ∨ ONA x)
axiom H2 : ∀ x, At x → (GSC x → ProTennis x)
axiom H3 : ∀ x, At x → (ONA x → Celebrity x)
axiom H4 : ∀ x, At x → (ProTennis x → Athlete x)
axiom H5 : ∀ x, At x → (Celebrity x → WellPaid x)
axiom H6 : ∀ x, At x → (Athlete x → Famous x)
axiom H7 : ∀ x, At x → (WellPaid x → TaxHaven x)

-- Djokovic-specific facts
axiom H8a : At djokovic
axiom H8b : (Famous djokovic ∧ Athlete djokovic) → WellPaid djokovic

-- Helpful lemmas
lemma famous_of_athlete_at {x} (hxAt : At x) (hAth : Athlete x) : Famous x :=
  (H6 x hxAt) hAth

lemma athlete_of_gsc_at {x} (hxAt : At x) (hG : GSC x) : Athlete x :=
  let hPT := (H2 x hxAt) hG
  (H4 x hxAt) hPT

-- Djokovic is well-paid (by cases on H1 and using H8b in the GSC branch)
lemma wellPaid_djokovic : WellPaid djokovic :=
by
  have hdisj : GSC djokovic ∨ ONA djokovic := H1 djokovic H8a
  cases hdisj with
  | inl hG =>
      have hA : Athlete djokovic := athlete_of_gsc_at H8a hG

      exact H8b ⟨hF, hA⟩
  | inr hO =>
      have hC : Celebrity djokovic := (H3 djokovic H8a) hO
      exact (H5 djokovic H8a) hC

-- Q2: Djokovic lives in a tax haven (provable)
theorem q2 : TaxHaven djokovic :=
  (H7 djokovic H8a) wellPaid_djokovic

-- Q3: "Djokovic does not live in a tax haven" is false
theorem q3_false : ¬ (¬ TaxHaven djokovic) :=
by
  intro h
  exact h q2

-- Q1 remains undecided: we have only H1 djokovic H8a : GSC djokovic ∨ ONA djokovic
