Story ID: 343
Premises: No digital media are analog.
Every printed text is analog media.
All streaming services are digital media.
If an object is a hardcover book, then it is printed text.
If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and proof attempt:

We model entities and predicates:
- Entity: the domain of objects.
- Digital, Analog, PrintedText, StreamingService, HardcoverBook: predicates on Entity.
- book1984: a constant for “1984”.

Assumptions from the text:
1. ∀x, Digital x → ¬ Analog x
2. ∀x, PrintedText x → Analog x
3. ∀x, StreamingService x → Digital x
4. ∀x, HardcoverBook x → PrintedText x
5. StreamingService book1984 → HardcoverBook book1984

Lean code:

universe u

constant Entity : Type u
constant Digital : Entity → Prop
constant Analog : Entity → Prop
constant PrintedText : Entity → Prop
constant StreamingService : Entity → Prop
constant HardcoverBook : Entity → Prop
constant book1984 : Entity

axiom no_digital_are_analog : ∀ x, Digital x → ¬ Analog x
axiom printed_are_analog : ∀ x, PrintedText x → Analog x
axiom streaming_are_digital : ∀ x, StreamingService x → Digital x
axiom hardcover_are_printed : ∀ x, HardcoverBook x → PrintedText x
axiom streaming1984_implies_hardcover1984 : StreamingService book1984 → HardcoverBook book1984

-- Key consequence: 1984 is not a streaming service.
theorem not_streaming_1984 : ¬ StreamingService book1984 := by
  intro hstream
  have hd : Digital book1984 := streaming_are_digital book1984 hstream
  have hh : HardcoverBook book1984 := streaming1984_implies_hardcover1984 hstream
  have hp : PrintedText book1984 := hardcover_are_printed book1984 hh
  have ha : Analog book1984 := printed_are_analog book1984 hp
  have hna : ¬ Analog book1984 := no_digital_are_analog book1984 hd
  exact hna ha

-- From the premises alone, we cannot derive PrintedText book1984, nor its negation.
-- But we can prove Q2 is false (since its negation holds) and Q3 is true.

theorem q2_false : ¬ StreamingService book1984 := not_streaming_1984
theorem q3_true : ¬ StreamingService book1984 := not_streaming_1984

Conclusions:
- Q1 (1984 is printed text): Cannot be derived; also cannot derive its negation. Unknown.
- Q2 (1984 is a streaming service): Its negation is provable, so False.
- Q3 (1984 is not a streaming service): Provable, so True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
