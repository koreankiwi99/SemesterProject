Story ID: 350
Premises: All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style. 
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.

Lean formalization and attempt:

universe u
constant U : Type u

-- Predicates
constant Design : U → Prop        -- design by Max
constant Adores : U → Prop        -- Max adores it
constant Brutalist : U → Prop
constant Interesting : U → Prop
constant Evocative : U → Prop
constant Dreamy : U → Prop
constant Zaha : U → Prop          -- Zaha Hadid's design style
constant Kelly : U → Prop         -- Kelly Wearstler's design style

-- Premises
constant h1 : ∀ x:U, Zaha x ∧ Adores x → Interesting x
constant h2 : ∀ x:U, Brutalist x ∧ Adores x → ¬ Interesting x
constant h3 : ∀ x:U, Adores x → (Zaha x ∨ Kelly x)
constant h4 : ∀ x:U, Kelly x ∧ Adores x → Evocative x
constant h5 : ∀ x:U, Kelly x ∧ Adores x → Dreamy x
constant h6 : ∀ x:U, Design x ∧ Adores x ∧ Interesting x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- Useful consequence: a design by Max that he adores cannot be interesting
lemma no_interesting_adored_design : ∀ x:U, Design x ∧ Adores x ∧ Interesting x → False :=
begin
  intro x, intro h,
  have hb : Brutalist x := (h6 x h).left,
  have hni : ¬ Interesting x := h2 x ⟨hb, h.2.1⟩,
  exact hni h.2.2,
end

-- Questions encoded
def Q1 : Prop := ∃ x:U, Design x ∧ Brutalist x
def Q2 : Prop := ∃ x:U, Design x ∧ Evocative x ∧ Dreamy x
def Q3 : Prop := ∃ x:U, Design x ∧ (Evocative x ∨ Dreamy x)

-- Attempted proofs:
-- From the given premises, there is no information guaranteeing the existence of any design by Max,
-- nor linking "Design" to "Adores" unconditionally. Thus Q1, Q2, and Q3 cannot be proved.
-- Likewise, the negations ¬Q1, ¬Q2, ¬Q3 also cannot be derived from the premises.

Conclusion: None of the three statements can be determined from the premises.
