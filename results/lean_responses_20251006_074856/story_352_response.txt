Story ID: 352
Premises: All business organizations are legal entities.
All companies are business organizations.
All private companies are companies.
All legal entities are created under law. 
All legal entities have legal obligations.
If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company.

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and proofs attempt:

universe u

constant Entity : Type u

-- Predicates
constant BusinessOrg : Entity → Prop
constant Company : Entity → Prop
constant PrivateCompany : Entity → Prop
constant LegalEntity : Entity → Prop
constant CreatedUnderLaw : Entity → Prop
constant HasLegalObligations : Entity → Prop

-- The Harvard Weekly Book Club
constant H : Entity

-- Axioms
axiom A1 : ∀ x, BusinessOrg x → LegalEntity x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Company x → BusinessOrg x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom A6 : CreatedUnderLaw H → ¬ PrivateCompany H

-- Derived chains
lemma pc_to_company {x} (hpc : PrivateCompany x) : Company x := A3 x hpc
lemma company_to_bo {x} (hc : Company x) : BusinessOrg x := A2 x hc
lemma bo_to_le {x} (hbo : BusinessOrg x) : LegalEntity x := A1 x hbo
lemma le_to_cu {x} (hle : LegalEntity x) : CreatedUnderLaw x := A4 x hle
lemma le_to_lo {x} (hle : LegalEntity x) : HasLegalObligations x := A5 x hle

lemma pc_to_le {x} (hpc : PrivateCompany x) : LegalEntity x :=
  bo_to_le (company_to_bo (pc_to_company hpc))

lemma pc_to_cu {x} (hpc : PrivateCompany x) : CreatedUnderLaw x :=
  le_to_cu (pc_to_le hpc)

lemma pc_to_lo {x} (hpc : PrivateCompany x) : HasLegalObligations x :=
  le_to_lo (pc_to_le hpc)

-- H cannot be a private company
theorem not_pc_H : ¬ PrivateCompany H := by
  intro hpc
  have hcu : CreatedUnderLaw H := pc_to_cu hpc
  have hnpc : ¬ PrivateCompany H := A6 hcu
  exact hnpc hpc

-- Q2 is false: the conjunction cannot hold
theorem Q2_false : ¬ (HasLegalObligations H ∧ PrivateCompany H) := by
  intro hconj
  exact not_pc_H hconj.right

-- Q3 is true: private company implies (LO or CU) in fact both
theorem Q3_true : PrivateCompany H → (HasLegalObligations H ∨ CreatedUnderLaw H) := by
  intro hpc
  have hlo : HasLegalObligations H := pc_to_lo hpc
  exact Or.inl hlo

Remarks:
- Q1 (HasLegalObligations H) is not derivable from the axioms, nor is its negation; we lack any premise making H a legal entity or otherwise forcing it to have legal obligations.
- Q2 is refutable because PrivateCompany H is impossible (not_pc_H).
- Q3 is provable since PrivateCompany H implies LegalEntity H, hence both HasLegalObligations H and CreatedUnderLaw H.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
