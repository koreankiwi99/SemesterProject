Premises: All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.
All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.
All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.

-- Axioms from the text
axiom hR_C    : ∀ x, R x → C x
axiom hH_R    : ∀ x, H x → R x
axiom hF_H    : ∀ x, F x → H x
axiom hD_notC : ∀ x, D x → ¬ C x
axiom hG_F    : ∀ x, G x → F x
axiom taylor_either : (H taylor ∧ D taylor) ∨ (¬ H taylor ∧ ¬ D taylor)

-- Derivations:
-- 1) H ∧ D is impossible (it yields C ∧ ¬C)
lemma not_H_and_D : ¬ (H taylor ∧ D taylor) := by
  intro h
  have ht : H taylor := h.left
  have dt : D taylor := h.right
  have rt : R taylor := hH_R taylor ht
  have ct : C taylor := hR_C taylor rt
  have nct : ¬ C taylor := hD_notC taylor dt
  exact nct ct

-- 2) Therefore the given disjunction forces the second case: ¬H ∧ ¬D
lemma notH_and_notD : ¬ H taylor ∧ ¬ D taylor := by
  cases taylor_either with
  | inl hhd =>
      exact False.elim (not_H_and_D hhd)
  | inr hnn =>
      exact hnn

-- 3) From G → F → H and ¬H, we get ¬G (modus tollens)
lemma notG : ¬ G taylor := by
  intro gt
  have ft : F taylor := hG_F taylor gt
  have ht : H taylor := hF_H taylor ft
  exact (notH_and_notD.left) ht

-- Consequences matching the questions:
-- Q2 is false (we proved ¬G taylor)
theorem Q2_neg : ¬ G taylor := notG

-- Q3 is true (we have ¬H taylor and ¬G taylor)
theorem Q3 : ¬ H taylor ∧ ¬ G taylor := And.intro notH_and_notD.left notG

-- For Q1 (R taylor), neither R taylor nor ¬ R taylor follows from the axioms above.

Reasoning summary:
- From H → R → C and D → ¬C, H ∧ D is impossible. Thus, Taylor must satisfy ¬H ∧ ¬D.
- From G → F → H and ¬H, we conclude ¬G. Hence Q2 is false, and Q3 (¬H ∧ ¬G) is true.
- Nothing in the premises lets us derive R or ¬R from ¬H and the other facts; thus Q1 is undetermined.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
