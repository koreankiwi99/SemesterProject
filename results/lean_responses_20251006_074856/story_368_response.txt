Lean formalization and proofs sketch:

- Types and predicates:
  Person : Type
  At : Person → Prop                      -- is at Mary's school
  Works : Person → Prop                   -- works in student jobs on campus
  Needs : Person → Prop                   -- needs to earn money to help pay tuition
  Orders : Person → Prop                  -- orders takeout frequently in college
  Enjoys : Person → Prop                  -- enjoys dining hall meals and recipes
  Picky : Person → Prop                   -- is a picky eater
  Dines : Person → Prop                   -- spends a lot of time eating/catching up in dining halls
  H : Person                              -- Hannah

- Axioms from the text:
  A1: ∀ x, At x ∧ Works x → Needs x
  A2: ∀ x, At x ∧ Orders x → Works x
  A3: ∀ x, At x → (Orders x ∨ Enjoys x)
  A4: ∀ x, At x ∧ Enjoys x → ¬ Picky x
  A5: ∀ x, At x ∧ Enjoys x → Dines x
  A6: At H
  A7a: Works H
  A7b: Needs H → (¬ Picky H ∧ ¬ Needs H)

- Derived facts:
  needs_H: Needs H
    from A1 with A6 and A7a.
  not_needs_H: ¬ Needs H
    from A7b: Needs H → (¬Picky H ∧ ¬Needs H), hence Needs H → ¬Needs H, and thus ¬Needs H (since (p → ¬p) ⟹ ¬p).
  not_picky_H: ¬ Picky H
    from A7b applied to needs_H.
  false_from_contra: False
    from not_needs_H needs_H.

- Question 1: Needs H is directly proved (needs_H). Hence provable.

- Question 2: We need At H ∧ ¬Picky H ∧ Dines H.
  At H is A6. ¬Picky H is not_picky_H. Dines H follows by ex falso (False.elim false_from_contra).
  Hence provable in Lean.

- Question 3: We need At H ∧ (¬Picky H ∨ (Picky H → Dines H)).
  At H is A6. The left disjunct ¬Picky H holds (not_picky_H), so the disjunction holds. Hence provable.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: True
