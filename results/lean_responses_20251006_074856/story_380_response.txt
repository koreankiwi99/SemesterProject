Story ID: 380
Premises: People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. 
Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean translation and proof attempt:

We model a domain of people with predicates for the relevant properties, and Bonnie as a designated individual.

Lean setup:
- Person : Type
- InClub, PerformsOften, AttendsEngaged, Inactive, Chaperones, Student, YoungOrTeen, Wishes : Person → Prop
- Bonnie : Person

Assumptions translated from the text:
1) ∀ x, InClub x ∧ PerformsOften x → AttendsEngaged x
2) ∀ x, InClub x → (PerformsOften x ∨ Inactive x)
3) ∀ x, InClub x ∧ Chaperones x → ¬ Student x
4) ∀ x, InClub x ∧ Inactive x → Chaperones x
5) ∀ x, InClub x ∧ YoungOrTeen x ∧ Wishes x → Student x
6) InClub Bonnie
7) (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ Student Bonnie) ∨ (¬ AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬ Student Bonnie)

Lean code:

constant Person : Type

constant InClub : Person → Prop
constant PerformsOften : Person → Prop
constant AttendsEngaged : Person → Prop
constant Inactive : Person → Prop
constant Chaperones : Person → Prop
constant Student : Person → Prop
constant YoungOrTeen : Person → Prop
constant Wishes : Person → Prop

constant Bonnie : Person

axiom h1 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x ∧ PerformsOften x → AttendsEngaged x
axiom h2 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x → (PerformsOften x ∨ Inactive x)
axiom h3 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x ∧ Chaperones x → ¬ Student x
axiom h4 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x ∧ Inactive x → Chaperones x
axiom h5 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x ∧ YoungOrTeen x ∧ Wishes x → Student x

axiom hbClub : InClub Bonnie
axiom hbEquiv : (AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ Student Bonnie) ∨ (¬ AttendsEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬ Student Bonnie)

-- Useful derived facts
lemma perform_implies_student : PerformsOften Bonnie → Student Bonnie := by
  intro hP
  have hA : AttendsEngaged Bonnie := h1 Bonnie ⟨hbClub, hP⟩
  cases hbEquiv with
  | inl hAS => exact hAS.right
  | inr hNS => exact False.elim (hNS.left hA)

lemma student_or_inactive : Student Bonnie ∨ Inactive Bonnie := by
  have h := h2 Bonnie hbClub
  cases h with
  | inl hP => exact Or.inl (perform_implies_student hP)
  | inr hI => exact Or.inr hI

-- Question 2 statement and proof
-- If ( (YoungOrTeen ∧ Wishes ∧ Chaperones) ∨ ¬(YoungOrTeen ∧ Wishes) ), then Student ∨ Inactive.
theorem Q2 :
  ((YoungOrTeen Bonnie ∧ Wishes Bonnie ∧ Chaperones Bonnie) ∨ ¬ (YoungOrTeen Bonnie ∧ Wishes Bonnie))
  → (Student Bonnie ∨ Inactive Bonnie) := by
  intro _
  exact student_or_inactive

-- For Question 3, the antecedent is derivable:
lemma not_chap_imp_perform : (¬ Chaperones Bonnie) → PerformsOften Bonnie := by
  intro hnot
  have h := h2 Bonnie hbClub
  cases h with
  | inl hP => exact hP
  | inr hI =>
      have hCh : Chaperones Bonnie := h4 Bonnie ⟨hbClub, hI⟩
      exact False.elim (hnot hCh)

lemma ant3_true : Chaperones Bonnie ∨ ((¬ Chaperones Bonnie) → PerformsOften Bonnie) := by
  exact Or.inr not_chap_imp_perform

Notes on the three questions:
- Q1 (Bonnie performs often): From InClub Bonnie, we get PerformsOften ∨ Inactive. Inactive implies Chaperones, which implies ¬Student, hence ¬AttendsEngaged by Bonnie’s given equivalence. Since PerformsOften implies AttendsEngaged, the two disjuncts are incompatible, but nothing forces either one; thus we cannot determine PerformsOften Bonnie. Unknown.
- Q2: As proved in Lean (theorem Q2), independent of the antecedent, InClub Bonnie entails Student ∨ Inactive. True.
- Q3: The antecedent is provable (lemma ant3_true), but the consequent (YoungOrTeen ∧ Wishes ∧ Inactive) is neither entailed nor refutable from the given information. Therefore the implication cannot be proved or disproved. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: Unknown

Questions and Results:
==================================================
Q1: Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes

Q3: If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: No
