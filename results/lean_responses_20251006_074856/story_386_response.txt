Story ID: 386
Premises: If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and attempt at proofs:

We model diseases as a type, with predicates for properties and kinds of diseases, and a constant for colorectal cancer.

- Deadly x → Low x
- Severe x → Deadly x
- BDC x → Severe x
- Chol x → BDC x
- MildFlu x → Low x
- ¬(BDC colorectal ∧ Low colorectal)

From these we derive:
- For any x, BDC x → Low x (by chaining the first three axioms).
- Hence ¬BDC colorectal (otherwise we would have both BDC and Low for colorectal, contradicting the last axiom).
- Hence ¬Chol colorectal (since Chol → BDC).

With ¬BDC colorectal and ¬Chol colorectal, the antecedent of Q2 is impossible, making Q2 vacuously true. For Q3, since ¬Chol colorectal, any statement that conjunctively requires Chol colorectal is false.

-- Q1: Severe colorectal? Neither provable nor refutable from given axioms.

  intro h

    cases h with
    | inl hb => exact not_bdc_col hb
    | inr hc => exact not_bdc_col (H4 colorectal hc)
  exact False.elim this

theorem Q3_false :
  ¬ ((Chol colorectal ∧ (MildFlu colorectal ∨ BDC colorectal)) ∨
     (Chol colorectal ∧ MildFlu colorectal ∧ BDC colorectal)) := by
  intro h
  cases h with

  | inr h2 => exact not_chol_col h2.left

end Reasoning

Conclusions:
- Q1 cannot be proved or refuted from the premises.
- Q2 is provable (vacuously true because the antecedent is impossible).
- Q3 is refutable; we proved its negation.
