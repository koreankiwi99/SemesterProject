Story ID: 426
Premises: All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. 
Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. 
Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. 
No managers work remotely from home. 
James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean translation and attempt:

We model a domain of persons with predicates:
- Employee, Sched, Go, Lc (lunch in company), Lh (lunch at home), R (works remotely from home), Abroad, Manager : Person → Prop
- james : Person

Axioms (from the text):
1. ∀x, Employee x ∧ Sched x → Go x
2. ∀x, Lc x → Sched x
3. ∀x, Employee x → Lc x ∨ Lh x
4. ∀x, Employee x ∧ Lh x → R x
5. ∀x, Employee x ∧ Abroad x → R x
6. ∀x, Manager x → ¬ R x
7. Go james ↔ Manager james

Goals:
- Q1: Lc james
- Q2: ¬ Lc james
- Q3: ((Manager james ∨ Abroad james) → ¬ (Lh james ∨ R james)) ∧ ((Lh james ∨ R james) → (¬ Manager james ∧ ¬ Abroad james))

Attempted proofs:
- Q1 cannot be derived: the axioms relating lunch locations apply only to employees, and we are not given that james is an employee. A2 alone (Lc → Sched) does not force Lc james.
- Q2 cannot be derived for the same reason; there is no axiom implying ¬Lc james.
- Q3 cannot be derived: from Manager james we get ¬R james (A6), but we cannot conclude ¬Lh james without also knowing james is an employee (A4’s antecedent). Likewise, from Lh james ∨ R james we cannot conclude ¬Manager james or ¬Abroad james without additional employee information. Moreover, the statement is not forced by the axioms; for example, a model where james is a manager, not an employee, has lunch at home, and does not work remotely satisfies all axioms but falsifies Q3. The negation of Q3 is also not derivable from the axioms.

Therefore, none of the three are provable nor is any negation provable.

Q1: James has lunch in the company.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q2: James does not have lunch in the company.
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Unknown
Correct: Yes

Q3: If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James does not either has lunch at home or work remotely from home. If James either has lunch at home or works remotely from home, then he is neither a manager nor does he work in other countries. [contrapositive is more natural]
