axiom H1 : ∀ x, Nice x → ¬ Mean x                       -- No one nice to animals is also mean to animals.
axiom H2 : ∃ x, Grumpy x ∧ Mean x                        -- Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
axiom H3 : ∀ x, AnimalLover x → Nice x                   -- All animal lovers are nice to animals.
axiom H4 : ∀ x, PetOwner x → AnimalLover x               -- All pet owners love animals.
axiom H5 : PetOwner Tom                                  -- Tom is a pet owner.

Summary of what was proved:
- Q1: neither provable nor refutable from the premises (Unknown).
- Q2: proved true.
- Q3: proved false (we proved the negation of the given implication).

ANSWERS:
