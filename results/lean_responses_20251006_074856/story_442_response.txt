Lean formalization and proof attempts

Translation of predicates and entities:
- Entity: the domain of discourse (animals/things mentioned)
- Pet : Entity → Prop
- BrownSwiss : Entity → Prop
- Cow : Entity → Prop
- Domesticated : Entity → Prop
- Alligator : Entity → Prop
- Ted : Entity

Axioms (from the text):
- ax1: ∀ x, BrownSwiss x → Cow x
- ax2: ∃ x, Pet x ∧ BrownSwiss x
- ax3: ∀ x, Cow x → Domesticated x
- ax4: ∀ x, Alligator x → ¬Domesticated x
- ax5: Alligator Ted

Lean code:
universe u

constant Entity : Type u

constant Pet : Entity → Prop
constant BrownSwiss : Entity → Prop
constant Cow : Entity → Prop
constant Domesticated : Entity → Prop
constant Alligator : Entity → Prop
constant Ted : Entity

axiom ax1 : ∀ x, BrownSwiss x → Cow x
axiom ax2 : ∃ x, Pet x ∧ BrownSwiss x
axiom ax3 : ∀ x, Cow x → Domesticated x
axiom ax4 : ∀ x, Alligator x → ¬ Domesticated x
axiom ax5 : Alligator Ted

lemma not_dom_Ted : ¬ Domesticated Ted := by
  have h := ax4 Ted
  exact h ax5

lemma not_cow_Ted : ¬ Cow Ted := by
  intro hCow
  have hDom : Domesticated Ted := ax3 Ted hCow

lemma not_BS_Ted : ¬ BrownSwiss Ted := by

  have hCow : Cow Ted := ax1 Ted hBS

-- Q1: We cannot derive Pet Ted nor its negation from the given axioms.

-- Q2: "Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle" is false (we prove its negation).
theorem Q2_neg : ¬ (Pet Ted ∧ BrownSwiss Ted) := by
  intro h
  have hBS : BrownSwiss Ted := h.right
  exact not_BS_Ted hBS

-- Q3: If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet.
theorem Q3 : BrownSwiss Ted → ¬ Pet Ted := by
  intro hBS
  have hCow : Cow Ted := ax1 Ted hBS
  have hDom : Domesticated Ted := ax3 Ted hCow
  have hF : False := not_dom_Ted hDom
  intro _; exact hF

Commentary on the three questions:
- Q1 (Ted is a pet): Not derivable; no axioms link being an alligator with being a pet (or not a pet). Unknown.
- Q2 (Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle): We proved ¬BrownSwiss Ted, hence the conjunction is impossible. False (we can prove the negation).
- Q3 (If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet): Provable, since BrownSwiss Ted would force Domesticated Ted, contradicting that alligators are not domesticated; from that contradiction we can derive ¬Pet Ted. True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
