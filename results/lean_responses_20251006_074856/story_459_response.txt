Story ID: 459
Premises: Jane does not like any animals that bark.
All dogs are animals that bark.
Jane likes all animals that jump.
If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. 
KiKi is an animal.
If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.

Lean formalization and attempt:

We model a single universe of entities with predicates for Animal, Dog, Barks, Jumps, Legs, Terricolous, and a binary Likes. We introduce constants jane and kiki and encode the premises.

-- Lean 4 code (sketch)

universe u
constant U : Type u

-- entities
constant jane kiki : U

-- predicates
constant Animal Barks Dog Jumps Legs Terricolous : U → Prop
constant Likes : U → U → Prop

-- premises
axiom h1 : ∀ x : U, Animal x ∧ Barks x → ¬ Likes jane x
axiom h2 : ∀ x : U, Dog x → Animal x ∧ Barks x
axiom h3 : ∀ x : U, Animal x ∧ Jumps x → Likes jane x
axiom h4 : ∀ x : U, Animal x ∧ Legs x → Jumps x
axiom h5 : ∀ x : U, Animal x ∧ Terricolous x → Legs x
axiom h6 : Animal kiki
axiom h7 : (¬ Jumps kiki ∧ ¬ Legs kiki) → (Terricolous kiki ∨ Legs kiki)

-- some derivable consequences (but none settle the questions)
lemma terricolous_implies_likes : Terricolous kiki → Likes jane kiki :=
by
  intro hk
  have hk_legs : Legs kiki := (h5 kiki) ⟨h6, hk⟩
  have hk_jumps : Jumps kiki := (h4 kiki) ⟨h6, hk_legs⟩
  exact (h3 kiki) ⟨h6, hk_jumps⟩

lemma dog_implies_barks : Dog kiki → Barks kiki :=
by
  intro hk
  exact (h2 kiki hk).2

lemma dog_implies_not_likes : Dog kiki → ¬ Likes jane kiki :=
by
  intro hk
  have : Animal kiki ∧ Barks kiki := h2 kiki hk
  exact (h1 kiki) this

-- An inconsistency if kiki were both a dog and terricolous
lemma not_dog_and_terricolous : ¬ (Dog kiki ∧ Terricolous kiki) :=
by
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨hk_dog, hk_terr⟩
  have : Likes jane kiki := terricolous_implies_likes hk_terr
  have : False := (dog_implies_not_likes hk_dog) this
  exact this.elim

-- However, none of the following are derivable from the axioms:
-- 1) Terricolous kiki
-- 2) Dog kiki ∧ Barks kiki
-- 3) ¬ Barks kiki ∧ ¬ Dog kiki
-- and neither are their negations, given the current premises.

Conclusion of the attempt:
- Q1 (Terricolous kiki): cannot be proved or refuted from the premises.
- Q2 (Dog kiki ∧ Barks kiki): cannot be proved or refuted from the premises.
- Q3 (¬Barks kiki ∧ ¬Dog kiki): cannot be proved or refuted from the premises.
