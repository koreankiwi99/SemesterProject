Story ID: 46
Premises: Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic animals.
Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s to resemble the aurochs.
Heck cattle are animals.
Aurochs are animals.
Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals.

Lean formalization and attempt:

universe u

constant U : Type u

-- Predicates on entities
constant Animal : U → Prop
constant HeckCattle : U → Prop
constant Aurochs : U → Prop
constant Extinct : U → Prop
constant BredBack : U → Prop
constant ArtificiallySelected : U → Prop
constant Resembles : U → U → Prop

-- Axioms from the textual context
-- 1) Breeding back is a form of artificial selection
axiom ax1 : ∀ x, BredBack x → ArtificiallySelected x
-- 2) Heck cattle were bred back (in the 1920s)
axiom ax2 : ∃ x, HeckCattle x ∧ BredBack x
-- 3) Heck cattle are animals
axiom ax3 : ∀ x, HeckCattle x → Animal x
-- 4) Aurochs are animals
axiom ax4 : ∀ x, Aurochs x → Animal x
-- 5) Some animals to be bred back resemble extinct animals
axiom ax5 : ∃ x y, Animal x ∧ BredBack x ∧ Extinct y ∧ Animal y ∧ Resembles x y

-- Q1: Some Heck cattle are artificially selected.
theorem Q1 : ∃ x, HeckCattle x ∧ ArtificiallySelected x := by
  obtain ⟨x, hx, hb⟩ := ax2
  have ha : ArtificiallySelected x := ax1 x hb
  exact ⟨x, And.intro hx ha⟩
-- Proven: True

-- Q2: Aurochs are extinct. (Formalized as ∀ y, Aurochs y → Extinct y.)
-- This does not follow from the given axioms, nor does its negation.
-- Hence: Unknown


ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
