Lean formalization and proof sketch:

- Domain: a type U of animals; predicates Rabbit, Squirrel, Turtle, Near, Cute, Skittish, Calm : U → Prop; constant Rockie : U.

Axioms from the text:
1. A1: ∀ x, Rabbit x ∧ Near x → Cute x
2. A2: ∃ x, Turtle x ∧ Near x
3. A3: ∀ x, Near x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x)
4. A4: ∀ x, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
5. A5: ∀ x, Squirrel x ∧ Near x → Skittish x
6. A6: Near Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

Derived facts:
- Near Rockie and Calm Rockie from A6.
- ¬ Squirrel Rockie: if Squirrel Rockie, then by A5 and Near Rockie, Skittish Rockie; by A4, ¬ Calm Rockie, contradicting Calm Rockie.
- From A3 and ¬ Squirrel Rockie, we get Rabbit Rockie; with A1 and Near Rockie, Cute Rockie.
- ¬ Skittish Rockie: from A4 and Calm Rockie.

Answers:
- Q1 (Rockie is a turtle): Not derivable; also its negation not derivable from the axioms. Unknown.
- Q2 (Rockie is not a turtle): Also not derivable. Unknown.
- Q3 (Rockie is a turtle or cute): True, since Cute Rockie is provable.
- Q4 (If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish): True, since Cute Rockie is provable unconditionally.
- Q5 (If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle): False. We have Cute Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie, but ¬ Skittish Rockie, so the consequent fails; hence the implication is false.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: True
4: True
5: False
