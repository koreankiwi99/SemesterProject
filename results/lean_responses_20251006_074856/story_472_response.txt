Story ID: 472
Premises: Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating. 
All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
All queen bees are bees.
Harry is a bee.

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean translation and analysis:

We model a single-sorted first-order setting with the following predicates on a domain U:
- Animal, Invertebrate, Vertebrate, Backbone, MF (reproduces by male-and-female mating), Bee, QueenBee : U → Prop
- A constant harry : U

Axioms, formalizing the textual context:
1. A1: ∀ x, Animal x → (Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x)
2. A2: ∀ x, (Animal x ∧ Backbone x) → MF x
3. A3: ∀ x, Vertebrate x → Backbone x
4. A4: ∀ x, Bee x → ¬ MF x
5. A5: ∀ x, QueenBee x → Bee x
6. A6: Bee harry

Immediate consequences:
- From A6 and A4: ¬ MF harry.
- There is no given axiom linking Bee to Animal, so we cannot conclude Animal harry.
- From A3 we have Vertebrate x → Backbone x, but there is no axiom Vertebrate x → Animal x.

Question 1: “Harry is a queen bee.”
- From A5 we only have QueenBee → Bee, not the converse, and no other information forces QueenBee harry. We also cannot derive ¬ QueenBee harry from the axioms.
- Hence neither QueenBee harry nor its negation is derivable from A1–A6.

Question 2: “Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee.”
- We cannot use A1 (Animal → Invertebrate ∨ Vertebrate) without knowing Animal harry.
- We also cannot derive QueenBee harry from Bee harry.
- The disjunction may be true in some models (e.g., if QueenBee harry holds) and false in others (e.g., if neither Invertebrate harry nor QueenBee harry holds while Animal harry is false so A1 does not apply). Thus neither the statement nor its negation is derivable.

Question 3: “If Harry is either both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone, or neither a vertebrate nor an animal with a backbone, then Harry is neither an invertebrate nor a queen bee.”
- Formalize the antecedent as:
  ((Vertebrate harry ∧ Animal harry ∧ Backbone harry) ∨ (¬ Vertebrate harry ∧ ¬(Animal harry ∧ Backbone harry)))
  and the consequent as (¬ Invertebrate harry ∧ ¬ QueenBee harry).
- This implication is not entailed by the axioms. For consistency witness making it false, take a model with:
  Bee harry = true, QueenBee harry = true, MF harry = false, Animal harry = true, Invertebrate harry = true, Vertebrate harry = false, Backbone harry = false.
  All axioms A1–A6 hold, the antecedent is true, and the consequent is false; so the implication is false in this model.
- Its negation is also not entailed (e.g., set QueenBee and Invertebrate both false; then the consequent is true and the implication holds). Thus neither the implication nor its negation is derivable from A1–A6.

Conclusion in Lean-proof terms:
- Q1: cannot be proved; its negation also cannot be proved → Unknown.
- Q2: cannot be proved; its negation also cannot be proved → Unknown.
- Q3: cannot be proved; its negation also cannot be proved → Unknown.
