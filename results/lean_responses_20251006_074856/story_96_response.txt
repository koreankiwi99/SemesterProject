Lean formalization and attempt:

We model entities and predicates:
- Entity : Type
- Stable : Entity → Prop
- leads : Entity → Entity → Prop
- includes : Entity → Entity → Prop
- feud_with : Entity → Entity → Prop

Constants:
- DiamondMine, RoderickStrong, CreedBrothers, IvyNile, Imperium : Entity

Axioms from the text:
- hStable : Stable DiamondMine
- hLeads : leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
- hIncCB : includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
- hIncIN : includes DiamondMine IvyNile
- hFeud : feud_with Imperium DiamondMine

Lean code:

constant Entity : Type u

constant Stable : Entity → Prop
constant leads : Entity → Entity → Prop
constant includes : Entity → Entity → Prop
constant feud_with : Entity → Entity → Prop

constant DiamondMine : Entity
constant RoderickStrong : Entity
constant CreedBrothers : Entity
constant IvyNile : Entity
constant Imperium : Entity

axiom hStable : Stable DiamondMine
axiom hLeads : leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
axiom hIncCB : includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
axiom hIncIN : includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom hFeud : feud_with Imperium DiamondMine

-- Q1: ∃ s, Stable s ∧ leads RoderickStrong s
theorem Q1_true : ∃ s, Stable s ∧ leads RoderickStrong s :=
  ⟨DiamondMine, And.intro hStable hLeads⟩
-- Proven: True

-- Q2: leads RoderickStrong CreedBrothers
def Q2_stmt : Prop := leads RoderickStrong CreedBrothers
-- Not derivable from given axioms; no proof or disproof provided (Unknown)

-- Q3: ¬ ∃ s, Stable s ∧ includes s IvyNile ∧ feud_with Imperium s
def Q3_stmt : Prop := ¬ ∃ s, Stable s ∧ includes s IvyNile ∧ feud_with Imperium s

-- We can prove the negation of Q3_stmt by exhibiting DiamondMine as a witness:
theorem Q3_neg_of_stmt : ∃ s, Stable s ∧ includes s IvyNile ∧ feud_with Imperium s :=
  ⟨DiamondMine, And.intro hStable (And.intro hIncIN hFeud)⟩

theorem Q3_false : ¬ Q3_stmt :=
  fun h => h Q3_neg_of_stmt
-- Hence the original Q3 statement is False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
