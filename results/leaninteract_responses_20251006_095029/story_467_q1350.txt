Premises: All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.
All monkeys are mammals. 
Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. 
Peter's birds can fly.
All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
Rock is Peter's pet.
Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. 
Conclusion: Rock does not have wings.
