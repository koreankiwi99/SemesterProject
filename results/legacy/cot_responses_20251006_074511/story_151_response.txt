Story ID: 151
Premises: Barutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.
Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island.
Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands.
Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands. 
If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
1) We are told Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin. There is no indication it is named after all islands in Antarctica; that claim conflicts with the given specific eponym.
2) We know Barutin Cove is named after a Bulgarian place and is on Snow Island, which is in the South Shetland Islands. We are told Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands (not that the South Shetland Islands are in Antarctica). Using the given transitivity, we can place Barutin Cove in the South Shetland Islands, but we cannot place it in Antarctica. So we cannot conclude there exists a cove in Antarctica named after a Bulgarian place.
3) As above, we cannot determine whether Barutin Cove is in Antarctica or not; we only know it is in the South Shetland Islands. Thus we cannot assert it is not in Antarctica.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
