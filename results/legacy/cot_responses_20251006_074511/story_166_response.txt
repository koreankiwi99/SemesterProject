Story ID: 166
Premises: Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Tom will rent if both: (a) he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and (b) the security deposit is no more than $1500.
- The Olive Garden is a managed building with monthly rent $2000.
- The security deposit at a managed building is either equal to the monthly rent or more, so at The Olive Garden it is at least $2000, which is more than $1500. Thus condition (b) is not satisfied.
- We do not know whether The Olive Garden allows pets, so we cannot confirm (a).
- The given condition is sufficient, not necessary; failing it does not imply Tom will not rent. Therefore we cannot conclude whether he will rent.
Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Cats are pets; Fluffy is Tom’s cat, so Fluffy is a pet.
- If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.
- We only know that some managed buildings allow pets; we do not know whether The Olive Garden allows pets.
Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- The security deposit at a managed building is either equal to the monthly rent or more.
- The Olive Garden’s monthly rent is $2000.
- Therefore, the security deposit at The Olive Garden is either $2000 or more.
Conclusion: True.
