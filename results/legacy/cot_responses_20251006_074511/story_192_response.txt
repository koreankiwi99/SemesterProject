Story ID: 192
Premises: International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
Mike is an international student.
Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- We know: If someone is an international student in the US, then they have either an F1 or J1 visa. We are not told Mike is in the US.
- We know: If an international student in the US has an F1 visa and wants to work in the US, they must apply for CPT or OPT. Mike “needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.” This is consistent with having an F1 visa, but the rule is only one-way; needing CPT does not imply F1 based on the given information.
- No information links J1 status to CPT or forbids it in the given context. Thus Mike’s CPT requirement does not rule out J1.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether Mike has F1 or J1 from the provided statements.
