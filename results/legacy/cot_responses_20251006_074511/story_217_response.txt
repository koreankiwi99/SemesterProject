Story ID: 217
Premises: If George likes music, he wants to compose.
If George has access to a program, he can compose.
If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- From "If George likes music, he wants to compose": L -> W.
- From "If George has access to a program, he can compose": A -> C.
- From "If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose": (C ∧ W) -> P.
- Given L ∧ A, we get W and C, hence C ∧ W, so P. Therefore the statement is true.

Question 2:
- From (C ∧ W) -> P, contraposition yields ¬P -> (¬C ∨ ¬W).
- This does not entail ¬P -> ¬C; George might fail to compose because he doesn’t want to, even if he can.
- A consistent scenario: C true, W false, P false satisfies all premises. So the implication ¬P -> ¬C is not entailed. It’s not forced false either, so it’s unknown based on given info.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
