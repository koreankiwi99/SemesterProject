Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- Premises: All horses have hooves. No humans have hooves.
- If any human were a horse, they would have hooves (from "all horses have hooves"), but humans do not have hooves (from "no humans have hooves"). Contradiction.
- Therefore, no humans are horses, so the statement "Some humans are horses" is false.
