==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- All fir trees are evergreens means every fir is an evergreen.
- Some objects of worship are fir trees means there exists at least one thing that is both a fir tree and an object of worship; thus some evergreens are objects of worship.
- The statement to evaluate claims there exist evergreens that are not objects of worship. The premises do not specify anything about non-fir evergreens or about whether all evergreens are objects of worship.
- It is consistent with the premises that all evergreens are objects of worship (making the statement false) and also consistent that some evergreens are not objects of worship (making it true). Therefore, the truth of the statement cannot be determined.
