Story ID: 306
Premises: If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then the restaurant has not received many negative reviews.
All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “All popular restaurants have ratings >4” and “HPS has rating >4 or is popular,” it follows that HPS (Hamden Plaza Subway) has rating >4.
- From “All rating >4 are listed in Yelp’s recommendations” and “Listed implies not many negative reviews,” it follows that HPS does not receive many negative reviews.
- No premise determines whether HPS provides take-out service.

Question 1:
- Antecedent requires HPS receives many negative reviews, but we derived that HPS does not. The antecedent cannot hold, so the conditional is vacuously true.
Answer: True.

Question 2:
- Disjunction “provides take-out or does not receive many negative reviews” is true because we have “does not receive many negative reviews.”
Answer: True.

Question 3:
- We have no information fixing whether HPS provides take-out; the existential statement about some no-take-out restaurants does not apply to HPS (and does not determine T(HPS)).
Answer: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
