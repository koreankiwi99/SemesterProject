Story ID: 315
Premises: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. 
If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: TM3 ⇒ transports multiple passengers ⇒ not a one-seater. Solo EV ⇒ single-seat electric car ⇒ one-seater ⇒ not transporting multiple passengers. Therefore, TM3 and Solo EV are mutually exclusive.
- The statement “If John’s car is not a TM3, then John’s car is not a TM3 or a single-seat electric car” is a tautology of the form A → (A ∨ B), so it gives no information about John’s car.

Question 1:
- No premise asserts John’s car is a TM3. The tautology provides no evidence. Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- No premise asserts John’s car is a Solo EV. Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 3:
- We could conclude not Solo EV if we knew John’s car is a TM3, but we don’t. The tautology gives no help. Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
