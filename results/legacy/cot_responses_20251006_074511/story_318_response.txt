If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.

Breaking Bad is a show.
Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From the context: Some show at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses. Any show that gives out roses is an episode of The Bachelor. The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people, and all shows portraying real lives are reality TV. Therefore, any rose-giving show is reality TV. Breaking Bad is a show and is not reality TV, so Breaking Bad cannot be a rose-giving show.

Question 1:
- We only know that some show at Monday 8 pm gives roses (and thus is reality TV). Breaking Bad is not reality TV, so it’s not that show. But nothing rules out Breaking Bad also airing at that time without giving roses. So we cannot determine its timeslot.
- Conclusion: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The claim requires that Breaking Bad gives out roses (at Monday 8 pm). But if it gave out roses, it would be an episode of The Bachelor and thus reality TV, contradicting that Breaking Bad is not reality TV. So the claim is false.
- Conclusion: False.

Question 3:
- Since roses are not given out during Breaking Bad, the antecedent “roses are given out during Breaking Bad” is false. A conditional with a false antecedent is true.
- Conclusion: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
