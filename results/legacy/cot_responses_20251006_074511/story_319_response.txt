Premises: No baked sweets are spicy.
All cupcakes are baked sweets.
All mala hotpots are spicy.
All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.
Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “No baked sweets are spicy,” we get Spicy -> not BakedSweet (and BakedSweet -> not Spicy).
- All cupcakes are baked sweets; all Baked by Melissa products are cupcakes; thus MelissaProduct -> Cupcake -> BakedSweet -> not Spicy.
- All mala hotpots are spicy; hence MalaHotpot -> Spicy -> not BakedSweet.
- Dried Thai chilies are (Spicy or MalaHotpot or not BakedSweet). Each disjunct implies not BakedSweet, so Dried Thai chilies are not BakedSweet. Therefore they are not Cupcakes and not MelissaProducts.

Question 1: Being a MelissaProduct would imply being a baked sweet, but Dried Thai chilies are not baked sweets. So False.

Question 2: As above, they are not MelissaProducts. True.

Question 3: The disjunction allows they might be spicy without being mala hotpots, or just not baked sweets. Cannot conclude they are mala hotpots. Unknown.

Question 4: We established they are not baked sweets and not MelissaProducts. True.

Question 5: They cannot be cupcakes (since not baked sweets), nor MelissaProducts. False.

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: Unknown
