Every Grand Slam champion at the mixer is a professional tennis player.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “Everyone at the mixer is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor” and “Djokovic is at the mixer,” we know Djokovic is G or O.
- G -> professional tennis player -> athlete (A); and A -> famous (F).
- O -> celebrity (C) -> well-paid (W).
- W -> lives in tax havens (L).
- Special for Djokovic: if he is a famous athlete (A and F), then he is well-paid (W).

Question 1:
- We only know Djokovic is G or O; nothing forces G specifically. So it’s not entailed that he is G.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- Case 1: If Djokovic is O, then C -> W -> L, so he lives in a tax haven.
- Case 2: If Djokovic is G, then G -> A and A -> F; by the special rule (A and F) -> W, so W -> L. Thus he lives in a tax haven.
- In all cases, Djokovic lives in a tax haven.
- Answer: True.

Question 3:
- This is the negation of Question 2’s conclusion, which is true.
- Answer: False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
