Premises: All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.
All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.
All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither.

Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From S -> C, H -> S, so H -> C. Also D -> ¬C. Therefore H and D cannot both be true.
- The given exclusive scenario for Taylor is (H ∧ D) or (¬H ∧ ¬D). Since H ∧ D is impossible, it must be ¬H ∧ ¬D.
- From G -> N -> H, we get G -> H. With ¬H, contrapositive gives ¬G.

Question 1:
- We have ¬H, but H -> S does not allow inferring ¬S. So whether Taylor eats salads is not determined.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- From ¬H and G -> H, we conclude ¬G.
- Answer: False.

Question 3:
- We have ¬H and ¬G, so the statement holds.
- Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
