Story ID: 363
Premises: All hydrocarbons are organic compounds .
All alkanes are hydrocarbons
All organic compounds are chemical compounds.
All organic compounds contain carbon.
No chemical compounds contain only one element.
The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “No chemical compounds contain only one element” and “The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither,” it follows the “both” case is impossible; thus the mixture is neither a chemical compound nor a one-element substance (¬C ∧ ¬E).
- From All alkanes → hydrocarbons → organic compounds → chemical compounds, we get Alkane → Chemical. By contraposition, ¬Chemical → ¬Alkane. Hence the mixture is not an alkane.
- Only organic compounds are guaranteed to contain carbon, but the mixture is not a chemical compound, hence not necessarily organic; so we cannot conclude it contains carbon.

Question 1: We cannot infer whether the mixture contains carbon. Unknown.

Question 2: The mixture is not an alkane, so the conjunction “alkane and contains carbon” is false. False.

Question 3: The consequent “neither a chemical compound nor an alkane” is true for the mixture, so the conditional is true regardless of the antecedent. True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
