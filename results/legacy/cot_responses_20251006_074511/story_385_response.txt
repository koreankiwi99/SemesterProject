Story ID: 385
Premises: If someone is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are one of the most active players in major tennis. 
Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022 is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male.
All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

- From “Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022” and “All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male,” Coco is either female or male at RG22.
- Assume Coco is male. Then by “All male tennis players at Roland Garros in 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal,” she lost to Nadal. Then by “If Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA or lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022,” it follows she is not male—a contradiction. Hence Coco is not male. Therefore, by the female-or-male dichotomy, Coco is female.
- Being female at RG22 implies she lost to Iga Świątek. Those who lost to Iga at RG22 are ranked highly by the WTA, and those ranked highly by the WTA are among the most active players in major tennis. Thus Coco is among the most active players in major tennis and also lost to Iga.

Question 1:
- As shown, Coco is ranked highly by the WTA, hence among the most active players in major tennis. True.

Question 2:
- We only know male players lost to Nadal; we have no rule that female players lost to Nadal. Coco is female, so we cannot conclude she lost to Nadal, nor can we conclude she did not. Unknown.

Question 3:
- We established Coco both lost to Iga and is among the most active players in major tennis. Therefore the statement “Coco is not both …” is false. False.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
3: False
