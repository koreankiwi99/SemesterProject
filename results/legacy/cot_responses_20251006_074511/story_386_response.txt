Story ID: 386
Premises: If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the premises: deadly -> low survival. Severe -> deadly. Bile duct cancer -> severe -> deadly -> low survival. Cholangiocarcinoma -> bile duct cancer. Therefore, bile duct cancer -> low survival.
- Given: Not (colorectal is bile duct cancer AND colorectal has low survival). Since bile duct cancer implies low survival, if colorectal were bile duct cancer, it would have low survival, contradicting the given. Hence colorectal is not a bile duct cancer. Therefore, colorectal is also not cholangiocarcinoma (as that would imply bile duct cancer). Whether colorectal has low survival or is severe remains undetermined. Mild flu implies low survival, but no link to colorectal cancer is given.

Question 1:
- We have no information implying colorectal cancer is severe, nor that it isn’t. So Unknown.

Question 2:
- Antecedent: “colorectal is bile duct cancer or cholangiocarcinoma” is false (both disjuncts are false). A material implication with a false antecedent is true. So True.

Question 3:
- The statement effectively requires colorectal to be cholangiocarcinoma and (a mild flu or a bile duct cancer), or “all of the above.” But colorectal is neither cholangiocarcinoma nor a bile duct cancer, so the whole statement is False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
