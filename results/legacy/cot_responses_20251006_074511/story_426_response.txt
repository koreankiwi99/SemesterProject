Story ID: 426
Premises: All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today. 
Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers. 
Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. 
No managers work remotely from home. 
James will appear in the company today if and only if he is a manager.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Given:
- Lunch in building -> schedules meeting -> goes to building today.
- Lunch at home -> remote.
- In other countries -> remote.
- Manager -> not remote (so not lunch at home; hence lunch in building by the either-or).
- Not remote -> not in other countries.
- James goes to the company today iff he is a manager.

Case analysis for James:
- If James is a manager: not remote -> not lunch at home -> lunch in building.
- If James is not a manager: he does not appear at the company; thus cannot have lunch in the building (that would force appearing), so he has lunch at home and is remote. Whether he is in other countries is undetermined.

Question 1:
- Lunch in building iff James is a manager. We donâ€™t know if he is a manager. Unknown.

Question 2:
- The negation of Q1; since Q1 is unknown, this is also unknown.

Question 3:
- The statement is (M or O) -> not(H or R), and its contrapositive (H or R) -> (not M and not O).
- In the non-manager case, James is remote and has lunch at home. He may or may not be in other countries; both are consistent with the premises. If he is in other countries, the statement becomes false; if he is not, it becomes true. Therefore the truth is not determined. Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: Unknown
3: Unknown
