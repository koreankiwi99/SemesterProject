Ted is an alligator.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From All Brown Swiss cattle are cows and All cows are domesticated animals, we get: All Brown Swiss cattle are domesticated animals.
- From Alligators are not domesticated animals and Ted is an alligator, we get: Ted is not domesticated.
- By modus tollens on All Brown Swiss cattle are domesticated animals, Ted is not Brown Swiss cattle.

Question 1:
- Nothing in the premises links being an alligator or being non-domesticated to not being a pet. We cannot conclude whether Ted is a pet.
- Answer: Unknown.

Question 2:
- The statement requires Ted to be both a pet and Brown Swiss cattle. We have deduced Ted is not Brown Swiss cattle, so the conjunction is false regardless of pet status.
- Answer: False.

Question 3:
- Since Ted is not Brown Swiss cattle, the antecedent is false; the conditional is therefore true (vacuously) given the premises.
- Answer: True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
