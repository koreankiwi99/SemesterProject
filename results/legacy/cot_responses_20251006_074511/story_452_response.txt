Story ID: 452
Premises: All aliens are extraterrestrials.
If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.
No extraterrestrials are human.
All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.
Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “either (from Earth and from Mars) or (from neither),” consider the two cases:
  - If Marvin is from Earth and from Mars: From Mars → alien → extraterrestrial → not human. Also, highly intelligent and from Earth → human. Contradiction (human and not human). So this case is impossible.
  - Therefore Marvin is not from Earth and not from Mars.
- From not from Earth → extraterrestrial, and extraterrestrial → not human. Hence Marvin is not human and not from Mars.
- Alien status: From Mars → alien, but Marvin is not from Mars. Also, extraterrestrial does not imply alien. So alien status is undetermined.

Question 1: Marvin is an alien.
- We cannot conclude alien from the premises (he’s extraterrestrial but that doesn’t imply alien). Unknown.

Question 2: Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars.
- We derived not human and not from Mars. True.

Question 3: If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human.
- We have not from Mars true and human false, so the conditional is false. False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
