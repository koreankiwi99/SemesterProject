Story ID: 456
Premises: Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. 
Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From the chain PB → JS → Leap → Activate, we have PB → Activate.
- Given ¬Activate(Yuri), by contraposition of Leap → Activate we get ¬Leap(Yuri), and by contraposition of PB → Activate we get ¬PB(Yuri).
- Nothing in the premises constrains Yuri’s nationality.

Question 1: No information links Yuri to being American or not. Unknown.
Question 2: “Not an American professional basketball player” means ¬(American ∧ PB). Since ¬PB(Yuri), this is true. True.
Question 3: Requires PB(Yuri), but we have ¬PB(Yuri). False.
Question 4: Antecedent ¬Leap(Yuri) is true; consequent (American ∧ PB) is false due to ¬PB(Yuri). Implication is false. False.
Question 5: Antecedent ¬(American ∧ PB) is true (since ¬PB); consequent PB is false. Implication is false. False.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
3: False
4: False
5: False
