Story ID: 459
Premises: Jane does not like any animals that bark.
All dogs are animals that bark.
Jane likes all animals that jump.
If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. 
KiKi is an animal.
If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From (¬Jumps(KiKi) ∧ ¬Legs(KiKi)) → (Terricolous(KiKi) ∨ Legs(KiKi)), if ¬Jumps and ¬Legs held, then with ¬Legs we’d have Terricolous, which by Terricolous → Legs contradicts ¬Legs. So ¬(¬Jumps ∧ ¬Legs), hence Jumps(KiKi) ∨ Legs(KiKi). If Legs, then by Legs → Jumps we get Jumps anyway. Therefore Jumps(KiKi) is true.
- Jane likes all animals that jump, so Jane likes KiKi.
- Jane does not like any animals that bark. Since KiKi is an animal and Jane likes KiKi, KiKi does not bark.
- All dogs bark, so if KiKi does not bark, KiKi is not a dog.
- Nothing entails Terricolous(KiKi); it remains undetermined.
