Story ID: 467
Premises: All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.
All monkeys are mammals. 
Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds. 
Peter's birds can fly.
All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
Rock is Peter's pet.
Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe. 

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- From "Rock is Peter's pet" and "Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds," Rock is a monkey or a bird.
- Nothing else forces Rock specifically to be a monkey or rules it out. Therefore, it is uncertain whether Rock is a monkey.

Question 2:
- We have the disjunction: Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.
- Case 1: If Rock can fly, then since Rock is Peter's pet, Rock has wings.
- Case 2: If Rock is a bird, then as Peter's bird Rock can fly; being Peter's pet that can fly, Rock has wings.
- Case 3: If Rock cannot breathe, then Rock cannot be a monkey (since monkey ⇒ mammal; Peter’s mammal-pets are animals; Peter’s animal-pets can breathe). Thus Rock must be a bird; then as Peter's bird Rock can fly; hence Rock has wings.
- In all cases, Rock has wings. So the statement is true.

Question 3:
- This is the negation of Question 2’s conclusion. Since Rock has wings is true, Rock does not have wings is false.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
