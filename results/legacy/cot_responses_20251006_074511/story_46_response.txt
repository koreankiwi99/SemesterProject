==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:

Question 1:
- Breeding back is defined as a form of artificial selection.
- Heck cattle were bred back in the 1920s.
- Therefore, Heck cattle are the result of artificial selection; thus at least some Heck cattle are artificially selected.
Conclusion: True.

Question 2:
- We know aurochs are animals and Heck cattle were bred back to resemble them.
- We also know some animals bred back resemble extinct animals, but this does not specify that aurochs are extinct.
- No explicit statement says aurochs are extinct, and the “some” statement doesn’t entail it.
Conclusion: Unknown.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: Unknown
