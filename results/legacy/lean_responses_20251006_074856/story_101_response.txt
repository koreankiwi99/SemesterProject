Lean formalization and proofs

We introduce an entity type and predicates to model the facts.

- Entity: the domain of entities (people or clubs)
- PlaysFor : Entity → Entity → Prop
- LoanedTo : Entity → Entity → Prop
- FootballClub : Entity → Prop
- Brazilian : Entity → Prop

Constants:
- Ailton, AiltonSilva, Braga, Nautico, Fluminense : Entity

Axioms from the text:
- h_alias : Ailton = AiltonSilva
- h_brazil : Brazilian AiltonSilva
- h_plays_nautico : PlaysFor AiltonSilva Nautico
- h_fc_nautico : FootballClub Nautico
- h_fc_braga : FootballClub Braga
- h_fc_flu : FootballClub Fluminense
- h_loan_braga : LoanedTo Ailton Braga

Lean code (sketch):

universe u

constant Entity : Type u

constant Ailton : Entity
constant AiltonSilva : Entity
constant Braga : Entity
constant Nautico : Entity
constant Fluminense : Entity

constant PlaysFor : Entity → Entity → Prop
constant LoanedTo : Entity → Entity → Prop
constant FootballClub : Entity → Prop
constant Brazilian : Entity → Prop

axiom h_alias : Ailton = AiltonSilva
axiom h_brazil : Brazilian AiltonSilva
axiom h_plays_nautico : PlaysFor AiltonSilva Nautico
axiom h_fc_nautico : FootballClub Nautico
axiom h_fc_braga : FootballClub Braga

axiom h_loan_braga : LoanedTo Ailton Braga

-- Q1: "No one playing for Nautico is Brazilian."
-- Formal: ∀ x, PlaysFor x Nautico → ¬ Brazilian x
theorem q1_false : ¬ (∀ x, PlaysFor x Nautico → ¬ Brazilian x) := by
  intro h
  have hnot : ¬ Brazilian AiltonSilva := h AiltonSilva h_plays_nautico
  exact hnot h_brazil

-- Q2: "Ailton Silva does not play for a football club."
-- Formal: ¬ ∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ PlaysFor AiltonSilva c
theorem q2_false : ¬ (¬ ∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ PlaysFor AiltonSilva c) := by
  intro h
  apply h
  exact ⟨Nautico, And.intro h_fc_nautico h_plays_nautico⟩

-- Q3: "Ailton was not loaned out to a football club."
-- Formal: ¬ ∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedTo Ailton c
theorem q3_false : ¬ (¬ ∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedTo Ailton c) := by
  intro h
  apply h
  exact ⟨Braga, And.intro h_fc_braga h_loan_braga⟩

-- Q4: "Ailton Silva played for Fluminense."
-- Formal: PlaysFor AiltonSilva Fluminense
-- Not derivable from the given axioms, and its negation is also not derivable.
-- Therefore: Unknown.

-- Q5: "Ailton Silva was loaned out to a football club."
-- Formal: ∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedTo AiltonSilva c
theorem q5_true : ∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedTo AiltonSilva c := by
  have hloan_silva : LoanedTo AiltonSilva Braga := by
    simpa [h_alias] using h_loan_braga
  exact ⟨Braga, And.intro h_fc_braga hloan_silva⟩

Conclusions:
- Q1 is False (proved ¬statement).
- Q2 is False (proved ¬statement).
- Q3 is False (proved ¬statement).
- Q4 is Unknown (neither provable nor disprovable from given axioms).
- Q5 is True (proved statement).

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: False
3: False
4: Unknown
5: True
