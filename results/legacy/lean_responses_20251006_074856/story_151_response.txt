Story ID: 151
Premises: Barutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.
Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island.
Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are located in the South Shetland Islands.
Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands. 
If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.

-- Facts from the context
axiom barutin_cove_is_cove : Cove BarutinCove
axiom barutin_cove_named_barutin : NamedAfter BarutinCove BarutinSettlement
axiom barutin_settlement_bulgarian : BulgarianPlace BarutinSettlement

axiom barutin_cove_in_snow : LocatedIn BarutinCove SnowIsland
axiom snow_in_ssi : LocatedIn SnowIsland SouthShetlandIslands
axiom greenwich_in_ssi : LocatedIn GreenwichIsland SouthShetlandIslands
axiom deception_in_ssi : LocatedIn DeceptionIsland SouthShetlandIslands

-- Note the (given) direction:
axiom antarctica_in_ssi : LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetlandIslands

-- Transitivity of location
axiom located_in_trans : ∀ {A B C : Place}, LocatedIn A B → LocatedIn B C → LocatedIn A C

-- Optional: mark the three named islands as islands
axiom snow_is_island : Island SnowIsland
axiom greenwich_is_island : Island GreenwichIsland
axiom deception_is_island : Island DeceptionIsland

-- A small derivation we can do:
theorem barutin_cove_in_ssi : LocatedIn BarutinCove SouthShetlandIslands :=
  located_in_trans barutin_cove_in_snow snow_in_ssi

-- Questions formalized:

-- Q1: "Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica."
def Q1 : Prop :=
  ∀ x : Place, Island x ∧ LocatedIn x Antarctica → NamedAfter BarutinCove x

-- Q2: "There is at least one cove in Antarctica named after a place in Bulgaria."
def Q2 : Prop :=
  ∃ c : Place, Cove c ∧ LocatedIn c Antarctica ∧ ∃ p : Place, BulgarianPlace p ∧ NamedAfter c p

-- Q3: "Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica."
def Q3 : Prop := ¬ LocatedIn BarutinCove Antarctica

-- Attempted proofs assessment:
-- From the given axioms, we can derive LocatedIn BarutinCove SouthShetlandIslands,
-- but we have no axiom that SouthShetlandIslands is located in Antarctica.
-- Instead, we have the reverse: LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetlandIslands.
-- Thus we cannot derive LocatedIn BarutinCove Antarctica, nor its negation.
-- Consequently:
-- - Q1 cannot be proved (no information about any island located in Antarctica)
--   and its negation cannot be proved either. Unknown.
-- - Q2 cannot be proved (we cannot show any cove is in Antarctica),
--   and its negation also cannot be proved. Unknown.
-- - Q3 cannot be proved (as above), and its negation also cannot be proved. Unknown.
