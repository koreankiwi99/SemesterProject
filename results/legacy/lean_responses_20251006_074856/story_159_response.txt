Lean translation and attempt:

-- Types and basic symbols
inductive Season where
| Spring | Summer | Fall | Winter
deriving DecidableEq

constant Person : Type
constant emma mia james : Person

-- Each person has exactly one favorite season
constant favorite : Person → Season

-- Predicates
constant Student : Person → Prop
constant WantsLongVacation : Person → Prop

-- Axioms from the text
axiom rule_students_who_want_have_summer :
  ∀ x : Person, Student x ∧ WantsLongVacation x → favorite x = Season.Summer

axiom emma_fav_summer : favorite emma = Season.Summer
axiom mia_fav_neq_emma : favorite mia ≠ favorite emma
axiom james_wants_long_vacation : WantsLongVacation james

-- Useful lemma derivable from the axioms
lemma mia_not_summer : favorite mia ≠ Season.Summer := by
  intro h
  have h₁ : favorite mia = favorite emma := by
    simpa [emma_fav_summer] using h
  exact mia_fav_neq_emma h₁

-- Q1: Is favorite james = Summer?
-- Attempt: From the rule, we would need Student james ∧ WantsLongVacation james.
-- We only have WantsLongVacation james, no information that james is a Student.
-- So we cannot prove favorite james = Summer, nor can we prove its negation.
-- Therefore: Unknown.

-- Q2: Is favorite mia = Spring?
-- From mia_fav_neq_emma and emma_fav_summer, we get favorite mia ≠ Summer (lemma above).
-- But with four seasons, not Summer does not imply Spring (could be Fall or Winter).
-- We cannot prove favorite mia = Spring, nor its negation from the given axioms.
-- Therefore: Unknown.
