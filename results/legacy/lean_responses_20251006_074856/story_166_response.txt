Story ID: 166
Premises: Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.

Lean formalization and analysis:

Types and constants:
- Person, Animal, Building : Type
- Tom : Person
- Fluffy : Animal
- OliveGarden : Building

Predicates and functions:
- Managed : Building → Prop
- AllowsPets : Building → Prop
- Pet : Animal → Prop
- Cat : Animal → Prop
- Owns : Person → Animal → Prop
- AllowedMoveInWith : Person → Animal → Building → Prop
- WillRentAt : Person → Building → Prop
- rent : Building → Nat
- deposit : Building → Nat

Axioms from the text:
1. ∃ b, Managed b ∧ AllowsPets b
2. ∀ b, Managed b → deposit b ≥ rent b
3. Owns Tom Fluffy ∧ Cat Fluffy
4. ∀ a, Cat a → Pet a
5. Managed OliveGarden
6. rent OliveGarden = 2000
7. 2000 > 1500
8. ∀ b, Managed b → AllowsPets b → ∀ p a, Pet a → AllowedMoveInWith p a b
9. ∀ b, Managed b → AllowedMoveInWith Tom Fluffy b → deposit b ≤ 1500 → WillRentAt Tom b

Targets:
- Q1: WillRentAt Tom OliveGarden
- Q2: AllowedMoveInWith Tom Fluffy OliveGarden
- Q3: deposit OliveGarden ≥ 2000

Proof attempts:
- Q3: From (2) with b = OliveGarden and (5), deposit OliveGarden ≥ rent OliveGarden. Using (6), conclude deposit OliveGarden ≥ 2000. This is provable.
- Q2: To prove AllowedMoveInWith Tom Fluffy OliveGarden from (8), we would need AllowsPets OliveGarden and Pet Fluffy. While Pet Fluffy follows from (3) and (4), we do not have AllowsPets OliveGarden; we only know there exists some managed building that allows pets (1). So neither Q2 nor its negation is derivable. Unknown.
- Q1: From (9), if AllowedMoveInWith Tom Fluffy OliveGarden and deposit OliveGarden ≤ 1500, then WillRentAt Tom OliveGarden. We cannot show the antecedent: we do not have AllowedMoveInWith Tom Fluffy OliveGarden (as above), and in fact deposit OliveGarden ≥ 2000 from Q3, so deposit ≤ 1500 is false. However (9) is only a sufficient condition; its failure does not imply he will not rent. Thus neither Q1 nor its negation is derivable. Unknown.
