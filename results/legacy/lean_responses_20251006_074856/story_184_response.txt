Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and attempt:

-- We model shows, two specific shows, and predicates about them.
namespace Reasoning

constant Show : Type
constant ST BM : Show

constant Popular : Show → Prop
constant NetflixShow : Show → Prop
constant Binge : Show → Prop          -- Karen binge-watches the show
constant Download : Show → Prop       -- Karen downloads the show
constant ShareWithLisa : Show → Prop  -- Karen shares the show with Lisa

-- Axioms extracted from the text
axiom ST_pop : Popular ST
axiom ST_nf  : NetflixShow ST

-- If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.
axiom ax1 : ∀ s, NetflixShow s ∧ Popular s → Binge s

-- For any Netflix show, Karen downloads it iff she binge-watches it.
axiom ax2 : ∀ s, NetflixShow s → (Download s ↔ Binge s)

-- Karen does not download Black Mirror.
axiom BM_not_dl : ¬ Download BM

-- Black Mirror is a Netflix show.
axiom BM_nf : NetflixShow BM

-- If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it with Lisa.
axiom ax3 : ∀ s, NetflixShow s → Binge s → ShareWithLisa s

-- Q1: Karen will share Stranger Things with Lisa. (Provable: True)
theorem Q1 : ShareWithLisa ST := by
  have hb : Binge ST := ax1 ST ⟨ST_nf, ST_pop⟩
  exact ax3 ST ST_nf hb

-- Q2: Black Mirror is popular. (Provable negation: False)
theorem Q2 : ¬ Popular BM := by
  intro hpop
  have hiff : Download BM ↔ Binge BM := ax2 BM BM_nf
  have hb2d : Binge BM → Download BM := Iff.mpr hiff
  exact BM_not_dl (hb2d (ax1 BM ⟨BM_nf, hpop⟩))

-- Helpful derived fact: from ax2 and BM_not_dl we get ¬ Binge BM.
theorem not_binge_BM : ¬ Binge BM := by
  have hiff : Download BM ↔ Binge BM := ax2 BM BM_nf
  have hb2d : Binge BM → Download BM := Iff.mpr hiff
  intro hb
  exact BM_not_dl (hb2d hb)

-- Q3: Karen will share Black Mirror with Lisa. (Not derivable; also its negation not derivable from given axioms)
-- We only have (Netflix ∧ Binge) → Share, and we derived ¬Binge BM, but we have no axiom Share → Binge.
-- Hence neither ShareWithLisa BM nor ¬ShareWithLisa BM follows from the axioms.

end Reasoning
