Lean formalization and proof attempt:

-- Types and basic predicates
universe u
constant Game : Type u
constant Company : Type u
constant JapaneseCompany : Company → Prop
constant Created : Company → Game → Prop
constant OnTop10 : Game → Prop
constant SoldOver1M : Game → Prop

-- Specific games
constant Zelda : Game
constant FIFA22 : Game

-- Assumptions from the text
axiom A1 : ∃ c : Company, JapaneseCompany c ∧ Created c Zelda
axiom A2 : ∀ g : Game, OnTop10 g → ∃ c : Company, JapaneseCompany c ∧ Created c g
axiom A3 : ∀ g : Game, SoldOver1M g → OnTop10 g
axiom A4 : SoldOver1M Zelda

-- Derived notion
def JapaneseMade (g : Game) : Prop := ∃ c : Company, JapaneseCompany c ∧ Created c g

-- Q1: The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.
-- Proof: from A4 and A3.
theorem Q1 : OnTop10 Zelda := A3 Zelda A4

-- Q2: FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese video game company.
-- Statement:
def Q2stmt : Prop := JapaneseMade FIFA22
-- From the given axioms, neither Q2stmt nor its negation can be derived.

-- Q3: The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list.
def Q3stmt : Prop := ¬ OnTop10 Zelda
-- We can prove the negation of Q3stmt using Q1.
theorem not_Q3 : ¬ Q3stmt := by
  intro h
  exact h Q1


ANSWERS:
1: True
