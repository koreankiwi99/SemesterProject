Lean formalization and attempt:

- Entities and predicates:
  - Type: Language
  - Constants: French, Spanish, German, Basque : Language
  - Predicates:
    - Romance, IndoEuro : Language → Prop
    - Related : Language → Language → Prop
    - IsFamily : (Language → Prop) → Prop
  - Axioms from the text:
    - romance_subset_indo : ∀ x, Romance x → IndoEuro x
    - romance_is_family : IsFamily Romance
    - all_in_family_related : ∀ F, IsFamily F → ∀ x y, F x → F y → Related x y
    - FrenchRomance : Romance French
    - SpanishRomance : Romance Spanish
    - GermanRelatedSpanish : Related German Spanish
    - Basque_isolate : ∀ y, y ≠ Basque → ¬ Related Basque y
    - Basque_ne_Spanish : Basque ≠ Spanish  [distinctness used to apply isolation]

- Proof sketches:
  - Q1 (Basque is a Romance language) is false:
    If Romance Basque, then since Romance is a family and Spanish is Romance, we get Related Basque Spanish. But Basque_isolate with Basque_ne_Spanish yields ¬ Related Basque Spanish. Contradiction. Hence ¬ Romance Basque.
  - Q2 (German is a Romance language) is not derivable:
    We only have that members of a language family are related; we do not have the converse. German being related to Spanish does not imply German is Romance. No axiom rules out German being Romance either. Hence Unknown.
  - Q3 (French is an Indo-European language) is true:
    From FrenchRomance and romance_subset_indo.

Lean 4 code (sketch):
