Lean formalization and attempt at proofs:

universe u
constant Entity : Type u

-- Predicates
constant MusicPiece : Entity → Prop
constant Composer : Entity → Prop
constant Orchestra : Entity → Prop
constant Conductor : Entity → Prop

-- Relations
constant Wrote : Entity → Entity → Prop
constant Premiered : Entity → Entity → Prop
constant Leads : Entity → Entity → Prop

-- Constants

constant Symphony9 : Entity
constant ViennaMusicSociety : Entity

-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom sym9_is_music : MusicPiece Symphony9
axiom composers_write : ∀ c, Composer c → ∃ m, MusicPiece m ∧ Wrote c m
axiom beethoven_wrote_sym9 : Wrote Beethoven Symphony9
axiom vms_premiered_sym9 : Premiered ViennaMusicSociety Symphony9
axiom vms_is_orchestra : Orchestra ViennaMusicSociety
axiom beethoven_leads_vms : Leads Beethoven ViennaMusicSociety
axiom leaders_of_orchestras_are_conductors :
  ∀ x o, Leads x o → Orchestra o → Conductor x

-- Q2: Some orchestras premiered music pieces.
theorem Q2_true : ∃ o m, Orchestra o ∧ MusicPiece m ∧ Premiered o m :=
  ⟨ViennaMusicSociety, Symphony9, vms_is_orchestra, sym9_is_music, vms_premiered_sym9⟩

-- Q3: Beethoven is not a conductor (we prove its negation by showing he is a conductor).
lemma beethoven_is_conductor : Conductor Beethoven :=
  leaders_of_orchestras_are_conductors Beethoven ViennaMusicSociety
    beethoven_leads_vms vms_is_orchestra

-- Hence the statement "Beethoven is not a conductor" is false.
theorem Q3_false : ¬ (¬ Conductor Beethoven) :=
  fun h => h beethoven_is_conductor

-- Q1: Beethoven is a composer.
-- From the given axioms we have only (Composer c → ∃ m, MusicPiece m ∧ Wrote c m)
-- and Wrote Beethoven Symphony9, which does not suffice to derive Composer Beethoven.
-- Therefore Q1 is not derivable from the given information, nor is its negation.
