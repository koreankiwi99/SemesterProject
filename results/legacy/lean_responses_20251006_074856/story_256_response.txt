Lean translation and attempt:

- Universe of discourse: U
- Predicates: Cat : U → Prop, Mammal : U → Prop, Pet : U → Prop
- Premises:
  1. ∀ x, Cat x → Mammal x          -- All cats are mammals.
  2. ∃ x, Pet x ∧ ¬ Mammal x        -- Some pets are not mammals.
- Claim to test: ∀ x, Pet x → ¬ Cat x  -- No pets are cats.

Lean code sketch:

universe u
variable {U : Type u}
variables (Cat Pet Mammal : U → Prop)
variable (h1 : ∀ x, Cat x → Mammal x)
variable (h2 : ∃ x, Pet x ∧ ¬ Mammal x)

-- Target (what the question asks): ∀ x, Pet x → ¬ Cat x

-- What we can prove from the premises:
theorem exists_pet_not_cat : ∃ x, Pet x ∧ ¬ Cat x := by
  rcases h2 with ⟨x, hxPet, hxNotMammal⟩
  have hxNotCat : ¬ Cat x := by
    exact mt (h1 x) hxNotMammal   -- from Cat x → Mammal x and ¬ Mammal x, infer ¬ Cat x
  exact ⟨x, hxPet, hxNotCat⟩

Commentary:
- From the premises we can derive that there exists at least one pet that is not a cat.
- However, this does not suffice to prove the universal statement that no pets are cats.
- We also cannot derive the negation (that there exists a pet that is a cat) from the premises.
- Therefore, the truth of “No pets are cats” is not determined by the given information.
