Lean formalization and attempt:

We model a domain U with predicates Human, Greek, Mortal : U → Prop and assumptions:
- h1: ∀ x, Human x → Mortal x
- h2: ∀ x, Greek x → Human x

From these, we can derive only that all Greeks are mortal, i.e., ∀ x, Greek x → Mortal x. To conclude that some Greek is mortal, we would also need an existence assumption ∃ x, Greek x.

Lean code:

universe u

section
variable {U : Type u}
variable (Human Greek Mortal : U → Prop)
variable (h1 : ∀ x, Human x → Mortal x)
variable (h2 : ∀ x, Greek x → Human x)

-- All Greeks are mortal (derivable)
lemma greek_implies_mortal : ∀ x, Greek x → Mortal x := by
  intro x hx
  exact h1 x (h2 x hx)

-- If some Greek exists, then some mortal Greek exists (derivable)
theorem ex_greek_then_ex_mortal_greek :
  (∃ x, Greek x) → ∃ x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x := by
  intro ⟨x, hx⟩
  refine ⟨x, ?_⟩
  exact And.intro hx (h1 x (h2 x hx))
end

-- Independence demonstration via two concrete models

-- Model 0: no Greeks exist; premises hold; existential is false
def U0 := PUnit
def Human0 : U0 → Prop := fun _ => False
def Greek0 : U0 → Prop := fun _ => False
def Mortal0 : U0 → Prop := fun _ => False

lemma h1_0 : ∀ x, Human0 x → Mortal0 x := by
  intro x hx; cases hx
lemma h2_0 : ∀ x, Greek0 x → Human0 x := by
  intro x hx; cases hx

lemma not_ex_mortal_greek_in_model0 : ¬ ∃ x, Greek0 x ∧ Mortal0 x := by
  intro h; rcases h with ⟨x, hx⟩
  rcases hx with ⟨hg, hm⟩
  cases hg

-- Model 1: a Greek exists; premises hold; existential is true
def Human1 : PUnit → Prop := fun _ => True
def Greek1 : PUnit → Prop := fun _ => True
def Mortal1 : PUnit → Prop := fun _ => True

lemma h1_1 : ∀ x, Human1 x → Mortal1 x := by
  intro x hx; trivial
lemma h2_1 : ∀ x, Greek1 x → Human1 x := by
  intro x hx; trivial

lemma ex_mortal_greek_in_model1 : ∃ x, Greek1 x ∧ Mortal1 x := by
  refine ⟨PUnit.unit, ?_⟩
  exact And.intro trivial trivial

Conclusion:
- From the given premises alone, we cannot prove ∃ x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x.
- We also cannot prove its negation from the premises alone.
- Therefore, the truth of “Some Greeks are mortal” is not entailed; it is uncertain without an existence premise.
