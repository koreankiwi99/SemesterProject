Premises: All fir trees are evergreens.
Some objects of worship are fir trees.

Lean formalization and analysis:

We model a domain of objects U with predicates:
- Fir : U → Prop    -- "is a fir tree"
- Evergreen : U → Prop    -- "is an evergreen"
- Worship : U → Prop    -- "is an object of worship"

Premises:
- h1: ∀ x, Fir x → Evergreen x       -- All fir trees are evergreens
- h2: ∃ x, Worship x ∧ Fir x         -- Some objects of worship are fir trees

Target statement:
- concl: ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ Worship x    -- Some evergreens are not objects of worship

Attempt to derive concl from h1 and h2 fails: from h2 we get some x that is both Worship and Fir, and by h1, that x is Evergreen, yielding ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ Worship x, not the desired ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ Worship x.

To substantiate that the target is not derivable and that its negation is also not derivable from the premises, we provide two concrete models in Lean.

Model A (premises hold, conclusion false):
- U1 := Unit
- Fir1 u := True
- Evergreen1 u := True
- Worship1 u := True
Then h1 and h2 hold, but ¬ (∃ x, Evergreen1 x ∧ ¬ Worship1 x).

Model B (premises hold, conclusion true):
- Define a two-element type:
  inductive Two | a | b
- Fir2 a := True, Fir2 b := False
- Evergreen2 _ := True
- Worship2 a := True, Worship2 b := False
Then h1 and h2 hold, and ∃ x, Evergreen2 x ∧ ¬ Worship2 x (take x = b).

Lean code:

namespace Q1

inductive Two : Type
| a | b
open Two

-- Model A: all predicates True on Unit
def U1 := Unit
def Fir1 : U1 → Prop := fun _ => True
def Evergreen1 : U1 → Prop := fun _ => True
def Worship1 : U1 → Prop := fun _ => True

lemma prem1_1 : ∀ x, Fir1 x → Evergreen1 x := by intro x _; trivial
lemma prem2_1 : ∃ x, Worship1 x ∧ Fir1 x := ⟨(), And.intro trivial trivial⟩
lemma not_concl_1 : ¬ (∃ x, Evergreen1 x ∧ ¬ Worship1 x) := by
  intro h; rcases h with ⟨x, _, hxnotW⟩; exact hxnotW trivial

-- Model B: Two with a-only fir and worship
def Fir2 : Two → Prop
| a => True
| b => False

def Evergreen2 : Two → Prop := fun _ => True

def Worship2 : Two → Prop
| a => True
| b => False

lemma prem1_2 : ∀ x, Fir2 x → Evergreen2 x := by intro _ _; trivial
lemma prem2_2 : ∃ x, Worship2 x ∧ Fir2 x := ⟨a, And.intro trivial trivial⟩
lemma concl_2 : ∃ x, Evergreen2 x ∧ ¬ Worship2 x := ⟨b, And.intro trivial (by intro h; cases h)⟩

-- Therefore the sequent is not valid, and neither is its negation
example : ¬ (∀ (U : Type) (Fir Evergreen Worship : U → Prop),
  (∀ x, Fir x → Evergreen x) → (∃ x, Worship x ∧ Fir x) → (∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ Worship x)) := by
  intro h
  have h' := h U1 Fir1 Evergreen1 Worship1 prem1_1 prem2_1
  exact not_concl_1 h'

example : ¬ (∀ (U : Type) (Fir Evergreen Worship : U → Prop),
  (∀ x, Fir x → Evergreen x) → (∃ x, Worship x ∧ Fir x) → ¬ (∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ Worship x)) := by
  intro h
  have h' := h Two Fir2 Evergreen2 Worship2 prem1_2 prem2_2
  exact h' concl_2

end Q1

Conclusion: The statement “Some evergreens are not objects of worship” is not entailed by the premises, nor is its negation; hence its truth is uncertain given the information.
