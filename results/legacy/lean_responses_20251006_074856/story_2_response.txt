Story ID: 2
Premises: Billings is a city in the state of Montana in U.S.
The state of Montana includes the cities of Butte, Helena, and Missoula.
White Sulphur Springs and Butte are cities in the same state in U.S.
The city of St Pierre is not in the state of Montana.
Any city in Butte is not in St Pierre.
A city can only be in one state in U.S.  except for Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma and Union City.

Lean formalization and proofs:

- Sorts and predicates:
  - Entity: everything (cities and states)
  - City : Entity → Prop
  - State : Entity → Prop
  - In : Entity → Entity → Prop  (generic containment; when second arg is a state, it means “city is in that state”)

- Constants for entities: Billings, Montana, Butte, Helena, Missoula, WhiteSulphurSprings, StPierre, Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma, UnionCity, Bismarck.

- Axioms from the text:
  - Billings is a city; Montana is a state; Billings ∈ Montana.
  - Butte, Helena, Missoula are cities; each is in Montana.
  - White Sulphur Springs is a city and is in the same state as Butte: ∃ s, State s ∧ In WSS s ∧ In Butte s.
  - St Pierre is a city and ¬ In StPierre Montana.
  - Any city in Butte is not in St Pierre: ∀ c, City c → In c Butte → ¬ In c StPierre. (not used in the proofs below)
  - Uniqueness of a city’s state except for the four exceptions:
    ∀ c s1 s2, City c → State s1 → State s2 → In c s1 → In c s2 →
      c ≠ Bristol → c ≠ Texarkana → c ≠ Texhoma → c ≠ UnionCity → s1 = s2.
  - Distinctness needed to apply uniqueness to Butte:
    Butte ≠ Bristol, Butte ≠ Texarkana, Butte ≠ Texhoma, Butte ≠ UnionCity.

- Definition:
  same_state x y := ∃ s, State s ∧ In x s ∧ In y s.

- Proofs:
  1) Q1 (Butte and St Pierre are in the same state) is False.
     Proof sketch: Assume same_state Butte StPierre via some state s. Since Butte ∈ Montana and Butte is not an exception, uniqueness forces s = Montana, hence StPierre ∈ Montana, contradicting ¬ In StPierre Montana.

  2) Q2 (St Pierre and Bismarck are in the same state) is unprovable from the given axioms: we have no facts about Bismarck and only know StPierre is not in Montana; there could be some other state containing both, or not. So neither the statement nor its negation is derivable.

  3) Q3 (Montana is home to the city of Missoula) is True by the axiom In Missoula Montana.
