Premises: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. 
If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.

Lean formalization and attempt at proofs:

-- We disable autoImplicit to make all binder types explicit
set_option autoImplicit false

universe u

-- Domain of discourse
constant Car : Type u

-- Predicates
constant Tesla3 : Car → Prop
constant TransportMulti : Car → Prop
constant OneSeater : Car → Prop
constant SingleSeatEV : Car → Prop
constant SoloEV : Car → Prop

-- Individual
constant john : Car

-- Axioms from the text
axiom ax1 : ∀ x : Car, TransportMulti x → ¬ OneSeater x
axiom ax2 : ∀ x : Car, Tesla3 x → TransportMulti x
axiom ax3 : ∀ x : Car, SingleSeatEV x → OneSeater x
axiom ax4 : ∀ x : Car, SoloEV x → SingleSeatEV x
axiom ax5 : ¬ Tesla3 john → (¬ Tesla3 john ∨ SingleSeatEV john)

-- Derived consequences
lemma tesla3_not_oneSeater (x : Car) : Tesla3 x → ¬ OneSeater x := by
  intro hT
  have hTM : TransportMulti x := ax2 x hT
  exact ax1 x hTM

lemma soloEV_oneSeater (x : Car) : SoloEV x → OneSeater x := by
  intro hS
  have hSE : SingleSeatEV x := ax4 x hS
  exact ax3 x hSE

-- They cannot both be Tesla3 and SoloEV (consistency check)
lemma not_both_tesla3_and_soloEV_john : ¬ (Tesla3 john ∧ SoloEV john) := by
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨hT, hS⟩
  have h1 : ¬ OneSeater john := tesla3_not_oneSeater john hT
  have h2 : OneSeater john := soloEV_oneSeater john hS
  exact h1 h2

-- The given implication ax5 is a tautology (doesn't add info)
lemma ax5_is_tautology : ¬ Tesla3 john → (¬ Tesla3 john ∨ SingleSeatEV john) := by
  intro h; exact Or.inl h

-- Targets:
def Q1 : Prop := Tesla3 john
def Q2 : Prop := SoloEV john
def Q3 : Prop := ¬ SoloEV john

-- None of Q1, Q2, or Q3 is derivable from the axioms above.
-- We can derive incompatibility (not both Tesla3 and SoloEV), but nothing forces either side.

Reasoning summary:
- From Tesla3 ⇒ TransportMulti ⇒ ¬ OneSeater, and SoloEV ⇒ SingleSeatEV ⇒ OneSeater, we get that John’s car cannot be both Tesla3 and SoloEV, but we have no premise that tells us whether John’s car is Tesla3 or SoloEV.
- The clause “if John’s car is not a Tesla Model 3, then (not Tesla Model 3) or (single-seat electric car)” is a tautology of the form A → (A ∨ B) and provides no new information.
