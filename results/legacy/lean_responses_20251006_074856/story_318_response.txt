  - EpisodeOfBachelor : Show → Prop  // “is an episode of The Bachelor”
  - PortraysReal : Show → Prop  // “portrays the lives of real people”
  - RealityTV : Show → Prop  // “is a reality TV show”
- Constants:
  - BreakingBad : Show

Axioms from the text:
1) ∃ s, Monday8 s ∧ GivesRoses s
2) ∀ s, GivesRoses s → EpisodeOfBachelor s
3) Interpretation of “The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people”: episodes of The Bachelor portray the lives of real people:
   ∀ s, EpisodeOfBachelor s → PortraysReal s
4) ∀ s, PortraysReal s → RealityTV s
5) ¬ RealityTV BreakingBad

-- Q2: BB is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm
-- We show its negation holds, hence the statement is False.
theorem Q2_neg : ¬ (Monday8 BreakingBad ∧ GivesRoses BreakingBad) :=
  fun h => no_roses_breakingbad h.right

-- Q3: If roses are given out during BB, then it is on Monday at 8 pm
-- This is vacuously true since BB cannot give out roses.
theorem Q3 : GivesRoses BreakingBad → Monday8 BreakingBad :=
  fun h => False.elim (no_roses_breakingbad h)

Comments on provability:
- Q1 (“Monday8 BreakingBad”) is neither derivable nor refutable from the axioms: there is no information linking Monday8 to Breaking Bad except through roses, and we proved ¬GivesRoses BreakingBad; but that does not prohibit Monday8 BreakingBad by itself. Thus Unknown.
- Q2 is False because it entails GivesRoses BreakingBad, which contradicts ¬RealityTV BreakingBad via the given rules.
- Q3 is True (vacuously), since ¬GivesRoses BreakingBad.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
