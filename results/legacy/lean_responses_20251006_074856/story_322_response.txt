Premises: All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
Some stocks are growth stocks.
All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
KO is a mature stock.

Lean formalization and proofs:

We model entities and predicates:
- Stock, Growth, Mature, Suitable, BoughtRapid, Volatile : Entity → Prop
- KO : Entity

Axioms from the text:
- A1: ∀ x, Growth x → BoughtRapid x
- A2: ∀ x, BoughtRapid x → ¬ Suitable x
- A3: ∃ x, Stock x ∧ Growth x
- A4: ∀ x, (Stock x ∧ Mature x) → Suitable x
- A5_stock: Stock KO
- A5_mature: Mature KO

Lean code:

namespace Reasoning

universe u
constant Entity : Type u
constant Stock : Entity → Prop
constant Growth : Entity → Prop
constant Mature : Entity → Prop
constant Suitable : Entity → Prop
constant BoughtRapid : Entity → Prop
constant Volatile : Entity → Prop
constant KO : Entity

axioms
  (A1 : ∀ x, Growth x → BoughtRapid x)
  (A2 : ∀ x, BoughtRapid x → ¬ Suitable x)
  (A3 : ∃ x, Stock x ∧ Growth x)
  (A4 : ∀ x, (Stock x ∧ Mature x) → Suitable x)
  (A5_stock : Stock KO)
  (A5_mature : Mature KO)

lemma KO_suitable : Suitable KO :=
  A4 KO ⟨A5_stock, A5_mature⟩

lemma KO_not_boughtRapid : ¬ BoughtRapid KO :=
by
  intro hBR
  have hns : ¬ Suitable KO := A2 KO hBR
  exact hns KO_suitable

lemma KO_not_growth : ¬ Growth KO :=
by
  intro hG
  exact KO_not_boughtRapid (A1 KO hG)

-- Q1: KO is a stock.
theorem Q1 : Stock KO := A5_stock

-- Q2: KO is a stock and a growth stock (this is false).
theorem Q2_false : ¬ (Stock KO ∧ Growth KO) :=
by
  intro h
  exact KO_not_growth h.right

-- Q3: If KO is a growth stock or bought for rapid appreciation,
-- then KO is neither a stock nor volatile (true vacuously).
theorem Q3 : (Growth KO ∨ BoughtRapid KO) → (¬ Stock KO ∧ ¬ Volatile KO) :=
by
  intro h
  have : False :=
    h.elim
      (fun hg => KO_not_growth hg)
      (fun hbr => KO_not_boughtRapid hbr)
  exact this.elim

end Reasoning

Conclusions:
- Q1 is provable (Stock KO).
- Q2 is false since we can prove KO is not a growth stock.
- Q3 is true vacuously because the antecedent (Growth KO ∨ BoughtRapid KO) is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
3: True
