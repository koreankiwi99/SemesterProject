Story ID: 361
Premises: If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing.
If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and is cleanly, or a person who does not spill a lot of food on his clothing and is not cleanly

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean translation and proof attempt:

Entities and predicates:
- Person : Type
- Spill : Person → Prop  -- spills a lot of food on clothing
- Tidy  : Person → Prop  -- notably tidy
- Cleanly : Person → Prop
- ValueOrder : Person → Prop  -- values order and spotlessness
- FP : Person → Prop  -- family prioritizes order and spotlessness
- C : Person → Prop  -- clumsy foodie who goes out frequently to find new restaurants

Axioms from the text:
1. ∀ x, Spill x → ¬ Tidy x
2. ∀ x, C x → Spill x
3. ∀ x, Cleanly x → Tidy x
4. ∀ x, ValueOrder x → Cleanly x
5. ∀ x, FP x → ValueOrder x
6. Peter satisfies: (Spill Peter ∧ Cleanly Peter) ∨ (¬Spill Peter ∧ ¬Cleanly Peter)

Lean developments (sketch):
- From (1) and (3), we get ∀ x, ¬(Spill x ∧ Cleanly x). Hence the first disjunct in (6) is impossible, so the second must hold: ¬Spill Peter ∧ ¬Cleanly Peter.
- From ¬Spill Peter and (2), contraposition gives ¬C Peter.
- From ¬Cleanly Peter and (4), (5), contraposition gives ¬FP Peter.

Consequences for the questions:
- Q1 (Tidy Peter): From ¬Spill and ¬Cleanly we cannot derive Tidy Peter nor ¬Tidy Peter using the given axioms. Unknown.
- Q2 (C Peter ∨ FP Peter): We proved ¬C Peter and ¬FP Peter, hence ¬(C Peter ∨ FP Peter). Therefore Q2 is False.
- Q3 ((C ∧ FP) ∨ (¬C ∧ ¬FP)): We have ¬C and ¬FP, so the right disjunct holds. Therefore Q3 is True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
