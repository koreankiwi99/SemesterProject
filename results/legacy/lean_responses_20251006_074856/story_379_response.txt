Story ID: 379
Premises: People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.
If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.
If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home. 
Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and proof attempt:

We model persons and predicates:
- MB x: x was born in a multiple birth
- SBT x: x has siblings who were born together
- Spend x: x spends a lot of time hanging out/playing with siblings
- Complains x: x complains often about annoying siblings
- Home x: x lives at home
- Strangers x: x lives with strangers
- Luke: a constant person

Axioms from the text:
1. ∀x, MB x → Spend x
2. ∀x, SBT x → MB x
3. ∀x, Complains x → SBT x
4. ∀x, Home x → ¬ Strangers x
5. ∀x, Spend x → Home x
6. (MB Luke ∧ Strangers Luke) ∨ (¬ MB Luke ∧ ¬ Strangers Luke)

Lean (informal sketch, but standard Lean 4 code can prove the results below):

- From 1 and 5 and 4, MB x → Spend x → Home x → ¬ Strangers x.
- Therefore, MB Luke ∧ Strangers Luke is impossible. Using 6 and ex falso on the left disjunct, we obtain the right disjunct: ¬ MB Luke ∧ ¬ Strangers Luke.
- From 3 and 2, Complains Luke → MB Luke. With ¬ MB Luke, we conclude ¬ Complains Luke (modus tollens).

Conclusions:
- Q1 (Spend Luke): From ¬ MB Luke we cannot conclude ¬ Spend Luke (no contrapositive of 1 is given), and we also cannot conclude Spend Luke. Hence Unknown.
- Q2 (Complains Luke): We proved ¬ Complains Luke, so the statement “Luke complains often ...” is False.
- Q3 (¬ MB Luke ∧ ¬ Complains Luke): Both conjuncts were proved, so True.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
