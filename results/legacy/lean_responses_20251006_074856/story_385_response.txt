universe u
constant Person : Type u
constant Coco : Person

-- Predicates
constant Ranked : Person → Prop            -- ranked highly by the WTA
constant Active : Person → Prop            -- among the most active players in major tennis
constant LostIga : Person → Prop           -- lost to Iga Świątek at Roland Garros 2022

-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom ax1 : ∀ x, Ranked x → Active x
axiom ax2 : ∀ x, LostIga x → Ranked x
axiom ax3 : ∀ x, FemaleRG x → LostIga x
axiom ax4 : ∀ x, PlayerRG x → (FemaleRG x ∨ MaleRG x)
axiom ax5 : ∀ x, MaleRG x → LostNadal x
axiom ax6 : (Ranked Coco ∨ LostNadal Coco) → ¬ (MaleRG Coco)
axiom ax7 : PlayerRG Coco

lemma ranked_Coco : Ranked Coco := ax2 Coco lostIga_Coco
lemma active_Coco : Active Coco := ax1 Coco ranked_Coco

-- Q1: Coco is among the most active Grand-Slam players.
theorem Q1 : Active Coco := active_Coco  -- True

-- Q3: The statement "¬ (LostIga Coco ∧ Active Coco)" is false,
-- since we can prove both conjuncts.
lemma both_Coco : LostIga Coco ∧ Active Coco := And.intro lostIga_Coco active_Coco
theorem Q3_false : ¬ (¬ (LostIga Coco ∧ Active Coco)) := by
  intro h
  exact h both_Coco  -- Therefore, the original statement is False.

-- Q2: We cannot derive LostNadal Coco nor its negation from the axioms above.
