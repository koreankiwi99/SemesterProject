constant Person : Type u

-- Predicates
constant WorksInLibrary : Person → Prop
constant FromCS : Person → Prop
constant UniPTJob : Person → Prop
constant TakesDB : Person → Prop
constant TakesWithDavid : Person → Prop
constant WorksInLab : Person → Prop

-- Individual
constant James : Person

-- Premises
axiom A1 : ∀ x, WorksInLibrary x → ¬ FromCS x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, UniPTJob x → WorksInLibrary x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, TakesDB x → FromCS x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, TakesWithDavid x → TakesDB x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, WorksInLab x → TakesWithDavid x
axiom A6 : WorksInLab James
-- Natural-language “or” taken as disjunction over the two clauses
axiom A7 : ¬ WorksInLab James ∨ ¬ UniPTJob James

-- Derived facts
lemma james_takes_db : TakesDB James := by
  have htd : TakesWithDavid James := A5 James A6
  exact A4 James htd

lemma james_from_cs : FromCS James := A3 James james_takes_db

lemma not_uniPT : ¬ UniPTJob James := by
  intro hpt

  have notCS : ¬ FromCS James := A1 James hLib

-- Answers to questions
-- Q1: James has a university part-time job. We prove its negation.
lemma Q1 : ¬ UniPTJob James := not_uniPT

-- Q2: James does not have a university part-time job. We prove it.
lemma Q2 : ¬ UniPTJob James := not_uniPT

-- Q3: James either takes DB or has a university part-time job. We prove the disjunction via the left disjunct.
lemma Q3 : TakesDB James ∨ UniPTJob James := Or.inl james_takes_db

-- Q4: James takes the database course. We proved this above.
lemma Q4 : TakesDB James := james_takes_db

ANSWERS:
1: False
2: True
3: True
