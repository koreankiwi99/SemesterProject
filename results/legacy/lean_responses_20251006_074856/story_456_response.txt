Story ID: 456
Premises: Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. 
Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and attempt:

We model:
- Person : Type
- A x := x is an American national
- P x := x is a professional basketball player
- J x := x can do jump shots
- L x := x leaps straight into the air
- M x := x activates leg muscles
- y : Person is Yuri

Axioms from the text:
- h1: ∃ x, P x ∧ ¬ A x
- h2: ∀ x, P x → J x
- h3: ∀ x, J x → L x
- h4: ∀ x, L x → M x
- h5: ¬ M y

Lean code:

universe u
constant Person : Type u
constants (A P J L M : Person → Prop)
constant y : Person

  (h1 : ∃ x, P x ∧ ¬ A x)
  (h2 : ∀ x, P x → J x)
  (h3 : ∀ x, J x → L x)
  (h4 : ∀ x, L x → M x)
  (h5 : ¬ M y)

lemma not_L_y : ¬ L y := by
  intro Ly
  have My : M y := h4 y Ly
  exact h5 My

lemma not_J_y : ¬ J y := by
  intro Jy
  exact not_L_y (h3 y Jy)

lemma not_P_y : ¬ P y := by
  intro Py
  exact not_J_y (h2 y Py)

-- Q1 (A y) is not derivable from the axioms; no proof here.

-- Q2: Yuri is not an American professional basketball player: ¬(A y ∧ P y)
theorem q2 : ¬ (A y ∧ P y) := by
  intro h
  exact not_P_y h.right

-- Q3: Yuri is an American professional basketball player is false
theorem q3_false : ¬ (A y ∧ P y) := q2

-- Q4: If ¬L y then A y ∧ P y is false
theorem q4_false : ¬ ((¬ L y) → (A y ∧ P y)) := by
  intro hImp
  have hAP : A y ∧ P y := hImp not_L_y
  exact q2 hAP

-- Q5: If ¬(A y ∧ P y) then P y is false
theorem q5_false : ¬ (¬ (A y ∧ P y) → P y) := by
  intro hImp
  have hP : P y := hImp q2
  exact not_P_y hP

end

Conclusions from the proofs:
- From ¬M y and the chain of implications, we derived ¬L y, ¬J y, and ¬P y.
- Q1 (A y) is not determined by the premises (Unknown).
- Q2 is true since ¬P y implies ¬(A y ∧ P y).
- Q3 is false since A y ∧ P y contradicts ¬P y.
- Q4 is false because ¬L y holds, yet A y ∧ P y does not.
- Q5 is false because ¬(A y ∧ P y) holds while P y does not.

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: True
