Lean formalization and attempt:

-- Universe of items (films)
universe u
constant Item : Type u

-- Predicates
constant Film : Item → Prop
constant AppropriateAllAges : Item → Prop
constant ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance : Item → Prop
constant ExcessiveEroticViolentContent : Item → Prop
constant RatedGA : Item → Prop
constant FamilyFriendlyAnimated : Item → Prop
constant FrozenSeries : Item → Prop

-- Constant for the specific film
constant Hachi : Item

-- Axioms from the textual context
axiom ax1 : ∀ x, AppropriateAllAges x → ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance x
axiom ax2 : ∀ x, ExcessiveEroticViolentContent x → ¬ ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance x
axiom ax3 : ∀ x, RatedGA x → AppropriateAllAges x
axiom ax4 : ∀ x, FamilyFriendlyAnimated x → RatedGA x
axiom ax5 : ∀ x, FrozenSeries x → FamilyFriendlyAnimated x
axiom ax6 : Film Hachi
axiom ax7 : FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateAllAges Hachi

-- Derived facts

      have hGA : RatedGA Hachi := ax4 Hachi hFam
      exact ax3 Hachi hGA
  | inr hApp =>

by
  intro hEx
  have hNotCW : ¬ ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi := ax2 Hachi hEx
  exact hNotCW Hachi_children_can_watch

-- Notes toward the questions:
-- Q1 asks for RatedGA Hachi. From ax7 we get AppropriateAllAges Hachi (as shown),
-- but ax3 is only one-way (RatedGA → Appropriate), so we cannot derive RatedGA Hachi.
-- Neither its negation is derivable from the given axioms. Hence Unknown.

-- Q2 asks for ExcessiveEroticViolentContent Hachi ∨ FrozenSeries Hachi.
-- We proved ¬ ExcessiveEroticViolentContent Hachi, but we have no information to prove
-- FrozenSeries Hachi or its negation. Thus the disjunction is not provable nor refutable. Unknown.

-- Q3 asks for (ExcessiveEroticViolentContent Hachi ∧ FrozenSeries Hachi) ∨ (¬ExcessiveEroticViolentContent Hachi ∧ ¬FrozenSeries Hachi).
-- Using Hachi_not_excessive, this reduces to False ∨ (True ∧ ¬FrozenSeries Hachi), i.e., ¬FrozenSeries Hachi,
-- which we cannot prove or refute from the axioms. Hence Unknown.

ANSWERS:
