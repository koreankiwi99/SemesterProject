Lean formalization and proof attempts:

We model people as a type Person with individuals Vladimir and Ekaterina. Predicates:
- CanRegisterUS : Person → Prop
- CanParticipate2024 : Person → Prop
- USCitizen : Person → Prop
- TaiwaneseCitizen : Person → Prop
- RussianFederationOfficial : Person → Prop
- ManagerGazprom : Person → Prop

Axioms from the context:
1. ∀ x, CanRegisterUS x → CanParticipate2024 x
2. ∀ x, USCitizen x → CanRegisterUS x
3. ∀ x, USCitizen x ∨ TaiwaneseCitizen x
4. ∀ x, RussianFederationOfficial x → ¬ TaiwaneseCitizen x
5. ¬ TaiwaneseCitizen Vladimir ∧ ¬ ManagerGazprom Vladimir
6. CanRegisterUS Ekaterina ∨ RussianFederationOfficial Ekaterina
