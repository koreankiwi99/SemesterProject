Lean analysis:

We model entities and predicates:
- Types: Event, Place, Country
- Constants: SummerOlympics, LastSummerOlympics, WorldChampionships, TokyoOlympics : Event; Tokyo : Place; UnitedStates : Country
- Predicates: SportingEvent : Event → Prop; HeldIn : Event → Place → Prop; WonMostMedalsAt : Country → Event → Prop

Facts from the text:
- h1: SportingEvent SummerOlympics
- h2: HeldIn LastSummerOlympics Tokyo
- h2_eq: LastSummerOlympics = TokyoOlympics
- h3: WonMostMedalsAt UnitedStates TokyoOlympics

Interpretation note: “The United States won the most medals in Tokyo” is formalized as h3, i.e., at the Tokyo Olympics event. The statement “The last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo” is captured via h2 and, for alignment, via h2_eq identifying the last Summer Olympics with the Tokyo Olympics event.

Goals and proofs:
- Q1: SportingEvent WorldChampionships. There is no information connecting WorldChampionships to SportingEvent; neither the statement nor its negation is derivable from the given facts. Unknown.

- Q2: ¬ HeldIn LastSummerOlympics Tokyo. From h2 we can prove the negation of this statement:
  q2_neg: HeldIn LastSummerOlympics Tokyo := h2
  Hence the original statement is false.

- Q3: WonMostMedalsAt UnitedStates LastSummerOlympics. Using equality h2_eq and h3:
  q3: WonMostMedalsAt UnitedStates LastSummerOlympics
      by rewriting h3 along h2_eq.

Therefore:
- Q1: Unknown (unprovable and irrefutable from given facts)
- Q2: False (we can prove its negation)
- Q3: True (we can prove the statement)

ANSWERS:
1: Unknown
2: False
3: True
