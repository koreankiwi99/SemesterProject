==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and proofs:

universe u

constant Person : Type u
constant Book : Type u

constant Reads : Person → Book → Prop
constant GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop
constant Smarter : Person → Prop
constant ContainsKnowledge : Book → Prop

-- Knowledge base
axiom books_contain_knowledge : ∀ b : Book, ContainsKnowledge b
axiom reading_gives_knowledge : ∀ p : Person, ∀ b : Book, Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p
axiom knowledge_makes_smarter : ∀ p : Person, GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p

-- Facts about Harry and Walden
constant harry : Person
constant walden : Book
axiom harry_read_walden : Reads harry walden

-- Q1: Walden contains knowledge.
theorem Q1 : ContainsKnowledge walden :=
  books_contain_knowledge walden

-- Q2: Harry is smarter than before.
theorem Q2 : Smarter harry :=
  knowledge_makes_smarter harry (reading_gives_knowledge harry walden harry_read_walden)

-- Q3: A smarter person has gained knowledge. Not derivable from the given axioms.
-- Target would be: ∀ p : Person, Smarter p → GainsKnowledge p
-- Neither this statement nor its negation follows from the current axioms.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: True
3: Unknown
