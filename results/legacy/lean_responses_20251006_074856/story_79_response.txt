Lean formalization and proof attempts:

namespace Reasoning

universe u

constant Person : Type u
constant Team : Type u

constant RL : Person
constant BM : Team

constant Striker : Person → Prop
constant SoccerPlayer : Person → Prop
constant PlaysFor : Person → Team → Prop
constant Left : Person → Team → Prop
constant Star : Person → Prop

axiom h1 : Striker RL
axiom h2 : ∀ p : Person, Striker p → SoccerPlayer p
axiom h3 : Left RL BM
axiom h4 : ∀ p : Person, ∀ t : Team, Left p t → ¬ PlaysFor p t

-- Q1: Robert Lewandowski is a soccer player.
theorem Q1_true : SoccerPlayer RL := h2 RL h1

-- Q2: Robert Lewandowski plays for Bayern Munchen.
def Q2_stmt : Prop := PlaysFor RL BM
theorem Q2_false : ¬ Q2_stmt := by
  unfold Q2_stmt
  exact h4 RL BM h3

-- Q3: Robert Lewandowski is a star.
def Q3_stmt : Prop := Star RL
-- No derivation available from given axioms.
