Story ID: 83
Premises: All vehicle registration plates in Istanbul begin with the number 34.
Plates that do not begin with the number 34 are not from Istanbul. 
Joe's vehicle registration plate is from Istanbul. 
Tom's license plate begins with the number 35. 
If a license plate begins with the number 35, then it does not begin with the number 34.

Model Response:
==================================================
Lean formalization and proof attempt:

universe u

constant Plate : Type u
constant Joe : Plate
constant Tom : Plate

constant begins34 : Plate → Prop
constant begins35 : Plate → Prop
constant fromIstanbul : Plate → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom ax1 : ∀ p : Plate, fromIstanbul p → begins34 p
axiom ax2 : ∀ p : Plate, ¬ begins34 p → ¬ fromIstanbul p
axiom axJoe : fromIstanbul Joe
axiom axTom35 : begins35 Tom
axiom ax35not34 : ∀ p : Plate, begins35 p → ¬ begins34 p

-- Q1: Joe's license plate begins with the number 34.
theorem Q1 : begins34 Joe :=
  ax1 Joe axJoe

-- Q2 (target statement would be: fromIstanbul Tom), but we can prove its negation.
theorem not_Q2 : ¬ fromIstanbul Tom :=
by
  have hnot34 : ¬ begins34 Tom := (ax35not34 Tom) axTom35
  exact (ax2 Tom) hnot34

We proved Q1 directly. For Q2, we proved its negation, so the statement is false.

ANSWERS:
1: True
2: False
