Premises: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars. 
If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. 
Conclusion: John's car is a Solo EV.

-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
axiom premise1 : ∀ x : Car, TransportsMultiple x → ¬ OneSeater x
-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
axiom premise2 : ∀ x : Car, TeslaModel3 x → TransportsMultiple x
-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
axiom premise3 : ∀ x : Car, SingleSeatElectric x → OneSeater x
-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
axiom premise4 : ∀ x : Car, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectric x
-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
axiom premise5 : (¬ TeslaModel3 JohnsCar) → (¬ TeslaModel3 JohnsCar ∨ SingleSeatElectric JohnsCar)
-- John's car is a Solo EV.
