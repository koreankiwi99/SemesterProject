Premises: If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate. 
Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer. 
All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.
Conclusion: If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu.
