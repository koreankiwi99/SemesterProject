Story ID: 456
Example ID: 1316
Premises: Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles. 
Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.
Conclusion: If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player.
