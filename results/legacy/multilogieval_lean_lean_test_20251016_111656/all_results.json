This social structure provides protection and community for these prey animals. However, not all black and white animals are highly social. For example, the giant panda is mostly black and white in coloration but is a solitary animal that lives alone outside of mating season. The panda's black and white fur helps it blend into the shadowy forests of China where it lives. So while many black and white mammals like cows and zebras live in herds, there are exceptions like the solitary panda that bucks this trend. The panda's individual lifestyle shows that not all black and white animals necessarily live in big groups.\n\ndoes this imply that cows usually live in groups?"

Even though most fruits grow on trees, this particular orange was sitting on the floor and not on its tree. Mary decided not to get that orange since it was dirty.

As she was picking out some fresh apples and oranges from the produce bins, she noticed one of the oranges seemed to have fallen on the ground. It must have rolled off the table it was displayed on. Even though most fruits grow on trees, this particular orange was sitting on the floor and not on its tree. Mary decided not to get that orange since it was dirty. She collected the rest of her apples, oranges and bananas that were still fresh on their displays. After paying for her fruit, Mary left the market satisfied with her fruity purchases.\n\ndoes this mean that bananas are growing on a tree and exactly one of the apples or oranges is not growing on a tree?"
