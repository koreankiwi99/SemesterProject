Context:
If a person learns to play the guitar, then they can entertain themselves. Moreover, if they take singing lessons, then they can improve their vocal skills. However, they find themselves in a situation where they either do not entertain themselves or do not improve their vocal skills.

Question:
Does it entail that for Alex, who is learning music, either they do not learn to play the guitar or they do not take singing lessons?

axiom Person : Type
axiom Alex : Person

axiom LearnGuitar : Person → Prop
axiom TakeSingingLessons : Person → Prop
axiom EntertainSelf : Person → Prop
axiom ImproveVocalSkills : Person → Prop
axiom LearningMusic : Person → Prop

-- Alex is learning music (mentioned but not used in the reasoning)
axiom alex_learning_music : LearningMusic Alex

-- Premises
axiom guitar_entertain : ∀ p : Person, LearnGuitar p → EntertainSelf p
axiom singing_improve : ∀ p : Person, TakeSingingLessons p → ImproveVocalSkills p
axiom alex_not_entertain_or_not_improve : ¬ EntertainSelf Alex ∨ ¬ ImproveVocalSkills Alex

-- Conclusion: For Alex, either they do not learn guitar or they do not take singing lessons
theorem alex_not_guitar_or_not_singing :
  (¬ LearnGuitar Alex) ∨ (¬ TakeSingingLessons Alex) := by
  cases alex_not_entertain_or_not_improve with
  | inl hNotEnt =>
      apply Or.inl
      intro hLG
      have hEnt : EntertainSelf Alex := guitar_entertain Alex hLG
      exact hNotEnt hEnt
  | inr hNotImp =>
      apply Or.inr
      intro hTSL
      have hImp : ImproveVocalSkills Alex := singing_improve Alex hTSL
