LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Amy : Person

axiom GoodTimeManagement : Person → Prop
axiom AccomplishesMoreInLessTime : Person → Prop

-- Premise: If someone has good time management skills, they can accomplish more in less time.
axiom premise_implication : ∀ x : Person, GoodTimeManagement x → AccomplishesMoreInLessTime x

-- Premise: Amy does not accomplish more in less time.
axiom premise_Amy_not_more : ¬ AccomplishesMoreInLessTime Amy

-- Conclusion: Amy does not have good time management skills.
theorem Amy_not_good_time_management : ¬ GoodTimeManagement Amy := by
  intro hGood
  have hMore : AccomplishesMoreInLessTime Amy := premise_implication Amy hGood
  exact premise_Amy_not_more hMore
</lean>
