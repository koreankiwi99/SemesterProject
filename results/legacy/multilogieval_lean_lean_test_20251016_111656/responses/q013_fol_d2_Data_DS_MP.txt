Context:
In a community garden, if someone plants vegetables early in the season, they harvest a large crop. However, it is not certain if the soil is fertile. People are sure that either the vegetables are planted early, or the soil is fertile, or both.

Question:
Mia's soil was not fertile. Does this mean Mia harvested a large crop?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Mia : Person

axiom PlantsEarly : Person → Prop
axiom FertileSoil : Person → Prop
axiom LargeCrop : Person → Prop

-- Premises from the context
axiom early_implies_large : ∀ x : Person, PlantsEarly x → LargeCrop x
axiom early_or_fertile : ∀ x : Person, PlantsEarly x ∨ FertileSoil x

-- Mia's soil was not fertile
axiom mia_not_fertile : ¬ FertileSoil Mia

theorem mia_harvested_large_crop : LargeCrop Mia := by
  have h := early_or_fertile Mia
  have h_early : PlantsEarly Mia := by
    cases h with
    | inl hE => exact hE
    | inr hF => exact False.elim (mia_not_fertile hF)
  exact early_implies_large Mia h_early
