Context:
An aspiring musician decided to try writing their own songs. They realized that if they composed original music, their work would be unique; if they promoted their music online, they would gain a following. The musician could write original songs or promote their music online.

Question:
Given that Maria's music was not unique, is it true that she gained a following online?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Maria : Person

axiom Original : Person → Prop
axiom Unique : Person → Prop
axiom Promoted : Person → Prop
axiom Following : Person → Prop

axiom h1 : Original Maria → Unique Maria
axiom h2 : Promoted Maria → Following Maria
axiom h3 : Original Maria ∨ Promoted Maria
axiom h4 : ¬ Unique Maria

theorem gained_following : Following Maria := by
  have notO : ¬ Original Maria := by
    intro o
    exact h4 (h1 o)
  have p : Promoted Maria := by
    cases h3 with
    | inl o => exact False.elim (notO o)
    | inr p => exact p
  exact h2 p
