Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: BD_DS
Source: data/multi_logi_original/data/d2_Data/fol/BD_DS.json

Context:
A student hoped to excel in class. They believed that if they took good notes, they would understand the material well, and if they did all the homework, they would get high marks. However, the student can either take good notes or not get high marks.

Question:
James didn't understand the material well. Is it true that James took good notes?
