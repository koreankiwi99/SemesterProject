Context:
If the sun is out, the pool gets crowded. If the pool gets crowded, there's a long wait for the waterslides. If it's payday, people go shopping. Today, either the sun was out, or it was payday, or both happened.

Question:
There was no long wait for the waterslides today. Did people go shopping?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom SunOut : Prop
axiom PoolCrowded : Prop
axiom LongWait : Prop
axiom Payday : Prop
axiom Shopping : Prop

axiom sun_implies_crowded : SunOut → PoolCrowded
axiom crowded_implies_longwait : PoolCrowded → LongWait
axiom payday_implies_shopping : Payday → Shopping
axiom sun_or_payday_today : SunOut ∨ Payday
axiom no_long_wait_today : ¬ LongWait

theorem shopping_today : Shopping := by
  have sun_implies_longwait : SunOut → LongWait := fun s => crowded_implies_longwait (sun_implies_crowded s)
  have not_sun : ¬ SunOut := fun s => no_long_wait_today (sun_implies_longwait s)
  have payday_today : Payday := by

ANSWER: Yes

Extracted Lean Code:
----------------------------------------
axiom SunOut : Prop
axiom PoolCrowded : Prop
axiom LongWait : Prop
axiom Payday : Prop
axiom Shopping : Prop

axiom crowded_implies_longwait : PoolCrowded → LongWait
axiom payday_implies_shopping : Payday → Shopping
axiom sun_or_payday_today : SunOut ∨ Payday
axiom no_long_wait_today : ¬ LongWait

theorem shopping_today : Shopping := by
  have sun_implies_longwait : SunOut → LongWait := fun s => crowded_implies_longwait (sun_implies_crowded s)
  have not_sun : ¬ SunOut := fun s => no_long_wait_today (sun_implies_longwait s)
  have payday_today : Payday := by
    cases sun_or_payday_today with
