Context:
In a small town, the mayor wanted citizens to live healthy and active lifestyles. They knew that if people exercised regularly, they would be fit, and if they ate nutritious foods, they would have energy. But not everyone in town was active or energetic. The mayor concluded that some citizens must not exercise or must not eat well. The mayor understood that if someone valued wellness, they would exercise regularly.

Question:
Jane eats very nutritious foods. From the context, is it true that Jane values wellness?

-- From Jane eating nutritious foods, we can conclude she is energetic.

-- Note: From the given premises, there is no way to derive ValuesWellness Jane.
-- We can only derive that if someone values wellness, they exercise, but not the converse.
-- Hence we cannot prove ValuesWellness Jane from the provided information.
