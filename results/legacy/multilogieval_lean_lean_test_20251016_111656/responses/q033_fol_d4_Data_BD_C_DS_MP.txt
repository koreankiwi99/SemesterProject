Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP
Source: data/multi_logi_original/data/d4_Data/fol/BD_C_DS_MP.json

Context:
If the pilot checks the plane thoroughly, it will fly safely. If there is heavy fog, all flights get delayed. Either she inspected the plane well, or there were no delays, or the plane was checked but flights left on time. If the flight is safe, the passengers will be grateful.

Question:
There was heavy fog today, does it entail that the passengers were grateful?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Checked : Prop           -- the pilot checked the plane thoroughly
axiom Safe : Prop              -- the flight is safe
axiom HeavyFog : Prop          -- there is heavy fog
axiom Delayed : Prop           -- the flight is delayed
axiom Grateful : Prop          -- the passengers are grateful

-- Premises from the text
axiom h1 : Checked → Safe
axiom h2 : HeavyFog → Delayed
-- Either the plane was checked, or there were no delays, or it was checked and there were no delays.
-- "flights left on time" is modeled as "not Delayed".
axiom h3 : Checked ∨ ¬ Delayed ∨ (Checked ∧ ¬ Delayed)
axiom h4 : Safe → Grateful

-- Fact: there was heavy fog today
axiom fog_today : HeavyFog

theorem passengers_grateful : Grateful := by
  have d : Delayed := h2 fog_today
  cases h3 with
  | inl hc =>
      exact h4 (h1 hc)
  | inr rest =>
      cases rest with
      | inl notd =>
          exact False.elim (notd d)
      | inr hc_and_notd =>
          exact h4 (h1 hc_and_notd.left)
</lean>
