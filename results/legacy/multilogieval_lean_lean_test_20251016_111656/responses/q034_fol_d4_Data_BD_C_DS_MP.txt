Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Context:
If a student studies hard, they will earn high marks on the test. If the teacher makes the test very difficult, many students will fail. Either the student studies hard, or the test will not be too hard, or the student studies hard and the test will not be too difficult. It's expected that if someone earns high marks, they will be satisfied with their performance.

Question:
The teacher made the test very difficult, will the student be satisfied with their performance?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Studies : Prop
axiom HighMarks : Prop
axiom VeryDifficult : Prop
axiom ManyFail : Prop
axiom Satisfied : Prop

-- Premises
axiom p1 : Studies → HighMarks
axiom p2 : VeryDifficult → ManyFail
axiom p3 : Studies ∨ ¬ VeryDifficult ∨ (Studies ∧ ¬ VeryDifficult)
axiom p4 : HighMarks → Satisfied

-- Fact: The teacher made the test very difficult
axiom difficult_fact : VeryDifficult

theorem student_satisfied : Satisfied := by
  -- From the disjunction and the fact that the test is very difficult, derive Studies
  have hStudies : Studies := by
    cases p3 with
    | inl hs => exact hs
    | inr rest =>
      cases rest with
      | inl notD =>
          exact False.elim (notD difficult_fact)
      | inr both =>
          exact both.left
  -- Then get HighMarks and hence Satisfied
  have hHigh : HighMarks := p1 hStudies
  exact p4 hHigh
