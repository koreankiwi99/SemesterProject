Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS_MP

Context:
It was the first morning of a big camping trip. If it rains during the night, then the tent leaks. If the tent leaks, then people's sleeping bags get wet. If someone forgets to tie down their tent, then it blows away in the wind. Either it rained last night or someone forgot to tie down their tent, or both things happened. The camp leader knows that if the tents blow away, then campers wake up frustrated.

Question:
Nobody's sleeping bag got wet last night. Did the campers wake up frustrated?
