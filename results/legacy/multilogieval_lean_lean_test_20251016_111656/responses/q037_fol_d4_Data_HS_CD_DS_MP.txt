Context:
It was the morning of a big game day in town. If the hometown team wins, then fans celebrate in the streets. If fans celebrate in the streets, then local businesses get more customers. If the hometown team loses, then fans feel disappointed. Either the hometown team won or they lost today. The mayor knows that if fans feel disappointed, then fewer people come downtown.

Question:
Local businesses did not get many customers today. Did fewer people come downtown?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Wins : Prop
axiom Loses : Prop
axiom Celebrate : Prop
axiom MoreCustomers : Prop
axiom Disappointed : Prop
axiom FewerDowntown : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom h1 : Wins → Celebrate
axiom h2 : Celebrate → MoreCustomers
axiom h3 : Loses → Disappointed
axiom h4 : Wins ∨ Loses
axiom h5 : Disappointed → FewerDowntown
axiom h6 : ¬ MoreCustomers

theorem conclusion : FewerDowntown := by
  -- From Wins we get MoreCustomers
  have hWM : Wins → MoreCustomers := fun w => h2 (h1 w)
  -- Since not MoreCustomers, we get not Wins
  have notWins : ¬ Wins := fun w => h6 (hWM w)
  -- From Wins ∨ Loses and ¬Wins, deduce Loses
  have l : Loses := Or.resolve_left h4 notWins
  -- Therefore Disappointed, hence FewerDowntown
  have d : Disappointed := h3 l
  exact h5 d
</lean>
