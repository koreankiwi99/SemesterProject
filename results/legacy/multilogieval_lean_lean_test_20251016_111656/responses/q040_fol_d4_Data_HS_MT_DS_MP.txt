Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Context:
Someone wanted to become an author and get their book published. They realized that if they wrote every day, they would complete writing their book. And if they completed their book, they could get it published. Either they wrote every day, or they took writing classes to improve their skills, or both. If someone takes writing classes, they gain valuable feedback on their work.

Question:
Mary did not get her book published. Did she gain valuable feedback on her work?
