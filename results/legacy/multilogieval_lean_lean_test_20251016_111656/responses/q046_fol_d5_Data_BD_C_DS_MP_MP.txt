Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Context:
If the crops get enough sunlight, they will grow strong. If it is windy, trees might fall over. Either the plants got good sunlight, or no trees fell. If the crops grow strong, the harvest will be plentiful. When there is a big harvest, the farmer makes a good profit.

Question:
If it was very windy this season, did the farmer make a good profit from the harvest?
