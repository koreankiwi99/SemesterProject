Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Context:
In the neighborhood, if someone hosts a party, their house gets very noisy. Also, if someone is practicing drums, the noise levels go up. Either there is a party, or someone is playing drums, or maybe both. So, if the house gets noisy from a party, neighbors start complaining. And if neighbors complain, the police are called to intervene.

Question:
If there was no noise level up, were the police called to intervene?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Party : Prop
axiom Drum : Prop
axiom Noise : Prop
axiom Complain : Prop
axiom Police : Prop

axiom party_implies_noise : Party → Noise
axiom drum_implies_noise : Drum → Noise
axiom party_or_drum : Party ∨ Drum
axiom party_implies_complain : Party → Complain
axiom complain_implies_police : Complain → Police

theorem police_called_if_no_noise : ¬Noise → Police := by
  intro hno
  have hN : Noise := party_or_drum.elim
    (fun hp => party_implies_noise hp)
    (fun hd => drum_implies_noise hd)
