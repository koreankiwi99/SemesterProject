Context:
If the oven temperature is set to 350 degrees, the cake will bake properly. If the cake batter contains eggs, it will be fluffy when baked. Either Sam set the oven temperature correctly, or the cake batter did not contain eggs. If a cake bakes properly, it will taste delicious. If a cake tastes delicious, guests at the party will be happy.

Question:
If the cake batter contained eggs, will the guests at the party be happy?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Oven350 : Prop
axiom BakeProperly : Prop
axiom Eggs : Prop
axiom Fluffy : Prop
axiom SamSetCorrect : Prop
axiom Delicious : Prop
axiom GuestsHappy : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom h1 : Oven350 → BakeProperly
axiom h2 : Eggs → Fluffy
axiom h3 : SamSetCorrect ∨ ¬ Eggs
axiom h4 : BakeProperly → Delicious
axiom h5 : Delicious → GuestsHappy
-- Interpreting "set correctly" as setting to 350 degrees
axiom h6 : SamSetCorrect → Oven350

theorem guests_happy_if_eggs : Eggs → GuestsHappy := by
  intro eggs
  have sc : SamSetCorrect := by
    cases h3 with
    | inl sc => exact sc
    | inr notEggs =>
        exact False.elim (notEggs eggs)
  have o350 : Oven350 := h6 sc
  have b : BakeProperly := h1 o350
  have d : Delicious := h4 b
