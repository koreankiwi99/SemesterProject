Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: default_reasoning_default
Source: data/multi_logi_original/data/d1_Data/nm/default_reasoning_default.json

Context:
John and Maria are students in math class. Typically students in math class take tests. John sometimes skips tests even when assigned.

Question:
Can we conclude Maria takes tests?

Iterations:

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom John : Person
axiom Maria : Person

axiom StudentInMath : Person → Prop
axiom TakesTests : Person → Prop
axiom SkipsTestsSometimes : Person → Prop

-- Premises
axiom john_student : StudentInMath John
axiom maria_student : StudentInMath Maria

-- "Typically students in math class take tests" modeled as: all students in math class take tests
axiom typical_students_take_tests : ∀ x : Person, StudentInMath x → TakesTests x

-- "John sometimes skips tests even when assigned" (does not contradict that he takes tests in general)
axiom john_sometimes_skips : SkipsTestsSometimes John

-- Conclusion: Maria takes tests
theorem maria_takes_tests : TakesTests Maria := by
  exact typical_students_take_tests Maria maria_student
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
