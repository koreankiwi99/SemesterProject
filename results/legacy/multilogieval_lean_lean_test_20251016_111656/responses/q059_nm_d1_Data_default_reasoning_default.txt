Context:
John and Mary are students in the same class. Typically, students in that class submit assignments online. However, John prefers to submit assignments on paper.

Question:
Can we conclude that Mary submits assignments online?

  constructor <;> simp [InClass]

theorem typical_behavior : TypicallyStudentsSubmitOnline C := by
  simp [TypicallyStudentsSubmitOnline]

theorem john_prefers_paper : PrefersPaper John := by
  simp [PrefersPaper]

-- Target claim from the question (can we conclude Mary submits online?)
-- We show the negation holds in this formalization: Mary does not submit online.
