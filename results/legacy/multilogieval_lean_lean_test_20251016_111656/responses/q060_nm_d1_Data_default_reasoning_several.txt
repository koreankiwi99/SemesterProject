Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: default_reasoning_several
Source: data/multi_logi_original/data/d1_Data/nm/default_reasoning_several.json

Context:
In software development, programmers who are skilled in algorithm design usually can solve complex problems. They also often contribute to open source projects. Dev1 cannot solve complex problems, while Dev2 does not contribute to open source.

Question:
Can we conclude that Dev2 can solve complex problems and Dev1 contributes to open source?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Dev1 : Person
axiom Dev2 : Person

axiom Skilled : Person → Prop
axiom SolvesComplexProblems : Person → Prop
axiom ContributesOpenSource : Person → Prop

-- From the text (interpreting "usually/often" as generic implication rules):
axiom skilled_implies_solves : ∀ p : Person, Skilled p → SolvesComplexProblems p
axiom solves_implies_contributes : ∀ p : Person, SolvesComplexProblems p → ContributesOpenSource p

-- Given specific facts:
axiom dev1_cannot_solve : ¬ SolvesComplexProblems Dev1
axiom dev2_does_not_contribute : ¬ ContributesOpenSource Dev2

-- The asked conclusion would be: SolvesComplexProblems Dev2 ∧ ContributesOpenSource Dev1
-- We show its negation follows from the premises.
theorem not_conclusion : ¬ (SolvesComplexProblems Dev2 ∧ ContributesOpenSource Dev1) := by
  intro h
  have hsolve2 : SolvesComplexProblems Dev2 := h.left
  have hcontrib2 : ContributesOpenSource Dev2 := solves_implies_contributes Dev2 hsolve2
