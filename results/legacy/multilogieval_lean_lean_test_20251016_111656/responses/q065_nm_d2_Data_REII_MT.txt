Context:
Mike adopted a dog from an animal shelter. Usually, dogs from shelters have been vaccinated. However, some owner-surrendered dogs may not have complete vaccination records. If a dog is too young, it will not have all its vaccinations yet.

Question:
Can we conclude Mike's dog is too young to be fully vaccinated?
