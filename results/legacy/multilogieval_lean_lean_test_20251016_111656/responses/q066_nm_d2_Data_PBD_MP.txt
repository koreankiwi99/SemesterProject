Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Context:
The coach said the player scored 30 points in the game. The referee said the player did not score 30 points. Officials are normally correct. The coach has better information than the referee. If the player scored 30 points, he likely had an exceptional game.

Question:
Can we conclude the player had an exceptional game?

axiom Agent : Type

axiom referee : Agent

-- Core propositions
axiom Scored30 : Prop
axiom Exceptional : Prop

-- "Likely" modality to capture non-definitive statements
axiom Likely : Prop → Prop

-- Speech acts

-- Information quality
axiom BetterInfo : Agent → Agent → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom coach_said : SaidScored30 coach
axiom referee_said : SaidNotScored30 referee
axiom coach_better_than_referee : BetterInfo coach referee

-- Resolution principle: prefer the better-informed statement in a direct conflict
axiom resolve_conflict :
  ∀ {a b : Agent}, SaidScored30 a → SaidNotScored30 b → BetterInfo a b → Scored30

-- If the player scored 30, then it is likely he had an exceptional game
axiom scored30_implies_likely_exceptional : Scored30 → Likely Exceptional

-- From the above, we can conclude only "Likely Exceptional", not "Exceptional"
theorem likely_exceptional : Likely Exceptional := by
  have h30 : Scored30 := resolve_conflict coach_said referee_said coach_better_than_referee
