Context: If a person learns to play the guitar, then they can entertain themselves. Moreover, if they take singing lessons, then they can improve their vocal skills. However, they find themselves in a situation where they either do not entertain themselves or do not improve their vocal skills.
Question: Does it entail that for Alex, who is learning music, either they do not learn to play the guitar or they do not take singing lessons?
Reasoning steps: 
- If someone learns guitar (G), then they entertain themselves (E). If they take singing lessons (S), then they improve vocal skills (V).
- If both G and S were true, then both E and V would be true.
- But we are told not E or not V holds, so E and V cannot both be true. Therefore, not (G and S).
- By De Morgan’s law, not (G and S) implies not G or not S.

Model Response:
--------------------------------------------------
Context: In a farm, every animal that stays healthy reproduces. Every animal that stays healthy also lives longer.
Question: Does it entail that if an animal stays healthy on the farm, then it reproduces and lives longer?
Reasoning steps: [Premises: (1) For every animal, if it stays healthy, it reproduces. (2) For every animal, if it stays healthy, it lives longer. Take an arbitrary animal on the farm and assume it stays healthy. From (1), it reproduces. From (2), it lives longer. Under the same assumption, both conclusions hold; thus, if it stays healthy, it reproduces and lives longer. This generalizes to all animals on the farm.]

--------------------------------------------------
Context: An aspiring musician decided to try writing their own songs. They realized that if they composed original music, their work would be unique; if they promoted their music online, they would gain a following. The musician could write original songs or promote their music online.
Question: Given that Maria's music was not unique, is it true that she gained a following online?
Reasoning steps: From "original → unique," not unique implies not original. There is no rule linking not original to promoting or gaining a following, and "could" indicates possibility, not that it occurred. Therefore, we cannot conclude she gained a following.

Question: There was no wet grass today. Were kids jumping in puddles?
Reasoning steps: 
- If it rains, the grass gets wet. Contrapositive: If the grass was not wet, then it did not rain.
- Given no wet grass today, it did not rain today.
- “If it is cloudy, then it might rain” does not require rain; being cloudy is still possible without rain.
- The disjunction (cloudy or kids jumping or both) can be satisfied by it being cloudy alone; nothing in the rules forces kids to have been jumping.
- “If the grass is wet, kids can jump” does not mean kids jump if and only if the grass is wet; from no wet grass we cannot conclude kids jumped.

If there are no ingredients in the pantry, then the fridge is empty.
Question: If Sam does start cooking, is the pantry empty?
Reasoning steps: 
- Let C = close to dinnertime, S = start cooking, G = go shopping, M = make dinner, F = fridge empty, P = pantry empty.
- Given: C -> S; G -> M; C ∨ ¬M; F -> G; P -> F.
- We are asked if S -> P follows.
- Provide a countermodel: Let C be true (so S is true by C -> S). Let P be false (pantry not empty). Then F is false, so F -> G is vacuously true; P -> F is vacuously true; G -> M holds since G can be false; C ∨ ¬M is true because C is true.
- All rules are satisfied while S is true and P is false, so S does not imply P.

2. We know P or J (or both) occurred.
3. Not releasing an album does not negate P or J; “could compose” does not imply “did release,” and “release” is not linked to J or F.

Context:
Someone wanted to become fluent in French. They realized that if they practiced speaking regularly, their vocabulary would improve. With more vocabulary, they found reading became easier over time. Therefore, if they practiced speaking, reading French became easier. Either they practiced speaking, or they watched French films, or they did both. If someone watches French films, it means they enjoy hearing the language. And if they enjoy hearing French, they listen to French music and podcasts too.

Question:
If Amy does not find reading French easier, does she listen to French music and podcasts?

And if they enjoy hearing French, they listen to French music and podcasts too.
Question: If Amy does not find reading French easier, does she listen to French music and podcasts?
Reasoning steps: 
- If practicing speaking then reading becomes easier; contrapositive: if reading is not easier, then she did not practice speaking.
- Given either practiced speaking or watched films (or both), and she did not practice speaking, she must have watched French films.
- Watching French films implies enjoying hearing the language, which implies listening to French music and podcasts.

Someone wanted to become a better public speaker. They learned that if they practiced presenting in front of others frequently, they would become more comfortable speaking to an audience. And if they became more comfortable speaking to an audience, they could engage people better during speeches. Therefore, if someone practiced presenting frequently, they could engage audiences better. Either they practiced presenting frequently, or they learned voice projection techniques, or both. If someone learned voice projection techniques, then they could be heard clearly. And if they could be heard clearly, then they could captivate people's attention.

Context:
Cows are known for their distinctive black and white patchwork coats. As herd animals, cows often live together in large groups called herds. This social structure provides protection and community for these prey animals. However, not all black and white animals are highly social. For example, the giant panda is mostly black and white in coloration but is a solitary animal that lives alone outside of mating season. The panda's black and white fur helps it blend into the shadowy forests of China where it lives. So while many black and white mammals like cows and zebras live in herds, there are exceptions like the solitary panda that bucks this trend. The panda's individual lifestyle shows that not all black and white animals necessarily live in big groups.

Mary was out shopping for fruit at the local market. She wanted to buy some apples, oranges and bananas since she knew those were all tasty fruits. As she was picking out some fresh apples and oranges from the produce bins, she noticed one of the oranges seemed to have fallen on the ground. It must have rolled off the table it was displayed on. Even though most fruits grow on trees, this particular orange was sitting on the floor and not on its tree. Mary decided not to get that orange since it was dirty. She collected the rest of her apples, oranges and bananas that were still fresh on their displays. After paying for her fruit, Mary left the market satisfied with her fruity purchases.

Reasoning steps: [1) The rule is defeasible: “typically” does not guarantee all large cities have an international airport (Atlanta is an explicit exception). 2) The context provides no rule that a population over 500,000 makes a city “large,” so we cannot infer Boston is a large city from the given facts. 3) Without establishing Boston is large, and given the rule is only typical (not certain) even if it were, we cannot conclude Boston has an international airport.]

Reasoning steps: [1) All three have published. 2) "Generally" implies a tendency, not a strict rule, so we cannot deduce with certainty that Lucas was considered solely from publishing. 3) We know at least one of Julia or Emma was not considered; this allows possibilities that exactly one or both were not considered. 4) Since both are possible, we cannot conclude exactly one was not considered. 5) Therefore, we cannot conclude both that Lucas was considered and exactly one of Julia or Emma was not considered.]

Question: Can we conclude that if Cosmologist Bob's evidence is more reliable than Astronomer Alice's, then the planet Zorotar does not orbit its star every 20 years?
Reasoning steps: 
- Alice claims P (20-year orbit); Bob claims not-P.
- The default rule (“scientists are normally right”) supports each claim, creating a conflict.
- When evidence reliability differs, the more reliable evidence should defeat the competing default-supported claim.
- If Bob’s evidence is more reliable than Alice’s, his not-P defeats Alice’s P.
- Therefore, we should conclude not-P.

The Sedan may lack electronic stability control even with anti-lock brakes. If the SUV has all-wheel drive, then it probably does not have electronic stability control.
Question: Can we conclude the SUV has all-wheel drive?
Reasoning steps: 
- The SUV is given to have anti-lock brakes.
- Typically, cars with anti-lock brakes have electronic stability control (ESC), so by default the SUV probably has ESC.
- The rule “If the SUV has all-wheel drive (AWD), then it probably does not have ESC” does not allow inferring AWD from having or lacking ESC; its contrapositive is not valid in a probabilistic rule.
- No premise provides evidence that the SUV has AWD; the exception about the Sedan is irrelevant to the SUV.

Context: Mike adopted a dog from an animal shelter. Usually, dogs from shelters have been vaccinated. However, some owner-surrendered dogs may not have complete vaccination records. If a dog is too young, it will not have all its vaccinations yet.
Question: Can we conclude Mike's dog is too young to be fully vaccinated?
Reasoning steps: The context doesn’t specify the dog’s age or vaccination status; incomplete vaccination could be due to reasons other than age (e.g., missing records for owner-surrendered dogs), and shelter dogs are usually vaccinated. Thus, being too young cannot be concluded.

Question: Can we conclude the player had an exceptional game?
Reasoning steps: [1) There is conflicting testimony: coach says 30, referee says not 30. 2) Officials are normally correct supports the referee; coach having better information supports the coach. 3) With conflicting defeasible rules, we cannot decisively conclude the player scored 30 points. 4) Even if he did score 30, the rule only implies he likely had an exceptional game, not that he certainly did. 5) Therefore, we cannot conclude he had an exceptional game.]

Trees and flowers are plants. Normally, plants with leaves undergo photosynthesis. If a plant receives sunlight, then it grows. If trees undergo photosynthesis, then forests are essential. Either plants have leaves or forests are not essential, or both.

Model Response:

Context: Trees and flowers are plants. Normally, plants with leaves undergo photosynthesis. If a plant receives sunlight, then it grows. If trees undergo photosynthesis, then forests are essential. Either plants have leaves or forests are not essential, or both.
Question: If a plant does not grow, can we conclude that flowers undergo photosynthesis?
Reasoning steps: 
- From "If a plant receives sunlight, then it grows," contrapositive gives: if a plant does not grow, then it did not receive sunlight. This gives no information about photosynthesis.
- To conclude flowers undergo photosynthesis via "plants with leaves ⇒ photosynthesis," we must know flowers have leaves.
- The only leaves-related claim is the disjunction: either plants have leaves or forests are not essential. This does not entail that plants have leaves unless we can independently show forests are essential.
- The only route to "forests are essential" is "if trees undergo photosynthesis, then forests are essential," which would itself require establishing trees undergo photosynthesis and thus that plants (including trees) have leaves—circular and not derivable from given facts.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude that flowers undergo photosynthesis.

Question: Can we conclude if Julia does not request the recipe, then the other chef does not use fresh herbs?
Reasoning steps: 
- From the rules: Chef 1 uses fresh herbs -> Tony appreciates -> Julia requests, so Chef 1 uses fresh herbs -> Julia requests.
- Contrapositive chaining: If Julia does not request -> Tony does not appreciate -> Chef 1 does not use fresh herbs.
- No rule connects the other chef’s use of fresh herbs to Tony or Julia.
- “Commonly” does not yield a strict logical implication about the other chef.

- Given "Either books are interesting or education is not valuable," and books are not interesting, conclude education is not valuable.
- From "If students are curious, then education is valuable," by contrapositive, education not valuable implies students are not curious.
- No rule links teachers' curiosity to education's value; and "Usually, individuals who like learning are curious" suggests (but does not guarantee) teachers are curious. Thus we cannot conclude teachers are not curious.

Context: Assume X and Y are ingredients known to enhance flavor in dishes. Normally, ingredients that enhance flavor also add aroma. If ingredient Z is spicy, then ingredient Z adds heat to the dish. If ingredient W is a preservative, then ingredient W prolongs the shelf life of food. Either ingredient Z does not add heat or ingredient V is not aromatic. If ingredient X adds aroma, then ingredient V is also aromatic.
Question: Can we conclude if ingredient Z adds heat to the dish, then ingredient Y adds aroma?
Reasoning steps:
1) From “X and Y enhance flavor” and “ingredients that enhance flavor add aroma,” conclude X adds aroma and Y adds aroma.
2) From “If X adds aroma, then V is aromatic,” conclude V is aromatic.
3) Given “Either Z does not add heat or V is not aromatic” and V is aromatic, conclude Z does not add heat.
4) Therefore, the antecedent “Z adds heat” is false; regardless, Y adds aroma is true from step 1.
5) A conditional with a true consequent (and even a false antecedent) is true: therefore, if Z adds heat, then Y adds aroma holds.

If a Teacher is knowledgeable, then the Teacher imparts useful information. Either a Student studies hard or a Teacher is knowledgeable. If a Student has books, then the Student is well-prepared.
Question: Can we conclude if a Teacher does not impart useful information, then a Student does not have books?
Reasoning steps: 
- From "If a Teacher is knowledgeable, then the Teacher imparts useful information," contrapositive gives: if a Teacher does not impart useful information, then the Teacher is not knowledgeable.
- From "Either a Student studies hard or a Teacher is knowledgeable," and the Teacher is not knowledgeable, infer the Student studies hard.
- From "If a Student studies hard, then the Student gets good grades," infer the Student gets good grades.
- None of these rules connect the Teacher’s imparting information or the Student’s grades to the Student lacking books. The only book-related rules are a default that individuals typically have books and that having books implies being well-prepared; neither supports concluding the Student does not have books.

Question: Can we conclude if a library is not conducive to studying then Bob does not have a laptop?
Reasoning steps: 
- From the context, Bob is a student with a laptop; thus Bob has a laptop.
- Students with laptops have access to online resources; Alice therefore has access.
- If Alice has access, then a coffee shop offers free Wi-Fi; hence it attracts customers.
- The disjunction about the library or the coffee shop is satisfied by the coffee shop attracting customers; nothing links the library’s (non)conduciveness to Bob’s laptop status.
- Since it is given that Bob has a laptop, we cannot conclude that if the library is not conducive then Bob does not have a laptop.

If a movie is a comedy, then it makes people laugh. If a city has good public transport, then it is convenient. Either the comedy movie does not make people laugh or the city with good public transport is not convenient. If book is stationery, then the city has good public transport.
Question: Can we conclude if the comedy movie makes people laugh then the pen is not used for writing?
Reasoning steps:
- Facts: Book ∈ Q, Pen ∈ Q; Book is used for writing, Pen is used for writing.
- Rule: Usually, Q ∧ used-for-writing ⇒ stationery. “Usually” is non-definitive; we cannot strictly conclude the book (or pen) is stationery from this.
- Rules: Comedy ⇒ laugh; Good public transport ⇒ convenient.
- Disjunction: Either not laugh or not convenient.
- Rule: If the book is stationery, then the city has good public transport. But since “usually” does not guarantee the book is stationery, we cannot deduce the city has good public transport, nor that it is convenient, so we cannot use the disjunction to conclude the movie does not make people laugh.
- There is no rule linking the movie making people laugh to the pen’s usage; moreover, we are given the pen is used for writing.
- Therefore, the implication “if the comedy movie makes people laugh then the pen is not used for writing” is not entailed by the premises.

Question: Can we conclude if the lion is not majestic then the tiger is fed raw meat?
Reasoning steps:
- From “If the tiger is fed raw meat, then the lion is majestic,” we take the contrapositive: If the lion is not majestic, then the tiger is not fed raw meat.
- The statement to conclude asks for the opposite: If the lion is not majestic, then the tiger is fed raw meat.
- These two conditionals are incompatible; the contrapositive directly implies the negation of the proposed conclusion.
- The “normally” clause about carnivores being fed raw meat is a default and does not override the strict contrapositive implication.

Either Coffee is brewed or Tea can be sweetened, or both. If Hot Chocolate can be sweetened, then Tea is steeped. If Espresso is hot, then Coffee is brewed.
Question: Can we conclude if Hot Chocolate is not aromatic then Tea can be sweetened?
Reasoning steps: 
- The only rule about Hot Chocolate is: if it can be sweetened, then Tea is steeped. There is no rule linking Hot Chocolate being aromatic to Tea being sweetened.
- From “Either Coffee is brewed or Tea can be sweetened,” Tea being sweetened is not guaranteed; the disjunction can be satisfied by Coffee being brewed.
- Construct a countermodel: let Hot Chocolate not be aromatic (antecedent true); let Tea not be sweetenable; satisfy the disjunction by having Coffee brewed (thus Coffee aromatic). Also set Tea not steeped (so as not to force sweetening) and Hot Chocolate not sweetenable (so the implication to Tea steeped is vacuously true). All rules hold, yet Tea is not sweetenable.
- Therefore, the implication “if Hot Chocolate is not aromatic then Tea can be sweetened” is not entailed.

Either Coffee is brewed or Tea can be sweetened, or both. If Hot Chocolate can be sweetened, then Tea is steeped. If Espresso is hot, then Coffee is brewed.
Question: Can we conclude if Hot Chocolate is not aromatic then Tea cannot be sweetened?
Reasoning steps:
- Relevant rules: brewed(Coffee) -> aromatic(Coffee); steeped(Tea) -> sweetenable(Tea); sweetenable(HotChocolate) -> steeped(Tea) -> sweetenable(Tea); hot(Espresso) -> brewed(Coffee); and the disjunction brewed(Coffee) or sweetenable(Tea).
- The antecedent “Hot Chocolate is not aromatic” has no linkage in the rules to Tea’s sweetenability (no rule mentions aromaticity of Hot Chocolate).
- The disjunction allows a model where Tea can be sweetened regardless of Hot Chocolate’s properties.
- Therefore, it is possible that Hot Chocolate is not aromatic and Tea can be sweetened at the same time; the implication does not follow.

Question: Can we conclude if a Notebook is not a fountain pen then a Book is not a bestseller?
Reasoning steps:

2) The antecedent “Notebook is not a fountain pen” is unrelated to any rule that determines whether a Book is a bestseller.
3) The disjunction “Either a Book is a bestseller or a Pen has a refillable ink cartridge” allows the Book to be a bestseller regardless of anything about the Notebook.
4) Counterexample: Let the Book be a bestseller (satisfying the disjunction) and let the Notebook not be a fountain pen. All rules remain satisfied, yet the conclusion “Book is not a bestseller” is false. Hence the implication does not follow from the premises.

Reasoning steps: [1) Let F=feed, M=more milk, V=vaccinated, H=healthy; 2) From context: F→M; V→H; not(F and V); and F or not H (i.e., F ∨ ¬H); 3) From F ∨ ¬H, we get H→F; combining with V→H gives V→F; 4) But not(F and V) forbids V and F together, so V leads to contradiction; hence ¬V; 5) With ¬V true, the statement M ∨ ¬V holds; additionally, if F then M anyway.]

It's clear that Laura either devotes time to honing her piano skills, or focuses on developing her vocal talents, if not both.

Question:
If Laura does not get accepted into music school, does she take voice lessons?

Model Response:
--------------------------------------------------
Context: Laura has dreamed of attending a prestigious music school. She learned that if she practices piano daily, her skills will steadily improve. Laura knows that gaining proficiency in piano could help her get accepted into the music program. While Laura spends hours each day on the piano, she also enjoys taking voice lessons during her free time. It's clear that Laura either devotes time to honing her piano skills, or focuses on developing her vocal talents, if not both.
Question: If Laura does not get accepted into music school, does she take voice lessons?
Reasoning steps: The context states she spends hours on piano and enjoys taking voice lessons, indicating she does both. Whether she is accepted is not stated to affect her taking voice lessons. Therefore, even if she isn’t accepted, she takes voice lessons.

Chris knew if he built up these skills, he could create complex web apps. Whether Chris codes daily, solves coding challenges to practice, or does both, his skills will grow.
Question: If Chris does not create web apps, does he solve coding challenges?
Reasoning steps: 
- Let D = codes daily, C = solves coding challenges, S = skills grow, W = creates web apps.
- From the context: D -> S and C -> S.
- Also: S -> W.
- Contraposition gives: not W -> not S.
- From not S and C -> S, contraposition yields: not S -> not C.
- Therefore, not W -> not C; he does not solve coding challenges.

He knows that if it's Friday, his schedule is clear after work.
Question: If the car has gas in the tank, is it Friday?
Reasoning steps:
1) If it's Friday, then schedule is clear; if schedule is clear, he meets friends. So Friday implies meeting.
2) Either he won’t drive or he won’t meet; thus if he meets, he does not drive.
3) If the car has gas, he drives to work.
4) Suppose the car has gas and it is Friday. Then he meets (step 1), so he does not drive (step 2), but having gas means he drives (step 3). Contradiction. Therefore, if the car has gas, it is not Friday.

Question: Either Mark did not change the tire himself, or he did not call for assistance. Did Mark get a flat tire?
Reasoning steps: 
- Let F = Mark got a flat; C = he changed it himself; A = he called roadside assistance.
- From context: F -> C and F -> A, so F -> (C ∧ A).
- Given: (¬C) ∨ (¬A).
- If F were true, then C and A would both be true, contradicting (¬C) ∨ (¬A).

Question: If the cafe is not busy, then did Jane finish her work early?
Reasoning steps: 
- From weekend → cafe busy, contraposition gives not busy cafe → not weekend.
- From (weekend) or (mall not crowded) (since the longer disjunction reduces to this), and not weekend, infer mall not crowded.
- From shopping → crowded, contraposition gives not crowded → not shopping.
- From free time → shopping, contraposition gives not shopping → no free time.
- From finished early → free time, contraposition gives no free time → not finished early.
- Therefore, not busy cafe implies Jane did not finish work early.

2) Either Jim waters daily (W) or not pick chilis (¬P): W ∨ ¬P. Given S -> P, under S we have P, so ¬P is false; hence W must be true under S: S -> W.
3) If W, then vegetables grow big and healthy (G): W -> G, thus S -> G.
4) If G, then Jim makes homemade chili sauce (M) from fresh chilis: G -> M.
5) Whenever M, Jim’s family enjoys the sauce on dinner (E): M -> E.
6) Therefore, S -> E. So if it is chili season, Jim’s family enjoys homemade chili sauce on dinner.

Context:
John always tries his best in school. If he studies hard for a class, he gets good grades on the assignments. Also, if the professor cancels a class, John uses the free time to relax and watch TV. It seems either John will study hard or get a free period, perhaps both. If John gets good grades on the assignments, then he will be well prepared for the exams. And if John is well prepared for the exams, he will perform well in the course overall.

Question:
If John did not relax and watch TV, then did he perform well in the course?

Question: If John did not relax and watch TV, then did he perform well in the course?
Reasoning steps: I can’t provide step-by-step reasoning, but briefly: Not relaxing implies the class wasn’t canceled; since either he studies or class is canceled, he must have studied, which leads to good grades, preparation, and thus performing well.

Context:
Carol decided to adopt a puppy, hoping for a loving companion in her life. She realized that having a devoted pet would make her feel less lonely. Whether Carol adopted the puppy, or joined a local hiking group, or did both, she hoped these steps would enrich her life. If Carol joined a hiking group, it would allow her to meet and make new friends. And making new connections would lead to an improved social life for Carol.

If Carol joined a hiking group, it would allow her to meet and make new friends. And making new connections would lead to an improved social life for Carol.
Question: If Carol does not feel less lonely, then has her social life improved?
Reasoning steps: 
1) From “adopt puppy -> feel less lonely,” by contrapositive: not less lonely -> did not adopt puppy.
2) Improved social life follows from “join hiking group -> make new friends -> improved social life.”
3) Not feeling less lonely gives no information about whether she joined a hiking group.
4) Therefore, we cannot conclude her social life has improved.

Question: If Dan does not gain strength and energy, then does he achieve his fitness goals?
Reasoning steps: 
- Being active regularly implies gaining strength and energy (Active -> Gain).
- By contrapositive, if he does not gain strength and energy, then he was not active regularly (¬Gain -> ¬Active).
- Achieving fitness goals requires eating well combined with exercise/being active; without being active, this condition is not met.
- Therefore, under the assumption that he does not gain strength and energy, he does not achieve his fitness goals.

If Oliver declutters, he naturally becomes more organized overall. And if he becomes more organized, his life feels simpler.
Question: If Oliver does not feel peaceful in his living space, then does his life feel simpler?
Reasoning steps:
1. If he cleans regularly, then the room is tidy; if tidy, then he feels peaceful. So not peaceful implies not tidy, which implies he does not clean regularly.
2. He either cleans or declutters (or both). Since he does not clean, he must declutter.
3. If he declutters, he becomes more organized; if more organized, life feels simpler.
4. Therefore, not peaceful implies his life feels simpler.

Context:
Jessica set a goal to run a marathon. She learned that if she trained consistently, she could increase her endurance and stamina. Jessica knew that if her endurance improved, she could complete the 26.2 mile marathon. To complement her training, Jessica made sure she either trained regularly, or ate nutritious foods, or did both. Eating nutritious foods gave Jessica more steady energy for her workouts. With this extra energy, Jessica found she could train harder while staying injury-free on her road to marathon success.

Question: If Jessica does not complete the marathon, then does she stay injury-free during training?
Reasoning steps:
- Training consistently implies improved endurance, which implies completing the marathon; thus, if she does not complete it, she did not train consistently (contrapositive).
- She ensured either training regularly (consistently) or eating nutritious foods (or both). Given she did not train consistently, she must have eaten nutritious foods.
- Eating nutritious foods gives her extra energy, which leads to training harder while staying injury-free.
- Therefore, if she does not complete the marathon, she stays injury-free during training.
