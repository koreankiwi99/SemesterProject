Premises: The ACME Factory knew that if they increased production, they would need to hire more workers. Meanwhile, the parent company was preparing to release a new product. The CEO knew that if they released a new product, then their stock price would likely increase. Either the factory increased production, or the stock price did not increase. The CFO was sure that if more workers were hired, the work will be done quickly for the next cycle.
Conclusion: The company released a new product. Will the work be quick for next cycle?

Lean Code:
axiom IncreasedProduction : Prop
axiom HiredMoreWorkers : Prop
axiom ReleasedNewProduct : Prop
axiom StockPriceIncreased : Prop
axiom WorkQuickNextCycle : Prop

-- Premises formalized
-- 1) If production increases, more workers are hired.
axiom incProd_implies_hire : IncreasedProduction → HiredMoreWorkers
-- 2) If a new product is released, the stock price increases.
axiom release_implies_stock : ReleasedNewProduct → StockPriceIncreased
-- 3) Either production increased, or the stock price did not increase.
axiom disj : IncreasedProduction ∨ ¬ StockPriceIncreased
-- 4) If more workers are hired, then the work will be done quickly next cycle.
axiom hire_implies_quick : HiredMoreWorkers → WorkQuickNextCycle

-- Conclusion to analyze (proved as a conditional): 
-- If the company released a new product, then the work will be quick next cycle.

Lean Code:

axiom StockPriceIncreased : Prop

-- Premises
-- 1) If production increased, then more workers are needed (hired).

axiom premise5 : HireMoreWorkers → WorkQuickNextCycle

-- We interpret the conclusion to analyze as the conjunction:
-- "The company released a new product and the work will be quick next cycle."
-- We attempt to prove its negation from the premises.
