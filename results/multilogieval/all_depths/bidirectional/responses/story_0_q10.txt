Premises: Jessica set a goal to run a marathon. She learned that if she trained consistently, she could increase her endurance and stamina. Jessica knew that if her endurance improved, she could complete the 26.2 mile marathon. To complement her training, Jessica made sure she either trained regularly, or ate nutritious foods, or did both. Eating nutritious foods gave Jessica more steady energy for her workouts. With this extra energy, Jessica found she could train harder while staying injury-free on her road to marathon success.
Conclusion: If Jessica does not complete the marathon, then does she stay injury-free during training?

Lean Code:
-- We formalize the scenario with propositional predicates about Jessica.
axiom Train : Prop                -- Jessica trains consistently/regularly
axiom Eat : Prop                  -- Jessica eats nutritious foods
axiom Energy : Prop               -- Jessica has steady energy
axiom InjuryFree : Prop           -- Jessica stays injury-free during training
axiom ImprovedEndurance : Prop    -- Jessica's endurance improves
axiom CompleteMarathon : Prop     -- Jessica completes the marathon

-- Premises translated to axioms:
-- If she trains consistently, her endurance improves.
axiom p_train_to_endurance : Train → ImprovedEndurance
-- If her endurance improves, she can complete the marathon.
axiom p_endurance_to_complete : ImprovedEndurance → CompleteMarathon
-- She made sure either she trained regularly or ate nutritious foods (or both).
axiom p_either_train_or_eat : Train ∨ Eat
-- Eating nutritious foods gave her steady energy.
axiom p_eat_to_energy : Eat → Energy
-- With the extra energy, she stays injury-free.
axiom p_energy_to_injuryfree : Energy → InjuryFree

-- Goal: If Jessica does not complete the marathon, then she stays injury-free during training.
