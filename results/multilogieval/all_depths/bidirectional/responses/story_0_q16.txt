Premises: Students and Teachers are individuals in a school. Typically, individuals in a school are educated. If a Student is in class, then they study. If a Teacher is in the staff room, then they grade papers. Either a Student is in class or a Teacher grades papers, or both. If a Principal grades papers, then a Teacher is in the staff room. If a Librarian is educated, then a Student is in class.
Conclusion: Can we conclude if a Principal does not grade papers then a Student does not study?
