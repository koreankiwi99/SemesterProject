Premises: Jim makes sure to water his vegetable garden every day. He knows if he waters the plants daily, they will grow big and healthy. It is now chili pepper season. Jim decided that if it was chili season, he would pick fresh chili peppers from his garden. Either Jim waters his garden daily or he did not pick fresh chilis this season. Jim knows if his vegetables grow big and healthy, he can use the fresh chilis to make homemade chili sauce. Whenever Jim makes homemade chili sauce, his family really enjoys pouring the spicy sauce on dinner.
Conclusion: If it is chili season, then does Jim's family enjoy homemade chili sauce on dinner?

-- Premises formalized
axiom premise1 : WatersDaily                                 -- Jim waters daily
axiom premise2 : WatersDaily → GrowsHealthy                  -- If he waters daily, plants grow big and healthy

axiom premise6 : GrowsHealthy → (PicksFreshChilis → CanUseChilisToMakeSauce)
-- If vegetables grow big and healthy, he can use the fresh chilis to make sauce (modeled as a separate "can use" ability)
axiom premise7 : MakesChiliSauce → FamilyEnjoysSauceOnDinner -- Whenever Jim makes sauce, family enjoys it on dinner

-- Negation of the conclusion to analyze:
-- We try to prove: not (if it is chili season, then Jim's family enjoys homemade chili sauce on dinner).

  -- From the premises we can derive that it is chili season, plants grow healthy, and chilis are picked.

  -- However, we have no premise connecting "can use to make sauce" to "actually makes sauce",
  -- and thus no way to derive FamilyEnjoysSauceOnDinner or its negation to reach a contradiction.
  -- Therefore we cannot derive a contradiction from assuming (ChiliSeason → FamilyEnjoysSauceOnDinner).
