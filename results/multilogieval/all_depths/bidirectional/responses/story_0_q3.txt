Premises: John always tries his best in school. If he studies hard for a class, he gets good grades on the assignments. Also, if the professor cancels a class, John uses the free time to relax and watch TV. It seems either John will study hard or get a free period, perhaps both. If John gets good grades on the assignments, then he will be well prepared for the exams. And if John is well prepared for the exams, he will perform well in the course overall.
Conclusion: If John did not relax and watch TV, then did he perform well in the course?
