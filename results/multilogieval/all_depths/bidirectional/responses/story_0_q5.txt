Premises: It's a beautiful sunny day. James notes that if it's sunny out, the community pool will open for the season today. If the lifeguards are scheduled, that means they'll show up for their shift. Either it's sunny out, or the lifeguards didn't come in today. James knows that if the pool opens, kids will start playing in it right away. And if kids are playing, the lifeguards on duty have to stay alert to watch them carefully.
Conclusion: If the lifeguards are scheduled to work, then do the lifeguards stay alert watching the kids?
