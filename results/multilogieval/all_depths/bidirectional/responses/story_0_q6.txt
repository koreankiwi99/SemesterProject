Premises: Emma checked the pet store hours. She knew if they're open, she buys treats for her dog. Emma was also taking her dog on a long hike. If they go on a long hike, the dog gets well-exercised. Either the store is open or the dog isn't exercised, or the store is open and the dog isn't exercised. Emma also knows if she finished work early, they're going on a hike. Her friend wondered if either Emma finished work early or she's meeting a friend for dinner, or both.
Conclusion: If Emma did not buy treats, is she meeting a friend for dinner?
