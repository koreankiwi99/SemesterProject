Premises: Dan wanted to get in better shape. He decided to start a new workout routine to become more active. Dan knew being active regularly would help him gain strength and energy. Whether Dan started a workout routine or made healthy meal plans, he was taking steps to improve his health. If Dan planned healthy meals, he would start eating a more nutritious diet. Eating well combined with exercise meant Dan could achieve his fitness goals.
Conclusion: If Dan does not gain strength and energy, then does he achieve his fitness goals?

axiom Nutritious : Prop             -- Dan eats a more nutritious diet (eating well)
axiom Exercise : Prop               -- Dan exercises

  -- Attempt: From the given premises, we cannot derive a contradiction from assuming
