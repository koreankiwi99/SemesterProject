Premises: The gardener is aware that if she plants her seeds at the correct depth, then if she waters them sufficiently, the vegetable plants will thrive.
Conclusion: The gardener watered the plants sufficiently, but the vegetable plants did not thrive. Did the gardener plant the seeds at the correct depth?

PROVE TRUE ATTEMPT
======================================================================
Lean Code:
axiom DepthCorrect : Prop
axiom WateredSufficiently : Prop
axiom PlantsThrive : Prop

-- Premise: If the gardener planted at the correct depth, then if she watered sufficiently, the plants thrive.
axiom premise : DepthCorrect → (WateredSufficiently → PlantsThrive)

-- Conclusion analysis: Given that the gardener watered sufficiently and the plants did not thrive,
-- we can conclude she did not plant at the correct depth.

Lean Code:

axiom Thrives : Prop

-- Premise: If planted at correct depth, then if watered sufficiently, the plants thrive.
axiom premise1 : PlantCorrectDepth → (WateredSufficiently → Thrives)

-- From the scenario to analyze: watered sufficiently, but the plants did not thrive.
axiom premise2 : WateredSufficiently
axiom premise3 : ¬Thrives

-- Negation of the queried conclusion: it is not the case that the gardener planted at the correct depth.
