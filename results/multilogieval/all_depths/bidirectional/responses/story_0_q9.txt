Premises: Mary was baking a cake for John's graduation party today. She knew that if the oven is preheated properly, the cake will bake evenly all over. At the same time, Mary knew it was John's graduation ceremony today. If it is John's graduation today, his family will bake a cake to celebrate the occasion. Either the oven was preheated correctly, or John's family did not bake a cake. Mary knows that if the cake bakes evenly throughout, it will taste delicious. If the cake tastes great, then John will be absolutely thrilled with it.
Conclusion: If it is John's graduation ceremony today, then is John thrilled with the cake?

Lean Code:
axiom G : Prop        -- John's graduation is today
axiom P : Prop        -- Oven preheated properly
axiom B : Prop        -- Cake bakes evenly
axiom F : Prop        -- John's family bakes a cake
axiom D : Prop        -- Cake tastes delicious
axiom T : Prop        -- John is thrilled with the cake

axiom preheat_implies_even : P → B
axiom grad_implies_family_bakes : G → F
axiom preheated_or_family_not_bake : P ∨ ¬ F
axiom even_implies_delicious : B → D
axiom delicious_implies_thrilled : D → T

Lean Code:
axiom Grad : Prop            -- It is John's graduation ceremony today
axiom FamilyBakes : Prop     -- John's family bakes a cake
axiom Preheated : Prop       -- The oven was preheated properly
axiom EvenBake : Prop        -- The cake bakes evenly all over
axiom Delicious : Prop       -- The cake tastes delicious
axiom Thrilled : Prop        -- John is thrilled with the cake

axiom preheated_implies_even : Preheated → EvenBake
axiom even_implies_delicious : EvenBake → Delicious

-- From the premises, the conclusion actually follows:

-- Therefore, the negation of the conclusion is refutable (we can prove ¬¬(Grad → Thrilled)):
