He knew that if you properly care for a pet, it will be happy and healthy.\nQuestion: Kevin adopts a pet. Will it be happy and healthy?\nReasoning steps: \n- If someone adopts an animal, then they must commit to taking care of it.\n- If someone properly cares for a pet, then the pet will be happy and healthy.\n- Kevin adopts a pet, so he commits to taking care of it.\n- There is no given rule that committing to take care implies properly caring for the pet.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude the pet will be happy and healthy.\nAnswer: No"

Either Alex studied diligently for his biology exam, or class was not canceled due to the weather. If a student feels confident about the material, they will likely do well on the exam. If a student performs well on an exam, they will be satisfied with their hard work.\nQuestion: If there was severe weather in the forecast, did Alex feel satisfied with his performance on the history exam?\nReasoning steps: [1) Severe weather only implies schools may cancel class, not that they will, so nothing definitive follows about cancellations. 2) The disjunction concerns studying for Alex\u2019s biology exam or class not being canceled; it gives no information about a history exam. 3) Satisfaction requires performing well, which (per premises) follows only from likely doing well due to confidence from studying hard for that specific exam. 4) There is no premise that Alex studied for the history exam, nor that he performed well on it. 5) Therefore, the conclusion about satisfaction on the history exam does not logically follow.]\nAnswer: No"
