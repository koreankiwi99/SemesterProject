Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: MT

Context:
When someone practices good hygiene, they are less likely to get sick. Sarah is not less likely to get sick.

Question:
Does Sarah practice good hygiene?

================================================================================
Iterations:
================================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Sarah : Person

axiom GoodHygiene : Person → Prop
axiom LessLikelySick : Person → Prop

-- Premises:
-- 1. Practicing good hygiene implies being less likely to get sick.
axiom hygiene_implies_less : ∀ x : Person, GoodHygiene x → LessLikelySick x
-- 2. Sarah is not less likely to get sick.
axiom sarah_not_less : ¬ LessLikelySick Sarah

-- Conclusion: Sarah does not practice good hygiene (by contrapositive / modus tollens).
theorem sarah_not_good : ¬ GoodHygiene Sarah := by
  intro h
  have hless : LessLikelySick Sarah := hygiene_implies_less Sarah h
  exact sarah_not_less hless
</lean>
ANSWER: No
