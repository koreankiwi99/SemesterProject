--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Camping : Prop
axiom Movies : Prop
axiom HikeThroughNature : Prop
axiom Entertained : Prop

axiom camp_imp_hike : Camping → HikeThroughNature
axiom movies_imp_entertained : Movies → Entertained
axiom choice : Camping ∨ Movies

theorem conclusion : HikeThroughNature ∨ Entertained := by
  cases choice with
  | inl hC =>
      exact Or.inl (camp_imp_hike hC)
  | inr hM =>
      exact Or.inr (movies_imp_entertained hM)
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes

Extracted Lean Code:
----------------------------------------
axiom Camping : Prop
axiom Movies : Prop
axiom HikeThroughNature : Prop
axiom Entertained : Prop

axiom camp_imp_hike : Camping → HikeThroughNature
axiom movies_imp_entertained : Movies → Entertained
axiom choice : Camping ∨ Movies

theorem conclusion : HikeThroughNature ∨ Entertained := by
  cases choice with
  | inl hC =>
      exact Or.inl (camp_imp_hike hC)
  | inr hM =>
      exact Or.inr (movies_imp_entertained hM)
----------------------------------------
