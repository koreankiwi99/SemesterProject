Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: DD

Context:
If a person learns to play the guitar, then they can entertain themselves. Moreover, if they take singing lessons, then they can improve their vocal skills. However, they find themselves in a situation where they either do not entertain themselves or do not improve their vocal skills.

Question:
Does it entail that for Alex, who is learning music, either they do not learn to play the guitar or they do not take singing lessons?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Alex : Person

axiom LearnGuitar : Person → Prop
axiom TakeSingingLessons : Person → Prop
axiom EntertainSelf : Person → Prop
axiom ImproveVocalSkills : Person → Prop

axiom prem1 : ∀ p : Person, LearnGuitar p → EntertainSelf p
axiom prem2 : ∀ p : Person, TakeSingingLessons p → ImproveVocalSkills p
axiom prem3 : ¬ EntertainSelf Alex ∨ ¬ ImproveVocalSkills Alex

theorem conclusion : ¬ LearnGuitar Alex ∨ ¬ TakeSingingLessons Alex := by
  cases prem3 with
  | inl hNE =>
      apply Or.inl
      intro hLG
      exact hNE (prem1 Alex hLG)
