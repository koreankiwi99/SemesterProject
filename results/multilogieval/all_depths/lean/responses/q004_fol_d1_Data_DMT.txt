Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: DMT

Context:
At a prestigious university, every professor was highly educated and an excellent teacher. Students vied for the opportunity to learn from these paragons of intellect and instruction. Nonetheless, some professors fell short of this lofty reputation.

Question:
Does it entail that there is at least one professor for whom either being highly educated is not true or being an excellent teacher is not true or both?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Professor : Type
axiom HighlyEducated : Professor → Prop
axiom ExcellentTeacher : Professor → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom all_prof_high_and_excellent : ∀ p : Professor, HighlyEducated p ∧ ExcellentTeacher p
axiom some_prof_fell_short : ∃ p : Professor, ¬ (HighlyEducated p ∧ ExcellentTeacher p)

-- Target entailment
theorem at_least_one_lacks_one_property :
    ∃ p : Professor, (¬ HighlyEducated p) ∨ (¬ ExcellentTeacher p) := by
  have ⟨p, hnot⟩ := some_prof_fell_short
  have h := all_prof_high_and_excellent p
  have : False := hnot h
  exact False.elim this
</lean>
