Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: BD

Context:
In a community, citizens who volunteer help those in need. Those who donate to charity organizations support important causes. However, citizens have limited time and money to allocate. They can either volunteer or they do not support important causes through donations.

Question:
Does this mean that Luis, a busy working father, either helps those in need by volunteering or does not donate money to charity organizations?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Luis : Person

axiom Citizen : Person → Prop
axiom Volunteer : Person → Prop
axiom Helps : Person → Prop
axiom Donate : Person → Prop
axiom SupportViaDonation : Person → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom volunteers_help : ∀ x : Person, Citizen x → (Volunteer x → Helps x)
axiom donate_supports : ∀ x : Person, Citizen x → (Donate x → SupportViaDonation x)
axiom limited_time : ∀ x : Person, Citizen x → (Volunteer x ∨ ¬ SupportViaDonation x)

-- Luis is a citizen
axiom luis_citizen : Citizen Luis

-- Conclusion: Luis either helps those in need by volunteering, or does not donate
theorem result : (Volunteer Luis ∧ Helps Luis) ∨ ¬ Donate Luis := by
  have h_time : Volunteer Luis ∨ ¬ SupportViaDonation Luis := limited_time Luis luis_citizen
  have h_don_supp : Donate Luis → SupportViaDonation Luis := donate_supports Luis luis_citizen
  have h_vol_help : Volunteer Luis → Helps Luis := volunteers_help Luis luis_citizen
  cases h_time with
  | inl v =>
      have h_help : Helps Luis := h_vol_help v
      exact Or.inl ⟨v, h_help⟩
  | inr ns =>
