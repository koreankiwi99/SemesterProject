--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Amy : Person

axiom GoodTimeManagement : Person → Prop
axiom AccomplishesMoreInLessTime : Person → Prop

-- Premise: If someone has good time management skills, they can (often) accomplish more in less time.
axiom good_implies_more : ∀ x : Person, GoodTimeManagement x → AccomplishesMoreInLessTime x

-- Premise: Amy does not accomplish more in less time.
axiom not_more_Amy : ¬ AccomplishesMoreInLessTime Amy

-- Conclusion: Amy does not have good time management skills (by modus tollens).
theorem Amy_not_good_time_management : ¬ GoodTimeManagement Amy := by
  intro hgood
  have hmore : AccomplishesMoreInLessTime Amy := good_implies_more Amy hgood
  exact not_more_Amy hmore
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
