  LikelySkilledAtPiano : Person → Prop
  -- Premise: If someone practices a musical instrument (piano) regularly, they will likely become skilled at playing it.
  premise1 : ∀ x, PracticesPianoRegularly x → LikelySkilledAtPiano x
  -- Fact: Emily has not become skilled at playing the piano.
  premise2 : ¬ SkilledAtPiano Emily

-- A model where Emily practices the piano regularly, the "likely" predicate holds trivially,
-- and she is nevertheless not (actually) skilled (showing the premises do not force skill).
