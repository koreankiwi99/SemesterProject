================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: DS

Context:
When attending a formal event, some dress in formal attire while others opt for casual wear. However, one person finds that their formal wear is not ready in time.

inductive Person where
  | Mary

open Person

-- Predicates
def WearsFormal : Person → Prop
  | Mary => True
  | John => False

  | Mary => True

-- Premises reflecting the textual context:
-- 1) Some dress in formal attire
theorem some_formal : ∃ p, WearsFormal p := by
  exact ⟨Mary, True.intro⟩

-- 2) Others opt for casual wear
theorem some_casual : ∃ p, WearsCasual p := by
  exact ⟨John, True.intro⟩

-- 3) One person finds their formal wear is not ready in time
theorem someone_not_ready : ∃ p, ¬ FormalReady p := by
  exact ⟨John, by simp [FormalReady]⟩

-- Mary has the option to dress formally or casually
theorem mary_options : OptionFormal Mary ∧ OptionCasual Mary := by
  exact And.intro True.intro True.intro

-- Target claim to test: "Mary wears casual attire"
-- Countermodel proof: in this model, Mary does NOT wear casual attire.
