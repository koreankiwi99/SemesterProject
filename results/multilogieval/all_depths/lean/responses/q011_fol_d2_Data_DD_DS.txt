Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DD_DS

Context:
If someone takes their car for an oil change, it runs smoothly. Also, if someone washes their car, it looks shiny and clean. However, this month someone either had a car that was not running smoothly or did not look clean, or both.

Question:
Tyler took his car for an oil change. Is it true that he washed his car?

LLM Response:
<lean>
universe u
axiom Person : Type u
axiom Tyler : Person
axiom OilChange : Person → Prop
axiom RunsSmoothly : Person → Prop
axiom Washed : Person → Prop
axiom LooksClean : Person → Prop

-- Premises
axiom oilchange_implies_smooth : ∀ x : Person, OilChange x → RunsSmoothly x
axiom washed_implies_clean : ∀ x : Person, Washed x → LooksClean x
axiom someone_not_smooth_or_not_clean : ∃ x : Person, (¬ RunsSmoothly x ∨ ¬ LooksClean x)

-- Fact: Tyler took his car for an oil change.
axiom oilchange_Tyler : OilChange Tyler

-- Derivable consequences:
theorem Tyler_runs_smoothly : RunsSmoothly Tyler := by
  exact oilchange_implies_smooth Tyler oilchange_Tyler

theorem not_clean_imp_not_washed (x : Person) : ¬ LooksClean x → ¬ Washed x := by
  intro hNotClean hWashed
  have hClean : LooksClean x := washed_implies_clean x hWashed
  exact hNotClean hClean

-- The question would be: theorem washed_Tyler : Washed Tyler
-- From the given premises, this is not derivable, nor is its negation.
