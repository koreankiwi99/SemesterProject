Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DD_DS

Context:
When people drive safely, they avoid accidents. Also, if people follow directions, they don't get lost. But either someone did not avoid an accident or someone got lost, or both.

Question:
Jane drove safely. Is it true that she followed directions?
