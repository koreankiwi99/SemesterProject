Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DS_MP

Context:
In a community garden, if someone plants vegetables early in the season, they harvest a large crop. However, it is not certain if the soil is fertile. People are sure that either the vegetables are planted early, or the soil is fertile, or both.

Question:
Mia's soil was not fertile. Does this mean Mia harvested a large crop?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Mia : Person

axiom PlantsEarly : Person → Prop
axiom FertileSoil : Person → Prop
axiom LargeCrop : Person → Prop

-- If someone plants early, they harvest a large crop.
axiom early_implies_large : ∀ x : Person, PlantsEarly x → LargeCrop x

-- For every person, either they plant early or the soil is fertile (or both).
axiom early_or_fertile : ∀ x : Person, PlantsEarly x ∨ FertileSoil x

-- Mia's soil was not fertile.
axiom Mia_not_fertile : ¬ FertileSoil Mia

theorem Mia_large_crop : LargeCrop Mia := by
  have h := early_or_fertile Mia
  have h_early : PlantsEarly Mia := Or.elim h
    (fun pe => pe)
    (fun f => False.elim (Mia_not_fertile f))
