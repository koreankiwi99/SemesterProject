Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DS_MP

Context:
In a sailing club, if someone maintains their boat well, they win races. However, it is not certain if the weather conditions are favorable. Either the boat is maintained well, or the weather conditions are favorable, or both.

Question:
Olivia's weather conditions were not favorable. Does this mean Olivia won her race?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Olivia : Person
axiom MaintainsWell : Person → Prop
axiom WinsRace : Person → Prop
axiom FavorableWeather : Person → Prop

-- If someone maintains their boat well, they win races.
axiom maintain_implies_win : ∀ x : Person, MaintainsWell x → WinsRace x

-- Either the boat is maintained well, or the weather conditions are favorable (for Olivia).
axiom maintained_or_favorable : MaintainsWell Olivia ∨ FavorableWeather Olivia

-- Olivia's weather conditions were not favorable.
axiom not_favorable_Olivia : ¬ FavorableWeather Olivia

theorem Olivia_won : WinsRace Olivia := by
  have mw : MaintainsWell Olivia := by
    cases maintained_or_favorable with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr hw =>
        have f : False := not_favorable_Olivia hw
        exact False.elim f
  exact maintain_implies_win Olivia mw
</lean>
