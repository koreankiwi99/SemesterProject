Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: BD_DS

Context:
A chef thought that if they used fresh ingredients, their dishes would taste delicious. And if they followed traditional recipes, diners would appreciate the authentic flavors. However, the chef could either use fresh ingredients or make inauthentic dishes.

Question:

axiom Fresh : Prop
axiom Delicious : Prop
axiom Traditional : Prop
axiom AuthenticAppreciated : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom fresh_implies_delicious : Fresh → Delicious
axiom traditional_implies_authentic_appreciated : Traditional → AuthenticAppreciated
axiom fresh_or_inauthentic : Fresh ∨ ¬ AuthenticAppreciated
axiom not_delicious : ¬ Delicious

-- Conclusion: the chef did not follow traditional recipes
theorem not_traditional : ¬ Traditional := by
  -- From ¬Delicious and (Fresh → Delicious), we get ¬Fresh
  have notFresh : ¬ Fresh := by
    intro f
    have d : Delicious := fresh_implies_delicious f

  -- From (Fresh ∨ ¬AuthenticAppreciated) and ¬Fresh, we get ¬AuthenticAppreciated

    apply Or.elim fresh_or_inauthentic
    · intro f
      intro _a
      exact notFresh f
    · intro na

  -- From (Traditional → AuthenticAppreciated) and ¬AuthenticAppreciated, we conclude ¬Traditional
