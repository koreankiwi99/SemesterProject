Rule: CD_DS

Context:
An aspiring musician decided to try writing their own songs. They realized that if they composed original music, their work would be unique; if they promoted their music online, they would gain a following. The musician could write original songs or promote their music online.

Question:
Given that Maria's music was not unique, is it true that she gained a following online?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom ComposeOriginal : Prop
axiom Unique : Prop
axiom PromoteOnline : Prop
axiom Following : Prop

axiom comp_imp_unique : ComposeOriginal → Unique
axiom promo_imp_following : PromoteOnline → Following
axiom compose_or_promote : ComposeOriginal ∨ PromoteOnline
axiom not_unique : ¬ Unique

theorem gained_following : Following := by
  have not_compose : ¬ ComposeOriginal := by
    intro c
    have u : Unique := comp_imp_unique c
    exact not_unique u
  have promoted : PromoteOnline := by
