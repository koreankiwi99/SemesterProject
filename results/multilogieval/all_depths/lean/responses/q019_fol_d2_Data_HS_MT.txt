Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: HS_MT

Context:
A band wanted to gain a larger fanbase. They knew that if they toured extensively, more people would be exposed to their music. Also, if more people heard their songs, ticket sales for their shows would increase.

Question:
If the band does not see an increase in ticket sales, do they tour extensively?

LLM Response:
<lean>
-- Propositions representing the key events
axiom TourExtensively : Prop
axiom MorePeopleHearSongs : Prop
axiom TicketSalesIncrease : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom tour_imp_exposure : TourExtensively → MorePeopleHearSongs
axiom exposure_imp_sales : MorePeopleHearSongs → TicketSalesIncrease

-- From no increase in ticket sales, conclude they did not tour extensively
theorem no_tour_from_no_sales : ¬ TicketSalesIncrease → ¬ TourExtensively := by
  intro hNoSales
  intro hTour
  have hExposure : MorePeopleHearSongs := tour_imp_exposure hTour
  have hSales : TicketSalesIncrease := exposure_imp_sales hExposure
  exact hNoSales hSales
