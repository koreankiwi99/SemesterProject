Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: BD_DS

Context:
A student hoped to excel in class. They believed that if they took good notes, they would understand the material well, and if they did all the homework, they would get high marks. However, the student can either take good notes or not get high marks.

Question:
James didn't understand the material well. Is it true that James took good notes?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person

axiom TookGoodNotes : Person → Prop
axiom UnderstandsWell : Person → Prop
axiom DidAllHomework : Person → Prop
axiom HighMarks : Person → Prop

-- Beliefs/premises from the text for James
axiom h1 : TookGoodNotes James → UnderstandsWell James
axiom h2 : DidAllHomework James → HighMarks James
axiom h3 : TookGoodNotes James ∨ ¬ HighMarks James
axiom h4 : ¬ UnderstandsWell James

-- From "if took good notes then understood well" and "didn't understand well",
-- we can conclude James did not take good notes.
theorem not_took_notes : ¬ TookGoodNotes James := by
  intro tn
  have uw : UnderstandsWell James := h1 tn
  exact h4 uw

-- (Optional) From the disjunction and the above, conclude not high marks.
theorem not_high_marks : ¬ HighMarks James := by
  apply Or.elim h3
  · intro tn
    exact False.elim (not_took_notes tn)
  · intro nh
    exact nh
