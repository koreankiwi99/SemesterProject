Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS

Context:
If the sun is out, the pool gets crowded. If the pool gets crowded, there's a long wait for the waterslides. If it's payday, people go shopping. Today, either the sun was out, or it was payday, or both happened.

Question:
There was no long wait for the waterslides today. Did people go shopping?

axiom Sun : Prop
axiom Crowded : Prop
axiom LongWait : Prop
axiom Payday : Prop
axiom Shopping : Prop

axiom sun_implies_crowded : Sun → Crowded
axiom crowded_implies_longwait : Crowded → LongWait
axiom payday_implies_shopping : Payday → Shopping
axiom sun_or_payday : Sun ∨ Payday
axiom no_long_wait : ¬ LongWait

theorem went_shopping_today : Shopping := by
  -- From no long wait and Crowded → LongWait, get ¬Crowded
  have not_crowded : ¬ Crowded := by

  -- From Sun → Crowded and ¬Crowded, get ¬Sun
