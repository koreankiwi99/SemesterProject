Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS

Context:
In a city, residents know that if it rains, the grass gets wet. If there is a festival, then the streets get crowded. Either it rained today, or the streets were not crowded.

Question:
There was a festival in town today. Is the grass wet?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Rain : Prop
axiom WetGrass : Prop
axiom Festival : Prop
axiom Crowded : Prop

axiom h_rain_implies_wet : Rain → WetGrass
axiom h_festival_implies_crowded : Festival → Crowded
axiom h_rain_or_not_crowded : Rain ∨ ¬ Crowded
axiom h_festival_today : Festival

theorem grass_wet : WetGrass := by
  have hc : Crowded := h_festival_implies_crowded h_festival_today
  have hr : Rain :=
    Or.elim h_rain_or_not_crowded
      (fun hr => hr)
      (fun hnc => False.elim (hnc hc))
  exact h_rain_implies_wet hr
</lean>
