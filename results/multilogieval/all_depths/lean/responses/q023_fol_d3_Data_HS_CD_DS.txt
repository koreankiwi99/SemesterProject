Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS

Context:
If it is cloudy, then it might rain later. If it rains, the grass gets wet. If the grass is wet, kids can jump in puddles. Either it was cloudy today, or kids were jumping in puddles, or both things happened.

Question:
There was no wet grass today. Were kids jumping in puddles?

LLM Response:
<lean>
theorem kids_jumping
  (Cloudy Rain Wet Jump : Prop)
  (cloudy_implies_rain : Cloudy → Rain)
  (rain_implies_wet : Rain → Wet)
  (wet_implies_jump : Wet → Jump)
  (cloudy_or_jump : Cloudy ∨ Jump)
  (not_wet : ¬ Wet) : Jump := by
  have not_rain : ¬ Rain := by
    intro hr
    exact not_wet (rain_implies_wet hr)
  have not_cloudy : ¬ Cloudy := by
    intro hc
    exact not_rain (cloudy_implies_rain hc)
  exact Or.elim cloudy_or_jump (fun hc => False.elim (not_cloudy hc)) (fun hj => hj)
