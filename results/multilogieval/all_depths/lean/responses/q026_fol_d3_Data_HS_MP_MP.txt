Context:
A young man was looking to adopt a pet. He learned that if you adopt an animal, you have to commit to taking care of it. He knew that if you properly care for a pet, it will be happy and healthy.

Question:

-- If someone adopts an animal, they have to commit to taking care of it.
axiom adopt_implies_commit : ∀ (x : Person) (a : Animal), Adopts x a → CommitsToCare x a

-- If someone properly cares for a pet, then the pet will be happy and healthy.
axiom proper_care_implies_happy_healthy : ∀ (x : Person) (a : Animal), ProperlyCaresFor x a → (Happy a ∧ Healthy a)

-- Fact: Kevin adopts a pet.
axiom kevin_adopts_pet : Adopts Kevin Pet

-- From adoption, we can conclude Kevin commits to care for the pet.
theorem kevin_commits_to_care : CommitsToCare Kevin Pet := by
  exact adopt_implies_commit Kevin Pet kevin_adopts_pet

-- If Kevin properly cares for the pet, then it will be happy and healthy.
theorem if_kevin_properly_cares_then_happy_healthy : ProperlyCaresFor Kevin Pet → (Happy Pet ∧ Healthy Pet) := by
