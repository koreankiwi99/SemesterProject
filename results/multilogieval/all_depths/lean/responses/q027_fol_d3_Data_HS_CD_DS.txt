Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS

Context:
If the electricity goes out, the house becomes very dark. If it is dark inside, people will turn on flashlights to see. If the internet also goes down, electronics will not work. Either there was a power outage today, or the internet went down, or both things occurred.

Question:
The house did not become dark. Were the electronics not working?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom ElectricityOut : Prop
axiom Dark : Prop
axiom InternetDown : Prop
axiom ElectronicsNotWorking : Prop
axiom FlashlightsOn : Prop

axiom h1 : ElectricityOut → Dark
axiom h2 : Dark → FlashlightsOn
axiom h3 : InternetDown → ElectronicsNotWorking
axiom h4 : ElectricityOut ∨ InternetDown
axiom h5 : ¬ Dark

theorem electronics_not_working : ElectronicsNotWorking := by
  have notE : ¬ ElectricityOut := by
    intro e
    exact h5 (h1 e)
  have i : InternetDown := Or.elim h4 (fun e => False.elim (notE e)) (fun i => i)
  exact h3 i
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes

Extracted Lean Code:
