Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_MP_MP

Context:
One day, someone decided to start exercising regularly. They believed that if someone exercises regularly, they will gain more energy. If someone gains energy, they have improved moods.

Question:
Did James become much happier after he started exercising regularly?

Iterations:
================================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person

axiom ExercisesRegularly : Person → Prop
axiom GainsEnergy : Person → Prop
axiom ImprovedMood : Person → Prop

-- Believed/general rules
axiom exercise_implies_energy : ∀ x : Person, ExercisesRegularly x → GainsEnergy x
axiom energy_implies_mood : ∀ x : Person, GainsEnergy x → ImprovedMood x

-- From the question: James started exercising regularly
axiom james_started : ExercisesRegularly James

theorem James_became_much_happier : ImprovedMood James := by
  have h₁ : GainsEnergy James := exercise_implies_energy James james_started
  exact energy_implies_mood James h₁
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes

Extracted Lean Code:
