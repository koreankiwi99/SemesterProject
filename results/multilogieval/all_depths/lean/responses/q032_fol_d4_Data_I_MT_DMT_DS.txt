Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: I_MT_DMT_DS

Context:
For students, teachers often say that if someone studies consistently throughout the semester, then if they are well-prepared before the exam, they will get good grades.

Question:
Emma was well-prepared before the exam. Emma did not get good grades. Did Emma study consistently throughout the semester?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Emma : Person

axiom StudiesConsistently : Person → Prop
axiom WellPrepared : Person → Prop
axiom GoodGrades : Person → Prop

-- If someone studies consistently, then if they are well-prepared, they will get good grades.
axiom study_rule : ∀ x : Person, StudiesConsistently x → (WellPrepared x → GoodGrades x)

-- Facts about Emma
axiom Emma_well_prepared : WellPrepared Emma
axiom Emma_not_good_grades : ¬ GoodGrades Emma

-- Conclusion: Emma did not study consistently throughout the semester.
theorem Emma_did_not_study_consistently : ¬ StudiesConsistently Emma := by
  intro hStudy
  have hwg : WellPrepared Emma → GoodGrades Emma := (study_rule Emma) hStudy
  have hgood : GoodGrades Emma := hwg Emma_well_prepared
  exact Emma_not_good_grades hgood
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
