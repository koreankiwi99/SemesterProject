Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP

Context:
If the pilot checks the plane thoroughly, it will fly safely. If there is heavy fog, all flights get delayed. Either she inspected the plane well, or there were no delays, or the plane was checked but flights left on time. If the flight is safe, the passengers will be grateful.

Question:
There was heavy fog today, does it entail that the passengers were grateful?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Checked : Prop          -- the pilot checked the plane thoroughly
axiom Safe : Prop             -- the flight is safe
axiom Fog : Prop              -- there is heavy fog
axiom Delayed : Prop          -- flights get delayed
axiom Grateful : Prop         -- passengers are grateful

axiom h1 : Checked → Safe
axiom h2 : Fog → Delayed
axiom h3 : Checked ∨ ¬Delayed ∨ (Checked ∧ ¬Delayed)
axiom h4 : Safe → Grateful
axiom h5 : Fog

theorem entail_grateful : Grateful := by
  have hd : Delayed := h2 h5
  cases h3 with
  | inl hc =>
      exact h4 (h1 hc)
  | inr rest =>
      cases rest with
      | inl nd =>
          exact False.elim (nd hd)
      | inr hc_nd =>
          exact False.elim (hc_nd.right hd)
