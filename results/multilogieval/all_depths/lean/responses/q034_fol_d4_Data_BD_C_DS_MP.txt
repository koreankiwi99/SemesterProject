Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP

Context:
If a student studies hard, they will earn high marks on the test. If the teacher makes the test very difficult, many students will fail. Either the student studies hard, or the test will not be too hard, or the student studies hard and the test will not be too difficult. It's expected that if someone earns high marks, they will be satisfied with their performance.

Question:
The teacher made the test very difficult, will the student be satisfied with their performance?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom S : Prop   -- student studies hard
axiom H : Prop   -- student earns high marks
axiom D : Prop   -- teacher made the test very difficult
axiom F : Prop   -- many students fail
axiom Sat : Prop -- student satisfied with performance

axiom p1 : S → H
axiom p2 : D → F
axiom p3 : (S ∨ ¬ D) ∨ (S ∧ ¬ D)
axiom p4 : H → Sat
axiom d  : D

theorem student_satisfied : Sat := by
  cases p3 with
  | inl h1 =>
    cases h1 with
    | inl hs =>
      exact p4 (p1 hs)
    | inr hnotd =>
