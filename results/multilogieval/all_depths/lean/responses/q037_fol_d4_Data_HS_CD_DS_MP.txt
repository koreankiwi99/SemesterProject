Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS_MP

Context:
It was the morning of a big game day in town. If the hometown team wins, then fans celebrate in the streets. If fans celebrate in the streets, then local businesses get more customers. If the hometown team loses, then fans feel disappointed. Either the hometown team won or they lost today. The mayor knows that if fans feel disappointed, then fewer people come downtown.

Question:
Local businesses did not get many customers today. Did fewer people come downtown?
