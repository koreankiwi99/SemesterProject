Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP

Context:
At the park on weekends, if it is sunny, then children will play on the playground. Also, if there is a traveling carnival in town, families will go ride the rides together. Either it is sunny today, or the carnival is in town, or both are happening. But if kids get to play on the playground, they will have fun and get exercise.

Question:
The families did not go ride carnival rides, did the kids have fun and get exercise?

axiom Sunny : Prop
axiom KidsPlay : Prop
axiom Carnival : Prop
axiom FamiliesRide : Prop
axiom KidsFun : Prop
axiom KidsExercise : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom sunny_implies_play : Sunny → KidsPlay
axiom carnival_implies_families_ride : Carnival → FamiliesRide
axiom sunny_or_carnival : Sunny ∨ Carnival
axiom play_implies_fun_and_exercise : KidsPlay → (KidsFun ∧ KidsExercise)

-- Given: families did not go ride carnival rides
axiom not_families_ride : ¬ FamiliesRide

theorem kids_had_fun_and_exercise : KidsFun ∧ KidsExercise := by
  -- From ¬FamiliesRide and (Carnival → FamiliesRide), deduce ¬Carnival
  have not_carnival : ¬ Carnival := by
    intro hc
    exact not_families_ride (carnival_implies_families_ride hc)
  -- From Sunny ∨ Carnival and ¬Carnival, deduce Sunny
  have sunny_today : Sunny := by
    cases sunny_or_carnival with

    | inr hc => exact False.elim (not_carnival hc)
  -- Then KidsPlay, hence KidsFun ∧ KidsExercise
