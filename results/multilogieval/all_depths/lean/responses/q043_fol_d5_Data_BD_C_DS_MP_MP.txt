Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the sun is shining, the solar panels will generate electricity. If it is windy outside, the wind turbines will spin. Either it was sunny today, or the wind turbines did not spin today. If solar panels generate electricity, the energy grid stays stable. If the grid is stable, blackouts can be prevented.

Question:
If it was windy today, were blackouts prevented?

axiom Windy : Prop
axiom Spin : Prop
axiom SolarGen : Prop
axiom Stable : Prop
axiom Prevented : Prop

axiom p1 : Sun → SolarGen
axiom p2 : Windy → Spin
axiom p3 : Sun ∨ ¬ Spin
axiom p4 : SolarGen → Stable
axiom p5 : Stable → Prevented
