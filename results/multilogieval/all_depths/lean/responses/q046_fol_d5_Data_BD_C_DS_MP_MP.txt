Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the crops get enough sunlight, they will grow strong. If it is windy, trees might fall over. Either the plants got good sunlight, or no trees fell. If the crops grow strong, the harvest will be plentiful. When there is a big harvest, the farmer makes a good profit.

Question:
If it was very windy this season, did the farmer make a good profit from the harvest?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom EnoughSunlight : Prop
axiom GrowStrong : Prop
axiom WindySeason : Prop
axiom TreesFell : Prop
axiom PlentifulHarvest : Prop
axiom GoodProfit : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom h1 : EnoughSunlight → GrowStrong
axiom h2 : WindySeason → TreesFell
axiom h3 : EnoughSunlight ∨ ¬ TreesFell
axiom h4 : GrowStrong → PlentifulHarvest
axiom h5 : PlentifulHarvest → GoodProfit

-- Goal: If it was very windy, the farmer made a good profit.
theorem farmer_profit_from_windy : WindySeason → GoodProfit := by
  intro hw
  have tf : TreesFell := h2 hw
  -- From (EnoughSunlight ∨ ¬TreesFell) and TreesFell, deduce EnoughSunlight
  have sun : EnoughSunlight := by
    cases h3 with
    | inl hs => exact hs
    | inr hnot =>
        have contra : False := hnot tf

  have gs : GrowStrong := h1 sun
  have ph : PlentifulHarvest := h4 gs
