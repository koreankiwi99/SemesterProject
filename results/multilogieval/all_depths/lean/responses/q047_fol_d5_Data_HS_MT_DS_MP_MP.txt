Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Someone wanted to become a better public speaker. They learned that if they practiced presenting in front of others frequently, they would become more comfortable speaking to an audience. And if they became more comfortable speaking to an audience, they could engage people better during speeches. Therefore, if someone practiced presenting frequently, they could engage audiences better. Either they practiced presenting frequently, or they learned voice projection techniques, or both. If someone learned voice projection techniques, then they could be heard clearly. And if they could be heard clearly, then they could captivate people's attention.

Question:
If Emma cannot engage people better during speeches, then can she captivate people's attention?
