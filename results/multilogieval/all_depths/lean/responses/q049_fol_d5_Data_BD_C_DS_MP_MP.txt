Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If someone studies hard for an exam, they will feel confident going into the test. If there is severe weather in the forecast, schools may cancel class that day. Either Alex studied diligently for his biology exam, or class was not canceled due to the weather. If a student feels confident about the material, they will likely do well on the exam. If a student performs well on an exam, they will be satisfied with their hard work.

Question:
If there was severe weather in the forecast, did Alex feel satisfied with his performance on the history exam?

-- Entities
axiom Person : Type
axiom Exam : Type
axiom Alex : Person
axiom Biology : Exam
axiom History : Exam

-- Predicates
axiom StudiesHard : Person → Exam → Prop
axiom FeelsConfident : Person → Exam → Prop
axiom PerformsWell : Person → Exam → Prop
axiom SatisfiedWithPerformance : Person → Exam → Prop

-- Propositions about the day/weather
axiom SevereWeather : Prop
axiom ClassCanceled : Prop
axiom MayCancel : Prop  -- capturing the "may cancel" modality as a separate proposition

-- Premises from the text
-- 1) If someone studies hard for an exam, they will feel confident going into the test.
axiom study_confident : ∀ p e, StudiesHard p e → FeelsConfident p e

-- 2) If there is severe weather in the forecast, schools may cancel class that day.
axiom severeWeather_mayCancel : SevereWeather → MayCancel

-- 3) Either Alex studied diligently for his biology exam, or class was not canceled due to the weather.
axiom studiedBio_or_notCanceled : StudiesHard Alex Biology ∨ ¬ClassCanceled

-- 4) If a student feels confident about the material, they will likely do well on the exam.
axiom confident_doWell : ∀ p e, FeelsConfident p e → PerformsWell p e

-- 5) If a student performs well on an exam, they will be satisfied with their hard work.
axiom doWell_satisfied : ∀ p e, PerformsWell p e → SatisfiedWithPerformance p e

-- Some consequences we can actually derive from the given premises:

-- From premise (3), if class was canceled, then Alex studied for his biology exam.
theorem canceled_implies_studied_biology : ClassCanceled → StudiesHard Alex Biology := by
  intro hc
  cases studiedBio_or_notCanceled with
  | inl hstud => exact hstud
  | inr hnot =>
      have : False := hnot hc
      exact False.elim this

-- Chaining the skill implications: if someone studies for an exam, they end up satisfied with that exam.
theorem studies_implies_satisfied (p : Person) (e : Exam) :
    StudiesHard p e → SatisfiedWithPerformance p e := by
  intro hstud
  have hconf : FeelsConfident p e := study_confident p e hstud
  have hwell : PerformsWell p e := confident_doWell p e hconf
  exact doWell_satisfied p e hwell

-- Therefore, if class was canceled, Alex is satisfied with his biology exam (but this says nothing about history).
theorem canceled_implies_satisfied_biology : ClassCanceled → SatisfiedWithPerformance Alex Biology := by
  intro hc
  have hstud : StudiesHard Alex Biology := canceled_implies_studied_biology hc
  exact studies_implies_satisfied Alex Biology hstud

-- We cannot derive from the given premises that:
-- SevereWeather → SatisfiedWithPerformance Alex History
-- because nothing links SevereWeather (or cancellation) to Alex's studying/confidence/performance on the history exam.
-- Nor can we derive its negation from the given information.
