Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: default_reasoning_irr

Context:
John and Sarah both entered the bake-off contest. Bake-off contestants normally make pies. John did not make a pie. Sarah made cookies.

Question:
Can we conclude Sarah made a pie?

axiom John : Person

axiom Contestant : Person → Prop

-- Premises
axiom john_contestant : Contestant John
axiom sarah_contestant : Contestant Sarah
-- "Bake-off contestants normally make pies."
-- We model "normally" with an abnormality predicate: contestants who are not abnormal make pies.
axiom normal_rule : ∀ x : Person, Contestant x ∧ ¬ Abnormal x → MakesPie x
axiom john_no_pie : ¬ MakesPie John
axiom sarah_made_cookies : MakesCookies Sarah

-- From the default rule and John's exception, we can derive that John is abnormal.

-- Target question: Can we conclude Sarah made a pie?
-- Under the given premises, there is no derivation of MakesPie Sarah,
-- because we have no information about whether Sarah is abnormal or not.
-- Thus, we do not provide a proof of MakesPie Sarah nor of its negation.

⊢ Abnormal John

--- Iteration 2 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
- From “Bake-off contestants normally make pies,” we treat “normally” as a defeasible rule: contestants tend to make pies unless they are exceptional.
- We know John is an exception (he did not make a pie), so exceptions exist.
- We have no information that Sarah is non-exceptional; the fact that she made cookies does not imply she made a pie.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sarah made a pie.

STAGE 1 ANSWER: No

STAGE 2 ANSWER: No

No Lean code found.

--- Iteration 3 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
- “Bake-off contestants normally make pies” is defeasible: contestants make pies unless they are exceptional.
- John is an explicit exception (he did not make a pie), so exceptions exist.
- We have no information that Sarah is non-exceptional; the fact that she made cookies does not entail she made a pie.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sarah made a pie.
