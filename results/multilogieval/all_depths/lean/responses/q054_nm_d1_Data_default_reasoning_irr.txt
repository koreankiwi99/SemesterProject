Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: default_reasoning_irr

Context:
Atlanta and Boston are cities. Typically, large cities have an international airport. Atlanta does not have an international airport. Boston has a population over 500,000 people.

Question:
Can we conclude Boston has an international airport?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
We cannot conclude Boston has an international airport. The premises only say that typically large cities have an international airport and that Boston has a population over 500,000. There is no given link that “population over 500,000” implies “large,” and “typically” does not assert a strict universal rule. Hence, the conclusion does not follow.

STAGE 1 ANSWER: No

STAGE 2 ANSWER: No

ANSWER: No

No Lean code found.

--- Iteration 3 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
We cannot conclude Boston has an international airport. “Typically” is not a universal rule, and we are not given that having a population over 500,000 implies being large. Hence the conclusion does not follow.

STAGE 1 ANSWER: No
