Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: reasoning_about_exceptions_1

Context:
Julia, Emma, and Lucas are graduate students in the biology department and have published research papers. Generally, students who have published are considered for scholarships. At least one of Julia or Emma has not been considered for a scholarship.

Question:
Can we conclude Lucas has been considered for a scholarship and exactly one of Julia or Emma has not been considered?

/-
We model the scenario with three people: Julia, Emma, and Lucas.
Predicates:
  - Published : Person → Prop
  - Considered : Person → Prop   (considered for a scholarship)

Facts given:
  - Julia, Emma, Lucas have published.
  - At least one of Julia or Emma has not been considered.

The sentence "Generally, students who have published are considered for scholarships."
is not formalized as a hard logical rule (→), since "generally" allows exceptions and
we are explicitly told there is an exception among Julia/Emma.

With only the premises above (and not turning "generally" into a strict implication),
we cannot derive that Lucas is considered, nor can we strengthen "at least one" to
"exactly one". Hence the target conclusion is not provable from these premises,
and its negation is also not provable from the given information.
