Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: reasoning_about_priority

Context:
Astronomer Alice asserts that the planet Zorotar orbits its star every 20 years. Cosmologist Bob asserts that the planet Zorotar does not orbit its star every 20 years. Normally, when scientists assert something about planetary orbits, they are right.

Question:
Can we conclude that if Cosmologist Bob's evidence is more reliable than Astronomer Alice's, then the planet Zorotar does not orbit its star every 20 years?

axiom Scientist : Type

-- Proposition: "Zorotar orbits its star every 20 years"
axiom Orbits20 : Prop

-- Predicates for assertions and topic classification
axiom Asserts : Scientist → Prop → Prop

-- Both assertions are about planetary orbits
axiom AboutOrbits : AboutOrbitClaim Orbits20
axiom AboutNotOrbits : AboutOrbitClaim (¬ Orbits20)

-- "Normally, when scientists assert something about planetary orbits, they are right."
-- We model "normally" as a defeasible/non-monotonic marker that does not entail truth in classical logic.

-- A reliability comparison relation
axiom MoreReliable : Scientist → Scientist → Prop

-- Target question: Can we conclude (in classical logic, from the above premises)
-- that if Bob's evidence is more reliable than Alice's, then ¬ Orbits20?
-- This is not derivable from the given axioms (the "normally" premise is defeasible),
