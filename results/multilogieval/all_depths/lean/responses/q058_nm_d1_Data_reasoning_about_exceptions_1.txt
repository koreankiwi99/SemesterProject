Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: reasoning_about_exceptions_1

Context:
The Blue Galaxy, Red Nebula, and Green Comet are celestial objects discovered last year and exhibit unusual electromagnetic signals. Typically, celestial objects with such signals are studied further by the space agency. At least one of Blue Galaxy or Red Nebula is not being studied further.

Question:
Can we conclude Green Comet is being studied further and exactly one of Blue Galaxy or Red Nebula is not being studied?

/- Entities and predicates -/
axiom Celestial : Type

axiom StudiedFurther : Celestial → Prop
/-
We model "Typically" as a separate predicate that does not entail StudiedFurther in classical logic.
This preserves the defeasible reading of "typically".
