Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: default_reasoning_default

Context:
John and Mary are students in the same class. Typically, students in that class submit assignments online. However, John prefers to submit assignments on paper.

Question:
Can we conclude that Mary submits assignments online?

inductive Person where
  | John
  | Mary
deriving DecidableEq

def InClassC (p : Person) : Prop := True

-- We model "Typically, students in that class submit assignments online"
-- as: for any student in the class, if they are typical, then they submit online.
-- John prefers to submit on paper.
theorem cannot_conclude_Mary_submits_online :
  ∃ (SubmitsOnline PrefersPaper Typical : Person → Prop),
    -- John prefers to submit on paper
    PrefersPaper Person.John ∧
    -- Typical students in the class submit online
    (∀ x, InClassC x → Typical x → SubmitsOnline x) ∧
    -- Yet Mary does not submit online in this consistent scenario
    ¬ SubmitsOnline Person.Mary := by
  refine ⟨(fun _ => False), (fun p => p = Person.John), (fun _ => False), ?_, ?_, ?_⟩
  · -- PrefersPaper John
    rfl
  · -- Typical in-class ⇒ submits online (vacuously true since Typical is False everywhere)

  · -- ¬ SubmitsOnline Mary (since SubmitsOnline Mary is False)
