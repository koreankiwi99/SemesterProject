Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DRD_MT

Context:
The Sedan and the SUV are cars with anti-lock brakes. Cars with anti-lock brakes usually have electronic stability control. The Sedan may lack electronic stability control even with anti-lock brakes. If the SUV has all-wheel drive, then it probably does not have electronic stability control.

Question:
Can we conclude the SUV has all-wheel drive?
