Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: BDR_MT

Context:
Emma and Jacob are students in the same class. Usually students in that class submit homework assignments. Emma did not submit the last homework. If Jacob missed over 3 classes, that means he likely did not submit the homework.

Question:
Can we conclude Jacob missed over 3 classes?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
- Premises: Students in the class usually submit homework; Emma didn’t submit; if Jacob missed > 3 classes, then likely he didn’t submit.
- From “if Jacob missed > 3 classes, then likely he didn’t submit,” we cannot infer that Jacob missed > 3 classes (affirming the consequent would be a fallacy, and “likely” is not logical entailment).
- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Jacob missed > 3 classes.

No Lean code found.

--- Iteration 3 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
- Premises: Students in the class usually submit; Emma didn’t submit; if Jacob missed > 3 classes, then likely he didn’t submit.
- From “if Jacob missed > 3 classes, then likely he didn’t submit,” we cannot infer that Jacob missed > 3 classes. “Likely” is non-logical and does not give a strict entailment, and inferring the antecedent from the consequent would be a fallacy.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude Jacob missed over 3 classes.
