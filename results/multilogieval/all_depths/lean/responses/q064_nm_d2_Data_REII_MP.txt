Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: REII_MP

Context:
Jane rented a Toyota Camry. Most Toyota Camrys have alloy wheels. However, some Toyota Camrys have hubcaps instead of alloy wheels. If a Toyota Camry has alloy wheels, then it also has power windows.

Question:
Can we conclude Jane's Camry has power windows?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
"Most" does not guarantee that Jane's specific Camry has alloy wheels, and we are told that some Camrys do not have alloy wheels. Since the only provided route to power windows is via having alloy wheels, we cannot conclude that Jane's Camry has power windows.
