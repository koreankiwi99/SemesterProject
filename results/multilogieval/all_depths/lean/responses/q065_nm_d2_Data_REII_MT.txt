Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: REII_MT

Context:
Mike adopted a dog from an animal shelter. Usually, dogs from shelters have been vaccinated. However, some owner-surrendered dogs may not have complete vaccination records. If a dog is too young, it will not have all its vaccinations yet.

Question:
Can we conclude Mike's dog is too young to be fully vaccinated?

-- Domain
axiom Dog : Type
axiom mDog : Dog

-- Predicates
axiom FromShelter : Dog → Prop
axiom OwnerSurrendered : Dog → Prop
axiom FullyVaccinated : Dog → Prop
axiom TooYoung : Dog → Prop
axiom HasCompleteVaccinationRecords : Dog → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom m_from_shelter : FromShelter mDog

-- "Usually, dogs from shelters have been vaccinated." (left informal; not a universal axiom)

-- Some owner-surrendered dogs may not have complete vaccination records.
axiom some_owner_surrendered_lack_records :
  ∃ d : Dog, OwnerSurrendered d ∧ ¬ HasCompleteVaccinationRecords d

-- If a dog is too young, it will not have all its vaccinations yet.
axiom too_young_not_fully_vaccinated :
  ∀ d : Dog, TooYoung d → ¬ FullyVaccinated d

-- What we can derive: if Mike's dog is too young, then it is not fully vaccinated.
theorem young_mike_dog_implies_not_fully :
  TooYoung mDog → ¬ FullyVaccinated mDog := by
  intro h
  exact too_young_not_fully_vaccinated mDog h

-- We cannot derive TooYoung mDog from the given premises.
-- Hence, the queried conclusion is not provable from these assumptions.
