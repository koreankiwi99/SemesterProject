Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: PBD_MP

Context:
The coach said the player scored 30 points in the game. The referee said the player did not score 30 points. Officials are normally correct. The coach has better information than the referee. If the player scored 30 points, he likely had an exceptional game.

Question:
Can we conclude the player had an exceptional game?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
We have conflicting testimonies: the coach says the player scored 30; the referee says he did not. Both are officials and “normally correct,” so we get two opposing default supports. Although the coach has better information than the referee, we are not given a firm rule that resolves the conflict into a factual conclusion that the player did score 30. Without establishing that he scored 30, the conditional “if scored 30 then likely exceptional” does not let us conclude he had an exceptional game. Therefore, we cannot conclude the player had an exceptional game.

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
There is conflicting testimony: coach says 30 points, referee says not 30 points. Both are normally correct, and the coach has better information, but we are not given a rule that resolves conflict into truth that the player scored 30. Without establishing that he scored 30, the conditional only yields a likely-exceptional conclusion under that antecedent. So we cannot conclude he had an exceptional game.
