Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: REII_MT

Context:
Emily rented a house near the beach. Typically, beach rentals come with access to the ocean. However, some more affordable places are a few blocks from the water and don't include beach access. If a rental is considered luxury, it does not have public beach access.

Question:
Can we conclude Emily's rental is considered a luxury property?

axiom Rental : Type

-- Emily's rental
axiom emilyRental : Rental

-- Predicates about rentals
axiom NearBeach : Rental → Prop
axiom PublicBeachAccess : Rental → Prop
axiom Luxury : Rental → Prop
axiom Affordable : Rental → Prop
axiom FewBlocksFromWater : Rental → Prop

-- Facts from the text:
-- Emily rented a house near the beach.
axiom emily_near : NearBeach emilyRental

-- Some more affordable places are a few blocks from the water and don't include beach access.
axiom exists_affordable_fewblocks_no_access :
  ∃ r : Rental, Affordable r ∧ FewBlocksFromWater r ∧ ¬ PublicBeachAccess r

-- If a rental is considered luxury, it does not have public beach access.
axiom luxury_no_public_access : ∀ r : Rental, Luxury r → ¬ PublicBeachAccess r

-- A derivable consequence (but it does not establish that Emily's rental is luxury):
theorem luxury_implies_no_public_access_for_emily :
  Luxury emilyRental → ¬ PublicBeachAccess emilyRental := by
  intro hL
  exact luxury_no_public_access emilyRental hL
