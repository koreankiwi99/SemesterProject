Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: REII_MT

Context:
Mary bought a new car. Typically, new cars come with a warranty. However, some dealers sell used cars that were former rentals, and those do not have a warranty. If a car was in a major accident, it will not have a warranty.

Question:
Can we conclude Mary's car was in a major accident?

-- Entities
axiom Car : Type
axiom MaryCar : Car

-- Predicates
axiom New : Car → Prop
axiom Warranty : Car → Prop
axiom Accident : Car → Prop
axiom UsedFormerRental : Car → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom mary_new : New MaryCar

-- "Typically, new cars come with a warranty." We model typicality separately,
-- not as a strict logical implication to Warranty.

axiom typical_new_has_warranty : ∀ c : Car, New c → TypicalWarranty c

-- Exceptions/rules that prevent warranty
axiom used_rental_no_warranty : ∀ c : Car, UsedFormerRental c → ¬ Warranty c
axiom accident_no_warranty : ∀ c : Car, Accident c → ¬ Warranty c

-- What strictly follows: if a car has a warranty, it was not in a major accident.

-- Specialization to Mary's car

-- From the given information alone, we cannot derive Accident MaryCar, nor its negation.
