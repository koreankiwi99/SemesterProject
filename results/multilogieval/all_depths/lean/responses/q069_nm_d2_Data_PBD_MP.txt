Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: PBD_MP

Context:
The coach said the player was late for practice. The assistant coach said the player was not late for practice. When people make statements, they are typically right. The coach has more credible evidence than the assistant coach. If the player was late for practice, then they broke team rules.

Question:
Can we conclude the player broke team rules?
