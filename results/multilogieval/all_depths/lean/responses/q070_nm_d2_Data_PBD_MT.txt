Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: PBD_MT

Context:
Jenny said the dress was blue. Mary said the dress was not blue. People are normally right when they make claims about colors. Jenny seems more reliable.

Question:
Can we conclude the dress is actually another color?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Jenny : Person
axiom Mary : Person

-- Proposition: the dress is blue
axiom Blue : Prop

-- Reports
axiom SaysBlue : Person → Prop
axiom SaysNotBlue : Person → Prop
axiom jenny_said_blue : SaysBlue Jenny
axiom mary_said_not_blue : SaysNotBlue Mary

-- Reliability relation and rule: when there is a conflict, trust the more reliable speaker
axiom MoreReliable : Person → Person → Prop
axiom jenny_more_reliable_than_mary : MoreReliable Jenny Mary
axiom trust_more_reliable_when_conflict :
  ∀ j m : Person, MoreReliable j m → SaysBlue j → SaysNotBlue m → Blue

-- "Actually another color" means "not blue"
def ActuallyAnotherColor : Prop := ¬ Blue

-- From the reliability rule and the reports, we can conclude the dress is blue
theorem conclude_blue : Blue := by
  exact trust_more_reliable_when_conflict Jenny Mary
    jenny_more_reliable_than_mary jenny_said_blue mary_said_not_blue

-- Therefore, it is not the case that the dress is actually another color
theorem cannot_conclude_actually_another_color : ¬ ActuallyAnotherColor := by
  unfold ActuallyAnotherColor
  intro h
  exact h conclude_blue
