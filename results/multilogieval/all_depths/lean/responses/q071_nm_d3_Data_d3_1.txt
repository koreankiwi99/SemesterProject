Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_1

Context:
Two authors have published best-selling novels. Authors of best-selling novels often receive literary awards. If author 1 receives a literary award, then Lucas writes a positive review. If Lucas writes a positive review, then Mia recommends the book.

Question:
Can we conclude if Mia does not recommend the book, then the other author does not receive a literary award?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
From the premises, we can derive: if Author 1 receives an award, then Lucas writes a positive review; if Lucas writes a positive review, then Mia recommends the book. Therefore, if Mia does not recommend the book, then Author 1 did not receive an award (contraposition). However, there is no given link between Mia’s recommendation and whether the other author (Author 2) receives an award. The statement that best-selling authors “often” receive awards is too weak to yield a logical implication about Author 2’s award status. Hence, we cannot conclude that Mia not recommending implies the other author does not receive an award.

ANSWER: No

No Lean code found.

--- Iteration 3 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
From the premises, we can contrapose the given implications to conclude: if Mia does not recommend the book, then Author 1 did not receive an award. However, there is no link from Mia’s recommendation to whether the other author (Author 2) receives an award. The “often receive awards” statement is not a universal rule and thus gives no logical implication. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if Mia does not recommend the book, then the other author does not receive a literary award.
