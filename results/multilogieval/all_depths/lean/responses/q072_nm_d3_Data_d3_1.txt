Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_1

Context:
Two cars C1 and C2 are equipped with automatic parallel parking feature. Normally, cars with automatic parallel parking also have cruise control. If car C1 has cruise control, then driver D1 can relax during long drives. If driver D1 can relax during long drives, then passenger P1 falls asleep.

Question:
Can we conclude if passenger P1 does not fall asleep, then car C2 has cruise control?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Car : Type
axiom Driver : Type
axiom Passenger : Type

axiom C1 : Car
axiom C2 : Car
axiom D1 : Driver
axiom P1 : Passenger

axiom AutomaticParallelParking : Car → Prop
axiom CruiseControl : Car → Prop
axiom CanRelaxLongDrives : Driver → Prop
axiom FallsAsleep : Passenger → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom app_C1 : AutomaticParallelParking C1
axiom app_C2 : AutomaticParallelParking C2
axiom normal_rule : ∀ c : Car, AutomaticParallelParking c → CruiseControl c
axiom cc_C1_relax : CruiseControl C1 → CanRelaxLongDrives D1
axiom relax_sleep : CanRelaxLongDrives D1 → FallsAsleep P1

-- Goal: If P1 does not fall asleep, then C2 has cruise control.
