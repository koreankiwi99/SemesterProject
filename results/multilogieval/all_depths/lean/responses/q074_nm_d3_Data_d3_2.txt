Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_2

Context:
Trees and flowers are plants. Normally, plants with leaves undergo photosynthesis. If a plant receives sunlight, then it grows. If trees undergo photosynthesis, then forests are essential. Either plants have leaves or forests are not essential, or both.

Question:
If a plant does not grow, can we conclude that flowers undergo photosynthesis?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
From the premises:
- If all plants have leaves, then (since flowers are plants) flowers have leaves; with “plants with leaves undergo photosynthesis,” it follows that flowers undergo photosynthesis.
- But we only know the disjunction: either all plants have leaves or forests are not essential. If the second disjunct holds, we get no information about flowers’ photosynthesis.
- The additional premise “a plant does not grow” gives no link to leaves or photosynthesis (growth depends on sunlight, not vice versa), so it does not help to force the first disjunct.

Therefore, from “a plant does not grow,” we cannot conclude that flowers undergo photosynthesis.

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
Given:
- Trees and flowers are plants.
- Plants with leaves undergo photosynthesis.
- If a plant receives sunlight, then it grows.
- If trees undergo photosynthesis, then forests are essential.
- Either all plants have leaves or forests are not essential.

From “a plant does not grow,” we cannot force that all plants have leaves. Without that, we cannot conclude that flowers undergo photosynthesis. The growth premise depends on sunlight and gives no information about leaves or photosynthesis. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow.
