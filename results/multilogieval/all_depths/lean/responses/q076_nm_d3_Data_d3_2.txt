Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_2

Context:
Athletes and coaches are part of a team. Typically, team members show teamwork. If a player is selfless, then the team succeeds. If athletes show teamwork, then coaches provide guidance. Either players are selfless or coaches do not provide guidance, or both.

Question:
If a team does not succeed, can we conclude that athletes do not show teamwork?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Selfless : Prop
axiom TeamSucceeds : Prop
axiom AthletesShowTeamwork : Prop
axiom CoachesProvideGuidance : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom selfless_implies_success : Selfless → TeamSucceeds
axiom teamwork_implies_guidance : AthletesShowTeamwork → CoachesProvideGuidance
axiom selfless_or_not_guidance : Selfless ∨ ¬ CoachesProvideGuidance

-- Goal: If a team does not succeed, then athletes do not show teamwork.
theorem not_success_implies_not_teamwork : ¬ TeamSucceeds → ¬ AthletesShowTeamwork := by
  intro hNotSucc
  -- From ¬ success and (Selfless → Success), we get ¬ Selfless
  have hNotSelfless : ¬ Selfless := by
    intro hS
    exact hNotSucc (selfless_implies_success hS)
  -- From (Selfless ∨ ¬ Guidance) and ¬ Selfless, we get ¬ Guidance

    cases selfless_or_not_guidance with
    | inl hS =>
      exact False.elim (hNotSelfless hS)
    | inr hNG =>
      exact hNG
  -- From (AthletesTeamwork → Guidance) and ¬ Guidance, we get ¬ AthletesTeamwork
