Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_2

Context:
English and French are languages with alphabets. Generally, languages with alphabets have written scripts. If a person speaks English, then they might know Spanish. Either English has a written script or a person does not speak Spanish, or both.

Can we conclude if a person does not know Spanish, then French has a written script?
