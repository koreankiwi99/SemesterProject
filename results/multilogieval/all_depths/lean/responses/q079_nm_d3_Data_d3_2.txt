Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_2

Context:
Phones and laptops are electronic devices. Usually, devices with internet access can browse websites. If a device has a camera, then it can take photos. If phones can browse websites, then laptops have multiple functions. Either devices can browse websites or laptops do not have multiple functions, or both.

Question:
If a device cannot take photos, can we conclude that phones do not have internet access?

--- Iteration 2 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
We cannot conclude that phones do not have internet access. The premises do not connect “cannot take photos” to internet access for phones. A consistent scenario exists where some device cannot take photos while phones still have internet access (e.g., no device has a camera, so nothing can take photos; yet phones can still have internet). Therefore, the conclusion does not follow.
