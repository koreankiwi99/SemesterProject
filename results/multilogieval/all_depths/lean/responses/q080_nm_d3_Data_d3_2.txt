Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_2

Context:
Students and teachers like learning. Usually, individuals who like learning are curious. If a book is interesting, then it is engaging. If students are curious, then education is valuable. Either books are interesting or education is not valuable, or both.

Question:
If a book is not engaging, can we conclude that teachers are not curious?

--- Iteration 2 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: The premises entail that teachers like learning and that anyone who likes learning is curious. Therefore all teachers are curious, regardless of anything about books or education’s value. Hence, even if there exists a non-engaging book, we cannot conclude that teachers are not curious.

--- Iteration 3 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: From the premises, all teachers like learning and anyone who likes learning is curious. Therefore, all teachers are curious regardless of whether any book is engaging or not. So we cannot conclude that teachers are not curious from the existence of a non-engaging book.
