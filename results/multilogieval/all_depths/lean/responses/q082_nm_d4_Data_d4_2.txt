Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: d4_2

Context:
Assume apples and oranges are fruits of type R and they both are round. Typically, fruits of type R that are round are juicy. If a drink is cold, then it is refreshing. If a person Z exercises regularly, then Z is healthy. Either the drink that is cold is not refreshing or the person who exercises regularly is not healthy. If apple is juicy, then the drink is cold.

Question:
Can we conclude if the drink is refreshing then the orange is round?

-- Apples and oranges are fruits of type R and both are round
axiom FR_apple : FruitR apple
axiom FR_orange : FruitR orange
axiom Round_apple : Round apple
axiom Round_orange : Round orange

-- Typically, fruits of type R that are round are juicy
axiom Typical : ∀ x : Thing, FruitR x ∧ Round x → Juicy x

-- If a drink is cold, then it is refreshing
axiom cold_refresh : Cold drink → Refreshing drink

-- If a person Z exercises regularly, then Z is healthy
axiom exercise_healthy : Exercises z → Healthy z

-- Either the drink that is cold is not refreshing or the person who exercises regularly is not healthy
axiom disj : (Cold drink → ¬ Refreshing drink) ∨ (Exercises z → ¬ Healthy z)

-- If apple is juicy, then the drink is cold
axiom juicyApple_cold : Juicy apple → Cold drink

-- Goal: if the drink is refreshing then the orange is round
theorem conclusion : Refreshing drink → Round orange := by
