Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: d4_1

Context:
Red and Blue cars have sunroofs. Typically, cars with sunroofs have leather seats. If a vehicle is a convertible, it has a top that can be retracted. If a motorcycle has a sidecar, it can carry an additional passenger. Either a convertible has a retractable top or a motorcycle with a sidecar can carry an extra passenger or both. If a red car has leather seats, then a convertible has a retractable top.

Question:
Can we conclude if a vehicle does not have a retractable top then a blue car has leather seats?

-- Goal: If a vehicle does not have a retractable top, then a blue car has leather seats.
-- We prove the stronger result that BlueCar has leather seats unconditionally from the premises.
