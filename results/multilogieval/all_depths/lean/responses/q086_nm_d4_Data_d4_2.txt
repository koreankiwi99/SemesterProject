Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: d4_2

Context:
Assume X and Y are ingredients known to enhance flavor in dishes. Normally, ingredients that enhance flavor also add aroma. If ingredient Z is spicy, then ingredient Z adds heat to the dish. If ingredient W is a preservative, then ingredient W prolongs the shelf life of food. Either ingredient Z does not add heat or ingredient V is not aromatic. If ingredient X adds aroma, then ingredient V is also aromatic.

Question:
Can we conclude if ingredient Z adds heat to the dish, then ingredient Y adds aroma?

--- Iteration 2 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
- We know Y enhances flavor.
- All flavor-enhancing ingredients add aroma.
- Therefore, Y adds aroma unconditionally.
- Hence, “If Z adds heat, then Y adds aroma” is true because the consequent is already true.

STAGE 1 ANSWER: Yes

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
- Y enhances flavor.
- All flavor-enhancing ingredients add aroma.
- Therefore, Y adds aroma unconditionally.
- Thus, “If Z adds heat, then Y adds aroma” holds because the consequent is already true.
