Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: d4_1

Context:
Students and Teachers are individuals in a school. Typically, individuals in a school have books. If a Student studies hard, then the Student gets good grades. If a Teacher is knowledgeable, then the Teacher imparts useful information. Either a Student studies hard or a Teacher is knowledgeable. If a Student has books, then the Student is well-prepared.

Question:
Can we conclude if a Teacher does not impart useful information, then a Student does not have books?
