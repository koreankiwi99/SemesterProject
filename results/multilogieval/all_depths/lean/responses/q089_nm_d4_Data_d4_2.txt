Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: d4_2

Context:
Assume books and pens are items of category Q and they both are used for writing. Usually, items of category Q used for writing are stationery. If a movie is a comedy, then it makes people laugh. If a city has good public transport, then it is convenient. Either the comedy movie does not make people laugh or the city with good public transport is not convenient. If book is stationery, then the city has good public transport.

Question:
Can we conclude if the comedy movie makes people laugh then the pen is not used for writing?
