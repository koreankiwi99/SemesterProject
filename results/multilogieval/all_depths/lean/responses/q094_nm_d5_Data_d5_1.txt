Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
Coffee and Tea are beverages served in a cafe. Usually, beverages served in a cafe are hot. If Coffee is brewed, then it is aromatic. If Tea is steeped, then it can be sweetened. Either Coffee is brewed or Tea can be sweetened, or both. If Hot Chocolate can be sweetened, then Tea is steeped. If Espresso is hot, then Coffee is brewed.

Question:
Can we conclude if Hot Chocolate is not aromatic then Tea cannot be sweetened?
