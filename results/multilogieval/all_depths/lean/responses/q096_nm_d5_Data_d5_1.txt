Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
Books and Pens are items in a bookstore. Normally, items in a bookstore are available for purchase. If a Book is a bestseller, then it is displayed prominently. If a Pen is a fountain pen, then it has a refillable ink cartridge. Either a Book is a bestseller or a Pen has a refillable ink cartridge, or both. If a Notebook is available for purchase, then a Pen is a fountain pen. If a Planner is displayed prominently, then a Book is a bestseller.

Question:
Can we conclude if a Notebook is not a fountain pen then a Book is a bestseller?

open Item

-- Predicates
-- Available: items are available for purchase (we model this as always true)
def Available : Item → Prop := fun _ => True

-- If a Book is a bestseller, then it is displayed prominently.
-- If a Planner is displayed prominently, then a Book is a bestseller.
def Bestseller : Item → Prop := fun _ => False
def Displayed  : Item → Prop := fun _ => False

-- If a Pen is a fountain pen, then it has a refillable ink cartridge.
-- We model fountain-pen status to be true exactly for Pen.
def FountainPen : Item → Prop
| Item.pen      => True
| _             => False

def Refillable : Item → Prop := FountainPen

-- Premises hold in this model:

-- All items are available
theorem items_available (x : Item) : Available x := True.intro

-- If a Book is a bestseller, then it is displayed prominently.
theorem book_bestseller_implies_displayed : Bestseller book → Displayed book := by
  intro h; cases h

-- If a Pen is a fountain pen, then it has a refillable ink cartridge.
theorem pen_fountain_implies_refillable : FountainPen pen → Refillable pen := by
  intro h; exact h

-- Either a Book is a bestseller or a Pen has a refillable ink cartridge, or both.
theorem disj : Bestseller book ∨ Refillable pen := Or.inr True.intro

-- If a Notebook is available for purchase, then a Pen is a fountain pen.
theorem notebook_avail_implies_pen_fountain : Available notebook → FountainPen pen := by
  intro _; exact True.intro

-- If a Planner is displayed prominently, then a Book is a bestseller.
theorem planner_display_implies_book_bestseller : Displayed planner → Bestseller book := by
  intro h; cases h

-- Target statement from the question:
def target : Prop := (¬FountainPen notebook → Bestseller book)

-- We prove the negation of the target in this model (hence the conclusion does not follow).
theorem not_target : ¬target := by
  intro h
  -- ¬FountainPen notebook holds because FountainPen notebook = False in this model
  have A : ¬FountainPen notebook := by intro hfp; cases hfp
  -- From h and A we would get Bestseller book, which is False in this model, contradiction
  have hb : Bestseller book := h A
  cases hb
