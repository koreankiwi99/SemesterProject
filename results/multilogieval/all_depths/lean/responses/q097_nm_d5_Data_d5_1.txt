Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
Books and Pens are items in a bookstore. Normally, items in a bookstore are available for purchase. If a Book is a bestseller, then it is displayed prominently. If a Pen is a fountain pen, then it has a refillable ink cartridge. Either a Book is a bestseller or a Pen has a refillable ink cartridge, or both. If a Notebook is available for purchase, then a Pen is a fountain pen. If a Planner is displayed prominently, then a Book is a bestseller.

Question:
Can we conclude if a Notebook is not a fountain pen then a Book is not a bestseller?

axiom Item : Type
axiom Book : Item
axiom Pen : Item
axiom Notebook : Item
axiom Planner : Item

axiom Available : Item → Prop
axiom Bestseller : Item → Prop
axiom Displayed : Item → Prop
axiom FountainPen : Item → Prop
axiom Refillable : Item → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom book_bestseller_displayed : Bestseller Book → Displayed Book
axiom pen_fountain_refillable : FountainPen Pen → Refillable Pen
axiom book_or_pen_refillable : Bestseller Book ∨ Refillable Pen
axiom notebook_available_implies_pen_fountain : Available Notebook → FountainPen Pen
axiom planner_displayed_implies_book_bestseller : Displayed Planner → Bestseller Book

-- We cannot derive (¬FountainPen Notebook) → (¬Bestseller Book) from these premises alone.

-- Demonstration: if additionally Bestseller Book and ¬FountainPen Notebook hold,
-- then the negation of the target implication follows.
