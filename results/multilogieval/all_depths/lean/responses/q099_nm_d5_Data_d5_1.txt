Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
In a bakery, cakes and cookies are baked with care. Normally, baked goods prepared with care are delicious. If a dessert has chocolate frosting, and it is rich in flavor, customers enjoy it. If a pastry is made with buttery layers and it is flaky, customers find it appetizing. Customers enjoy either a dessert with chocolate frosting or a pastry with buttery layers, or both. If the chocolate cake is enjoyed by customers, then the buttery pastry is appetizing. If the cookie is delicious, then the chocolate cake is enjoyed by customers.

Question:
Can we conclude if the chocolate cake is not enjoyed by customers then the cookie is delicious?
