Logic Type: pl
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: HS

Context:
In football, if the offense gains 10 yards on a play, it results in a first down. Additionally, if the offense gets a first down, they get 4 more chances to advance the ball.

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Offense : Type
axiom TodayOffense : Offense

axiom Gains10 : Offense → Prop
axiom FirstDown : Offense → Prop
axiom FourMoreChances : Offense → Prop

-- Rules from the textual context
axiom rule_gain10_firstdown : ∀ o : Offense, Gains10 o → FirstDown o
axiom rule_firstdown_four : ∀ o : Offense, FirstDown o → FourMoreChances o

-- Fact about today's offense
axiom today_gained10 : Gains10 TodayOffense
