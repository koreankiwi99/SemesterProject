Context:
In a farm, cows that eat nutritious feed produce more milk. Also, cows that are vaccinated remain healthy. However, due to limited resources, the farmer must choose between feed and vaccines for the cows. The cows cannot have both nutritious feed and vaccines regularly. The cows can either eat nutritious feed or not remain healthy.

Question:
Does this mean that the cows on the farm either produce more milk or are not vaccinated?
