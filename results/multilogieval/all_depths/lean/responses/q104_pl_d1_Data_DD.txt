Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: DD

Context:
At a tech startup, the engineering team knows that if they add exciting new features, they will attract more users. Also, if they fix bugs quickly, they will improve user satisfaction. However, with limited resources, the team struggles. They often release updates that either don't attract new users or they have no user satisfaction.

Question:
Does this imply the engineering team either does not add exciting new features or does not fix bugs quickly?

LLM Response:

axiom Team : Type
axiom Engineering : Team

axiom AddsFeatures : Team → Prop
axiom AttractsUsers : Team → Prop
axiom FixesBugsQuickly : Team → Prop
axiom UserSatisfaction : Team → Prop

-- If they add exciting new features, they will attract more users.
axiom premise1 : AddsFeatures Engineering → AttractsUsers Engineering
-- If they fix bugs quickly, they will improve user satisfaction.
axiom premise2 : FixesBugsQuickly Engineering → UserSatisfaction Engineering
-- They often release updates that either don't attract new users or they have no user satisfaction.
axiom premise3 : ¬ AttractsUsers Engineering ∨ ¬ UserSatisfaction Engineering

-- Does this imply they either do not add exciting new features or do not fix bugs quickly?
theorem goal : ¬ AddsFeatures Engineering ∨ ¬ FixesBugsQuickly Engineering := by
  have c1 : ¬ AttractsUsers Engineering → ¬ AddsFeatures Engineering := by

    intro hAF
    exact hNA (premise1 hAF)
  have c2 : ¬ UserSatisfaction Engineering → ¬ FixesBugsQuickly Engineering := by
    intro hNS
    intro hFB
    exact hNS (premise2 hFB)
  exact Or.elim premise3 (fun hNA => Or.inl (c1 hNA)) (fun hNS => Or.inr (c2 hNS))
