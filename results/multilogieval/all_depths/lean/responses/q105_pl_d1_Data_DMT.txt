Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: DMT

Context:
In an art class, students were instructed to paint a still life scene with fruit. Despite the teacher's expectation, it was not true that both students used the appropriate brush techniques and mixed the correct paint colors.

Question:
Does it entail that either the students did not use the right brush techniques or did not mix the correct paint colors or both?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom UsedRightBrushTechniques : Prop
axiom MixedCorrectPaintColors : Prop

-- From the text: "it was not true that both students used the appropriate brush techniques and mixed the correct paint colors."
axiom premise : ¬ (UsedRightBrushTechniques ∧ MixedCorrectPaintColors)

-- Does it entail: either they did not use the right brush techniques or did not mix the correct paint colors (or both)?
theorem entailment : ¬ UsedRightBrushTechniques ∨ ¬ MixedCorrectPaintColors := by
  classical
  by_cases hBrush : UsedRightBrushTechniques
  · right
    intro hMix
    exact premise ⟨hBrush, hMix⟩
  · left
    exact hBrush
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
