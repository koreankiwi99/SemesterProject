Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: BD

Context:
The student knows if he studies more, he will get high marks on the test. And if he gets enough sleep, his mind will be sharp. But he has so much material to review that he must sacrifice sleep. He can either study thoroughly or not keep his mind sharp.

Question:
Does this lead to the conclusion that the student will either get high marks or does not get enough sleep?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom StudyMore : Prop
axiom EnoughSleep : Prop
axiom MindSharp : Prop
axiom HighMarks : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom h1 : StudyMore → HighMarks            -- If he studies more, he will get high marks.
axiom h2 : EnoughSleep → MindSharp           -- If he gets enough sleep, his mind will be sharp.
axiom h3 : ¬ EnoughSleep                     -- He must sacrifice sleep (so not enough sleep).
axiom h4 : StudyMore ∨ ¬ MindSharp           -- He can either study thoroughly or not keep his mind sharp.

-- Conclusion: the student will either get high marks or does not get enough sleep.
theorem conclusion : HighMarks ∨ ¬ EnoughSleep := by
  exact Or.inr h3
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
