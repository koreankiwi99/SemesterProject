Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: DD

Context:
At a busy hospital, Dr. Jones knows that if she thoroughly reviews patient charts, she will provide accurate diagnoses. Also, if she orders the right lab tests, she will recommend effective treatment plans. However, with many patients to see each day, Dr. Jones struggles to find time. She often finds herself providing either inaccurate diagnoses or ineffective treatments.

Question:
Does this imply that Dr. Jones either does not thoroughly review patient charts or does not order the right lab tests?

theorem dr_jones_reasoning
  (ThoroughReview AccurateDiagnosis OrdersRightTests EffectiveTreatment : Prop)
  (h1 : ThoroughReview → AccurateDiagnosis)
  (h2 : OrdersRightTests → EffectiveTreatment)
  (h3 : ¬AccurateDiagnosis ∨ ¬EffectiveTreatment)
  : (¬ThoroughReview ∨ ¬OrdersRightTests) := by
  cases h3 with

      apply Or.inl
      intro r
      exact na (h1 r)
  | inr ne =>
      apply Or.inr
      intro t
      exact ne (h2 t)
