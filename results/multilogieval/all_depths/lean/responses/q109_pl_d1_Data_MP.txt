Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: MP

Context:
If Jenny gets enough sleep, she is usually energetic and focused throughout the day. Last night, Jenny made sure to get to bed early and got a full 8 hours of rest. Jenny got adequate sleep.

Question:
Is Jenny energetic and focused today?

Lean Verification:
  Success: False
  Errors:
    - Function expected at
  UsuallyEnergeticAndFocused p
but this term has type
  Prop

Note: Expected a function because this term is being applied to the argument
  lemma
    - unexpected token ':'; expected command
    - Unknown identifier `enough_jenny`

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
From the text: If Jenny gets enough sleep, she is usually energetic and focused. She did get adequate sleep (indeed, went to bed early and slept 8 hours). “Usually” is a hedge and does not entail certainty. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that she is energetic and focused today.

STAGE 2 ANSWER: No

No Lean code found.

--- Iteration 3 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
From the premises: If Jenny gets enough sleep, she is usually energetic and focused. She went to bed early, slept 8 hours, and (explicitly) got adequate sleep. Adequate sleep implies enough sleep via the given rules. However, “usually” does not entail certainty. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that she is energetic and focused today.
