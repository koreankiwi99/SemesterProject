Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: HS_MP

Context:
Jenny wanted to launch a mobile app startup. She decided to enroll in an intensive coding bootcamp so she could learn new programming languages. Jenny knew that with these new coding skills, she would be able to build a mobile app herself.

Question:
If Jenny takes a coding bootcamp, will she build a mobile app?
