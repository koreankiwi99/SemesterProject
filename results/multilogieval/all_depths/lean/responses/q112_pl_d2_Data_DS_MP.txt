Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DS_MP

Context:
A farmer was growing maize on his land. He knew that if the crop was watered sufficiently, it would have a high yield. However, pests can sometimes attack and damage crops. The farmer's wife believed that either the crop was watered sufficiently or there were no pest attacks or both.

Question:
If there were pests attacking the crop, does this mean it had a high yield?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Watered : Prop
axiom HighYield : Prop
axiom Pests : Prop

-- If the crop was watered sufficiently, it would have a high yield.
axiom premise1 : Watered → HighYield

-- Either the crop was watered sufficiently or there were no pest attacks (or both).
axiom premise2 : Watered ∨ ¬ Pests

-- If there were pests attacking the crop, then it had a high yield.
theorem goal : Pests → HighYield := by
  intro hp
  cases premise2 with
  | inl hw =>
      exact premise1 hw
  | inr hnp =>
      exact False.elim (hnp hp)
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
