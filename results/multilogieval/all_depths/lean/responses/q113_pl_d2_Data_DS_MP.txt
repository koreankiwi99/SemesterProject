Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DS_MP

Context:
Mark was driving down a steep hill when he had to stop suddenly. He knew if his tires had good tread, his car would stop safely. But he was also relying on his brakes to work properly. Mark's passenger thought either the tires had good tread, or the brakes worked fine, or both.

Question:
If the brakes were not working, does this mean the car stopped safely?

namespace Scenario

/-
Propositions:
- GoodTread: the tires have good tread
- BrakesWorking: the brakes are working properly
- SafeStop: the car stops safely
Premises:
1) If the tires have good tread, the car stops safely.
2) Either the tires have good tread or the brakes are working.
Goal:
If the brakes are not working, then the car stops safely.
