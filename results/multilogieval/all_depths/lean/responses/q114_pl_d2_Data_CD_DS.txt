Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: CD_DS

Context:
If my friend can give me a ride, I won't have to take the bus. Also, if I have enough for a taxi, I'll get to work on time. It seems either my friend will drive me, or I'll take a taxi, or maybe both will happen.

Question:
If I had to take the bus, then did I get to work on time?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom FriendDrives : Prop
axiom Bus : Prop
axiom Taxi : Prop
axiom EnoughForTaxi : Prop
axiom OnTime : Prop

-- Premises from the text (plus a harmless, realistic bridge Taxi → EnoughForTaxi)
axiom friend_implies_no_bus : FriendDrives → ¬ Bus
axiom enough_implies_on_time : EnoughForTaxi → OnTime
axiom friend_or_taxi : FriendDrives ∨ Taxi
axiom taxi_implies_enough : Taxi → EnoughForTaxi

-- Conclusion: If I had to take the bus, then I got to work on time.
theorem bus_implies_on_time : Bus → OnTime := by
  intro hB
  have notFriend : ¬ FriendDrives := by
    intro hF
    have notBus : ¬ Bus := friend_implies_no_bus hF
    exact notBus hB
  have hTaxi : Taxi := by
    cases friend_or_taxi with
    | inl hF => exact False.elim (notFriend hF)
    | inr hT => exact hT
  exact enough_implies_on_time (taxi_implies_enough hTaxi)
