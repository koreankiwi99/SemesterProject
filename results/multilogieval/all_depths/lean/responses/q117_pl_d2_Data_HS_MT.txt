Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: HS_MT

Context:
Jeff wanted to gain more strength so he could lift heavier weights. He learned that if he followed a consistent workout routine, he would steadily gain strength over time. And if he gained enough strength, Jeff knew he could lift heavier weights in his workouts.

Question:
If Jeff cannot lift heavier weights, then does he follow a workout routine?

LLM Response:
<lean>
-- We model Jeff's situation with propositional variables about Jeff.
def FollowsRoutine : Prop := False
def GainsSteadily : Prop := False
def GainsEnough : Prop := False
def CanLiftHeavier : Prop := False

-- Premises from the text:
-- 1) If he follows a consistent workout routine, he steadily gains strength.
theorem routine_implies_gain : FollowsRoutine → GainsSteadily := by
  intro h
  exact False.elim h

-- 2) If he gains enough strength, he can lift heavier weights.
theorem enough_implies_lift : GainsEnough → CanLiftHeavier := by
  intro h
  exact False.elim h

-- A derivable fact: If he cannot lift heavier weights, then he did not gain enough strength.
theorem not_lift_implies_not_enough : ¬CanLiftHeavier → ¬GainsEnough := by
  intro hnotL
  intro hEnough
  have hLift : CanLiftHeavier := enough_implies_lift hEnough
  exact hnotL hLift

-- The question asks: does (¬CanLiftHeavier) → FollowsRoutine hold?
-- We show the negation of that implication holds in this model, hence the implication is not valid.
theorem negate_question : ¬((¬CanLiftHeavier) → FollowsRoutine) := by
  -- Since CanLiftHeavier is False by definition, ¬CanLiftHeavier is provable.
  have hNotLift : ¬CanLiftHeavier := by
    intro h
    exact h
  -- Assume the implication and derive a contradiction (a proof of False).
  intro hImp
  have hFR : FollowsRoutine := hImp hNotLift
  -- But FollowsRoutine is False by definition, so this is a contradiction.
  exact hFR
