Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DD_DS

Context:
If Amy practiced piano daily, she will excel at her recital. If Amy is very talented, she will play beautifully. However, either Amy won't excel at her recital or she won't play beautifully, or maybe Amy won't excel at her recital and won't play beautifully.

Question:
If Amy practiced piano daily, is Amy very talented?

-- Entities and predicates
axiom Practiced : Prop        -- Amy practiced piano daily
axiom Talented : Prop         -- Amy is very talented
axiom Excels : Prop           -- Amy will excel at her recital
axiom Beautiful : Prop        -- Amy will play beautifully

-- Premises from the textual context
axiom h1 : Practiced → Excels              -- If Amy practiced daily, she will excel.
axiom h2 : Talented → Beautiful            -- If Amy is very talented, she will play beautifully.
axiom h3 : ¬Excels ∨ ¬Beautiful            -- Either she won't excel or she won't play beautifully (or both).

-- The question (informal): If Amy practiced piano daily, is Amy very talented?
-- That would be the statement: Practiced → Talented.
-- We cannot prove that, but we can prove the stronger contrary conditional: Practiced → ¬Talented.

--- Iteration 2 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
- If Amy practiced, then she excels.
- If she is talented, then she plays beautifully.
- Either she does not excel or she does not play beautifully.
Assume Amy practiced. Then she excels. Given the disjunction, it must be that she does not play beautifully. But if she were talented, she would play beautifully. Hence, under the assumption that she practiced, she is not talented. Therefore, the answer to “If Amy practiced, is Amy very talented?” is No.

STAGE 1 ANSWER: No

STAGE 2: [Lean code in <lean></lean> tags]

-- Propositions representing the statements about Amy
axiom Practiced : Prop        -- Amy practiced piano daily
axiom Talented : Prop         -- Amy is very talented
axiom Excels : Prop           -- Amy will excel at her recital
axiom Beautiful : Prop        -- Amy will play beautifully

-- Premises from the textual context
axiom h1 : Practiced → Excels              -- If Amy practiced daily, she will excel.
axiom h2 : Talented → Beautiful            -- If Amy is very talented, she will play beautifully.
axiom h3 : ¬Excels ∨ ¬Beautiful            -- Either she won't excel or she won't play beautifully (or both).

-- We cannot prove Practiced → Talented. Instead, we can derive Practiced → ¬Talented.

STAGE 2 ANSWER: No

No Lean code found.

--- Iteration 3 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
Assume Amy practiced. Then she excels. Given either not excels or not beautiful, and since she excels, it follows she is not beautiful. If she were talented, she would be beautiful. Thus, under the assumption that she practiced, she is not talented. Therefore, the answer to “If Amy practiced, is Amy very talented?” is No.
