Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DD_DS

Context:
If it's Friday, my friends and I will go out to dinner. If I finished all my work this week, I'll relax this weekend. However, either my friends and I won't go out to dinner or I won't relax this weekend, or maybe we won't go out and I won't relax.

Question:
If it's Friday, did I finish all my work this week?

Lean Verification:
  Success: False
  Errors:
    - Function expected at
  ¬D ∧ ¬R
but this term has type
  Prop

Note: Expected a function because this term is being applied to the argument

    - unexpected token ':'; expected command
    - Unknown identifier `not_F_and_W`

--- Iteration 2 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
Let F = it's Friday, D = we go out to dinner, W = I finished all my work, R = I relax. Premises: F → D, W → R, and ¬D ∨ ¬R (the third sentence implies at least one of D or R fails). If both F and W held, then D and R would both hold, contradicting ¬D ∨ ¬R. Hence ¬(F ∧ W), so F → ¬W. Therefore, if it's Friday, I did not finish all my work this week.

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
Let F = it's Friday, D = we go out to dinner, W = I finished all my work, R = I relax.
Premises: F → D, W → R, and (¬D ∨ ¬R) ∨ (¬D ∧ ¬R). From the third, we get ¬D ∨ ¬R. If both F and W held, then D and R would follow, contradicting ¬D ∨ ¬R. Hence ¬(F ∧ W), so F → ¬W. Therefore, if it's Friday, I did not finish all my work this week.
