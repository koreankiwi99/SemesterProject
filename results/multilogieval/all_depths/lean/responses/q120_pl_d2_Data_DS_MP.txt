Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DS_MP

Context:
Jenny was struggling in math class, so her parents enrolled her in tutoring sessions. They knew if Jenny attended the tutoring, her grades would likely improve. However, the effectiveness of the tutoring itself was also a factor. Jenny's teacher thought that either the tutoring was high quality, or Jenny attended regularly, or both were true.

Question:
If the tutoring was not high quality, does this mean Jenny's grades improved?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom HighQualityTutoring : Prop
axiom AttendedRegularly : Prop
axiom GradesImproved : Prop

axiom attend_improves : AttendedRegularly → GradesImproved
axiom teacher_belief : HighQualityTutoring ∨ AttendedRegularly

theorem grades_improved_if_not_high_quality : ¬ HighQualityTutoring → GradesImproved := by
  intro notHQ
