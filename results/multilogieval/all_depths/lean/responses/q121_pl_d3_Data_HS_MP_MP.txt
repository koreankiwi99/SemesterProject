<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Amy : Person

axiom PracticesRegularly : Person → Prop
axiom ImprovedSkills : Person → Prop
axiom PerformsWellInGames : Person → Prop
axiom TeamWinsMoreMatches : Person → Prop

axiom practice_improves : PracticesRegularly Amy → ImprovedSkills Amy
axiom improved_perform : ImprovedSkills Amy → PerformsWellInGames Amy
axiom perform_teamwins : PerformsWellInGames Amy → TeamWinsMoreMatches Amy

theorem amy_practice_team_wins_more :
