Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS

Context:
Last night we experienced some unusual weather. If the electricity goes out, the room becomes dark. If the room is dark, we light candles to see. If it starts raining, the streets get wet from the rain. Last night, either the electricity went out, it started raining, or both things happened.

Question:
If we did not light any candles, did the streets get wet?
