Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: DMT_CO_MT

Context:
Whenever Kate feels stressed, she meditates. Kate also exercises when feeling anxious. Relaxation techniques and physical activity help manage stress.

Question:
Either Kate did not meditate or she did not exercise. Was Kate feeling stressed?

axiom Person : Type
axiom Kate : Person

axiom Stressed : Person → Prop
axiom Anxious : Person → Prop
axiom Meditates : Person → Prop
axiom Exercises : Person → Prop

-- Premises from the text
-- 1) Whenever Kate feels stressed, she meditates.
axiom stressed_implies_meditates : Stressed Kate → Meditates Kate
-- 2) Kate also exercises when feeling anxious.
axiom anxious_implies_exercises : Anxious Kate → Exercises Kate
-- 3) Either Kate did not meditate or she did not exercise.
axiom not_meditates_or_not_exercises : ¬ Meditates Kate ∨ ¬ Exercises Kate

-- What we can derive from the given information:
-- From (Stressed → Meditates) and (¬Meditates ∨ ¬Exercises),
-- we can conclude (¬Stressed ∨ ¬Exercises), but not Stressed.
