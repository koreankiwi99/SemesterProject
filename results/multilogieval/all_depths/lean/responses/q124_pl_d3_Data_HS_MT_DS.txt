Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS

Context:
Laura has dreamed of attending a prestigious music school. She learned that if she practices piano daily, her skills will steadily improve. Laura knows that gaining proficiency in piano could help her get accepted into the music program. While Laura spends hours each day on the piano, she also enjoys taking voice lessons during her free time. It's clear that Laura either devotes time to honing her piano skills, or focuses on developing her vocal talents, if not both.

Question:
If Laura does not get accepted into music school, does she take voice lessons?
