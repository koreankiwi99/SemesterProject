Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS

Context:
Chris decided to learn to code by practicing every day. He found that daily coding helped him build programming skills. Chris knew if he built up these skills, he could create complex web apps. Whether Chris codes daily, solves coding challenges to practice, or does both, his skills will grow.

Question:
If Chris does not create web apps, does he solve coding challenges?

LLM Response:
<lean>
-- Entities as propositions about Chris
axiom CodesDaily : Prop
axiom SolvesChallenges : Prop
axiom SkillsGrow : Prop
axiom CreatesWebApps : Prop

-- Premises from the text
-- 1) Daily coding helps build programming skills.
axiom daily_implies_skills : CodesDaily → SkillsGrow
-- 2) Whether Chris codes daily, solves coding challenges, or both, his skills will grow.
axiom practice_implies_skills : CodesDaily ∨ SolvesChallenges → SkillsGrow
-- 3) If he builds up these skills, he could create complex web apps.
axiom skills_implies_webapps : SkillsGrow → CreatesWebApps

-- Consequences derivable from the premises

-- If Chris does not create web apps, then he does not solve coding challenges.
theorem not_webapps_implies_not_challenges : ¬ CreatesWebApps → ¬ SolvesChallenges := by
  intro hNotW
  intro hChallenges
  have hSkills : SkillsGrow := practice_implies_skills (Or.inr hChallenges)
  have hW : CreatesWebApps := skills_implies_webapps hSkills
  exact hNotW hW

-- Also, if Chris does not create web apps, then he does not code daily.
theorem not_webapps_implies_not_daily : ¬ CreatesWebApps → ¬ CodesDaily := by
  intro hNotW
  intro hDaily
  have hSkills : SkillsGrow := daily_implies_skills hDaily
  have hW : CreatesWebApps := skills_implies_webapps hSkills
