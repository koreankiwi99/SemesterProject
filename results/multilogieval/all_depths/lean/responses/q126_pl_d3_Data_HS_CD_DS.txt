Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS

Context:
It was an eventful Saturday in town. If it is the weekend, the mall gets very crowded as people have free time to shop. If the mall is crowded, there tend to be long lines at the registers. Also, yesterday was payday at many jobs. If it's payday, people have some extra money to spend. Today, either it was the weekend, or it was payday yesterday, or both things occurred.

Question:
If there were no long lines, did people have money to spend?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Weekend : Prop
axiom Crowded : Prop
axiom LongLines : Prop
axiom Payday : Prop
axiom HasMoney : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom weekend_implies_crowded : Weekend → Crowded
axiom crowded_implies_longlines : Crowded → LongLines
axiom payday_implies_money : Payday → HasMoney
axiom payday_happened : Payday
axiom weekend_or_payday : Weekend ∨ Payday

-- Goal: If there were no long lines, did people have money to spend?
-- Since payday happened and payday implies having money, the answer is yes regardless of lines.
theorem no_long_lines_implies_money : (¬ LongLines) → HasMoney := by
  intro _
  exact payday_implies_money payday_happened
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
