Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: DD_DS_MT

Context:
Alex needs gas in his car to drive to work and a clear schedule to meet friends for dinner. If the car has gas, Alex can drive to work. If Alex's schedule is clear after work, he'll meet friends for dinner. Either he won't drive to work or he won't meet for dinner, or maybe neither. Alex checks his calendar to see what day it is. He knows that if it's Friday, his schedule is clear after work.

Question:
If the car has gas in the tank, is it Friday?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Gas : Prop
axiom Drive : Prop
axiom Clear : Prop
axiom Meet : Prop
axiom Friday : Prop

-- Premises from the text:
-- 1) Alex needs gas to drive to work.
axiom need_gas_to_drive : Drive → Gas
-- 2) If the car has gas, Alex can drive to work.
axiom gas_implies_drive : Gas → Drive
-- 3) Alex needs a clear schedule to meet friends for dinner.
axiom need_clear_to_meet : Meet → Clear
-- 4) If Alex's schedule is clear after work, he'll meet friends for dinner.
axiom clear_implies_meet : Clear → Meet
-- 5) Either he won't drive to work or he won't meet for dinner (or both).
axiom not_both : ¬Drive ∨ ¬Meet
-- 6) If it's Friday, his schedule is clear after work.
axiom friday_implies_clear : Friday → Clear

-- From these, we can derive: If the car has gas, then it is not Friday.
theorem gas_implies_not_friday : Gas → ¬Friday := by
  intro g
  have d : Drive := gas_implies_drive g
  have nm : ¬Meet :=
    Or.elim not_both
      (fun nd : ¬Drive => False.elim (nd d))
      (fun nm : ¬Meet => nm)
  have nc : ¬Clear := by
    intro c
    exact nm (clear_implies_meet c)
  have nf : ¬Friday := by
    intro f
    exact nc (friday_implies_clear f)
  exact nf
