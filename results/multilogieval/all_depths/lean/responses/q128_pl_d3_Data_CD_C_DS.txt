Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS

Context:
I have some plans for my day off today. If the package with my new bookshelf arrives today, I'll start building it. But if my friend asks me to help them move, I'll spend the day helping them instead. It seems either my package will arrive, or my friend will need help, or perhaps both will happen.

Question:
If I didn't spend the day helping my friend, then did I start building my new bookshelf?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom PackageArrives : Prop
axiom Build : Prop
axiom FriendAsks : Prop
axiom Help : Prop

axiom hPackageImpliesBuild : PackageArrives → Build
axiom hAskImpliesHelp : FriendAsks → Help
axiom hArriveOrAsk : PackageArrives ∨ FriendAsks

theorem started_building_if_not_helping : (¬Help) → Build := by
  intro notH
  have notM : ¬FriendAsks := by
    intro m
    exact notH (hAskImpliesHelp m)
  have p : PackageArrives := Or.resolve_right hArriveOrAsk notM
  exact hPackageImpliesBuild p
</lean>
