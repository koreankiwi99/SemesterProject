Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: DMT_CO_MT

Context:
Whenever Mark gets a flat tire, he changes it himself. Also, if Mark gets a flat, he calls roadside assistance. Being self-reliant and seeking help when needed are useful skills when dealing with car troubles.

Question:
Either Mark did not change the tire himself, or he did not call for assistance. Did Mark get a flat tire?

Iterations:

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
-- Propositions representing Mark's situation
axiom Flat : Prop
axiom Changed : Prop
axiom Called : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom h1 : Flat → Changed
axiom h2 : Flat → Called
axiom h3 : ¬Changed ∨ ¬Called

-- Conclusion: Mark did not get a flat tire
theorem not_Flat : ¬Flat := by
  cases h3 with
  | inl hNotChanged =>
      exact (fun f => hNotChanged (h1 f))
  | inr hNotCalled =>
      exact (fun f => hNotCalled (h2 f))
</lean>
