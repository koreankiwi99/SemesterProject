Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_DS_MT_MT

Context:
It was Saturday afternoon. Jane knew if it is the weekend, then the cafe she likes is busy. Jane also wanted to go shopping today. If Jane goes shopping, the mall will be crowded. Either it is the weekend, or the mall is not crowded, or it is the weekend and the mall is not crowded. She also knows if she has free time, then she goes shopping. If Jane finished her work early, then she has free time.

Question:
If the cafe is not busy, then did Jane finish her work early?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Weekend : Prop
axiom CafeBusy : Prop
axiom Shopping : Prop
axiom MallCrowded : Prop
axiom FreeTime : Prop
axiom FinishedEarly : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom weekend_true : Weekend
axiom weekend_implies_busy : Weekend → CafeBusy
axiom shopping_implies_crowded : Shopping → MallCrowded
axiom disj : Weekend ∨ ¬MallCrowded ∨ (Weekend ∧ ¬MallCrowded)
axiom free_implies_shopping : FreeTime → Shopping
axiom finished_implies_free : FinishedEarly → FreeTime

-- Goal: If the cafe is not busy, then Jane finished her work early.
theorem cafe_not_busy_implies_finished_early : (¬ CafeBusy) → FinishedEarly := by
  intro hnot
  have busy : CafeBusy := weekend_implies_busy weekend_true
  have contra : False := hnot busy
  exact False.elim contra
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
