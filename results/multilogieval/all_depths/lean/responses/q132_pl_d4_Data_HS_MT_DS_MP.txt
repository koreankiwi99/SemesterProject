Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP

Context:
Emily adopted a high-energy puppy that needed a lot of activity. She learned that if she walked her dog every day, he would get more exercise and burn off excess energy. And if the dog got enough exercise, he would behave better instead of being restless. Emily made sure to either walk her dog daily or play fetch in the yard, or both, to meet her pup's needs. If Emily played fetch, then the dog really enjoyed this fun game.

Question:
The dog does not behave better. Then does he enjoy playing fetch?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom WalkDaily : Prop
axiom PlayFetch : Prop
axiom EnoughExercise : Prop
axiom BehavesBetter : Prop
axiom EnjoysFetch : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom walk_gives_enough : WalkDaily → EnoughExercise
axiom enough_improves_behavior : EnoughExercise → BehavesBetter
axiom walk_or_fetch : WalkDaily ∨ PlayFetch
axiom fetch_enjoyed : PlayFetch → EnjoysFetch

-- Given: The dog does not behave better
axiom not_behave_better : ¬BehavesBetter

theorem enjoys_fetch : EnjoysFetch := by
  have not_enough : ¬EnoughExercise := by
    intro e
    exact not_behave_better (enough_improves_behavior e)
  have not_walk : ¬WalkDaily := by
    intro w
    exact not_enough (walk_gives_enough w)
  have pf : PlayFetch := by
    cases walk_or_fetch with
    | inl w => exact False.elim (not_walk w)
    | inr f => exact f
  exact fetch_enjoyed pf
