Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: I_MT_DMT_DS

Context:
The teacher mentioned that if students complete all the homework assignments, then if they study hard before the test, they will score high marks.

Question:
The students studied hard before the test. The students did not score high marks. Did the students complete all the homework assignments?

LLM Response:
<lean>
-- Propositional encoding:
-- C: students completed all homework assignments
-- S: students studied hard before the test
-- H: students scored high marks

axiom C : Prop
axiom S : Prop
axiom H : Prop

-- Premises from the text:
-- 1) If students complete all homework, then if they study hard, they will score high marks.
axiom premise1 : C → (S → H)
-- 2) The students studied hard.
axiom premise2 : S
-- 3) The students did not score high marks.
axiom premise3 : ¬ H

-- From the premises, we can derive that the students did NOT complete all the homework.
theorem not_completed : ¬ C := by
  intro hc
  have sh : S → H := premise1 hc
  have hh : H := sh premise2
  exact premise3 hh
</lean>
ANSWER: No
