Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS_MP

Context:
It was a stormy Saturday afternoon. If it is raining, the soccer game gets canceled. When the game is canceled, the kids get disappointed. In this neighborhood, sometimes the electricity goes out during storms. If the power goes out, the TV won't turn on. Today, either it was raining, or the electricity went out, or both things happened. When the TV won't turn on, the family likes to play board games together instead.

Question:
If the kids were not disappointed, did the family play board games?
