Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP

Context:
The ACME Factory knew that if they increased production, they would need to hire more workers. Meanwhile, the parent company was preparing to release a new product. The CEO knew that if they released a new product, then their stock price would likely increase. Either the factory increased production, or the stock price did not increase. The CFO was sure that if more workers were hired, the work will be done quickly for the next cycle.

Question:
The company released a new product. Will the work be quick for next cycle?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom IncreasedProduction : Prop
axiom MoreWorkersHired : Prop
axiom NewProduct : Prop
axiom StockIncreased : Prop
axiom WorkQuickNextCycle : Prop

-- Premises translated from the text
-- If they increased production, they would hire more workers.
axiom premise1 : IncreasedProduction → MoreWorkersHired
-- If they released a new product, then stock price would increase.
axiom premise2 : NewProduct → StockIncreased
-- Either the factory increased production, or the stock price did not increase.
axiom premise3 : IncreasedProduction ∨ ¬ StockIncreased
-- If more workers were hired, the work will be done quickly for the next cycle.
axiom premise4 : MoreWorkersHired → WorkQuickNextCycle
-- The company released a new product.
axiom premise5 : NewProduct

theorem goal : WorkQuickNextCycle := by
  -- From new product, stock increased.
  have hStock : StockIncreased := premise2 premise5
  -- From the disjunction and hStock, conclude increased production.
  have hIncProd : IncreasedProduction := by
    cases premise3 with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr h =>
        exact False.elim (h hStock)
  -- Then more workers were hired, hence work will be quick.
  exact premise4 (premise1 hIncProd)
