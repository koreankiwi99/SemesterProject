Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_DS_MT_MT

Context:
The team was training intensely this week. They knew that if they are training hard, they will be prepared for the upcoming game. The coach also scheduled extra practices recently. If the coach scheduled extra practices, the players are putting in more hours. Either the team is training hard, or the players are not putting in more hours, or the team is training hard but the players are not putting in more hours. We know that if it is a very important match this weekend, then the coach scheduled extra practices. It's true that if the team lost their last game, then this weekend's match is very important.

Question:
If the team will not be prepared for the game, then did the team lose their last game?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom TrainingHard : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop
axiom ExtraPractices : Prop
axiom MoreHours : Prop
axiom VeryImportantMatch : Prop
axiom LostLastGame : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom prem_TH_true : TrainingHard
axiom prem_TH_imp_P : TrainingHard → Prepared
axiom prem_EP_true : ExtraPractices
axiom prem_EP_imp_MH : ExtraPractices → MoreHours
axiom prem_disj : TrainingHard ∨ ¬MoreHours ∨ (TrainingHard ∧ ¬MoreHours)
axiom prem_VIM_imp_EP : VeryImportantMatch → ExtraPractices
axiom prem_LLG_imp_VIM : LostLastGame → VeryImportantMatch

-- Goal: If the team will not be prepared for the game, then the team lost their last game.
