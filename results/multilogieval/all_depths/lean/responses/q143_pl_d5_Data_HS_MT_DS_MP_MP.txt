Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Carol decided to adopt a puppy, hoping for a loving companion in her life. She realized that having a devoted pet would make her feel less lonely. Whether Carol adopted the puppy, or joined a local hiking group, or did both, she hoped these steps would enrich her life. If Carol joined a hiking group, it would allow her to meet and make new friends. And making new connections would lead to an improved social life for Carol.

Question:
If Carol does not feel less lonely, then has her social life improved?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom AdoptedPuppy : Prop
axiom JoinedHikingGroup : Prop
axiom FeelsLessLonely : Prop
axiom MadeNewConnections : Prop
axiom SocialLifeImproved : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom adopted : AdoptedPuppy                                 -- Carol decided to adopt a puppy (modeled as adoption)
axiom adopt_implies_less_lonely : AdoptedPuppy → FeelsLessLonely
axiom join_implies_connections : JoinedHikingGroup → MadeNewConnections
axiom connections_improve_social : MadeNewConnections → SocialLifeImproved

-- Question: If Carol does not feel less lonely, then has her social life improved?
theorem query : (¬ FeelsLessLonely) → SocialLifeImproved := by
  intro not_less
  have less : FeelsLessLonely := adopt_implies_less_lonely adopted
  have contra : False := not_less less
  exact False.elim contra
