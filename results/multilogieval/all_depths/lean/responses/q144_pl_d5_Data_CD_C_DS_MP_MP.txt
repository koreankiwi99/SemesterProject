Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
At the end of a long workday, Sam considers how to spend his evening. If Sam has free time after work, he goes to the gym to workout. Also, if Sam's friend asks him to meet up, Sam gets coffee with him instead. It seems either Sam will have free time or his friend will want to meet up, maybe both. When Sam works out after work, it helps relieve stress from his job. And when Sam relieves stress from work, he gets good endorphins after his gym session.

Question:
If Sam did not get coffee with his friend, then did he get good endorphins after a workout?
