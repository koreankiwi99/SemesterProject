Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Dan wanted to get in better shape. He decided to start a new workout routine to become more active. Dan knew being active regularly would help him gain strength and energy. Whether Dan started a workout routine or made healthy meal plans, he was taking steps to improve his health. If Dan planned healthy meals, he would start eating a more nutritious diet. Eating well combined with exercise meant Dan could achieve his fitness goals.

Question:
If Dan does not gain strength and energy, then does he achieve his fitness goals?

axiom Person : Type
axiom Dan : Person

-- Predicates
axiom StartWorkoutRoutine : Person → Prop
axiom Active : Person → Prop
axiom GainStrengthEnergy : Person → Prop
axiom StepsImproveHealth : Person → Prop
axiom PlannedHealthyMeals : Person → Prop
axiom EatNutritiousDiet : Person → Prop
axiom Exercise : Person → Prop
axiom AchieveFitnessGoals : Person → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom decided_start : StartWorkoutRoutine Dan
-- "He decided to start a new workout routine to become more active."
axiom start_implies_active : ∀ p : Person, StartWorkoutRoutine p → Active p
-- "Being active regularly would help him gain strength and energy."
axiom active_implies_gain : ∀ p : Person, Active p → GainStrengthEnergy p
-- "Whether Dan started a workout routine or made healthy meal plans, he was taking steps to improve his health."
axiom start_implies_steps : ∀ p : Person, StartWorkoutRoutine p → StepsImproveHealth p
axiom plan_implies_steps : ∀ p : Person, PlannedHealthyMeals p → StepsImproveHealth p
-- "If Dan planned healthy meals, he would start eating a more nutritious diet."
axiom plan_implies_nutrition : ∀ p : Person, PlannedHealthyMeals p → EatNutritiousDiet p
-- Starting a workout routine implies he exercises (linking workout to exercise).
axiom start_implies_exercise : ∀ p : Person, StartWorkoutRoutine p → Exercise p
-- "Eating well combined with exercise meant Dan could achieve his fitness goals."
axiom eating_and_exercise_implies_goal :
  ∀ p : Person, EatNutritiousDiet p ∧ Exercise p → AchieveFitnessGoals p

-- Goal: If Dan does not gain strength and energy, then he achieves his fitness goals.
-- We can derive that Dan gains strength and energy from the given premises,
-- so from ¬GainStrengthEnergy Dan we obtain a contradiction and hence any conclusion.
