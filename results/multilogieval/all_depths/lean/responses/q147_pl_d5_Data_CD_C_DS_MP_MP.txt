Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Context:
Amy woke up eager to make plans for the beautiful day. If the weather is nice, she will go on a hike. Also, if Amy has no pressing work deadlines, she will take the day off. It seems either the weather will be nice or Amy will have no deadlines, maybe both. If Amy goes on a hike, she will get to explore nature and get some exercise. And if she explores nature and exercises, Amy will have a relaxing day.

Question:
If Amy did not take the day off, then did she have a relaxing day?

axiom NoDeadlines : Prop
axiom TakeDayOff : Prop
axiom ExploreNature : Prop
axiom Exercise : Prop
axiom RelaxingDay : Prop

-- If the weather is nice, Amy will go on a hike.
axiom nice_implies_hike : WeatherNice → GoHike
-- If Amy has no pressing work deadlines, she will take the day off.
axiom nd_implies_dayoff : NoDeadlines → TakeDayOff
-- Either the weather will be nice or Amy will have no deadlines (or both).
axiom nice_or_no_deadlines : WeatherNice ∨ NoDeadlines
-- If Amy goes on a hike, she will explore nature and get some exercise.
axiom hike_implies_explore_and_exercise : GoHike → (ExploreNature ∧ Exercise)
-- If she explores nature and exercises, Amy will have a relaxing day.
axiom explore_and_exercise_implies_relaxing : (ExploreNature ∧ Exercise) → RelaxingDay

-- If Amy did not take the day off, then she had a relaxing day.
