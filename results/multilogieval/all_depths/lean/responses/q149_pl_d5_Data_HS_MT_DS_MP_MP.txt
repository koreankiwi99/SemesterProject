Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Jessica set a goal to run a marathon. She learned that if she trained consistently, she could increase her endurance and stamina. Jessica knew that if her endurance improved, she could complete the 26.2 mile marathon. To complement her training, Jessica made sure she either trained regularly, or ate nutritious foods, or did both. Eating nutritious foods gave Jessica more steady energy for her workouts. With this extra energy, Jessica found she could train harder while staying injury-free on her road to marathon success.

Question:
If Jessica does not complete the marathon, then does she stay injury-free during training?

axiom T : Prop -- trains consistently
axiom E : Prop -- endurance improved

axiom H : Prop -- trains harder
axiom I : Prop -- injury-free

axiom a1 : T → E
