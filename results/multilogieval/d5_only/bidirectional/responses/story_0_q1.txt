Premises: Liam had a big exam coming up that he needed to ace. He realized if he studied hard, he would understand the material thoroughly. And if he understood the material, Liam knew he could pass the exam. Liam strived to either study hard, or get enough sleep, or do both to optimize his mind. He understood that if he got enough sleep, he would have good mental clarity. Logically, if Liam had mental clarity, he would run bussiness.
Conclusion: If Liam does not pass the exam, then does he run bussiness?
