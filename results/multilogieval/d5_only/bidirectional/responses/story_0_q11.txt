Premises: Jim makes sure to water his vegetable garden every day. He knows if he does this, he'll have a huge harvest this season. If Susan takes a day off, she goes hiking in the mountains to unwind. Either Jim is watering his garden daily, or Susan did not go hiking today. Jim realizes that if he has a bountiful harvest, he can share his fresh organic vegetables. When Jim shares his produce, it brings the community together for a potluck dinner.
Conclusion: If Susan took the day off work, then did the neighborhood have a community potluck?

axiom Share : Prop                 -- Jim shares his fresh organic vegetables
