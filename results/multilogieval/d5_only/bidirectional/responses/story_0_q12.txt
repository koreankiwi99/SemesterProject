Premises: Carol decided to adopt a puppy, hoping for a loving companion in her life. She realized that having a devoted pet would make her feel less lonely. Whether Carol adopted the puppy, or joined a local hiking group, or did both, she hoped these steps would enrich her life. If Carol joined a hiking group, it would allow her to meet and make new friends. And making new connections would lead to an improved social life for Carol.
Conclusion: If Carol does not feel less lonely, then has her social life improved?

-- Premises formalized:
-- 1) Carol adopted a puppy.
axiom premise1 : AdoptedPuppy
-- 2) Having (from adopting) a devoted pet makes her feel less lonely.
axiom premise2 : AdoptedPuppy → FeelsLessLonely
-- 3) If Carol joined a hiking group, she would make new friends.
axiom premise3 : JoinedHikingGroup → MadeNewConnections
-- 4) Making new connections leads to an improved social life.
axiom premise4 : MadeNewConnections → SocialLifeImproved

-- Conclusion to prove: If Carol does not feel less lonely, then her social life has improved.
theorem goal : ¬FeelsLessLonely → SocialLifeImproved := by
  intro hNotLessLonely
  -- From adoption and its effect, she feels less lonely:
  have hLessLonely : FeelsLessLonely := premise2 premise1
  -- Contradiction with the assumption ¬FeelsLessLonely:
  have hFalse : False := hNotLessLonely hLessLonely
  -- From false, anything follows (ex falso):
