Example ID: 14
Premises: Jessica aims to finish all her homework before she relaxes at night. She knows that if she finishes her homework, she'll have time to relax before bed. If her friend calls, Jessica will likely talk with her for an hour or more. Either Jessica finished her homework, or she didn't talk with her friend for an hour. Jessica realizes that if she relaxes before bed, she'll feel tired when it's time to sleep. And if she feels tired, she'll fall asleep quickly once she's in bed.
Conclusion: If Jessica's friend calls her on the phone, then does Jessica fall asleep quickly when she goes to bed?

Lean Code:
-- Propositions representing key facts about Jessica's evening
axiom Finished : Prop                  -- Jessica finished her homework
axiom Relax : Prop                     -- Jessica relaxes before bed
axiom Calls : Prop                     -- Jessica's friend calls her
axiom TalkHour : Prop                  -- Jessica talks with her friend for an hour or more
axiom Tired : Prop                     -- Jessica feels tired at bedtime
axiom SleepQuick : Prop                -- Jessica falls asleep quickly

-- Premises formalized
axiom aim_finish_before_relax : Relax → Finished
axiom finish_implies_relax : Finished → Relax
axiom calls_implies_talkhour : Calls → TalkHour
axiom finished_or_not_talkhour : Finished ∨ ¬ TalkHour
axiom relax_implies_tired : Relax → Tired
axiom tired_implies_sleepquick : Tired → SleepQuick

-- Goal: If Jessica's friend calls, then Jessica falls asleep quickly when she goes to bed

-- Premises
-- 1) She relaxes before bed only after finishing homework

axiom p2 : Finished → Relaxes
-- 3) If her friend calls, she will talk for an hour or more
