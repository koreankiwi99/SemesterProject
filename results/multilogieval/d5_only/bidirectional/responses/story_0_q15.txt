Premises: Amy woke up eager to make plans for the beautiful day. If the weather is nice, she will go on a hike. Also, if Amy has no pressing work deadlines, she will take the day off. It seems either the weather will be nice or Amy will have no deadlines, maybe both. If Amy goes on a hike, she always enjoys the fresh air and nature. And if she enjoys the fresh air, she ends up feeling rejuvenated and re-energized.
Conclusion: If Amy did not take the day off, then did she feel rejuvenated?
