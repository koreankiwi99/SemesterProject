Premises: Students and Teachers are individuals in a school. Typically, individuals in a school are educated. If a Student is in class, then they study. If a Teacher is in the staff room, then they grade papers. Either a Student is in class or a Teacher grades papers, or both. If a Principal grades papers, then a Teacher is in the staff room. If a Librarian is educated, then a Student is in class.
Conclusion: Can we conclude if a Principal does not grade papers then a Student does not study?

  intro h
  -- Attempt to derive existence of a non-studying student from the premises fails.
  -- The available premises only provide positive implications (e.g., in-class students study),
  -- and disjunction that guarantees either a student in class (hence studies) or a teacher grading.
  -- There is no premise that yields a non-studying student from a principal not grading papers.
