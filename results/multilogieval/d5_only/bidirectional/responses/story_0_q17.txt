Premises: Books and Pens are items in a bookstore. Normally, items in a bookstore are available for purchase. If a Book is a bestseller, then it is displayed prominently. If a Pen is a fountain pen, then it has a refillable ink cartridge. Either a Book is a bestseller or a Pen has a refillable ink cartridge, or both. If a Notebook is available for purchase, then a Pen is a fountain pen. If a Planner is displayed prominently, then a Book is a bestseller.
Conclusion: Can we conclude if a Notebook is not a fountain pen then a Book is a bestseller?
