Premises: Coffee and Tea are beverages served in a cafe. Usually, beverages served in a cafe are hot. If Coffee is brewed, then it is aromatic. If Tea is steeped, then it can be sweetened. Either Coffee is brewed or Tea can be sweetened, or both. If Hot Chocolate can be sweetened, then Tea is steeped. If Espresso is hot, then Coffee is brewed.
Conclusion: Can we conclude if Hot Chocolate is not aromatic then Tea cannot be sweetened?

  -- Attempt to derive a contradiction from the premises:
  -- Available: Brewed Coffee ∨ CanBeSweetened Tea
  -- If Tea is sweetenable, this is consistent with the disjunction.
  -- None of the premises connect Aromatic HotChocolate with Tea being sweetenable.
  -- Also, hotchocolate_sweetenable_implies_tea_steeped goes the other way (from HotChocolate sweetenable to Tea steeped),
  -- and provides no way to use tea_sweetenable to conclude anything about HotChocolate's aromatic property.
  -- Thus, no contradiction can be derived from the given premises.
