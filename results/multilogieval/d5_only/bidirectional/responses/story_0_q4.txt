Premises: Alice knew that if she wins the race, she would be awarded a big trophy. If Bob ate a large meal beforehand, he would likely get a stomach ache during the race. Either Alice won the race, or Bob did not get a stomach ache. Alice's coach understood that if she was awarded a trophy, she would want to celebrate her win. Whenever Alice celebrated a victory, she went out for ice cream after.
Conclusion: If Bob ate a big meal before the race, then did Alice go out for ice cream?

We model the scenario with propositional predicates about Alice and Bob.

Premises:
1. If Alice wins, she is awarded a trophy.
2. If Bob ate a big meal, he gets a stomach ache.
3. Either Alice won the race, or Bob did not get a stomach ache.
4. If Alice was awarded a trophy, she would celebrate her win.
5. Whenever Alice celebrated a victory, she went out for ice cream after.

In fact, from the premises we can derive that if Bob ate a big meal,
then Alice went out for ice cream.

Goal (negation of the user's conclusion):
We attempt to prove: ¬(BobBigMeal → IceCreamAlice).
This is not derivable from the premises (indeed, the implication holds as shown above),
so this proof attempt cannot be completed.

theorem negated_conclusion : ¬(BobBigMeal → IceCreamAlice) := by
  intro h
  -- From the premises we have the implication (positive_conclusion),
  -- so there is no way to derive a contradiction here.
  -- Therefore, the negation is not provable from the given premises.
