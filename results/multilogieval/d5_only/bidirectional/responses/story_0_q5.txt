Premises: My team has been working hard to finish a big project this week. If the project is completed on time, the client will be satisfied with our work. Also, if the team works late nights all week, then team will be sick. It seems either we'll finish on time or team will be sick, maybe both. If the client is satisfied, then our company will likely get a positive review from them. And if we get a positive review, then we'll gain more business from referrals.
Conclusion: If the team will not be sick, then did we gain more business from referrals?

Lean Code:

axiom Sick : Prop

axiom Satisfied : Prop
axiom PosReview : Prop
axiom MoreBusiness : Prop

-- Premises
axiom p1 : OnTime → Satisfied
axiom p2 : LateNights → Sick
axiom p3 : OnTime ∨ Sick
axiom p4 : Satisfied → PosReview
axiom p5 : PosReview → MoreBusiness

-- Conclusion: If the team will not be sick, then we gained more business from referrals.
