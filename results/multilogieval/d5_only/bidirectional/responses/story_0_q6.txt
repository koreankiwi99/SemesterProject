Premises: Abby works hard to take care of her health. She knows that if she drinks plenty of water daily, she will be properly hydrated. Having proper hydration gives Abby high energy levels throughout the day. Abby also understands that either she drinks lots of water, or eats a balanced diet, or does both, to feel her best. Eating a nutritious diet ensures that Abby gets all the nutrients she needs. And by meeting her nutritional needs with food, Abby is able to maintain good overall health.
Conclusion: If Abby does not experience high energy levels, then does she maintain good health?

Lean Code:
axiom W : Prop        -- Abby drinks plenty of water daily
axiom H : Prop        -- Abby is properly hydrated
axiom E : Prop        -- Abby has high energy levels
axiom B : Prop        -- Abby eats a balanced/nutritious diet
axiom N : Prop        -- Abby gets all the nutrients she needs
axiom G : Prop        -- Abby maintains good overall health

axiom Hydrated_implies_Energy : H → E
axiom Water_or_Balanced : W ∨ B
