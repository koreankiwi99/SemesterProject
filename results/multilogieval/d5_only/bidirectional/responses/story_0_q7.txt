Premises: Sam has an important day coming up - his birthday! If it's his birthday, his family will take him out to dinner to celebrate. Also, if Sam has a big project due at work tomorrow, he may end up working late at the office tonight. It seems either it will be his birthday or he'll have a project due, maybe both. If his family takes him out, naturally Sam will get to celebrate with them. And we know if Sam celebrates with family, he'll have a nice birthday dinner.
Conclusion: If Sam did not work late at the office, then did he have a nice birthday dinner?
