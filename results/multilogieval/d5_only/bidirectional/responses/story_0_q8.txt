Premises: The chef at a popular restaurant decided that if he added more salt to the soup, it would enhance the flavor. However, he soon realized that if the soup tasted too salty, customers would send it back to the kitchen. The chef was either adding more salt to the soup as an experiment, or he was experimenting with entirely new recipes, or perhaps both. If the chef was experimenting with new recipes, he ended up using some unusual ingredient combinations. The chef knew that if he used unusual combinations, the restaurant menu would start to have more eclectic offerings.
Conclusion: If customers do not send the soup back to the kitchen, then does the restaurant menu have eclectic offerings?

We model the scenario with propositional variables:

S  : the chef added more salt to the soup
H  : the flavor is enhanced
T  : the soup tastes too salty
B  : customers send the soup back
NR : the chef was experimenting with new recipes
U  : the chef used unusual ingredient combinations
E  : the restaurant menu has eclectic offerings

Premises:
1. If he added more salt, it would enhance the flavor:         S → H
2. If the soup tasted too salty, customers would send it back: T → B
3. He was adding more salt or experimenting with new recipes:  S ∨ NR
4. If experimenting with new recipes, he used unusual combos:  NR → U
5. If he used unusual combos, the menu is eclectic:            U → E

Conclusion to analyze:
If customers do not send the soup back, then the menu is eclectic:
(¬B → E)

We aim to prove the negation of the conclusion:
¬(¬B → E)

  intro h
  -- From T → B we can derive (¬B → ¬T), but no contradiction is reachable.
  -- From NR we could derive E (via U), which doesn't contradict anything.
  -- From S alone we cannot relate to B or E with given premises.
  -- Hence we cannot conclude False from the premises and h.
