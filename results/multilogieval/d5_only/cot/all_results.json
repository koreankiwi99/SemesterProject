John did not bring treats, so we cannot conclude it was a birthday; plausibly not a birthday.\n- From \u201ceither projects get done early or it\u2019s a birthday,\u201d not-birthday implies projects got done early (by someone).\n- \u201cIf someone finishes early, they can take a long lunch\u201d grants permission, not necessity; it does not entail that John took a long lunch.\n- Only taking a long lunch leads to being recharged, which then leads to a very productive afternoon. We lack grounds that John took a long lunch or was recharged.\n- Therefore, we cannot deduce that John had a very productive afternoon.\nAnswer: No",

If a Banana is yellow, then it is rich in potassium. Either an Apple is red or a Banana is rich in potassium, or both. If a Pear is ripe, then a Banana is yellow. If a Peach is sweet, then an Apple is red.\nQuestion: Can we conclude if a Pear is not yellow then a Banana is rich in potassium?\nReasoning steps: [1) The only rules leading to \u201cBanana is rich in potassium\u201d are: (a) Banana yellow -> rich in potassium, and (b) the disjunction: Apple red OR Banana rich in potassium. 2) There is no rule connecting \u201cPear is not yellow\u201d to Banana being yellow or to Banana being rich in potassium. 3) The rule involving Pear relates ripeness to Banana yellow (Pear ripe -> Banana yellow), not Pear\u2019s color. 4) The disjunction does not guarantee Banana rich in potassium (it might be satisfied by Apple red alone). 5) Therefore, from \u201cPear not yellow\u201d we cannot conclude \u201cBanana rich in potassium.\u201d]\nAnswer: No",

She knew that if the oven temperature reaches 375\u00b0F, then the cake batter will be cooked through properly. Either it's Alex's birthday, or the cake batter will not be cooked through properly. Alex's mom is aware that if the cake cooks through completely, it will turn out light and fluffy in texture. Alex loves light and fluffy cake, so if the cake turns out that way, then Alex will really enjoy eating it.\nQuestion: If The oven temperature reaches 375\u00b0FF, then does Alex enjoy the cake?\nReasoning steps:\n- If the oven reaches 375\u00b0F, then the cake is cooked through.\n- If the cake is cooked through, then it turns out light and fluffy.\n- If the cake is light and fluffy, then Alex enjoys it.\n- Therefore, if the oven reaches 375\u00b0F, Alex enjoys the cake.\n- (Additionally, from \u201cBirthday or not cooked\u201d and \u201ccooked,\u201d we can infer it\u2019s his birthday, but this is not needed to conclude enjoyment.)\nAnswer: Yes",

Lately, Sarah makes sure that either she is studying consistently, or she is getting enough sleep - or sometimes both! Sarah has found that if she gets enough shut-eye, she feels well-rested the next day. She has learned that if she feels well-rested, it helps her stay healthy overall.\nQuestion: If Sarah does not earn good grades, then does she stay healthy?\nReasoning steps:\n- Let S = studies daily, L = learns well, G = earns good grades, E = enough sleep, R = well-rested, H = healthy.\n- From L \u2192 G, contrapositive: \u00acG \u2192 \u00acL.\n- From S \u2192 L, contrapositive: \u00acL \u2192 \u00acS; thus from \u00acG we get \u00acS.\n- From S \u2228 E and \u00acS, infer E.\n- From E \u2192 R and R \u2192 H, infer H.\n- Therefore, \u00acG \u2192 H.\nAnswer: Yes",
