Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Someone decided they wanted to become more knowledgeable about world history. They realized that if they read history books regularly, they would learn about major historical events and figures. And if they learned about major historical events and figures, they could understand how the past shaped the present. Therefore, if someone read history books regularly, they could grasp how the past shaped the present. Either someone reads history books regularly, or they listen to history podcasts, or they do both. If someone listens to history podcasts, they gain different perspectives on historical events. And if they gain different perspectives, their overall understanding of history is more nuanced.

Question:
If Lauren cannot grasp how the past shaped the present, is her understanding of history nuanced?
