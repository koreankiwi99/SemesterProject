Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the farmer waters his crops daily, they will grow strong and healthy. If there is a drought, then the crops will dry up. Either the farmer waters the crops routinely, or the crops did not dry up. If the crops grow strong, there will be a bountiful harvest. If there is a large harvest, the farmer will make good profits.

Question:
If there was a drought this season, will the farmer make good profits?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Waters : Prop
axiom GrowsStrong : Prop
axiom Drought : Prop
axiom DryUp : Prop
axiom BountifulHarvest : Prop
axiom Profit : Prop

axiom h1 : Waters → GrowsStrong
axiom h2 : Drought → DryUp
axiom h3 : Waters ∨ ¬ DryUp
axiom h4 : GrowsStrong → BountifulHarvest
axiom h5 : BountifulHarvest → Profit

theorem profits_if_drought : Drought → Profit := by
  intro d
  have u : DryUp := h2 d
  have w : Waters := by
    cases h3 with
    | inl w => exact w
    | inr not_u =>
      exact False.elim (not_u u)
  have gs : GrowsStrong := h1 w
  have bh : BountifulHarvest := h4 gs
  exact h5 bh
