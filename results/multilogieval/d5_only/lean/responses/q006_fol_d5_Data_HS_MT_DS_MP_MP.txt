Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Someone wanted to become a faster sprinter. They realized that if they did sprint workouts several times a week, their speed would improve. And if their speed improved, they could run races faster. Therefore, if they trained hard weekly, they could improve their race times. Either they trained hard at sprinting, or they stretched regularly after runs, or both. If they stretched after runs, it means they took recovery seriously. And if they took recovery seriously, then they focused on muscle flexibility to prevent injury.

Question:
If Lauren does not run races faster, does she focus on flexibility to prevent injury?
