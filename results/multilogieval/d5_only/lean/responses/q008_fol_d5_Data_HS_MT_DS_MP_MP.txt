Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Someone wanted to become a better basketball player. They realized that if they practiced dribbling every day, their ball handling skills would improve. And if their ball handling improved, they could execute advanced dribble moves. Therefore, if they practiced dribbling daily, they could execute advanced moves. Either they practiced dribbling daily, or they worked on their vertical leap, or both. If they worked on their vertical leap, their ability to dunk would increase. This is important because if their dunking ability increased, they could score and defend more effectively during games.

Question:
If Michael is unable to execute advanced dribble moves, does he score and defend more effectively during games?
