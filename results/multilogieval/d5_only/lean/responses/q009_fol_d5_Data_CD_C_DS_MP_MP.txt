Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
As winter comes to an end, the weather starts getting warmer. If the last snow melts away, the hiking trails will open up. Also, if the ice rink shuts down, the skating lessons will end for the season. It seems either the snow will melt, or the ice rink will close, or perhaps both will occur. If the hiking trails open up, nature lovers will go for long walks in the mountains. And if they go hiking, they will breathe in the fresh air and enjoy the scenic views.

Question:
If skating lessons will not end for the season, did the nature lovers enjoy scenic views on their hike?
