Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If you wash your hands regularly, you likely won't get sick. If you take the train to work, you'll be exposed to germs. Either someone washed their hands routinely, or they did not take the train. If you don't get sick, you won't have to miss work. If you don't miss work, your boss will be happy with your attendance.

Question:
If Sam took the train to work this week, was his boss happy with his attendance?
