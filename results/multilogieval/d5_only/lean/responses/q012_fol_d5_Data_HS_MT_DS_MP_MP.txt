Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
A musician wanted to compose an album. They realized that if they practiced new melodies daily, they would expand their repertoire. If they had more material, they could produce enough songs for an album. So if they practiced new melodies daily, they could compose an album. Either the musician practiced new melodies, or they jammed with friends, or they did both. If someone jammed with friends, they gained inspiration from collaboration. And if they felt inspired, their creativity flourished.

Question:
If Sarah did not release an album this year, did her creativity flourish?

Lean Verification:
  Success: False
  Errors:
    - Function expected at
  CreativityFlourished x
but this term has type
  Prop

Note: Expected a function because this term is being applied to the argument
  lemma
    - unexpected token ':'; expected command
    - Unknown identifier `practiced_implies_couldCompose`
    - Unknown identifier `jammed_implies_flourish`

--- Iteration 2 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
From the premises:
- Practicing daily implies being able to compose an album.
- Jamming implies inspiration, which implies creativity flourishes.
- Sarah either practiced or jammed (or both).

There is no connection given between releasing an album and either practicing, jamming, being inspired, or creativity flourishing. Therefore, from “Sarah did not release an album this year,” we cannot conclude that her creativity flourished. The data only ensures that either she could compose an album (if she practiced) or her creativity flourished (if she jammed), but not which disjunct holds, and release is independent of these.

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
From the premises:
- Practicing daily implies being able to compose an album.
- Jamming implies inspiration, which implies creativity flourishes.
- Sarah either practiced or jammed (or both).
There is no stated link between releasing an album and creativity. Therefore, from “Sarah did not release an album this year,” we cannot conclude that her creativity flourished.
