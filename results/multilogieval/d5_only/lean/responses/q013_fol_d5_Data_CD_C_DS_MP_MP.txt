Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the weather clears up, the baseball game will go on. Also, if someone finishes their errands, they'll meet friends for dinner. Either it will clear up, or the errands will get done, or maybe both will happen. If the game is on, fans will get to cheer for their team. And if fans get to cheer, it will be an exciting night at the ballpark.

Question:
If Mary did not meet her firends for dinner, was it an exciting night at the ballpark?
