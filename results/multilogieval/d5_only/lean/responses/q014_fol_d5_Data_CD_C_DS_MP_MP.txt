Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
In the neighborhood, if someone hosts a party, their house gets very noisy. Also, if someone is practicing drums, the noise levels go up. Either there is a party, or someone is playing drums, or maybe both. So, if the house gets noisy from a party, neighbors start complaining. And if neighbors complain, the police are called to intervene.

Question:
If there was no noise level up, were the police called to intervene?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Party : Prop
axiom Drums : Prop
axiom Noisy : Prop
axiom Complain : Prop
axiom Police : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom party_implies_noisy : Party → Noisy
axiom drums_implies_noisy : Drums → Noisy
axiom party_or_drums : Party ∨ Drums
axiom party_implies_complain : Party → Complain
axiom complain_implies_police : Complain → Police

-- If there was no noise level up, were the police called?
theorem no_noise_then_police : ¬Noisy → Police := by
  intro hNotNoisy
  -- From the disjunction and the implications, we get Noisy
  have hNoisy : Noisy := by
    cases party_or_drums with
    | inl hP => exact party_implies_noisy hP
    | inr hD => exact drums_implies_noisy hD
  -- Contradiction with ¬Noisy
  have hFalse : False := hNotNoisy hNoisy
  -- Explosion: from False, derive Police
  exact False.elim hFalse
