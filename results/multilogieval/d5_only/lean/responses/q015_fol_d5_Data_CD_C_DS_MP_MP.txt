Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
In the office, if an important deadline is approaching, employees have to work late nights. Also, if the internet is down, work becomes very slow. Either there is a deadline coming up, or the internet is down, or maybe both. So, if employees work late nights, they feel overworked and stressed. And if they feel stressed, they take a day off to recharge.

Question:
If Mary's work did not become slow, did she take a day off to recharge?
