Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the new phone is fast and smart, someone will enjoy using it. Also, if the apps are easy to navigate, the phone experience will be smooth. Either the phone will be fast or the apps will be intuitive or maybe both. If someone enjoys using their new phone, they'll rely on it for many tasks. If they rely on their phone a lot, its battery will need frequent charging.

Question:
If James did not have the smooth phone experience, then did he need to charge his phone battery frequently?

axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person

-- Global properties about the phone/apps
axiom Fast : Prop
axiom Smart : Prop
axiom AppsEasy : Prop
axiom AppsIntuitive : Prop

-- Per-person predicates
axiom Enjoy : Person → Prop
axiom SmoothExperience : Person → Prop
axiom Rely : Person → Prop
axiom FrequentCharge : Person → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom ax1 : (Fast ∧ Smart) → ∃ p, Enjoy p
axiom ax2 : AppsEasy → ∀ p, SmoothExperience p
axiom ax3 : Fast ∨ AppsIntuitive
axiom ax4 : ∀ p, Enjoy p → Rely p
axiom ax5 : ∀ p, Rely p → FrequentCharge p

-- A derived fact we can prove: from fast and smart, someone will need frequent charging
theorem someone_needs_frequent_charge_of_fast_and_smart :
  (Fast ∧ Smart) → ∃ p, FrequentCharge p := by
  intro hfs
  have ⟨p, hpE⟩ := ax1 hfs
  exact ⟨p, ax5 p (ax4 p hpE)⟩

-- The question's claim:
def claim : Prop := (¬ SmoothExperience James) → FrequentCharge James
-- We cannot derive `claim` from the given premises, nor its negation, with the information provided.
