Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the team practices hard, they will be prepared for the big game. If the star player is injured, he cannot play in the game. Either the team practiced hard, or the star player is not injured. When the team is well-prepared, the team wins the important game. If the team wins the important game, they will celebrate with a team dinner afterwards.

Question:
If the star player is injured, will the team celebrate with a team dinner after the big game?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Practiced : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop
axiom Injured : Prop
axiom CanPlay : Prop
axiom Win : Prop
axiom Celebrate : Prop

axiom premise1 : Practiced → Prepared
axiom premise2 : Injured → ¬ CanPlay
axiom premise3 : Practiced ∨ ¬ Injured
axiom premise4 : Prepared → Win
axiom premise5 : Win → Celebrate

theorem goal : Injured → Celebrate := by
  intro hinj
  have hnn : ¬ (¬ Injured) := by
    intro hnotinj
    exact hnotinj hinj
  have hprac : Practiced :=
    Or.elim premise3
      (fun hp => hp)
      (fun hnotinj => False.elim (hnn hnotinj))
  have hprep : Prepared := premise1 hprac
  have hwin : Win := premise4 hprep
  exact premise5 hwin
