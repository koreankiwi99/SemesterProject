Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the team practices every day, they will be prepared for the big game. If it is sunny outside, children will play at the park. Either the team practiced daily, or kids did not go to the park today. If a team feels prepared, then they will have confidence. When people feel confident, they hold their head up high.

Question:
If it was sunny out, did the team hold their heads up high?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom PracticeDaily : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop
axiom Sunny : Prop
axiom Park : Prop
axiom Confident : Prop
axiom HeadsUp : Prop

axiom premise1 : PracticeDaily → Prepared
axiom premise2 : Sunny → Park
axiom premise3 : PracticeDaily ∨ ¬ Park
axiom premise4 : Prepared → Confident
axiom premise5 : Confident → HeadsUp

theorem team_heads_up_if_sunny : Sunny → HeadsUp := by
  intro hSunny
  have hPark : Park := premise2 hSunny
  have hPractice : PracticeDaily := by
    cases premise3 with
    | inl hP => exact hP
    | inr hNotPark =>
      have : False := hNotPark hPark
      exact False.elim this
  have hPrepared : Prepared := premise1 hPractice
  have hConfident : Confident := premise4 hPrepared
  exact premise5 hConfident
