Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
A chef wanted to improve their cooking skills. They realized that if they learned new techniques and recipes, they would expand their repertoire. And if they expanded their repertoire, they could prepare a wider variety of dishes. Therefore, if someone learned new techniques and recipes, they could prepare more dishes. However, some chefs were not able to prepare a variety of dishes. Therefore, they did not learn new techniques and recipes. Either they learned new techniques and recipes, or they researched global cuisines, or both. If someone researched global cuisines, then they were exposed to new flavors. And if they were exposed to new flavors, then they could create innovative flavor combinations.

Question:
If Tom cannot prepare a variety of dishes, then can he create innovative flavor combinations?
