Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If there is road construction on the usual route, I'll have to find an alternate way to work. Also, if I sleep through my alarm, I'll be late leaving home. Either there could be construction, or I could sleep through my alarm, or perhaps both will happen. So if I have to find an alternate route, my commute will take longer than normal. And if my commute takes longer, I'll arrive late at the office.

Question:
If I did not leave home late, did I arrive late at the office?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Construction : Prop
axiom AlternateRoute : Prop
axiom SleepThroughAlarm : Prop
axiom LeaveLateHome : Prop
axiom CommuteLonger : Prop
axiom ArriveLateOffice : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom p1 : Construction → AlternateRoute
axiom p2 : SleepThroughAlarm → LeaveLateHome
axiom p3 : Construction ∨ SleepThroughAlarm
axiom p4 : AlternateRoute → CommuteLonger
axiom p5 : CommuteLonger → ArriveLateOffice

-- Conclusion: If I did not leave home late, I arrived late at the office.
theorem arrived_late_if_not_left_late : ¬LeaveLateHome → ArriveLateOffice := by
  intro notL
  -- From p2 and notL, derive ¬SleepThroughAlarm
  have notS : ¬SleepThroughAlarm := by
    intro hs
    have hL : LeaveLateHome := p2 hs

  -- From p3 and ¬S, derive Construction
  have hC : Construction := by
    cases p3 with
    | inl c => exact c
    | inr s => exact False.elim (notS s)
  -- Chain implications to get ArriveLateOffice

  have hT : CommuteLonger := p4 hA
