Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the presentation goes well, someone will land the big account at work. Also, if it's someone's anniversary, their spouse will plan a nice dinner out. Either the presentation will go well, or it's their anniversary, or maybe both will happen. If they land the big account, they'll get a promotion at work. And if they get a promotion, they'll celebrate with champagne.

Question:
If John did not have his anniversary dinner, did he celebrate with champagne?

axiom PresentationGoesWell : Person → Prop
axiom LandsBigAccount : Person → Prop
axiom Anniversary : Person → Prop
axiom AnniversaryDinner : Person → Prop
axiom Promotion : Person → Prop
axiom CelebrateChampagne : Person → Prop

-- Premises from the textual context (instantiated per person, tracking the same individual)

-- Goal: From "John did not have his anniversary dinner," conclude he celebrated with champagne.
