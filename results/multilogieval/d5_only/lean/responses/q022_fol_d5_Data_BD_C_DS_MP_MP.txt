Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the farmer waters his crops, they will grow healthy and strong. If it is monsoon season, there will be heavy rains. Either the farmer waters his crops daily, or there are no heavy monsoon rains this season. When crops grow strong, the harvest will be bountiful. If the harvest is bountiful, the farmer will make a good profit selling his crops.

Question:
If it is monsoon season, will the farmer make a good profit selling his crops?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Waters : Prop
axiom GrowsStrong : Prop
axiom Monsoon : Prop
axiom HeavyRains : Prop
axiom WatersDaily : Prop
axiom BountifulHarvest : Prop
axiom GoodProfit : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom p1 : Waters → GrowsStrong
axiom p2 : Monsoon → HeavyRains
axiom p3 : WatersDaily ∨ ¬HeavyRains
axiom p4 : GrowsStrong → BountifulHarvest
axiom p5 : BountifulHarvest → GoodProfit

-- Natural implication: watering daily implies watering
axiom p6 : WatersDaily → Waters

theorem profit_if_monsoon : Monsoon → GoodProfit := by
  intro m
  have hH : HeavyRains := p2 m
  apply Or.elim p3
  · intro hd
    have w : Waters := p6 hd
    have g : GrowsStrong := p1 w
    have b : BountifulHarvest := p4 g
    exact p5 b
  · intro nH
    have f : False := nH hH
    exact False.elim f
