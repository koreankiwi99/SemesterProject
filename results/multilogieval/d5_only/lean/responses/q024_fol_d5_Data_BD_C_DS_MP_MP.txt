Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the field gets enough water, the crops will grow well. If pests invade the field, some crops will be destroyed. Either the farmer watered the field adequately, or pests did not damage crops, or the field got enough water but pests still damaged crops. If crops grow well, the harvest will be bountiful. If the harvest is bountiful, the farmer will make good profit.

Question:
If pests invaded the field, did the farmer make good profit?

axiom EnoughWater : Prop
axiom GrowWell : Prop
axiom Invaded : Prop
axiom Damaged : Prop
axiom Bountiful : Prop
axiom Profit : Prop

-- Premises
axiom water_implies_grow : EnoughWater → GrowWell
axiom invade_implies_damage : Invaded → Damaged
axiom disjunct : EnoughWater ∨ ¬Damaged ∨ (EnoughWater ∧ Damaged)
axiom grow_implies_bountiful : GrowWell → Bountiful
axiom bountiful_implies_profit : Bountiful → Profit

-- Conclusion: If pests invaded the field, the farmer made good profit.
