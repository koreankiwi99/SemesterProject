Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Someone wanted to be able to run a 5k race without stopping. They learned that if they did strength training consistently, it would build up their leg muscles. And if they built up leg strength, they could run longer distances without getting tired. Therefore, if someone did strength training consistently, they could run a 5k without stopping to rest. Either someone does strength training consistently, or they do cardio exercise regularly, or they do both. If someone does cardio exercise regularly, then their lung capacity increases. And if their lung capacity increases, then they have better endurance for long distance running.

Question:
If James cannot yet run a 5k without stopping, does he have increased lung capacity?
