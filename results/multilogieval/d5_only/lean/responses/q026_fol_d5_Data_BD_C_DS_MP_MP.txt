Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the sun is shining, the solar panels will generate electricity. If it is windy outside, the wind turbines will spin. Either it was sunny today, or the wind turbines did not spin today. If solar panels generate electricity, the energy grid stays stable. If the grid is stable, blackouts can be prevented.

Question:
If it was windy today, were blackouts prevented?

axiom h1 : Sun → SolarGen
axiom h2 : Windy → TurbinesSpin
axiom h3 : Sun ∨ ¬TurbinesSpin
axiom h4 : SolarGen → GridStable
axiom h5 : GridStable → BlackoutsPrevented
