Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the farmer's market has ripe, juicy peaches, someone will bake a peach pie. Also, if someone won a baking contest, they'll celebrate with friends and family. Either peaches are in season, or someone won a contest, or perhaps both. If someone bakes a pie, the house will smell amazing. And if the house smells amazing, it feels like a homey, cozy place to relax.

Question:
If James did not celebrate with friends and family, then did the house feel homey and cozy?
