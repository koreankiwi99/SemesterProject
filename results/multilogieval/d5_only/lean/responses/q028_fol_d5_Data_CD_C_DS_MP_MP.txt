Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the bus is running on time, someone will get to work early. Also, if there is traffic, someone will be late for their meeting. Either the bus is on time, or there is traffic, or maybe both. If someone gets to work early, they'll have time to grab breakfast. And if they have breakfast, then they'll start the day feeling satisfied.

Question:
If Mary was not late for her meeting, did she start the day feeling satisfied?

Comment:
From the given premises we can derive:
- If the bus is on time, then someone starts satisfied.
- If Mary gets to work early, then Mary starts satisfied.

However, the premises do not allow us to conclude that
(¬ LateForMeeting Mary) → StartSatisfied Mary.
Indeed, "no traffic for Mary" does not imply Mary got to work early or had breakfast.
Thus the asked implication is not derivable from the premises.

--- Iteration 2 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
From the premises we only know that if the bus is on time, someone (not necessarily Mary) gets to work early; if there is traffic, someone (not necessarily Mary) is late; either the bus is on time or there is traffic (or both); and early implies breakfast, breakfast implies starting satisfied. There is no information connecting Mary’s not being late to her being early or having breakfast. A countermodel: let there be Mary and Bob; suppose the bus is on time and there is traffic; Bob is early and late (hence satisfied), while Mary is neither early nor late, thus does not have breakfast and is not satisfied. Then Mary is not late, yet she did not start satisfied. Therefore the queried implication does not follow.

--- Iteration 3 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
From the premises we only know that either the bus is on time (giving someone early arrival) or there is traffic (making someone late), and that early implies breakfast implies starting satisfied. None of these guarantees anything specific about Mary. In particular, Mary’s not being late does not imply she arrived early or had breakfast. A countermodel exists where the premises hold, Mary is not late, yet she did not start satisfied. So the implication does not follow.

STAGE 1 ANSWER: No

STAGE 2: [Lean code in <lean></lean> tags]

We build a concrete model satisfying the premises but where
(¬ LateForMeeting Mary) → StartSatisfied Mary is false.
This shows the queried implication does not follow from the premises.
