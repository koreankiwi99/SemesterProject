Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If someone waters the garden regularly, the flowers will bloom brightly. If it rains a lot, then the soil becomes saturated. Either the garden is watered routinely, or the soil did not saturated. If the flowers bloom, they will release fragrance. If there is fragrance, it will attract butterflies.

Question:
If there was heavy rain, did the garden attract butterflies?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Watered : Prop
axiom Bloom : Prop
axiom Rain : Prop
axiom Saturated : Prop
axiom Fragrance : Prop
axiom Butterflies : Prop

axiom h1 : Watered → Bloom
axiom h2 : Rain → Saturated
axiom h3 : Watered ∨ ¬Saturated
axiom h4 : Bloom → Fragrance
axiom h5 : Fragrance → Butterflies

theorem attracts_from_heavy_rain : Rain → Butterflies := by
  intro r
  have s : Saturated := h2 r
  have w : Watered := by
    cases h3 with
    | inl hw => exact hw
    | inr hnotS => exact False.elim (hnotS s)
  have b : Bloom := h1 w
  have f : Fragrance := h4 b
  exact h5 f
