Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Someone wanted to become fluent in Spanish. They realized that if they practiced speaking Spanish daily, their vocabulary and grammar would improve. And if their Spanish skills improved, they could converse with native speakers. Therefore, if they practiced speaking Spanish daily, they could converse with native speakers. Either they practiced speaking Spanish daily, or they watched Spanish TV shows, or both. If they watched Spanish TV shows, their listening comprehension would get better. This is important because if their listening comprehension improved, they could understand rapid conversational Spanish.

Question:
If Mark cannot converse with native speakers, can he understand rapid conversational Spanish?
