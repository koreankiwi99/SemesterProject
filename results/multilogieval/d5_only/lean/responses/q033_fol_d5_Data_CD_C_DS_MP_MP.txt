Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
With school being closed for summer, the kids look forward to the break. If their parents plan a trip, the family will travel somewhere fun. Also, if the community pool opens, the kids will swim daily with their friends. It seems either their parents will plan a trip, or the pool will open, or maybe both will happen. If the family gets to travel somewhere fun, the kids will learn new things and make new memories. And if they make great summer memories, the kids will have amazing stories to share when school reopens.

Question:
If Sam did not swim daily with his friends, did he have amazing stories to share when school reopened?
