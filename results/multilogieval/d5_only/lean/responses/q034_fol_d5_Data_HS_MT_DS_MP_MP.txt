Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Someone wanted to become fluent in Spanish. They realized that if they took language lessons, their vocabulary and grammar would improve. And with improved language skills, they could become fluent. Therefore, if someone took language lessons, they could become fluent in Spanish. Either they took language lessons, or they watched Spanish TV shows, or they did both. If someone watches Spanish shows, they get exposure to native speakers. And with exposure to native speakers, they pick up proper pronunciation.

Question:
If Lisa is not fluent in Spanish, does she have good pronunciation?
