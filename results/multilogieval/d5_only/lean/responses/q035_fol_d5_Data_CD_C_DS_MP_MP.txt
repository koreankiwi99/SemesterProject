Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
During summer, there are always fun activities to do outside. If it doesn't rain today, the local softball team will have their game as scheduled. Also, if the swimming pool is open, some kids will go for a swim. It looks like either it won't rain, or the pool will be open, or perhaps both. If the softball team has their game, the players will enjoy catching and batting. And if the players enjoy playing, they will have smiles on their faces at the end.

Question:
If the kids did not go for a swim, did the players have smiles on their faces at the end?
