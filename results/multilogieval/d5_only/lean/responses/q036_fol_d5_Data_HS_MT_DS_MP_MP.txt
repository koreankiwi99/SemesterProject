Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Someone wanted to become an artist. They learned that if they practiced drawing techniques consistently, they would improve their artistic skills. With improved artistic skills, they could sell their artworks. Either someone practices drawing techniques consistently, or someone studies art history and famous artists, or they do both. If someone studies art history and famous artists, then they gain inspiration for their own art. If they gain inspiration, then they can develop their own creative style.

Question:
If Emma cannot sell her artworks yet, then has she developed her own creative style?
