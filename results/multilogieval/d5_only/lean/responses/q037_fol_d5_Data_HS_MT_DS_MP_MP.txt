Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Someone wanted to become a faster runner. They realized that if they did strength training exercises, they would build more muscular endurance. And if they built more muscular endurance, they could run farther without getting tired. Therefore, if someone did strength training, they could run farther. Either they did strength training, or they improved running form, or both. If someone improved their running form, then they experienced less fatigue. And if they experienced less fatigue, then they could run faster speeds.

Question:
If James cannot run farther, then can he run faster speeds?
