Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
At school, if there's a substitute teacher, the students will goof off in class. Also, if the cafeteria serves pizza for lunch, the kids will be hyper all afternoon. Either there will be a sub, or they'll have pizza, or maybe both will happen. So if the students goof off in class, they won't learn much that day. And if they don't learn much, they'll have lots of homework.

Question:
If kids will not be hyper all afternoon, did the students have lots of homework?

<lean>
-- Propositions representing the scenario
axiom SubstituteTeacher : Prop
axiom PizzaForLunch : Prop
axiom StudentsGoofOff : Prop
axiom KidsHyperAllAfternoon : Prop
axiom StudentsLearnMuch : Prop
axiom LotsOfHomework : Prop

-- Premises
axiom sub_implies_goof : SubstituteTeacher → StudentsGoofOff
axiom pizza_implies_hyper : PizzaForLunch → KidsHyperAllAfternoon
axiom sub_or_pizza : SubstituteTeacher ∨ PizzaForLunch
axiom goof_implies_not_learn : StudentsGoofOff → ¬ StudentsLearnMuch
axiom not_learn_implies_homework : ¬ StudentsLearnMuch → LotsOfHomework

-- Conclusion: If kids are not hyper all afternoon, then students have lots of homework
theorem homework_if_not_hyper : (¬ KidsHyperAllAfternoon) → LotsOfHomework := by
  intro notHyper
  -- From pizza → hyper and ¬hyper, derive ¬pizza
  have notPizza : ¬ PizzaForLunch := by
    intro pizza
    exact notHyper (pizza_implies_hyper pizza)
  -- From sub_or_pizza and ¬pizza, deduce there was a substitute
  have sub : SubstituteTeacher :=
    Or.elim sub_or_pizza
      (fun s => s)
      (fun p => False.elim (notPizza p))
  -- Goofing off follows from a substitute
  have goof : StudentsGoofOff := sub_implies_goof sub
  -- Not learning much follows from goofing off
  have notLearn : ¬ StudentsLearnMuch := goof_implies_not_learn goof
  -- Lots of homework follows from not learning much
  exact not_learn_implies_homework notLearn
