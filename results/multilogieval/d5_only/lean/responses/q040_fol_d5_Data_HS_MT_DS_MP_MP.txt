Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Someone decided they wanted to take up gardening as a hobby. They learned that if they watered the plants adequately, the plants would bloom brightly. And if the plants bloomed brightly, it would attract more bees and butterflies to the garden. Therefore, if someone watered their plants adequately, it would attract more bees and butterflies to their garden. Either someone waters their plants adequately, or they use organic fertilizers, or they do both. If someone uses organic fertilizers, the soil quality improves. And if the soil quality improves, the plants grow healthier.

Question:
If John's garden does not attract more bees and butterflies, is his soil high quality?
