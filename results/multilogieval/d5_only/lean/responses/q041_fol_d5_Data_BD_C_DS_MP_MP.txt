Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the oven temperature is set to 350 degrees, the cake will bake properly. If the cake batter contains eggs, it will be fluffy when baked. Either Sam set the oven temperature correctly, or the cake batter did not contain eggs. If a cake bakes properly, it will taste delicious. If a cake tastes delicious, guests at the party will be happy.

Question:
If the cake batter contained eggs, will the guests at the party be happy?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Oven350 : Prop
axiom BakesProperly : Prop
axiom Eggs : Prop
axiom Fluffy : Prop
axiom TastesDelicious : Prop
axiom GuestsHappy : Prop

axiom h1 : Oven350 → BakesProperly
axiom h2 : Eggs → Fluffy
axiom h3 : Oven350 ∨ ¬ Eggs
axiom h4 : BakesProperly → TastesDelicious
axiom h5 : TastesDelicious → GuestsHappy

theorem guests_happy_if_eggs : Eggs → GuestsHappy := by
