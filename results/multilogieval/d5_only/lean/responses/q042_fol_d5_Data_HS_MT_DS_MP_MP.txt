Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Someone wanted to learn to play the guitar. They realized that if they practiced the basic chords every day, they would develop the muscle memory in their fingers. And if they developed this muscle memory, they would be able to play simple songs. Therefore, if someone practiced the basic chords daily, they could learn to play simple songs. Either someone was practicing the basic chords daily, or they were focused on learning music theory, or both. If someone learned music theory, then they gained knowledge about song structure. Gaining this knowledge about song structure enabled them to analyze and understand how songs are composed.

Question:
If Amy cannot play any songs yet, does she have knowledge about song structure?
