Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
At the sporting event, if the home team is winning, the crowd will be very loud and energized. Also, if it's a rivalry game, fans will be more emotionally invested. Either the home team will be winning, or it's a rivalry game, or maybe both. So if the crowd is loud and energized, the atmosphere will be electric. And if the atmosphere is electric, it will be an unforgettable game.

Question:
If the fans will not be more emotionally invested, was the atmosphere electric?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom W : Prop        -- home team is winning
axiom R : Prop        -- it's a rivalry game
axiom L : Prop        -- crowd is loud and energized
axiom E : Prop        -- atmosphere is electric
axiom U : Prop        -- game is unforgettable
axiom M : Prop        -- fans are more emotionally invested

-- Premises from the text
axiom h1 : W → L      -- if winning then loud/energized
axiom h2 : R → M      -- if rivalry then more invested
axiom h3 : W ∨ R      -- either winning, or rivalry, or both
axiom h4 : L → E      -- if loud/energized then electric atmosphere
axiom h5 : E → U      -- if electric atmosphere then unforgettable

-- Goal: If the fans will not be more emotionally invested, was the atmosphere electric?
theorem atmosphere_electric_of_not_invested : ¬ M → E := by
  intro hNotM
  -- From R → M and ¬M, we get ¬R
  have hNotR : ¬ R := by
    intro r
    exact hNotM (h2 r)
  -- From W ∨ R and ¬R, we get W
  have w : W := by
    cases h3 with
    | inl hw => exact hw
    | inr hr => exact False.elim (hNotR hr)
  -- Then L and hence E
  have l : L := h1 w
  exact h4 l
