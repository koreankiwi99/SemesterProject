Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the team practices hard, they will be prepared for the game. If it is very hot outside, the game is postponed. Either the team practiced hard, or the game was not postponed. If a team is prepared, they will play well. When a team plays well, they will win.

Question:
If it was very hot outside, did the team win?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom PracticesHard : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop
axiom VeryHot : Prop
axiom GamePostponed : Prop
axiom PlaysWell : Prop
axiom Win : Prop

axiom premise1 : PracticesHard → Prepared
axiom premise2 : VeryHot → GamePostponed
axiom premise3 : PracticesHard ∨ ¬ GamePostponed
axiom premise4 : Prepared → PlaysWell
axiom premise5 : PlaysWell → Win

theorem team_wins_if_hot : VeryHot → Win := by
  intro hHot
  have hPost : GamePostponed := premise2 hHot
  have hPract : PracticesHard :=
    Or.elim premise3
      (fun hp => hp)
      (fun hnot => False.elim (hnot hPost))
  exact premise5 (premise4 (premise1 hPract))
</lean>
