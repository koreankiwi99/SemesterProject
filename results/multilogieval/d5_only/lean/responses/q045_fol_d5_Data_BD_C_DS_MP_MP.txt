Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If someone studies hard for an exam, they will feel confident going into the test. If there is severe weather in the forecast, schools may cancel class that day. Either Alex studied diligently for his biology exam, or class was not canceled due to the weather. If a student feels confident about the material, they will likely do well on the exam. If a student performs well on an exam, they will be satisfied with their hard work.

Question:
If there was severe weather in the forecast, did Alex feel satisfied with his performance on the history exam?

We formalize the story:

- Persons and Exams.
- Alex as a person; Biology and History as exams.
- Predicates for studying hard, confidence, weather, cancellation, doing well, and satisfaction.

Premises:
1. Studying hard for an exam implies confidence for that exam.
2. If there is severe weather in the forecast, schools may cancel class (modeled by a separate "MayCancelClass" possibility predicate).
3. Either Alex studied diligently for his biology exam, or class was not canceled.
4. Confidence about the material implies doing well on the exam.
5. Doing well on an exam implies being satisfied with one's hard work on that exam.

Goal asked in English:
If there was severe weather in the forecast, did Alex feel satisfied with his performance on the history exam?

Conclusion:
From these premises, there is no link from severe weather to Alex's satisfaction on the history exam. We can derive a chain from StudiedHard to Satisfied for the same exam, but we have no premise that Alex studied hard (or felt confident, or did well) for the history exam. The weather/cancellation facts do not bridge to history-exam performance. Hence the goal is not derivable, nor is its negation derivable from the provided information.

The target in question would be:

theorem target : SevereWeatherForecast → Satisfied Alex History := by
  ...

But this is not provable from the given premises, since there is no way to derive
any of StudiedHard/Confident/DidWell about Alex's History exam from SevereWeatherForecast
(or from the disjunction about Biology or class cancellation).
Thus we do not provide a (non-admissible) proof term for this target.
