Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
In a bakery, cakes and cookies are baked with care. Normally, baked goods prepared with care are delicious. If a dessert has chocolate frosting, and it is rich in flavor, customers enjoy it. If a pastry is made with buttery layers and it is flaky, customers find it appetizing. Customers enjoy either a dessert with chocolate frosting or a pastry with buttery layers, or both. If the chocolate cake is enjoyed by customers, then the buttery pastry is appetizing. If the cookie is delicious, then the chocolate cake is enjoyed by customers.

Question:
Can we conclude if the chocolate cake is not enjoyed by customers then the cookie is not delicious?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Item : Type
axiom ChocolateCake : Item
axiom ButteryPastry : Item
axiom Cookie : Item

axiom Enjoyed : Item → Prop
axiom Delicious : Item → Prop
axiom Appetizing : Item → Prop

-- If the chocolate cake is enjoyed by customers, then the buttery pastry is appetizing.
axiom premise1 : Enjoyed ChocolateCake → Appetizing ButteryPastry
-- If the cookie is delicious, then the chocolate cake is enjoyed by customers.
axiom premise2 : Delicious Cookie → Enjoyed ChocolateCake

-- Can we conclude: if the chocolate cake is not enjoyed by customers then the cookie is not delicious?
theorem conclude : ¬ Enjoyed ChocolateCake → ¬ Delicious Cookie := by
  intro hNotEnjoyed
  intro hDeliciousCookie
  have hEnjoyedCake : Enjoyed ChocolateCake := premise2 hDeliciousCookie
  exact hNotEnjoyed hEnjoyedCake
