Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
In an office, managers and employees have leadership skills. Normally, individuals with leadership skills can handle team dynamics effectively. If a team leader communicates clearly and sets goals, the team achieves success. If an employee is proactive and takes initiative, they stand out in the organization. The team achieves success under a team leader who communicates clearly and sets goals, or an employee stands out who takes initiative, or both. If Alex stands out in the organization, then Sarah achieves success in the team. If Sarah handles team dynamics effectively, then Alex stands out in the organization.

Question:
Can we conclude if Sarah does not achieve success in the team then Alex has leadership skills?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
From the premises:
- Leadership implies handling team dynamics.
- If Sarah handles team dynamics, then Alex stands out.
- If Alex stands out, then Sarah achieves success.

From ¬(Sarah achieves success), we can conclude ¬(Alex stands out) by contraposition of “Alex stands out → Sarah achieves success.” Then from ¬(Alex stands out) and “Sarah handles → Alex stands out,” we get ¬(Sarah handles). Using “Leadership → Handles,” we derive ¬(Leadership Sarah). However, none of these implications give us any information that would entail Leadership Alex. There is no rule connecting Sarah’s lack of success to Alex having leadership skills. So the target implication (¬ Success Sarah → Leadership Alex) is not derivable from the given premises, nor can its negation be derived from the premises provided.

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
From the premises:
- Leadership → Handles team dynamics.
- If Sarah handles team dynamics, then Alex stands out.
- If Alex stands out, then Sarah achieves success.

Assume Sarah does not achieve success. Then by contraposition of (Alex stands out → Sarah succeeds), Alex does not stand out. By contraposition of (Sarah handles → Alex stands out), Sarah does not handle team dynamics. By contraposition of (Leadership → Handles), Sarah does not have leadership. None of this yields Leadership Alex. There is no premise connecting Sarah’s lack of success to Alex having leadership. The statement and its negation are both not derivable from the given premises.
