Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
Dogs and Cats are animals with fur. Typically, animals with fur also have tails. If a Dog can bark, then it is a mammal. If a Cat can purr, then it is a carnivore. Either a Dog can bark or a Cat is a carnivore, or both. If a Tiger is a carnivore, then a Cat can purr. If a Wolf is a mammal, then a Dog can bark.

Question:
Can we conclude if a Tiger does not purr then a Dog has a tail?

--- Iteration 2 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
- From the context: Dogs and Cats have fur, and animals with fur have tails. Therefore, Dog has a tail unconditionally.
- Hence, regardless of whether Tiger purrs, the statement “if Tiger does not purr then Dog has a tail” is true.

--- Iteration 3 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
- From the premises: Dog has fur, and any animal with fur has a tail. Therefore, Dog has a tail unconditionally.
- Hence, regardless of whether Tiger purrs, the conditional “if Tiger does not purr then Dog has a tail” holds.
