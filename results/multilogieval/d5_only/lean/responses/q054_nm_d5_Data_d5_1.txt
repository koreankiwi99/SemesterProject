Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
In an office, managers and employees have leadership skills. Normally, individuals with leadership skills can handle team dynamics effectively. If a team leader communicates clearly and sets goals, the team achieves success. If an employee is proactive and takes initiative, they stand out in the organization. The team achieves success under a team leader who communicates clearly and sets goals, or an employee stands out who takes initiative, or both. If Alex stands out in the organization, then Sarah achieves success in the team. If Sarah handles team dynamics effectively, then Alex stands out in the organization.

Question:
Can we conclude if Sarah does not achieve success in the team then Alex does not have leadership skills?
