Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
Dogs and Cats are animals with fur. Typically, animals with fur also have tails. If a Dog can bark, then it is a mammal. If a Cat can purr, then it is a carnivore. Either a Dog can bark or a Cat is a carnivore, or both. If a Tiger is a carnivore, then a Cat can purr. If a Wolf is a mammal, then a Dog can bark.

Question:
Can we conclude if a Tiger does not purr then a Dog does not have a tail?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
- From Dog has fur and “fur ⇒ tail,” Dog has a tail.
- The queried implication is: if Tiger does not purr then Dog does not have a tail.
- Since Dog does have a tail from the premises, the conclusion “Dog does not have a tail” is false. Thus the implication would only be true if Tiger does purr (classically, (¬Purr Tiger → ¬Tail Dog) is equivalent to Purr Tiger when Tail Dog is true).
- But the premises do not give Purr Tiger (only Carnivore Tiger → Purr Cat), so we cannot conclude the queried implication.

--- Iteration 3 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
- From Dog has fur and “fur implies tail,” Dog has a tail.
- The queried implication is: if Tiger does not purr then Dog does not have a tail.
- Since Dog does have a tail from the premises, that implication would force Tiger to not fail to purr (it becomes equivalent to ¬¬(Tiger purrs)). The premises give no information to derive Tiger purring or ¬¬(Tiger purring).
- Therefore, we cannot conclude the queried implication.
