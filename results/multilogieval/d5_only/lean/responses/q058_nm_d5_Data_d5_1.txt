Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
Tom and Jerry are students who are diligent. Typically, diligent students also excel academically. If a student studies computer science, and they are skilled in coding, they can develop software. If a student chooses biology as their major and excels in laboratory work, they can pursue a career in research. Either a student studies computer science or a student can pursue a career in research, or both. If Peter has developed software, then Mary excels in laboratory work. If Tom excels academically, then Peter has developed software.

Question:
Can we conclude if Mary does not excel in laboratory work then Jerry does not excel academically?
