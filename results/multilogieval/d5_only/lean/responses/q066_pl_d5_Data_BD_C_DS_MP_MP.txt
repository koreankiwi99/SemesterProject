Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Ashley has a big physics exam tomorrow. She knows that if she studies 4 hours daily, she will ace the exam. If her friend invites her, Ashley will decide to take a break from studying and go. Either Ashley has been studying 4 hours everyday, or she did not take a break and go to the concert. Ashley knows that if she aces the exam, her high stress levels will decrease. When her stress goes down, Ashley feels recharged and refreshed.

Question:
If Ashley's friend invited her to a concert, then did Ashley feel recharged?
