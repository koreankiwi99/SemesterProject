Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Kim has a test coming up next week. If the test seems easy, Kim will not study much for it. Also, if Kim has other commitments, she will spend time on her hobbies instead of studying. It appears either the test will be easy or Kim will be busy, or both. If Kim does not study much for this test, she will feel relaxed leading up to test day. And if she is relaxed rather than stressed, she will likely perform well on the test.

Question:
If Kim did not spend time on her hobbies, then did she perform well on the test?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Easy : Prop
axiom OtherCommitments : Prop
axiom StudyMuch : Prop
axiom Hobbies : Prop
axiom Relaxed : Prop
axiom PerformWell : Prop

-- Premises from the textual context
axiom easy_implies_not_study : Easy → ¬StudyMuch
axiom other_implies_hobbies : OtherCommitments → Hobbies
axiom easy_or_other : Easy ∨ OtherCommitments
axiom notstudy_implies_relaxed : ¬StudyMuch → Relaxed
axiom relaxed_implies_perform : Relaxed → PerformWell

-- Goal: If Kim did not spend time on her hobbies, then she performed well
theorem conclusion : ¬Hobbies → PerformWell := by
  intro nh
  -- From ¬Hobbies and (Other → Hobbies), get ¬Other
  have nOther : ¬OtherCommitments := by
    intro o
    have h : Hobbies := other_implies_hobbies o
    exact nh h
  -- From Easy ∨ Other and ¬Other, get Easy
  have e : Easy := by
    cases easy_or_other with
    | inl e => exact e
    | inr o => exact False.elim (nOther o)
  -- Chain implications to get PerformWell
  have nS : ¬StudyMuch := easy_implies_not_study e
  have r : Relaxed := notstudy_implies_relaxed nS
