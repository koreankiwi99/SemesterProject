Context:
Mary was baking a cake for John's graduation party today. She knew that if the oven is preheated properly, the cake will bake evenly all over. At the same time, Mary knew it was John's graduation ceremony today. If it is John's graduation today, his family will bake a cake to celebrate the occasion. Either the oven was preheated correctly, or John's family did not bake a cake. Mary knows that if the cake bakes evenly throughout, it will taste delicious. If the cake tastes great, then John will be absolutely thrilled with it.

Question:
If it is John's graduation ceremony today, then is John thrilled with the cake?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom GraduationToday : Prop
axiom OvenPreheatedProperly : Prop
axiom CakeBakesEvenly : Prop
axiom FamilyBakesCake : Prop
axiom CakeTastesDelicious : Prop
axiom JohnThrilled : Prop

axiom h1 : OvenPreheatedProperly → CakeBakesEvenly
axiom h2 : GraduationToday → FamilyBakesCake
axiom h3 : OvenPreheatedProperly ∨ ¬ FamilyBakesCake
axiom h4 : CakeBakesEvenly → CakeTastesDelicious
axiom h5 : CakeTastesDelicious → JohnThrilled

theorem goal : GraduationToday → JohnThrilled := by

  have p : OvenPreheatedProperly := by
    cases h3 with
    | inl p => exact p
    | inr notF => exact False.elim (notF f)
