Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
James was preparing for an important cycling race. He decided to train hard so he could increase his biking speed. James knew if he cycled faster, he would be able to finish the race quickly. In addition to training, James strived to either diligently fix up his bike, or train for the race, or make time for both activities. He realized that if he fixed his bike regularly, it would operate smoothly. Logically, if his bike operated smoothly, James would have a good chance of winning the race.

Question:
If James does not finish the race quickly, then does he win the race?

/- We model the story with propositional variables -/
axiom Train : Prop            -- James trains
axiom Faster : Prop           -- James cycles faster
axiom Quick : Prop            -- James finishes the race quickly
axiom FixBike : Prop          -- James fixes his bike
axiom Smooth : Prop           -- The bike operates smoothly
axiom Win : Prop              -- James wins the race

/- Premises extracted from the text -/
axiom trained : Train                                  -- "In addition to training" / he trains
axiom train_implies_faster : Train → Faster            -- training hard increases speed
axiom faster_implies_quick : Faster → Quick            -- cycling faster ⇒ finish quickly
axiom fix_or_train : FixBike ∨ Train                   -- he strives to fix or train or both
axiom fix_implies_smooth : FixBike → Smooth            -- fixing ⇒ smooth operation
axiom smooth_implies_win : Smooth → Win                -- smooth operation ⇒ win

/- Goal: If James does not finish quickly, then he wins the race. -/
