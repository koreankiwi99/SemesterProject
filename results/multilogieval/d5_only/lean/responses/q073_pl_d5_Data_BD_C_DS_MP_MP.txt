Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Lucy likes waking up early so she can exercise in the morning. Lucy also had a doctor's check-up scheduled today. She knows that if she has a doctor's appointment, she will need to skip her morning workout. Either Lucy woke up early, or she did not miss her morning exercise routine. Lucy understands that if she does exercise in the morning, she will feel exicted till evening. Whenever this happens, Lucy goes for a walk.

Question:
If Lucy had a doctor's appointment, then did she go for a walk?

LLM Response:
<lean>
-- We model the story with propositional predicates about Lucy.
axiom Appointment : Prop
axiom WokeEarly : Prop
axiom Exercise : Prop
axiom Excited : Prop
axiom Walk : Prop

-- Premises from the text:
-- 1) Lucy had a doctor's check-up scheduled today.
axiom appointment_today : Appointment
-- 2) If Lucy has a doctor's appointment, she will skip (not do) her morning workout.
axiom appointment_implies_skip : Appointment → ¬ Exercise
-- 3) Either Lucy woke up early, or she did not miss her morning exercise (i.e., she exercised).
axiom either_woke_or_exercise : WokeEarly ∨ Exercise
-- 4) Lucy likes waking up early so she can exercise in the morning (modelled as: if she woke early, then she exercises).
axiom woke_implies_exercise : WokeEarly → Exercise
-- 5) If she exercises in the morning, she will feel excited till evening.
axiom exercise_implies_excited : Exercise → Excited
-- 6) Whenever she feels excited till evening, she goes for a walk.
axiom excited_implies_walk : Excited → Walk

-- Goal: If Lucy had a doctor's appointment, then she went for a walk.
theorem went_for_walk_if_appointment : Appointment → Walk := by
  intro hA
  -- From (3) and (4), we obtain that Lucy exercised.

        exact woke_implies_exercise hWoke
    | inr hEx =>
        exact hEx
  -- From exercising, she felt excited till evening.
  have hExcited : Excited := exercise_implies_excited hExercise
  -- From being excited till evening, she went for a walk.
  exact excited_implies_walk hExcited
