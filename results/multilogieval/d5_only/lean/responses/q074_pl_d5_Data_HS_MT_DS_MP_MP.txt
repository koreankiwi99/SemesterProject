Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
An athlete wanted to compete in the Olympics and win a medal. She realized that if she trained intensely, she would be in peak physical condition. She knew that excellent conditioning would give her a competitive edge. Either the athlete was training hard, or she suffered an injury, or perhaps both happened. If she was injured, the athlete could not train fully. She understood that limited training would negatively impact her Olympic performance.

Question:
If the athlete does not have a competitive edge, is her Olympic performance impacted?

-- T: trained intensely/hard
-- P: peak physical condition
-- E: competitive edge
-- I: injured
-- LT: limited training
-- O: Olympic performance impacted

axiom h1 : T → P                 -- If she trained intensely, then peak condition.
axiom h2 : P → E                 -- Peak condition gives a competitive edge.
axiom h3 : T ∨ I                 -- Either she trained hard or she was injured (or both).
axiom h4 : I → LT                -- If injured, then limited training (could not train fully).
axiom h5 : LT → O                -- Limited training negatively impacts performance.

--- Iteration 2 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
- If she trained, then peak condition, which implies a competitive edge. So if she lacks a competitive edge, she did not train.
- Given either trained or injured, and not trained, it follows she was injured.
- If injured, then limited training; limited training negatively impacts Olympic performance.
Therefore, if she does not have a competitive edge, her Olympic performance is impacted.

--- Iteration 3 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: [natural language reasoning]
- If she trained intensely, then she’s in peak condition; peak condition implies a competitive edge. So if she lacks a competitive edge, she did not train intensely.
- Given either she trained or she was injured, and she did not train, it follows she was injured.
- If injured, then limited training; limited training negatively impacts Olympic performance.
Therefore, if she does not have a competitive edge, her Olympic performance is impacted.
