Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
At the end of a long workday, Sam considers how to spend his evening. If Sam has free time after work, he goes to the gym to workout. Also, if Sam's friend asks him to meet up, Sam gets coffee with him instead. It seems either Sam will have free time or his friend will want to meet up, maybe both. When Sam works out after work, it helps relieve stress from his job. And when Sam relieves stress from work, he gets good endorphins after his gym session.

Question:
If Sam did not get coffee with his friend, then did he get good endorphins after a workout?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom FreeTime : Prop
axiom FriendRequestsMeet : Prop
axiom Workout : Prop
axiom Coffee : Prop
axiom RelieveStress : Prop
axiom GoodEndorphins : Prop

-- Premises
axiom p1 : FreeTime → Workout
axiom p2 : FriendRequestsMeet → Coffee
axiom p3 : FreeTime ∨ FriendRequestsMeet
axiom p4 : Workout → RelieveStress
axiom p5 : RelieveStress → GoodEndorphins

-- Conclusion: If Sam did not get coffee, then he got good endorphins (after a workout).
theorem conclusion : ¬Coffee → GoodEndorphins := by
  intro hNotCoffee
  -- From (FriendRequestsMeet → Coffee) and ¬Coffee, infer ¬FriendRequestsMeet
  have hNotFR : ¬ FriendRequestsMeet := by
    intro hFR
    exact hNotCoffee (p2 hFR)
  -- From (FreeTime ∨ FriendRequestsMeet) and ¬FriendRequestsMeet, infer FreeTime
  have hFT : FreeTime := by
    cases p3 with
    | inl ft => exact ft
    | inr fr => exact False.elim (hNotFR fr)
  -- Chain implications to GoodEndorphins
  have hW : Workout := p1 hFT
  have hRS : RelieveStress := p4 hW
  exact p5 hRS
