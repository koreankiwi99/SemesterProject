Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Sarah is a diligent high school student who studies every day. She realized that if she studies daily, she better learns and absorbs the material. Sarah knows that if she learns the material well, she will earn good grades in her classes. Lately, Sarah makes sure that either she is studying consistently, or she is getting enough sleep - or sometimes both! Sarah has found that if she gets enough shut-eye, she feels well-rested the next day. She has learned that if she feels well-rested, it helps her stay healthy overall.

Question:
If Sarah does not earn good grades, then does she stay healthy?

LLM Response:
<lean>
-- Propositions about Sarah
axiom StudiesDaily : Prop
axiom LearnsMaterialWell : Prop
axiom EarnsGoodGrades : Prop
axiom StudyingConsistently : Prop
axiom GetsEnoughSleep : Prop
axiom FeelsWellRested : Prop
axiom StaysHealthy : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom fact_studies_daily : StudiesDaily
axiom studies_impl_learn : StudiesDaily → LearnsMaterialWell
axiom learn_impl_grades : LearnsMaterialWell → EarnsGoodGrades
axiom consistent_or_sleep : StudyingConsistently ∨ GetsEnoughSleep
axiom sleep_impl_rested : GetsEnoughSleep → FeelsWellRested
axiom rested_impl_healthy : FeelsWellRested → StaysHealthy

-- Goal: If Sarah does not earn good grades, then she stays healthy
theorem main_goal : (¬ EarnsGoodGrades) → StaysHealthy := by
  intro not_grades
  have grades : EarnsGoodGrades := learn_impl_grades (studies_impl_learn fact_studies_daily)
  have falsehood : False := not_grades grades
  exact False.elim falsehood
