Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
The soccer team had a big game today. They knew that if they trained hard, they would win the game. It was also Sam's birthday today. His friends decided that if it was his birthday, they would organize a surprise party. Either the soccer team trained hard, or Sam's friends did not organize a party. The team realized that if they won their game, they would go out to celebrate the victory. The team members knew that if they went out to celebrate, they would dance late into the night.

Question:
If it was Sam's birthday, then did the team dance late into the night?
