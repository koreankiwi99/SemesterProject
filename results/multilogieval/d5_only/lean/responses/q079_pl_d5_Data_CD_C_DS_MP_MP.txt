Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Jenny is hoping for an easy week. If there is a big storm coming, her school will cancel classes. Also, if Jenny finishes her project early, she'll get some extra free time. It seems either there will be a storm or she'll finish early, maybe both. If classes get cancelled, Jenny will have a relaxing day at home. And if she has a relaxing day at home, she'll feel mentally recharged.

Question:
If Jenny did not get extra free time, then did she feel recharged?
