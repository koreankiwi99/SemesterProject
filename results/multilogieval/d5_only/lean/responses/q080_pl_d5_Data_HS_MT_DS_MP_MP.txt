Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
A company wanted to increase its market share in a competitive industry. The executives realized that if they lowered prices, the company would become more competitive. They knew that if they were more competitive, their market share would likely increase. Either the company was lowering prices as a strategy, or customer demand was decreasing, or both were happening simultaneously. If customer demand was decreasing, it meant customers were becoming more price-sensitive. The executives understood that if customers were highly price-sensitive, the company would need to cut costs to maintain profitability.

Question:
If the company does not increase its market share, then does the company need to cut costs?

axiom premise1 : LowerPrices → MoreCompetitive
axiom premise2 : MoreCompetitive → IncreaseMarketShare
axiom premise3 : LowerPrices ∨ DemandDecreasing
axiom premise4 : DemandDecreasing → HighPriceSensitive
axiom premise5 : HighPriceSensitive → NeedCutCosts
