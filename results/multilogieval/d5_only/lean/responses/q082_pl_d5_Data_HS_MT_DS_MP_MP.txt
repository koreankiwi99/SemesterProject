Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
The basketball team wanted to start winning more games. The players realized that if they practiced team plays regularly, their execution would improve. And if their play execution improved, they could start winning more games. The team knew that either they were practicing hard, or their coach was providing new strategies, or both were happening. If the coach provided new strategies, the players would try new techniques and plays. The team understood that if they tried new techniques, their overall performance would improve.

Question:
If the team does not win more games, then does their performance improve?

Translating the scenario into propositional variables:
- PR: the team practices team plays regularly
- E: play execution improves
- W: the team wins more games
- H: the team is practicing hard
- S: the coach provides new strategies
- T: the players try new techniques and plays
- I: the overall performance improves
Premises:
1) PR → E
2) E → W
3) H ∨ S
4) S → T
5) T → I
Question: Does ¬W → I hold?

axiom PR : Prop
axiom E : Prop
axiom W : Prop
axiom H : Prop
axiom S : Prop
axiom T : Prop
axiom I : Prop

axiom pr_improves_exec : PR → E
axiom exec_implies_win : E → W
axiom hard_or_strategies : H ∨ S
axiom strategies_imply_try : S → T
axiom try_improves_perf : T → I

-- Some derivable consequences of the premises:

-- If the team practices team plays regularly, then they will win more games.
theorem win_from_regular_practice : PR → W := by
  intro hpr
  exact exec_implies_win (pr_improves_exec hpr)

-- If the coach provides new strategies, performance improves.
theorem perf_from_strategies : S → I := by
  intro hs
  exact try_improves_perf (strategies_imply_try hs)

-- If the team does not win more games, then execution did not improve (modus tollens on E → W).
theorem not_win_implies_not_exec : ¬ W → ¬ E := by
  intro hnotW
  intro hE
  exact hnotW (exec_implies_win hE)

/-
Attempt toward the query (¬W → I):
From ¬W we can derive ¬E (not_win_implies_not_exec), but the given premises only allow us to get I from S (via S → T → I).
The disjunction H ∨ S does not let us conclude S, so we cannot in general derive I from ¬W.
Hence, the implication (¬W → I) is not provable from the stated premises.
