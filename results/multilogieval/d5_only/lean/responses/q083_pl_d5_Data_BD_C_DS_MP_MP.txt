Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Nick heard that if the weather report predicts rain, he takes an umbrella when going out. Alex knows that if it's March Madness, he hosts basketball watching parties. Either the weather report predicted rain today, or Alex didn't host a party. Nick understands that if he takes an umbrella out, the living room gets very noisy during March Madness parties. If the living room gets too noisy, the neighbors complain about the noise.

Question:
If it's March Madness season, then do the neighbors complain about the noise?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom RainPred : Prop
axiom TakesUmb : Prop
axiom HostParty : Prop
axiom March : Prop
axiom NoisyLR : Prop
axiom NeighborComplain : Prop

axiom h1 : RainPred → TakesUmb
axiom h2 : March → HostParty
axiom h3 : RainPred ∨ ¬ HostParty
axiom h4 : TakesUmb → March → NoisyLR
axiom h5 : NoisyLR → NeighborComplain

theorem neighbors_complain_if_march : March → NeighborComplain := by
  intro m
  have host : HostParty := h2 m
  have r : RainPred :=
    Or.elim h3
      (fun r => r)
