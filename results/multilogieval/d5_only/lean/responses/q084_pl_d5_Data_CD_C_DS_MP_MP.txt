Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Context:
My family likes camping when the weather is nice. If it's beautiful this weekend, we'll go camping together. Also, if my brother's car needs repairs, he'll get it fixed first. It seems either the weather will be nice or my brother will need car repairs, maybe both. If we go camping, we'll enjoy time together in nature. And if we enjoy nature, we'll have a fun and relaxing camping trip.

Question:
If my brother did not get his car fixed, did we have a fun and relaxing camping trip?

axiom Nice : Prop
axiom Repairs : Prop
axiom Fixed : Prop
axiom Camping : Prop
axiom EnjoyNature : Prop
axiom FunRelaxingTrip : Prop
axiom LikesCamping : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom like_when_nice : Nice → LikesCamping
axiom nice_implies_camping : Nice → Camping
axiom repairs_implies_fixed : Repairs → Fixed
axiom nice_or_repairs : Nice ∨ Repairs
axiom camping_implies_enjoy : Camping → EnjoyNature
axiom enjoy_implies_fun : EnjoyNature → FunRelaxingTrip

-- Goal: If my brother did not get his car fixed, did we have a fun and relaxing camping trip?
theorem fun_if_not_fixed : ¬ Fixed → FunRelaxingTrip := by
  intro hNotFixed
  -- From Repairs → Fixed and ¬Fixed, conclude ¬Repairs
  have hNotRepairs : ¬ Repairs := by
    intro hRep
    exact hNotFixed (repairs_implies_fixed hRep)
  -- From Nice ∨ Repairs and ¬Repairs, conclude Nice
  have hNice : Nice := Or.elim nice_or_repairs (fun h => h) (fun hRep => False.elim (hNotRepairs hRep))
  -- Chain implications to FunRelaxingTrip
