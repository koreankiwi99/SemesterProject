Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Luis looks forward to the weekends when he can truly relax. If there is a big game today, Luis will watch it on TV. Also, if Luis finishes his work early, he'll go to the gym after. It seems either there is a big game or Luis gets done with work early, or maybe both will happen. If Luis watches the game on TV, he'll get totally engrossed in it. And if he gets engrossed in the game, he'll have a fun and relaxing evening.

Question:
If Luis did not go to the gym after work, then did he have a fun and relaxing evening?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom BigGameToday : Prop
axiom WatchesOnTV : Prop
axiom FinishesWorkEarly : Prop
axiom GoesToGymAfter : Prop
axiom GetsEngrossed : Prop
axiom HasFunRelaxingEvening : Prop

axiom h1 : BigGameToday → WatchesOnTV
axiom h2 : FinishesWorkEarly → GoesToGymAfter
axiom h3 : BigGameToday ∨ FinishesWorkEarly
axiom h4 : WatchesOnTV → GetsEngrossed
axiom h5 : GetsEngrossed → HasFunRelaxingEvening

theorem main :
  (¬GoesToGymAfter) → HasFunRelaxingEvening := by
  intro hnotG
  have hNotF : ¬FinishesWorkEarly := by
    intro hF
    exact hnotG (h2 hF)
  have hB : BigGameToday := by
    cases h3 with
    | inl hb => exact hb
    | inr hF => exact (False.elim (hNotF hF))
