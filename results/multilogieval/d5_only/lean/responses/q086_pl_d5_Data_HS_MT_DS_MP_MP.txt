Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
The chef at a popular restaurant decided that if he added more salt to the soup, it would enhance the flavor. However, he soon realized that if the soup tasted too salty, customers would send it back to the kitchen. The chef was either adding more salt to the soup as an experiment, or he was experimenting with entirely new recipes, or perhaps both. If the chef was experimenting with new recipes, he ended up using some unusual ingredient combinations. The chef knew that if he used unusual combinations, the restaurant menu would start to have more eclectic offerings.

Question:
If customers do not send the soup back to the kitchen, then does the restaurant menu have eclectic offerings?

The target question is whether (¬SendBack → EclecticMenu) follows from the premises.
We show a countermodel (at the level of pure propositional logic) witnessing that the
premises can all hold while (¬SendBack → EclecticMenu) is false. Hence the implication
is not derivable from the given premises alone.
