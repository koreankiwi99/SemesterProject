Context:
School is out for summer vacation. The kids know if it's summer, they can sleep in late. Meanwhile, Grandma is visiting this week. When Grandma visits, she always makes a huge breakfast for the family. Either it's summer vacation, or Grandma didn't make breakfast. The kids know if they sleep in late, the kitchen will be busy with Grandma cooking up a big breakfast. Whenever the kitchen is busy, the dog sits waiting for someone to slip him some tasty scraps.

Question:
If Grandma is visiting, does the dog beg for scraps?

<lean>
axiom Summer : Prop
axiom SleepIn : Prop
axiom Visiting : Prop
axiom Breakfast : Prop
axiom BusyKitchen : Prop
axiom DogBegs : Prop

-- Premises from the story
axiom school_out : Summer
axiom kids_sleep_in_if_summer : Summer → SleepIn
axiom grandma_visiting_this_week : Visiting
axiom visiting_implies_breakfast : Visiting → Breakfast
axiom summer_or_no_breakfast : Summer ∨ ¬Breakfast
axiom sleep_in_implies_busy_kitchen : SleepIn → BusyKitchen
axiom busy_kitchen_implies_dog_begs : BusyKitchen → DogBegs

-- Goal: If Grandma is visiting, the dog begs for scraps.
theorem dog_begs_if_grandma_visits : Visiting → DogBegs := by

  have s : Summer := school_out
  have si : SleepIn := kids_sleep_in_if_summer s
  have bk : BusyKitchen := sleep_in_implies_busy_kitchen si
