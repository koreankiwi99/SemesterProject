Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Jessica woke up eager to make plans for her day off. If the weather is nice today, she will go for a hike. Also, if Jessica has the day off work, she will relax at home. It seems either the weather will be nice or Jessica has the day off, maybe both. If Jessica goes for a hike, she will get to enjoy the fresh air. And if she enjoys the fresh air, then she will feel rejuvenated afterwards.

Question:
If Jessica did not relax at home, then did she feel rejuvenated?
