Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Ashley wanted to advance her career, so she made an effort to network with professionals in her industry. She realized that if she networked consistently, she would build meaningful connections. And if Ashley built these connections, she would hear about new job opportunities. Ashley strived to either network diligently, or work on improving her skills, or make time for both career development activities. She knew that if she worked on her skills, she would become more qualified for higher level roles. Logically, if Ashley became more qualified, she could advance her career over time.

Question:
If Ashley does not hear about new job opportunities, then does she advance her career?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom N : Prop        -- Ashley networks diligently/consistently
axiom C : Prop        -- Ashley builds meaningful connections
axiom J : Prop        -- Ashley hears about new job opportunities
axiom S : Prop        -- Ashley works on improving her skills
axiom Q : Prop        -- Ashley becomes more qualified
axiom Adv : Prop      -- Ashley advances her career

-- Premises from the text
axiom h1 : N → C         -- If Ashley networks consistently, she builds connections.
axiom h2 : C → J         -- If Ashley builds connections, she hears about new job opportunities.
axiom h3 : N ∨ S         -- Ashley either networks diligently or works on improving her skills (or both).
axiom h4 : S → Q         -- If Ashley works on her skills, she becomes more qualified.
axiom h5 : Q → Adv       -- If Ashley becomes more qualified, she advances her career.

-- Goal: If Ashley does not hear about new job opportunities, then she advances her career.
