Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Amy woke up eager to make plans for the beautiful day. If the weather is nice, she will go on a hike. Also, if Amy has no pressing work deadlines, she will take the day off. It seems either the weather will be nice or Amy will have no deadlines, maybe both. If Amy goes on a hike, she always enjoys the fresh air and nature. And if she enjoys the fresh air, she ends up feeling rejuvenated and re-energized.

Question:
If Amy did not take the day off, then did she feel rejuvenated?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom WeatherNice : Prop
axiom Hike : Prop
axiom NoDeadlines : Prop
axiom TakeOff : Prop
axiom EnjoyFreshAir : Prop
axiom Rejuvenated : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom h1 : WeatherNice → Hike
axiom h2 : NoDeadlines → TakeOff
axiom h3 : WeatherNice ∨ NoDeadlines
axiom h4 : Hike → EnjoyFreshAir
axiom h5 : EnjoyFreshAir → Rejuvenated

-- Goal: If Amy did not take the day off, then she felt rejuvenated.
theorem goal : ¬TakeOff → Rejuvenated := by
  intro hNotT
  have hNotN : ¬NoDeadlines := by
    intro hN
    exact hNotT (h2 hN)
  have hW : WeatherNice := by
    cases h3 with
    | inl hW => exact hW
    | inr hN => exact False.elim (hNotN hN)
  have hH : Hike := h1 hW
  have hF : EnjoyFreshAir := h4 hH
  exact h5 hF
