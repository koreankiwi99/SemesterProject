Context:
Jane has an exciting day coming up. If her friends invite her to a concert, she'll buy tickets to go with them. Also, if her grandmother is visiting from out of town, Jane will stay home to spend time with her. It seems either Jane will be invited to a concert or grandma will visit, maybe both. If Jane buys tickets, she'll have fun with her friends at the show. And if she has fun with her friends, that means she enjoyed the concert.

Question:
If Jane did not stay home with grandma, then did she enjoy the concert?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Invite : Prop
axiom BuyTickets : Prop
axiom GrandmaVisits : Prop
axiom StayHome : Prop
axiom Fun : Prop
axiom Enjoyed : Prop

axiom h1 : Invite → BuyTickets
axiom h2 : GrandmaVisits → StayHome
axiom h3 : Invite ∨ GrandmaVisits
axiom h4 : BuyTickets → Fun
axiom h5 : Fun → Enjoyed

theorem goal : (¬ StayHome) → Enjoyed := by
  intro nHome
  cases h3 with
  | inl inv =>
      have bt : BuyTickets := h1 inv
      have hf : Fun := h4 bt
      exact h5 hf
  | inr gv =>
      have sh : StayHome := h2 gv
      have contra : False := nHome sh
      exact False.elim contra
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
