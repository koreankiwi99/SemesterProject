Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Mark had a biology test coming up. He knew that if he studied hard, he would pass the test. If it was Valentine's day, Mark would buy roses for his girlfriend. Either Mark studied hard, or he did not buy roses. Mark understood that if he passed his biology test, he would feel very proud. Whenever Mark felt proud, he would have a big smile on his face.

Question:
If it was Valentine's day, then did Mark have a big smile?

axiom Passed : Prop
axiom BoughtRoses : Prop
axiom Proud : Prop
axiom BigSmile : Prop

axiom hSP : StudiedHard → Passed
axiom hVR : Valentines → BoughtRoses
axiom hSorNotR : StudiedHard ∨ ¬ BoughtRoses
axiom hPP : Passed → Proud
axiom hPB : Proud → BigSmile
