Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Mark has been waiting to find out if his business trip will conflict with his family vacation. If his business trip gets canceled, he'll get to go on the family vacation after all. Also, if Mark wins an award at work, his boss will give him a bonus. It seems either his trip will be canceled or he'll win an award, maybe both. If Mark gets to go on the family vacation, he'll get to enjoy more time with his loved ones. And if he gets more family time, he'll feel fortunate overall.

Question:
If Mark did not get a bonus, then did he feel fortunate?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom T : Prop  -- Trip canceled
axiom W : Prop  -- Wins award
axiom B : Prop  -- Gets bonus
axiom V : Prop  -- Gets to go on family vacation
axiom F : Prop  -- Gets more family time
axiom G : Prop  -- Feels fortunate

axiom h1 : T → V      -- If trip is canceled, then vacation
axiom h2 : W → B      -- If wins award, then bonus
axiom h3 : T ∨ W      -- Either trip canceled or wins award (or both)
axiom h4 : V → F      -- If vacation, then more family time
axiom h5 : F → G      -- If more family time, then feels fortunate

theorem goal : ¬B → G := by
  intro notB
  have notW : ¬W := by
    intro w
    exact notB (h2 w)
  have t : T := Or.elim h3 (fun t => t) (fun w => False.elim (notW w))
  have v : V := h1 t
  have f : F := h4 v
  have g : G := h5 f
