Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Jessica aims to finish all her homework before she relaxes at night. She knows that if she finishes her homework, she'll have time to relax before bed. If her friend calls, Jessica will likely talk with her for an hour or more. Either Jessica finished her homework, or she didn't talk with her friend for an hour. Jessica realizes that if she relaxes before bed, she'll feel tired when it's time to sleep. And if she feels tired, she'll fall asleep quickly once she's in bed.

Question:
If Jessica's friend calls her on the phone, then does Jessica fall asleep quickly when she goes to bed?
