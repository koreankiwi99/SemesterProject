Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Jeff worked a busy 9-5 office job that required him to stay focused. He learned that if he ate a nutritious breakfast every morning, he would have more energy during the mornings at work. And if he had more morning energy, he could stay focused and productive at his job. Jeff realized that either he was eating breakfast daily, or he was going to bed early enough, or he was doing both. If Jeff went to bed early, he would get enough quality sleep. And Jeff knew that if he got enough sleep, he would go for a walk in the morning.

Question:
If Jeff does not stay focused at work, then is he going for a walk in the morning?
