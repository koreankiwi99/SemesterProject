Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Kim was taking some very challenging college courses. She realized that if she took good notes during lectures, she would understand the material better. And if she understood the lectures, she could perform well on exams. Kim knew that either she was taking good notes, or she had formed a study group, or she was doing both. If Kim formed a study group, they would review material together. Kim understood that if she reviewed material with classmates, she would feel fully prepared before exams.

Question:
If Kim does not perform well on exams, then does she feel prepared for exams?
