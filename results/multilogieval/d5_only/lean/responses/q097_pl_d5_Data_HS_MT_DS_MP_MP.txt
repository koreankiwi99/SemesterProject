Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Jessica set a goal to run a marathon. She learned that if she trained consistently, she could increase her endurance and stamina. Jessica knew that if her endurance improved, she could complete the 26.2 mile marathon. To complement her training, Jessica made sure she either trained regularly, or ate nutritious foods, or did both. Eating nutritious foods gave Jessica more steady energy for her workouts. With this extra energy, Jessica found she could train harder while staying injury-free on her road to marathon success.

Question:
If Jessica does not complete the marathon, then does she stay injury-free during training?

<lean>
axiom Trained : Prop
axiom EnduranceImproved : Prop
axiom StaminaIncreased : Prop
axiom CompleteMarathon : Prop
axiom AteNutritious : Prop
axiom ExtraEnergy : Prop
axiom TrainHarder : Prop
axiom InjuryFree : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom p1 : Trained → (EnduranceImproved ∧ StaminaIncreased)
axiom p2 : EnduranceImproved → CompleteMarathon
axiom p3 : Trained ∨ AteNutritious
axiom p4 : AteNutritious → ExtraEnergy
axiom p5 : ExtraEnergy → (TrainHarder ∧ InjuryFree)

theorem goal : ¬CompleteMarathon → InjuryFree := by

  -- From training to completion via endurance
  have h1 : Trained → CompleteMarathon := by
    intro t
    have he : EnduranceImproved := (p1 t).left
    exact p2 he
  -- If she did not complete, then she did not train
  have hnt : ¬Trained := by

  -- From (Trained ∨ Ate) and ¬Trained, deduce Ate
