Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Carol decided to adopt a puppy, hoping for a loving companion in her life. She realized that having a devoted pet would make her feel less lonely. Whether Carol adopted the puppy, or joined a local hiking group, or did both, she hoped these steps would enrich her life. If Carol joined a hiking group, it would allow her to meet and make new friends. And making new connections would lead to an improved social life for Carol.

Question:
If Carol does not feel less lonely, then has her social life improved?

axiom Adopted : Prop

-- Premises extracted from the text
-- 1) Adopting a puppy gives Carol a devoted pet
axiom adopt_implies_pet : Adopted → DevotedPet
-- 2) Having a devoted pet makes Carol feel less lonely
axiom pet_implies_less_lonely : DevotedPet → LessLonely
-- 3) If Carol joined a hiking group, she would meet and make new friends
axiom join_implies_connections : JoinedGroup → MakingConnections
-- 4) Making new connections leads to an improved social life
axiom connections_improve_social_life : MakingConnections → ImprovedSocialLife
-- 5) Carol either adopted the puppy, or joined a hiking group, or both
axiom adopt_or_join : Adopted ∨ JoinedGroup

-- From (3) and (4)
theorem join_improves_social_life : JoinedGroup → ImprovedSocialLife := by
  intro hJ
  exact connections_improve_social_life (join_implies_connections hJ)

-- If she is not less lonely, then she did not adopt (since adoption would yield a devoted pet and hence less loneliness).
-- Using the disjunction (adopted or joined), this forces that she joined.

  -- From Adopted ∨ JoinedGroup and ¬Adopted, deduce JoinedGroup
