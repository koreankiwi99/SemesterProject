Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Abby works hard to take care of her health. She knows that if she drinks plenty of water daily, she will be properly hydrated. Having proper hydration gives Abby high energy levels throughout the day. Abby also understands that either she drinks lots of water, or eats a balanced diet, or does both, to feel her best. Eating a nutritious diet ensures that Abby gets all the nutrients she needs. And by meeting her nutritional needs with food, Abby is able to maintain good overall health.

Question:
If Abby does not experience high energy levels, then does she maintain good health?
