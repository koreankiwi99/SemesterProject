Context:
Susan looks forward to every wedding anniversary. If it is Susan's anniversary, her husband buys her flowers. Also, if her favorite restaurant has a table available, Susan and her husband will have dinner there. It seems either it will be Susan's anniversary or there will be a table open at the restaurant, maybe both. If her husband buys Susan flowers, she will feel loved and appreciated. And if Susan feels loved, then she will have a romantic anniversary overall.

Question:
If Susan and her husband did not have dinner at the restaurant, then did Susan have a romantic anniversary?
