Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
The factory manager knew that if production increases, more workers need to be hired. The marketing director realized that if a new model is released, demand will be high. Either production increased, or demand for the new phone was low. The factory manager understood that if more workers were hired, wages would increase. If wages increased, applications to work at the factory would rise.

Question:
If the company released a new model phone, then did applications to work at the factory rise?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom ProductionIncreased : Prop
axiom MoreWorkersHired : Prop
axiom NewModelReleased : Prop
axiom DemandHigh : Prop
axiom DemandLow : Prop
axiom WagesIncreased : Prop
axiom ApplicationsRise : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom p1 : ProductionIncreased → MoreWorkersHired
axiom p2 : NewModelReleased → DemandHigh
axiom p3 : ProductionIncreased ∨ DemandLow
axiom p4 : MoreWorkersHired → WagesIncreased
axiom p5 : WagesIncreased → ApplicationsRise

-- Natural exclusivity: if demand is high, it is not low
axiom high_not_low : DemandHigh → ¬ DemandLow

theorem applications_rise_if_new_model_released : NewModelReleased → ApplicationsRise := by
  intro hRel
  have hHigh : DemandHigh := p2 hRel
  have hNotLow : ¬ DemandLow := high_not_low hHigh
  have hProd : ProductionIncreased := by
    cases p3 with
    | inl hP => exact hP
    | inr hLow => exact False.elim (hNotLow hLow)
