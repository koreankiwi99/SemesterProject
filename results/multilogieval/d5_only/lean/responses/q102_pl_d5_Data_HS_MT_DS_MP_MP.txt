Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Dan wanted to get in better shape. He decided to start a new workout routine to become more active. Dan knew being active regularly would help him gain strength and energy. Whether Dan started a workout routine or made healthy meal plans, he was taking steps to improve his health. If Dan planned healthy meals, he would start eating a more nutritious diet. Eating well combined with exercise meant Dan could achieve his fitness goals.

Question:
If Dan does not gain strength and energy, then does he achieve his fitness goals?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom WorkoutRoutine : Prop
axiom HealthyMealPlans : Prop
axiom TakingSteps : Prop
axiom ActiveRegularly : Prop
axiom GainStrengthEnergy : Prop
axiom EatingWell : Prop
axiom Exercise : Prop
axiom FitnessGoals : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom started_workout : WorkoutRoutine
axiom active_implies_gain : ActiveRegularly → GainStrengthEnergy
axiom steps_if_wr_or_hm : (WorkoutRoutine ∨ HealthyMealPlans) → TakingSteps
axiom healthy_meals_implies_eating_well : HealthyMealPlans → EatingWell
axiom eating_well_and_exercise_implies_goals : EatingWell ∧ Exercise → FitnessGoals
axiom workout_implies_exercise : WorkoutRoutine → Exercise

-- Some consequences we can derive
theorem exercise_true : Exercise :=
  workout_implies_exercise started_workout

theorem steps_taken : TakingSteps :=
  steps_if_wr_or_hm (Or.inl started_workout)

theorem goals_if_healthy_meals : HealthyMealPlans → FitnessGoals := by
  intro hHM
  have hE : EatingWell := healthy_meals_implies_eating_well hHM
  have hX : Exercise := exercise_true
  exact eating_well_and_exercise_implies_goals ⟨hE, hX⟩
