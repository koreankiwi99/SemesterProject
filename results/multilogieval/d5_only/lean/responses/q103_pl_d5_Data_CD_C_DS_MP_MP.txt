Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Sam has an important day coming up - his birthday! If it's his birthday, his family will take him out to dinner to celebrate. Also, if Sam has a big project due at work tomorrow, he may end up working late at the office tonight. It seems either it will be his birthday or he'll have a project due, maybe both. If his family takes him out, naturally Sam will get to celebrate with them. And we know if Sam celebrates with family, he'll have a nice birthday dinner.

Question:
If Sam did not work late at the office, then did he have a nice birthday dinner?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Bday : Prop
axiom ProjectDue : Prop
axiom WorkLate : Prop
axiom FamilyOut : Prop
axiom Celebrate : Prop
axiom NiceDinner : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom bday_implies_out : Bday → FamilyOut
axiom project_implies_late : ProjectDue → WorkLate
axiom either_bday_or_project : Bday ∨ ProjectDue
axiom out_implies_celebrate : FamilyOut → Celebrate
axiom celebrate_implies_nice : Celebrate → NiceDinner

-- Conclusion: If Sam did not work late, then he had a nice birthday dinner.

  -- From ¬WorkLate and (ProjectDue → WorkLate), we get ¬ProjectDue
