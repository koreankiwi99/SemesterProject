Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
It's a beautiful sunny day. James notes that if it's sunny out, the community pool will open for the season today. If the lifeguards are scheduled, that means they'll show up for their shift. Either it's sunny out, or the lifeguards didn't come in today. James knows that if the pool opens, kids will start playing in it right away. And if kids are playing, the lifeguards on duty have to stay alert to watch them carefully.

Question:
If the lifeguards are scheduled to work, then do the lifeguards stay alert watching the kids?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Sunny : Prop
axiom PoolOpens : Prop
axiom Scheduled : Prop
axiom ShowUp : Prop
axiom KidsPlaying : Prop
axiom GuardsAlert : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom sunny_today : Sunny
axiom sunny_implies_open : Sunny → PoolOpens
axiom scheduled_implies_show : Scheduled → ShowUp
axiom sunny_or_not_show : Sunny ∨ ¬ ShowUp
axiom open_implies_kids : PoolOpens → KidsPlaying
axiom kids_implies_alert : KidsPlaying → GuardsAlert

-- Conclusion: If the lifeguards are scheduled, they stay alert watching the kids.
theorem lifeguards_alert_if_scheduled : Scheduled → GuardsAlert := by
