Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
John always tries his best in school. If he studies hard for a class, he gets good grades on the assignments. Also, if the professor cancels a class, John uses the free time to relax and watch TV. It seems either John will study hard or get a free period, perhaps both. If John gets good grades on the assignments, then he will be well prepared for the exams. And if John is well prepared for the exams, he will perform well in the course overall.

Question:
If John did not relax and watch TV, then did he perform well in the course?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom StudiesHard : Prop          -- John studies hard for a class (S)
axiom GoodGrades : Prop           -- John gets good grades on assignments (G)
axiom ClassCanceled : Prop        -- The professor cancels a class (C), i.e., John gets a free period
axiom Relaxes : Prop              -- John relaxes and watches TV (R)
axiom Prepared : Prop             -- John is well prepared for the exams (P)
axiom PerformsWell : Prop         -- John performs well in the course overall (W)

-- Premises from the text
axiom hSG : StudiesHard → GoodGrades        -- If he studies hard, he gets good grades.
axiom hCR : ClassCanceled → Relaxes         -- If class is canceled, he relaxes and watches TV.
axiom hSC : StudiesHard ∨ ClassCanceled     -- He will study hard or get a free period (or both).
axiom hGP : GoodGrades → Prepared           -- If he gets good grades, he is well prepared.
axiom hPW : Prepared → PerformsWell         -- If he is well prepared, he performs well overall.

-- Target: If John did not relax and watch TV, then he performed well in the course.
theorem conclusion : (¬ Relaxes) → PerformsWell := by
  intro notR
  -- From ¬R and (C → R), we get ¬C
  have notC : ¬ ClassCanceled := by
    intro c
    exact notR (hCR c)
  -- From S ∨ C and ¬C, we derive S
  have hs : StudiesHard := by
    cases hSC with
    | inl hs => exact hs
    | inr hc => exact False.elim (notC hc)
  -- Chain implications S → G → P → W
  have gg : GoodGrades := hSG hs
  have prep : Prepared := hGP gg
