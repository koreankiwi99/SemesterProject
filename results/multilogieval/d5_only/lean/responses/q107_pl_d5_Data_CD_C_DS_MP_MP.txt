Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
My team has been working hard to finish a big project this week. If the project is completed on time, the client will be satisfied with our work. Also, if the team works late nights all week, then team will be sick. It seems either we'll finish on time or team will be sick, maybe both. If the client is satisfied, then our company will likely get a positive review from them. And if we get a positive review, then we'll gain more business from referrals.

Question:
If the team will not be sick, then did we gain more business from referrals?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom OnTime : Prop
axiom Sick : Prop
axiom WorksLate : Prop
axiom Satisfied : Prop
axiom PositiveReview : Prop
axiom MoreBusiness : Prop

axiom ontime_implies_satisfied : OnTime → Satisfied
axiom workslate_implies_sick : WorksLate → Sick
axiom ontime_or_sick : OnTime ∨ Sick
axiom satisfied_implies_positive : Satisfied → PositiveReview
axiom positive_implies_business : PositiveReview → MoreBusiness

theorem not_sick_implies_business : ¬ Sick → MoreBusiness := by
  intro hNotSick
  have hOnTime : OnTime := by
    cases ontime_or_sick with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr hs => exact False.elim (hNotSick hs)
  exact positive_implies_business (satisfied_implies_positive (ontime_implies_satisfied hOnTime))
