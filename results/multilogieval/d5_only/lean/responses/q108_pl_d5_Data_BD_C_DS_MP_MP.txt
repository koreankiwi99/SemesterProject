Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Jim makes sure to water his vegetable garden every day. He knows if he does this, he'll have a huge harvest this season. If Susan takes a day off, she goes hiking in the mountains to unwind. Either Jim is watering his garden daily, or Susan did not go hiking today. Jim realizes that if he has a bountiful harvest, he can share his fresh organic vegetables. When Jim shares his produce, it brings the community together for a potluck dinner.

Question:
If Susan took the day off work, then did the neighborhood have a community potluck?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom WateringDaily : Prop
axiom Harvest : Prop
axiom DayOff : Prop
axiom Hiking : Prop
axiom Shares : Prop
axiom Potluck : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom water_fact : WateringDaily
axiom water_imp_harvest : WateringDaily → Harvest
axiom dayoff_imp_hiking : DayOff → Hiking
axiom disj : WateringDaily ∨ ¬ Hiking
axiom harvest_imp_shares : Harvest → Shares
axiom shares_imp_potluck : Shares → Potluck

-- Goal: If Susan took the day off work, then the neighborhood had a community potluck.
