Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Alice knew that if she wins the race, she would be awarded a big trophy. If Bob ate a large meal beforehand, he would likely get a stomach ache during the race. Either Alice won the race, or Bob did not get a stomach ache. Alice's coach understood that if she was awarded a trophy, she would want to celebrate her win. Whenever Alice celebrated a victory, she went out for ice cream after.

Question:
If Bob ate a big meal before the race, then did Alice go out for ice cream?
