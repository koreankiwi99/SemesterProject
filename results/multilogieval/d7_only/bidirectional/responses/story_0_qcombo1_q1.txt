Story ID: 0
Example ID: combo1_q1
Premises: If Emma attends the art workshop, then she learns new techniques. Whenever she learns new techniques, her artwork improves. If the gallery hosts a critique session, then artists receive valuable feedback. Either Emma attends the workshop or the gallery hosts a critique session. When valuable feedback is received, Emma refines her portfolio. If she refines her portfolio, then her artistic vision sharpens, and if her vision sharpens, then her exhibits become more cohesive. Whenever her exhibits become more cohesive, she gains recognition.
Conclusion: If R is not true, then is X true?

Conclusion to analyze (in natural language):
"If R is not true, then X is true." i.e., (¬R → X)

We must PROVE the NEGATION of the conclusion from the premises, i.e., show:
¬(¬R → X)

Attempted proof (expected to fail): the premises do not relate X in any way,
nor do they let us derive ¬R; hence we cannot derive ¬(¬R → X).
