Premises: If Carlos attends the leadership seminar, then he gains new insights. Whenever he gains new insights, his management skills improve. If the HR department conducts a team-building event, then team collaboration improves. Either Carlos attends the seminar or the HR department conducts an event. When team collaboration improves, Carlos implements effective strategies. If he implements effective strategies, then his team meets project deadlines, and if his team meets project deadlines, then their productivity increases. Whenever their productivity increases, the company achieves its quarterly goals.
Conclusion: If R is not true, then is X true?
