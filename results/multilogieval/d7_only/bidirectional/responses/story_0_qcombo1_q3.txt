Premises: If Lily participates in the coding challenge, then she hones her programming skills. Whenever she hones her skills, her project efficiency improves. If the tech club hosts a hackathon, then participants innovate solutions. Either Lily participates in the challenge or the club hosts a hackathon. When solutions are innovated, Lily documents her process. If she documents her process, then she improves her technical communication, and if she improves her communication, then her project presentations become more compelling. Whenever her presentations become more compelling, she receives offers from tech companies.
Conclusion: If R is not true, then is X true?
