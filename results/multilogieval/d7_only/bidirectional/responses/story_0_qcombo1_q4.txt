Premises: If David attends the finance workshop, then he learns investment strategies. Whenever he learns strategies, his portfolio performance improves. If the firm provides market insights, then clients make informed decisions. Either David attends the workshop or the firm provides insights. When clients make informed decisions, David adjusts his financial plans. If he adjusts his plans, then his client relationships strengthen, and if his relationships strengthen, then his client retention rate increases. Whenever his client retention rate increases, his career prospects enhance.
Conclusion: If R is not true, then is X true?

/- The conclusion to analyze is "¬R → X".
   We must prove its negation: ¬(¬R → X), which is classically equivalent to (¬R ∧ ¬X).
   However, the premises above do not relate R or X to any other propositions,
   so this statement is not derivable from the given premises. -/
