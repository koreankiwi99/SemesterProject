Premises: If Emma enrolls in the advanced painting class, then she learns new artistic techniques. If the curator reviews the gallery submissions, then the curator selects the best pieces for exhibition. Either Emma enrolls in the advanced class, or the curator does not select the best pieces, or both. If Emma learns new artistic techniques, then she creates more expressive artworks. If she creates more expressive artworks, then art critics give favorable reviews. If art critics give favorable reviews, then Emma's exhibition gains popularity. If Emma's exhibition gains popularity, then she receives an art award.
Conclusion: If R is true, then is W true?
