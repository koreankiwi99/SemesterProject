Premises: If John participates in a leadership seminar, then he enhances his management skills. If the CEO evaluates the annual performance, then the CEO approves the new budget. Either John participates in the seminar, or the CEO does not approve the new budget, or both. If John enhances his management skills, then he implements more effective strategies. If he implements more effective strategies, then the team achieves higher productivity. If the team achieves higher productivity, then the department meets its goals efficiently. If the department meets its goals efficiently, then John receives a promotion.
Conclusion: If R is true, then is W true?

-- Propositions corresponding to statements in the premises
axiom JohnParticipatesLeadershipSeminar : Prop
axiom JohnEnhancesManagementSkills : Prop
axiom CEOEvaluatesAnnualPerformance : Prop
axiom CEOApprovesNewBudget : Prop
axiom JohnImplementsMoreEffectiveStrategies : Prop
axiom TeamAchievesHigherProductivity : Prop
axiom DepartmentMeetsGoalsEfficiently : Prop

-- Premises
axiom premise1 : JohnParticipatesLeadershipSeminar → JohnEnhancesManagementSkills
axiom premise2 : CEOEvaluatesAnnualPerformance → CEOApprovesNewBudget
axiom premise3 : JohnParticipatesLeadershipSeminar ∨ ¬ CEOApprovesNewBudget
axiom premise4 : JohnEnhancesManagementSkills → JohnImplementsMoreEffectiveStrategies
axiom premise5 : JohnImplementsMoreEffectiveStrategies → TeamAchievesHigherProductivity
axiom premise6 : TeamAchievesHigherProductivity → DepartmentMeetsGoalsEfficiently
axiom premise7 : DepartmentMeetsGoalsEfficiently → JohnReceivesPromotion

-- Interpreting R and W from the narrative:
-- R := Department meets its goals efficiently
-- W := John receives a promotion
def R : Prop := DepartmentMeetsGoalsEfficiently
def W : Prop := JohnReceivesPromotion

-- Goal: If R is true, then W is true.
