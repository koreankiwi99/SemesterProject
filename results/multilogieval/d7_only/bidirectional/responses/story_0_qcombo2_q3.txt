Premises: If Alex joins a coding bootcamp, then he learns advanced programming skills. If the project manager reviews the software requirements, then the team completes the software design. Either Alex joins the bootcamp, or the team does not complete the design, or both. If Alex learns advanced programming skills, then he develops more efficient code. If he develops more efficient code, then the software project is completed on time. If the software project is completed on time, then the client is satisfied with the project. If the client is satisfied with the project, then the company receives repeat business.
Conclusion: If R is true, then is W true?
