Premises: If Mia takes part in an international music competition, then she gains experience and exposure. If the judges evaluate all performances, then the judges award the top performers. Either Mia takes part in the competition, or the judges do not award the top performers, or both. If Mia gains experience and exposure, then she improves her musical skills. If she improves her musical skills, then she receives positive feedback from mentors. If she receives positive feedback from mentors, then her confidence grows. If her confidence grows, then she is invited to perform at prestigious events.
Conclusion: If R is true, then is W true?

Lean Code:
axiom M : Prop    -- Mia takes part in the competition
axiom R : Prop    -- Judges evaluate all performances
axiom W : Prop    -- Judges award the top performers
axiom G : Prop    -- Mia gains experience and exposure
axiom S : Prop    -- Mia improves her musical skills
axiom PF : Prop   -- Mia receives positive feedback from mentors
axiom C : Prop    -- Mia's confidence grows
axiom I : Prop    -- Mia is invited to perform at prestigious events

-- Premises
axiom p1 : M → G
axiom p2 : R → W
axiom p3 : M ∨ ¬ W
axiom p4 : G → S
