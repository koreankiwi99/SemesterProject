Premises: If Sarah completes her project proposal ahead of the deadline, then she has ample time to refine the details. If Sarah meets with her project advisor, then she receives valuable insights. Sarah is determined that she will either complete her proposal ahead of time or meet with her advisor, or do both. If Sarah receives valuable insights, then she incorporates the new ideas into her project. If she incorporates the new ideas into her project, then she creates an outstanding project. If Sarah collaborates with a team, then she brainstorms innovative solutions. She also plans that either she receives valuable insights or collaborates with a team, or both. If Sarah brainstorms innovative solutions, then her project presentation is engaging. If her project presentation is engaging, then she wins the best project award.
Conclusion: If Sarah did not have ample time to refine the details and did not create an outstanding project, did she win the best project award?
