Premises: If Tom compiles his research data meticulously, then he identifies key trends. If Tom discusses his findings with colleagues, then he receives constructive feedback. Tom ensures that he will either compile his data meticulously or discuss his findings with colleagues, or both. If Tom receives constructive feedback, then he adjusts his analysis methods. If he adjusts his analysis methods, then he achieves robust results. If Tom collaborates on a joint paper, then he refines the arguments. He also knows that either he receives constructive feedback or he collaborates on a joint paper, or both. If Tom refines the arguments, then the paper is logically coherent. If the paper is logically coherent, then it is published in a top journal.
Conclusion: If Tom did not identify key trends and did not achieve robust results, was the paper published in a top journal?
