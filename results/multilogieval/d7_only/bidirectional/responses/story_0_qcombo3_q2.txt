Premises: If Lily plans her meals in advance, then she maintains a balanced diet. If Lily consults a nutritionist, then she receives personalized nutrition advice. Lily is certain that she will either plan her meals in advance or consult a nutritionist, or both. If Lily receives personalized nutrition advice, then she adapts her eating habits. If she adapts her eating habits, then she improves her overall health. If Lily joins a cooking class, then she explores new recipes. She also anticipates that either she receives personalized nutrition advice or joins a cooking class, or both. If Lily explores new recipes, then she enjoys cooking at home. If she enjoys cooking at home, then she stays consistent with her healthy lifestyle.
Conclusion: If Lily did not maintain a balanced diet and did not improve her overall health, did she stay consistent with her healthy lifestyle?
