Premises: If Max sets up a backup system for his files, then he secures his data against loss. If Max attends a cybersecurity workshop, then he learns about the latest security protocols. Max has made sure that he will either set up a backup system or attend the cybersecurity workshop, or both. If Max learns about the latest security protocols, then he updates his software accordingly. If he updates his software accordingly, then he strengthens his digital security. If Max subscribes to a tech magazine, then he keeps up with technology trends. He also ensures that either he learns about the latest security protocols or subscribes to a tech magazine, or both. If Max keeps up with technology trends, then he effectively manages his tech resources. If he effectively manages his tech resources, then his productivity increases.
Conclusion: If Max did not secure his data against loss and did not strengthen his digital security, did his productivity increase?
