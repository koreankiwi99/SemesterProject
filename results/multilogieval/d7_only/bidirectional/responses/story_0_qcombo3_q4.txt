Premises: If Olivia explores different painting techniques, then she enhances her artistic skills. If Olivia attends art workshops, then she receives expert guidance. Olivia is dedicated to either exploring different painting techniques or attending art workshops, or both. If Olivia receives expert guidance, then she experiments with new mediums. If she experiments with new mediums, then she produces unique pieces of art. If Olivia collaborates with local artists, then she shares ideas and gains inspiration. She also commits to either receiving expert guidance or collaborating with local artists, or both. If Olivia shares ideas and gains inspiration, then her creativity flourishes. If her creativity flourishes, then her artwork gains recognition.
Conclusion: If Olivia did not enhance her artistic skills and did not produce unique pieces of art, did her artwork gain recognition?
