Premises: If Emily submits her thesis draft to the committee, then the committee provides feedback on the draft. If the committee provides feedback on the draft, then the thesis is approved for final defense. Emily's research team knows that either she submits the thesis draft or the team conducts an additional data analysis, or both. If the research team conducts an additional data analysis, then the analysis reveals new insights. If the librarian updates the research database, then access to scholarly resources improves. The team also believes that either they conduct an additional data analysis or access to scholarly resources does not improve, or both. If the analysis reveals new insights, then the final defense presentation is enhanced with new findings.
Conclusion: If the thesis was not approved for final defense and the librarian updated the research database, was the final defense presentation enhanced with new findings?
