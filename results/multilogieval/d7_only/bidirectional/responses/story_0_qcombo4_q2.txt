Premises: If Olivia submits the manuscript to the publisher, then the editor reviews the manuscript. If the editor reviews the manuscript, then the book is approved for publication. The author team knows that either Olivia submits the manuscript or the team conducts a peer review session, or both. If the author team conducts a peer review session, then the review identifies plot inconsistencies. If the graphic designer updates the cover art, then the visual appeal of the book improves. The team also believes that either they conduct a peer review session or the visual appeal of the book does not improve, or both. If the review identifies plot inconsistencies, then the final manuscript is revised with coherent plot lines.
Conclusion: If the book was not approved for publication and the graphic designer updated the cover art, was the final manuscript revised with coherent plot lines?
