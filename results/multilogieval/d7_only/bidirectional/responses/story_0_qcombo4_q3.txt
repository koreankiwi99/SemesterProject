Premises: If Mark submits the architectural plans to the city council, then the city council reviews the plans. If the city council reviews the plans, then the construction project is approved. The engineering team knows that either Mark submits the architectural plans or the team conducts a feasibility study, or both. If the engineering team conducts a feasibility study, then the study highlights structural weaknesses. If the safety inspector updates the site safety protocols, then the safety compliance of the project improves. The team also believes that either they conduct a feasibility study or the safety compliance of the project does not improve, or both. If the study highlights structural weaknesses, then the construction blueprint is revised to address structural issues.
Conclusion: If the construction project was not approved and the safety inspector updated the site safety protocols, was the construction blueprint revised to address structural issues?
