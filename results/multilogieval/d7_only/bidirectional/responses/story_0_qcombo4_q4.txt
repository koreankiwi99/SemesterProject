Premises: If Chloe submits the marketing proposal to the client, then the client reviews the proposal. If the client reviews the proposal, then the campaign is approved for execution. The advertising team knows that either Chloe submits the marketing proposal or the team conducts a focus group study, or both. If the advertising team conducts a focus group study, then the study reveals consumer preferences. If the analytics team updates the market segmentation data, then the targeting accuracy of the campaign improves. The team also believes that either they conduct a focus group study or the targeting accuracy of the campaign does not improve, or both. If the study reveals consumer preferences, then the campaign strategy is refined to meet consumer needs.
Conclusion: If the campaign was not approved for execution and the analytics team updated the market segmentation data, was the campaign strategy refined to meet consumer needs?
