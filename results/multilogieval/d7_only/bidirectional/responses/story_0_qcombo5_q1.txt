Premises: If the teacher submits a detailed lesson plan, then the department head approves the lesson plan. If the school board confirms the class schedule, then the class is officially on the calendar. Either the department head does not approve the lesson plan, or the class is not officially on the calendar, or both. If the teacher attends pedagogical seminars, then the teacher's instructional methods improve. If the teacher's instructional methods improve, then the students' test scores increase. Either the teacher attends pedagogical seminars, or the principal provides additional classroom resources, or both. If the principal provides additional classroom resources, then the teacher receives enhanced teaching materials. If the teacher receives enhanced teaching materials, then the class is highly effective.
Conclusion: If the teacher submits a detailed lesson plan and the students' test scores do not increase, is the class highly effective?
