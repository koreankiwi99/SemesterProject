Premises: If the author submits the complete manuscript, then the editor reviews the manuscript. If the publisher approves the book proposal, then the book is officially accepted for publication. Either the editor does not review the manuscript, or the book is not officially accepted for publication, or both. If the author attends writing workshops, then the author's writing style improves. If the author's writing style improves, then the book's critical reception improves. Either the author attends writing workshops, or the literary agent arranges additional feedback sessions, or both. If the literary agent arranges additional feedback sessions, then the author receives targeted editorial advice. If the author receives targeted editorial advice, then the book becomes a bestseller.
Conclusion: If the author submits the complete manuscript and the book's critical reception does not improve, does the book become a bestseller?
