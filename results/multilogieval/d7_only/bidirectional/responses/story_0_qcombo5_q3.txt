Premises: If the scientist submits a comprehensive grant proposal, then the funding committee evaluates the proposal. If the research institution approves the project, then the project is officially funded. Either the funding committee does not evaluate the proposal, or the project is not officially funded, or both. If the scientist attends scientific innovation workshops, then the research methodologies improve. If the research methodologies improve, then the project's success rate increases. Either the scientist attends scientific innovation workshops, or the collaborator provides additional data analysis support, or both. If the collaborator provides additional data analysis support, then the scientist receives advanced statistical tools. If the scientist receives advanced statistical tools, then the project achieves groundbreaking results.
Conclusion: If the scientist submits a comprehensive grant proposal and the project's success rate does not increase, does the project achieve groundbreaking results?
