Premises: If the musician submits a complete album draft, then the producer reviews the album. If the record label confirms the release date, then the album is officially scheduled for launch. Either the producer does not review the album, or the album is not officially scheduled for launch, or both. If the musician attends advanced music composition classes, then the musician's composition skills improve. If the musician's composition skills improve, then the album's critical acclaim increases. Either the musician attends advanced music composition classes, or the manager arranges additional recording sessions, or both. If the manager arranges additional recording sessions, then the musician receives professional studio feedback. If the musician receives professional studio feedback, then the album becomes a hit.
Conclusion: If the musician submits a complete album draft and the album's critical acclaim does not increase, does the album become a hit?
