Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: CD_DS_HS_CD_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If Mia prepares a detailed study plan, then she organizes her study materials efficiently. If Mia attends a study group session, then she gains new insights into the material. Mia is confident that she will either prepare a study plan or attend a study group session, or both. If Mia gains new insights into the material, then she practices a variety of problem sets. If she practices a variety of problem sets, then she masters the subject. If Mia discusses topics with a knowledgeable friend, then she reinforces her understanding through discussion. She also trusts that either she gains new insights or discusses topics with a friend, or both. If Mia reinforces her understanding through discussion, then she feels well-prepared for the exam. If she feels well-prepared for the exam, then she scores highly on the exam.

Question:
If Mia did not organize her study materials efficiently and did not master the subject, did she score highly on the exam?
