Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_BD_CT_DS_MP

Context:
If David submits the application for the grant, then the grant committee evaluates the application. If the grant committee evaluates the application, then the project receives grant funding. The research team anticipates that either David submits the application or the team works on a pilot study, or both. If the team works on a pilot study, then the study identifies key areas for improvement. If the lab installs new equipment, then the efficiency of experiments improves. The team also thinks that either they work on a pilot study or the efficiency of experiments does not improve, or both. If the study identifies key areas for improvement, then the project timeline is adjusted accordingly.

Question:
If the project did not receive grant funding and the lab installed new equipment, was the project timeline adjusted accordingly?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom DavidSubmits : Prop
axiom CommitteeEvaluates : Prop
axiom GrantFunding : Prop
axiom PilotStudy : Prop
axiom IdentifiesAreas : Prop
axiom NewEquipment : Prop
axiom EfficiencyImproves : Prop
axiom TimelineAdjusted : Prop

-- Premises
axiom a1 : DavidSubmits → CommitteeEvaluates
axiom a2 : CommitteeEvaluates → GrantFunding
axiom a3 : DavidSubmits ∨ PilotStudy
axiom a4 : PilotStudy → IdentifiesAreas
axiom a5 : NewEquipment → EfficiencyImproves
axiom a6 : PilotStudy ∨ ¬ EfficiencyImproves
axiom a7 : IdentifiesAreas → TimelineAdjusted

-- Conclusion to prove: If the project did not receive grant funding and the lab installed new equipment, then the project timeline was adjusted accordingly.
theorem timeline_adjusted : (¬ GrantFunding ∧ NewEquipment) → TimelineAdjusted := by
  intro h
  have hNotG : ¬ GrantFunding := And.left h
  -- From DavidSubmits → CommitteeEvaluates → GrantFunding, ¬GrantFunding implies ¬DavidSubmits
  have hNotD : ¬ DavidSubmits := by
    intro d
    apply hNotG
    exact a2 (a1 d)
  -- From DavidSubmits ∨ PilotStudy and ¬DavidSubmits, deduce PilotStudy
  have hP : PilotStudy := by
    cases a3 with
    | inl d => exact False.elim (hNotD d)
    | inr p => exact p
  -- Then IdentifiesAreas and finally TimelineAdjusted
