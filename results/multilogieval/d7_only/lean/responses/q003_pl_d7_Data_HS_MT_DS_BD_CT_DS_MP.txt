Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_BD_CT_DS_MP

Context:
If Julia submits the conference paper draft, then the review committee evaluates the draft. If the review committee evaluates the draft, then the paper is accepted for presentation. The research team believes that either Julia submits the draft or the team conducts a peer review session, or both. If the team conducts a peer review session, then the session identifies critical weaknesses. If the editor updates the manuscript formatting, then the readability of the paper improves. The team also expects that either they conduct a peer review session or the readability of the paper does not improve, or both. If the session identifies critical weaknesses, then the presentation materials are refined effectively.

Question:
If the paper was not accepted for presentation and the editor updated the manuscript formatting, were the presentation materials refined effectively?
