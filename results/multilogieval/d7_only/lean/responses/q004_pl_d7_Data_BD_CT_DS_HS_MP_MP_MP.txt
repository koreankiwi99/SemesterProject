Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: BD_CT_DS_HS_MP_MP_MP

Context:
If Tom attends the leadership seminar, then he acquires effective management strategies. If the CEO reviews the annual report, then the report gets approved. Either Tom attends the seminar, or the report does not get approved, or both. If Tom acquires effective management strategies, then he implements a new workflow. If he implements a new workflow, then team productivity increases. If team productivity increases, then the department receives commendation. If the department receives commendation, then it is awarded a bonus.

Question:
If R is true, then is W true?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom T : Prop        -- Tom attends the seminar
axiom M : Prop        -- Tom acquires effective management strategies
axiom W : Prop        -- Tom implements a new workflow
axiom P : Prop        -- Team productivity increases
axiom C : Prop        -- Department receives commendation
axiom B : Prop        -- Department is awarded a bonus
axiom R : Prop        -- CEO reviews the annual report
axiom A : Prop        -- The report gets approved

axiom attend_imp_strat : T → M
axiom review_imp_approved : R → A
axiom attend_or_not_approved : T ∨ ¬A
axiom strat_imp_workflow : M → W
axiom workflow_imp_productivity : W → P
axiom productivity_imp_commendation : P → C
axiom commendation_imp_bonus : C → B

theorem R_implies_W : R → W := by
  intro r
  have a : A := review_imp_approved r
  have t : T := attend_or_not_approved.elim (fun ht => ht) (fun hna => False.elim (hna a))
  have m : M := attend_imp_strat t
