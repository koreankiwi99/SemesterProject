Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: BD_CT_DS_HS_MP_MP_MP

Context:
If Sarah enrolls in a photography course, then she learns advanced techniques. If the instructor evaluates the portfolio, then the portfolio meets professional standards. Either Sarah enrolls in the course, or the portfolio does not meet professional standards, or both. If Sarah learns advanced techniques, then she refines her editing skills. If she refines her editing skills, then she produces stunning images. If she produces stunning images, then her work gains a large online following. If her work gains a large online following, then she secures a major exhibition.

Question:
If R is true, then is W true?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom E : Prop  -- Sarah enrolls in a photography course
axiom A : Prop  -- Sarah learns advanced techniques
axiom R : Prop  -- She refines her editing skills
axiom S : Prop  -- She produces stunning images
axiom G : Prop  -- Her work gains a large online following
axiom W : Prop  -- She secures a major exhibition
axiom I : Prop  -- The instructor evaluates the portfolio
axiom P : Prop  -- The portfolio meets professional standards

axiom h1 : E → A
axiom h2 : I → P
axiom h3 : E ∨ ¬ P
axiom h4 : A → R
axiom h5 : R → S
axiom h6 : S → G
axiom h7 : G → W

theorem R_implies_W : R → W := by
  intro r
  have s : S := h5 r
  have g : G := h6 s
  exact h7 g
