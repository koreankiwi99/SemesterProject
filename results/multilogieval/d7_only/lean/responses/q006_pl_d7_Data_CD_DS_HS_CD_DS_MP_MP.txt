Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: CD_DS_HS_CD_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If Olivia designs a comprehensive marketing strategy, then she understands the target audience better. If Olivia attends a marketing summit, then she learns innovative marketing techniques. Olivia knows that she will either design a strategy or attend a summit, or both. If Olivia learns innovative marketing techniques, then she applies new techniques in campaigns. If she applies new techniques in campaigns, then she boosts the campaign's effectiveness. If Olivia networks with industry leaders, then she gains insights into market trends. She also anticipates that either she learns innovative techniques or networks with leaders, or both. If Olivia gains insights into market trends, then her marketing approach becomes more refined. If her marketing approach becomes more refined, then her campaign achieves outstanding results.

Question:
If Olivia did not understand the target audience better and did not boost the campaign's effectiveness, did her campaign achieve outstanding results?
