Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_BD_CT_DS_MP

Context:
If Olivia launches the new website feature, then the product manager reviews the feature. If the product manager reviews the feature, then the feature is included in the final release. The development team believes that either Olivia launches the website feature or the UX team conducts a user test, or both. If the UX team conducts a user test, then the test uncovers usability issues. If the development team updates the interface design, then the user experience improves. The team also expects that either they conduct a user test or the user experience does not improve, or both. If the test uncovers usability issues, then the release schedule is modified appropriately.

Question:
If the feature was not included in the final release and the development team updated the interface design, was the release schedule modified appropriately?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom L : Prop -- Olivia launches the new website feature
axiom R : Prop -- Product manager reviews the feature
axiom F : Prop -- Feature included in the final release
axiom U : Prop -- UX team conducts a user test
axiom I : Prop -- Test uncovers usability issues
axiom D : Prop -- Development team updates the interface design
axiom E : Prop -- User experience improves
axiom M : Prop -- Release schedule modified appropriately

axiom h1 : L → R
axiom h2 : R → F
axiom h3 : L ∨ U
axiom h4 : U → I
axiom h5 : D → E
axiom h6 : U ∨ ¬E
axiom h7 : I → M

theorem goal : (¬F ∧ D) → M := by
  intro h
  have d : D := And.right h
  have e : E := h5 d
  have u : U := Or.elim h6 (fun u => u) (fun notE => False.elim (notE e))
  have i : I := h4 u
