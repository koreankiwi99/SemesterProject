Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: CD_DS_HS_CD_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If Tom drafts a comprehensive project proposal, then he clarifies the project objectives. If Tom meets with the project team, then he receives valuable feedback. Tom plans that he will either draft a proposal or meet with the team, or both. If Tom receives valuable feedback, then he adjusts the project scope. If he adjusts the project scope, then he finalizes a detailed project plan. If Tom collaborates with an industry expert, then he enhances his project strategy. He also expects that either he receives valuable feedback or collaborates with an expert, or both. If Tom enhances his project strategy, then his project execution is seamless. If his project execution is seamless, then his project is completed ahead of schedule.

Question:
If Tom did not clarify the project objectives and did not finalize a detailed project plan, was his project completed ahead of schedule?
