Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_BD_CT_DS_MP

Context:
If Emily sends the marketing survey results, then the analytics team interprets the results. If the analytics team interprets the results, then the marketing strategy is adapted for the new campaign. The marketing team knows that either Emily sends the survey results or the team organizes a focus group discussion, or both. If the team organizes a focus group discussion, then the discussion highlights consumer preferences. If the data team enhances the reporting tools, then the clarity of insights improves. The team also expects that either they organize a focus group discussion or the clarity of insights does not improve, or both. If the discussion highlights consumer preferences, then the advertising plan is tailored effectively.

Question:
If the marketing strategy was not adapted for the new campaign and the data team enhanced the reporting tools, was the advertising plan tailored effectively?
