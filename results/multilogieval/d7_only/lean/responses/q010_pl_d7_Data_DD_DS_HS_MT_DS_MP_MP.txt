Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: DD_DS_HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the producer submits the final film script, then the director approves the script. If the studio secures distribution rights, then the film is officially released. Either the director does not approve the script, or the film is not officially released, or both. If the producer attends film production workshops, then the producer's production skills improve. If the producer's production skills improve, then the film's quality ratings increase. Either the producer attends film production workshops, or the director assigns a seasoned cinematographer, or both. If the director assigns a seasoned cinematographer, then the film receives expert cinematography. If the film receives expert cinematography, then the film is a critical success.

Question:
If the producer submits the final film script and the film's quality ratings do not increase, is the film a critical success?
