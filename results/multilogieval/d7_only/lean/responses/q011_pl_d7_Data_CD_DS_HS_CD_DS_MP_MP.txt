Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: CD_DS_HS_CD_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If Sarah sets a daily exercise routine, then she improves her physical stamina. If Sarah joins a fitness class, then she learns new workout techniques. Sarah is certain that she will either set a daily routine or join a fitness class, or both. If Sarah learns new workout techniques, then she practices regularly at home. If she practices regularly at home, then she reaches her fitness goals. If Sarah partners with a workout buddy, then she stays motivated and consistent. She also expects that either she learns new techniques or partners with a buddy, or both. If Sarah stays motivated and consistent, then her health and energy levels improve. If her health and energy levels improve, then she participates successfully in a local marathon.

Question:
If Sarah did not improve her physical stamina and did not reach her fitness goals, did she participate successfully in a local marathon?
