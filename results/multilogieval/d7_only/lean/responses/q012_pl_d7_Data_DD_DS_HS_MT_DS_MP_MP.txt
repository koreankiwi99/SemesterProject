Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: DD_DS_HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the musician submits the full album demo, then the record label reviews the demo. If the distributor confirms the release date, then the album is officially launched. Either the record label does not review the demo, or the album is not officially launched, or both. If the musician attends promotional strategy workshops, then the musician's marketing skills improve. If the musician's marketing skills improve, then the album's sales numbers increase. Either the musician attends promotional strategy workshops, or the manager arranges media interviews, or both. If the manager arranges media interviews, then the musician gains media exposure. If the musician gains media exposure, then the album becomes a hit.

Question:
If the musician submits the full album demo and the album's sales numbers do not increase, does the album become a hit?
