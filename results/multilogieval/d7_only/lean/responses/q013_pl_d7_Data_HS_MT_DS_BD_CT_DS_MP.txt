Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_BD_CT_DS_MP

Context:
If Tom completes the financial report on schedule, then the CFO reviews the report thoroughly. If the CFO reviews the report thoroughly, then the report is approved for the board meeting. The finance team expects that either Tom completes the report on schedule or they prepare a contingency analysis, or both. If the finance team prepares a contingency analysis, then the analysis reveals budgeting concerns. If the IT department upgrades the financial software, then the accuracy of financial projections improves. The team also believes that either they prepare a contingency analysis or the accuracy of financial projections does not improve, or both. If the analysis reveals budgeting concerns, then the budget plan is revised successfully.

Question:
If the report was not approved for the board meeting and the IT department upgraded the financial software, was the budget plan revised successfully?
