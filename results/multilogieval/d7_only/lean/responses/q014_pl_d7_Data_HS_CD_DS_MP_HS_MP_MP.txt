Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS_MP_HS_MP_MP

Context:
If Sarah publishes her findings online, then the research community takes notice. Whenever the community takes notice, Sarah receives collaboration offers. If a major journal highlights her work, then the research gains public interest. Either Sarah publishes online or a major journal highlights her work. When the research gains public interest, Sarah gets invited to speak at conferences. If she gets invited, then her work gains credibility, and if her work gains credibility, then her career advances significantly. Whenever her career advances significantly, she secures additional funding.

Question:
If R is not true, then is X true?
