Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: DD_DS_HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the student submits a complete scholarship application, then the scholarship committee reviews the application. If the financial aid office confirms available funds, then the scholarship is officially granted. Either the scholarship committee does not review the application, or the scholarship is not officially granted, or both. If the student attends financial literacy workshops, then the student's budgeting skills improve. If the student's budgeting skills improve, then the student's financial stability increases. Either the student attends financial literacy workshops, or the advisor provides personal financial counseling, or both. If the advisor provides personal financial counseling, then the student receives tailored financial advice. If the student receives tailored financial advice, then the student manages finances successfully.

Question:
If the student submits a complete scholarship application and the student's financial stability does not increase, does the student manage finances successfully?
