Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: CD_DS_HS_CD_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If David plans his garden layout meticulously, then he optimizes plant placement. If David consults a horticulturist, then he receives expert gardening advice. David knows that he will either plan his garden layout or consult a horticulturist, or both. If David receives expert gardening advice, then he implements advanced gardening techniques. If he implements advanced gardening techniques, then he achieves a flourishing garden. If David exchanges gardening tips with a neighbor, then he improves his soil management skills. He also believes that either he receives expert gardening advice or exchanges tips with a neighbor, or both. If David improves his soil management skills, then his garden becomes more sustainable. If his garden becomes more sustainable, then it is featured in a local magazine.

Question:
If David did not optimize plant placement and did not achieve a flourishing garden, was his garden featured in a local magazine?
