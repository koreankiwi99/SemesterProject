Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS_MP_HS_MP_MP

Context:
If Alice organizes the workshop early, then more participants register. Whenever more participants register, the workshop discussions are rich. If the guest speaker promotes the event, then it receives wider attention. Either Alice organizes early or the guest speaker promotes the event. When the event receives wider attention, Alice prepares a comprehensive agenda. If she prepares a comprehensive agenda, then she enhances the workshop's engagement, and if she enhances the engagement, then the workshop runs smoothly. Whenever the workshop runs smoothly, the feedback is overwhelmingly positive.

Question:
If R is not true, then is X true?
