Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: BD_CT_DS_HS_MP_MP_MP

Context:
If Emily plants new seeds in her garden, then she observes healthy plant growth. If the gardener adjusts the irrigation system, then the soil remains moist. Either Emily plants new seeds, or the soil does not remain moist, or both. If Emily observes healthy plant growth, then she optimizes her fertilizing schedule. If she optimizes her fertilizing schedule, then she achieves vibrant blooms. If she achieves vibrant blooms, then the garden becomes a local attraction. If the garden becomes a local attraction, then it receives a community award.

Question:
If R is true, then is W true?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Seeds : Prop
axiom Healthy : Prop
axiom AdjustsIrrigation : Prop
axiom MoistSoil : Prop
axiom OptimizesFertilizing : Prop
axiom VibrantBlooms : Prop
axiom LocalAttraction : Prop
axiom CommunityAward : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom h1 : Seeds → Healthy
axiom h2 : AdjustsIrrigation → MoistSoil
axiom h3 : Seeds ∨ ¬MoistSoil
axiom h4 : Healthy → OptimizesFertilizing
axiom h5 : OptimizesFertilizing → VibrantBlooms
axiom h6 : VibrantBlooms → LocalAttraction
axiom h7 : LocalAttraction → CommunityAward

-- Interpreting R as "Healthy" and W as "CommunityAward"
def R : Prop := Healthy
def W : Prop := CommunityAward

theorem goal : R → W := by
  intro r
  have hH : Healthy := by simpa [R] using r
  have hO : OptimizesFertilizing := h4 hH
  have hB : VibrantBlooms := h5 hO
  have hL : LocalAttraction := h6 hB
  have hA : CommunityAward := h7 hL
  simpa [W] using hA
