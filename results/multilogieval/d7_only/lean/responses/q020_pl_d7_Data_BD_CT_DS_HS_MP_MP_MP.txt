Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: BD_CT_DS_HS_MP_MP_MP

Context:
If Jake attends a coding bootcamp, then he enhances his programming skills. If the mentor reviews the project code, then the project passes quality checks. Either Jake attends the bootcamp, or the project does not pass quality checks, or both. If Jake enhances his programming skills, then he develops an advanced application. If he develops an advanced application, then it performs efficiently. If the application performs efficiently, then it gains user traction. If the application gains user traction, then it wins a tech award.

Question:
If R is true, then is W true?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom A : Prop -- Jake attends the bootcamp
axiom E : Prop -- Jake enhances programming skills
axiom R : Prop -- Mentor reviews the project code
axiom P : Prop -- Project passes quality checks
axiom D : Prop -- Jake develops an advanced application
axiom F : Prop -- The application performs efficiently
axiom T : Prop -- The application gains user traction
axiom W : Prop -- The application wins a tech award

axiom h1 : A → E
axiom h2 : R → P
axiom h3 : A ∨ ¬ P
axiom h4 : E → D
axiom h5 : D → F
axiom h6 : F → T
axiom h7 : T → W

theorem goal : R → W := by
  intro r
  have p : P := h2 r
  have notNotP : ¬¬ P := by
    intro hnp
    exact hnp p
  have a : A := by
    cases h3 with
    | inl ha => exact ha
    | inr hnp =>
        exact False.elim (notNotP hnp)
  have e : E := h1 a
  have d : D := h4 e
  have f : F := h5 d
  have t : T := h6 f
