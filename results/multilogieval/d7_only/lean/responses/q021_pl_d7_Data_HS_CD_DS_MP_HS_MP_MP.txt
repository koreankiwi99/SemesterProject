Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS_MP_HS_MP_MP

Context:
If Jack submits a patent application, then the innovation is officially recognized. Whenever it is recognized, Jack attracts investor interest. If the media covers the innovation, then public curiosity is heightened. Either Jack submits the application or the media covers the innovation. When public curiosity is heightened, Jack receives speaking invitations. If he receives invitations, then his industry reputation grows, and if his reputation grows, then he secures strategic partnerships. Whenever he secures partnerships, he expands his business operations.

Question:
If R is not true, then is X true?

-- Define propositions for events
axiom SubmitApplication : Prop
axiom Recognized : Prop
axiom InvestorInterest : Prop
axiom MediaCovers : Prop
axiom PublicCuriosity : Prop
axiom Invitations : Prop
axiom ReputationGrows : Prop
axiom Partnerships : Prop
axiom ExpandsOps : Prop

-- Unrelated propositions mentioned in the query
axiom R : Prop
axiom X : Prop

-- Premises from the textual context
axiom p1 : SubmitApplication → Recognized
axiom p2 : Recognized → InvestorInterest
axiom p3 : MediaCovers → PublicCuriosity
axiom p4 : SubmitApplication ∨ MediaCovers
axiom p5 : PublicCuriosity → Invitations
axiom p6 : Invitations → ReputationGrows
axiom p7 : ReputationGrows → Partnerships
axiom p8 : Partnerships → ExpandsOps

-- Some consequences that do follow from the premises
theorem mediaLeadsToExpansion (h : MediaCovers) : ExpandsOps := by
  have hc : PublicCuriosity := p3 h
  have hi : Invitations := p5 hc
  have hr : ReputationGrows := p6 hi
  have hp : Partnerships := p7 hr

      exact Or.inl hInv
  | inr hMedia =>
      exact Or.inr (mediaLeadsToExpansion hMedia)

-- The query asks whether (¬R → X) follows. There is no connection from the premises to R or X.
-- In particular, assuming ¬R and ¬X yields the negation of (¬R → X), showing the implication is not derivable from the given premises.
