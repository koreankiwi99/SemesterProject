Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS_MP_HS_MP_MP

Context:
If Olivia completes the safety training, then she is allowed to access the lab. Whenever she accesses the lab, experiment results are reliable. If the equipment undergoes regular maintenance, then it operates efficiently. Either Olivia completes the training or the equipment undergoes maintenance. When equipment operates efficiently, Olivia follows the protocols strictly. If she follows protocols strictly, then safety standards are upheld, and if safety standards are upheld, then the research project progresses without incidents. Whenever the project progresses without incidents, it receives additional grants.

Question:
If R is not true, then is X true?
