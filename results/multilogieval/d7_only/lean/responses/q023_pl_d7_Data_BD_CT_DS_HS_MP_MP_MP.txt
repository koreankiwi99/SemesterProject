Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: BD_CT_DS_HS_MP_MP_MP

Context:
If Lucy starts a daily exercise routine, then she improves her endurance. If the trainer assesses Lucy's progress, then her form is corrected. Either Lucy starts her routine, or her form is not corrected, or both. If Lucy improves her endurance, then she participates in a marathon. If she participates in a marathon, then she completes it successfully. If she completes the marathon successfully, then she gains admiration from peers. If she gains admiration from peers, then she is motivated to set new goals.

Question:
If R is true, then is W true?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom R : Prop            -- Lucy starts her routine
axiom E : Prop            -- Lucy improves her endurance
axiom T : Prop            -- Trainer assesses Lucy's progress
axiom F : Prop            -- Lucy's form is corrected
axiom P : Prop            -- Lucy participates in a marathon
axiom C : Prop            -- She completes it successfully
axiom A : Prop            -- She gains admiration from peers
axiom W : Prop            -- She is motivated to set new goals

axiom h1 : R → E          -- If Lucy starts her routine, then she improves her endurance.
axiom h2 : T → F          -- If the trainer assesses Lucy's progress, then her form is corrected.
axiom h3 : R ∨ ¬F         -- Either Lucy starts her routine, or her form is not corrected, or both.
axiom h4 : E → P          -- If Lucy improves her endurance, then she participates in a marathon.
axiom h5 : P → C          -- If she participates in a marathon, then she completes it successfully.
axiom h6 : C → A          -- If she completes the marathon successfully, then she gains admiration from peers.
axiom h7 : A → W          -- If she gains admiration from peers, then she is motivated to set new goals.

theorem goal : R → W := by
  intro hR
  have hE := h1 hR
  have hP := h4 hE
  have hC := h5 hP
  have hA := h6 hC
  have hW := h7 hA
  exact hW
