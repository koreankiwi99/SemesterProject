Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: DD_DS_HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the engineer submits a detailed project blueprint, then the project manager approves the blueprint. If the regulatory body confirms compliance, then the project is officially greenlit. Either the project manager does not approve the blueprint, or the project is not officially greenlit, or both. If the engineer attends professional development seminars, then the engineer's technical skills improve. If the engineer's technical skills improve, then the project's efficiency increases. Either the engineer attends professional development seminars, or the senior engineer provides mentorship, or both. If the senior engineer provides mentorship, then the engineer receives expert guidance. If the engineer receives expert guidance, then the project is completed efficiently.

Question:
If the engineer submits a detailed project blueprint and the project's efficiency does not increase, is the project completed efficiently?
