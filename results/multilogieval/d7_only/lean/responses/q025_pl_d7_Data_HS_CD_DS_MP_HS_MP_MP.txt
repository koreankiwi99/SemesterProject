Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d7 (d7_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS_MP_HS_MP_MP

Context:
If Tom finishes the code review promptly, then bugs are identified earlier. Whenever bugs are identified earlier, the software release is stable. If the testing team conducts additional tests, then the project timeline is met. Either Tom finishes the review promptly or the testing team conducts additional tests. When the project timeline is met, Tom updates the documentation. If he updates the documentation, then his updates improve team coordination, and if team coordination improves, then the team resolves issues quickly. Whenever the team resolves issues quickly, the client is satisfied.

Question:
If R is not true, then is X true?

Some derivable consequences (to show understanding of the chain):
- If testing team conducts additional tests, the client is satisfied.
- If Tom finishes promptly, the release is stable.

Target question:
"If R is not true, then is X true?" i.e., prove (¬R) → X.

This target is unrelated to the above premises; there are no links from the scenario
to R or X, so (¬R) → X is not derivable from the given assumptions in intuitionistic logic,
and its negation is also not derivable from these premises.
-- theorem question : (¬R) → X := by
--   -- Not derivable from the given premises.
