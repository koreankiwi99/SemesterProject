The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect handling of the hypothesis within the Lean code. The `hypothesis` keyword is not valid; instead, the hypothesis should be a parameter of the theorem. Additionally, the axioms should be defined as propositions for the specific person Alex, as the context refers to a single individual (Alex). 

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom AdvertisesCleverly : Prop
axiom OffersDiscounts : Prop
axiom AttractsMoreCustomers : Prop
axiom IncreasesSales : Prop
axiom ExpandsBusiness : Prop

axiom A1 : AdvertisesCleverly → AttractsMoreCustomers
axiom A2 : OffersDiscounts → IncreasesSales
axiom A3 : AdvertisesCleverly ∨ OffersDiscounts
axiom A4 : IncreasesSales → ExpandsBusiness

theorem AlexExpands (H : ¬ AttractsMoreCustomers) : ExpandsBusiness := by
  have not_clever : ¬ AdvertisesCleverly := fun h_clever => H (A1 h_clever)
  cases A3 with
  | inl clever => contradiction
  | inr disc => 
      have sales : IncreasesSales := A2 disc
      exact A4 sales
</lean>

**Proof Explanation:**
1. **Contradiction for clever advertising:**  
   From `A1` (clever advertising attracts customers) and the hypothesis `H` (Alex has no extra customers), we derive `¬AdvertisesCleverly`.
2. **Disjunctive syllogism:**  
   Axiom `A3` states Alex must either advertise cleverly or offer discounts. Since clever advertising is impossible (from step 1), Alex must offer discounts (`OffersDiscounts`).
3. **Discounts lead to sales:**  
   Axiom `A2` converts discounts into increased sales (`IncreasesSales`).
4. **Sales imply expansion:**  
   Axiom `A4` links increased sales to business expansion, proving `ExpandsBusiness`.

**Conclusion:** The theorem is provable. Alex expanded his business despite not attracting more customers.
