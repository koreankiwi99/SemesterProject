The context describes a student in a classroom. The key points are:

1. If the student studies diligently, they excel academically (Study → Excel)
2. If the student participates actively, they gain leadership skills (Participate → Leader)
3. The student either studies diligently or participates actively (Study ∨ Participate)
4. If someone is a leader, they become class prefect (Leader → Prefect)
5. The student did not excel academically (¬Excel)

The question asks whether the student was chosen as class prefect given these conditions.

From ¬Excel and (Study → Excel), we deduce ¬Study (the student does not study diligently). Since (¬Study) and (Study ∨ Participate), we conclude Participate (the student participates actively). Then, from (Participate → Leader), we get Leader (the student gains leadership skills). Finally, from (Leader → Prefect), we obtain Prefect (the student is chosen as class prefect). Thus, the answer is yes.
