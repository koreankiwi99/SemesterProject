The context describes conditions for improving guitar skills, and the question asks whether Sarah listens attentively to music given that she cannot learn songs faster.

### Key Predicates:
- `PracticesRegularly`: Indicates if a person practices guitar scales and chords daily.
- `ListensAttentively`: Indicates if a person listens attentively to music.
- `TechniqueImproves`: Indicates if a person's guitar technique improves.
- `LearnFaster`: Indicates if a person can learn songs faster.

### Axioms from Context:
1. If someone practices regularly, their technique improves:  
   `∀ p, PracticesRegularly p → TechniqueImproves p`
2. If technique improves, they learn faster:  
   `∀ p, TechniqueImproves p → LearnFaster p`
3. To progress, they either practice regularly, listen attentively, or both:  
   `∀ p, PracticesRegularly p ∨ ListensAttentively p`

### Given for Sarah:
- `¬LearnFaster Sarah` (Sarah cannot learn songs faster).

### Proof Strategy:
1. From `¬LearnFaster Sarah` and axiom 2 (contrapositive), Sarah's technique does not improve:  
   `¬TechniqueImproves Sarah`
2. From `¬TechniqueImproves Sarah` and axiom 1 (contrapositive), Sarah does not practice regularly:  
   `¬PracticesRegularly Sarah`
3. From axiom 3, Sarah must either practice regularly or listen attentively (or both). Since she does not practice regularly, she must listen attentively:  
   `ListensAttentively Sarah`

Thus, we can prove that Sarah listens attentively to music.
