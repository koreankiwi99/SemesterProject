ANSWER: Yes

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic in the `inl` branch did not automatically close the goal when faced with a context containing both `p : Promotion Sam` and `given : ¬ Promotion Sam`. This is because the goal was still `LeadNewTeam Sam`, not `False`. To fix this, we explicitly:

1. Used `exfalso` to change the goal to `False` (since anything follows from contradiction)
2. Applied the contradiction between `h : Promotion Sam` and `given : ¬ Promotion Sam`

The corrected proof uses `exfalso` to convert the goal to `False` in the contradictory branch, then directly applies the contradiction. In the non-contradictory branch, the proof remains valid.
