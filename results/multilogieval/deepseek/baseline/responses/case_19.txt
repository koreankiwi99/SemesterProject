ANSWER: Yes

Explanation:
- Since service quality decreased (¬GreatService), and the owner must either provide excellent service or host events (ax3), they must host events (by disjunctive syllogism).
- Hosting events implies more customers (ax2), and more customers imply improved revenue (ax4).
- Therefore, revenue improved. The Lean proof formalizes this reasoning and succeeds.
