The context describes a scenario involving a protagonist (referred to as "someone") and general office dynamics. Key points:
1. A protagonist believes: If close to lunchtime, then their coworkers are hungry (`A1`).
2. For the protagonist: Preparing well implies readiness for meetings (`A2`).
3. The protagonist is certain: Either close to lunchtime or not ready for meetings (`A3`).
4. Everyone understands: Diligence implies preparing well (`A4`).

The question asks: If John's coworkers are not hungry, is John diligent?

Lean modeling:
- `Person` type with `John` and `Protagonist` (representing "someone")
- Global `CloseToLunchtime` state
- Person-specific predicates (`CoworkersHungry`, `PrepareWell`, etc.)
- Axioms apply only to `Protagonist` (not necessarily John)

Analysis:
- `¬CoworkersHungry John` is given
- No axiom links `CloseToLunchtime` to John's coworkers (only to `Protagonist`'s)
- Diligence axiom (`A4`) applies universally but doesn't connect to lunchtime/readiness
- John may or may not be the Protagonist
- Countermodels exist:
  - Model where John is diligent (consistent with all axioms)
  - Model where John is not diligent (consistent with all axioms)

Conclusion: Neither `¬CoworkersHungry John → Diligent John` nor its negation can be proven.

ITERATION 2

The error occurred because `CoworkersHungry` was mistakenly defined as a predicate on `Person` when it should be a global proposition since coworkers are shared across the office. Additionally, `constant` was used inconsistently with `axiom` declarations. The corrected code models `CoworkersHungry` as a global state and declares `Protagonist` using `axiom` for consistency.

axiom Person : Type
axiom John : Person
axiom CloseToLunchtime : Prop
axiom CoworkersHungry : Prop
axiom PrepareWell : Person → Prop
axiom ReadyForMeeting : Person → Prop
axiom Diligent : Person → Prop

axiom Protagonist : Person
axiom A1 : CloseToLunchtime → CoworkersHungry
axiom A2 : PrepareWell Protagonist → ReadyForMeeting Protagonist
axiom A3 : CloseToLunchtime ∨ ¬ ReadyForMeeting Protagonist
axiom A4 : ∀ p : Person, Diligent p → PrepareWell p

-- Theorem: ¬CoworkersHungry → Diligent John
-- Proof attempt:
example : ¬CoworkersHungry → Diligent John :=
  fun h => 
  have notClose : ¬CloseToLunchtime := by
    intro hClose
    exact h (A1 hClose)
  have notReady : ¬ReadyForMeeting Protagonist := by
    cases A3 with
    | inl hClose => exact notClose hClose
    | inr hNotReady => exact hNotReady
  have notPrepare : ¬PrepareWell Protagonist :=
    notReady.imp (A2 Protagonist)
  have notDiligentProt : ¬Diligent Protagonist :=
    notPrepare.compose (A4 Protagonist)
  -- Cannot conclude anything about John since no link between John/Protagonist
  sorry

-- The theorem cannot be proven. Attempt to prove negation:
example : ¬(¬CoworkersHungry → Diligent John) :=
  fun h => 
  -- Countermodel exists where the theorem holds, so negation also unprovable
  sorry
</lean>

**Analysis**:  
- `¬CoworkersHungry` implies `¬CloseToLunchtime` (contrapositive of A1).  
- Using `A3`, this forces `¬ReadyForMeeting Protagonist` and subsequently `¬Diligent Protagonist`.  
- However, no axioms connect John to the protagonist:  
  - If John ≠ Protagonist, John could be diligent (A4 holds independently)  
  - If John = Protagonist, John would *not* be diligent when coworkers are not hungry.  
- Neither `¬CoworkersHungry → Diligent John` nor its negation is provable.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors were due to incorrect function applications and tactic usage. The key issues were:
1. Misapplying `A2` to `Protagonist` instead of a proof term
2. Using non-existent functions like `.compose`
3. Type mismatches in proof construction

The corrected code properly handles:
- `CoworkersHungry` as a global proposition
- Person-specific predicates
- Proof construction using proper function application
- Case analysis for disjunctions

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom John : Person
axiom CloseToLunchtime : Prop

axiom PrepareWell : Person → Prop
axiom ReadyForMeeting : Person → Prop
axiom Diligent : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : CloseToLunchtime → CoworkersHungry
axiom A2 : PrepareWell Protagonist → ReadyForMeeting Protagonist
axiom A3 : CloseToLunchtime ∨ ¬ ReadyForMeeting Protagonist
axiom A4 : ∀ p : Person, Diligent p → PrepareWell p

-- Attempt to prove: ¬CoworkersHungry → Diligent John
theorem thm : ¬CoworkersHungry → Diligent John :=
  fun h => 
  have notClose : ¬CloseToLunchtime := 
    fun hClose => h (A1 hClose)
  have notReady : ¬ReadyForMeeting Protagonist := by
    intro hReady
    cases A3 with
    | inl hClose => exact h (A1 hClose)
    | inr hNotReady => exact hNotReady hReady
  have notPrepare : ¬PrepareWell Protagonist := 
    fun hPrep => notReady (A2 hPrep)
  have notDiligentProt : ¬Diligent Protagonist := 
    fun hDil => notPrepare (A4 Protagonist hDil)
  -- Cannot prove anything about John since:
  -- 1. No connection between John and Protagonist
  -- 2. No axioms about John specifically
  sorry

-- Attempt to prove negation
theorem neg_thm : ¬(¬CoworkersHungry → Diligent John) :=
  fun h => 
  -- Countermodels exist where:
  -- Case 1: John = Protagonist → theorem false
  -- Case 2: John ≠ Protagonist → theorem true
  sorry
</lean>

**Proof Analysis**:
1. From `¬CoworkersHungry` and `A1`, we derive `¬CloseToLunchtime`
2. Using `A3` and case analysis:
   - If close to lunch: contradiction with `¬CoworkersHungry`
   - If not ready: directly contradicts readiness assumption
3. This gives `¬PrepareWell Protagonist` via `A2`
4. Then `¬Diligent Protagonist` via universal diligence axiom `A4`
5. **Critical gap**: No axioms connect John to:
   - The protagonist
   - Coworkers' hunger state
   - Presentation preparation status
   
**Conclusion**: Neither the theorem nor its negation is provable. When John's coworkers aren't hungry, John could be:
- Diligent (if he's not the protagonist)
- Not diligent (if he is the protagonist)
