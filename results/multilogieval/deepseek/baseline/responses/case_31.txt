The context provides normative statements about what one should do if they suspect cheating, but it does not establish that these actions are always taken. The question states that Priya either did not talk to her partner or did not reassess the relationship. There is no logical link between the actions (talking/reassessing) and the suspicion of cheating in the axioms, as the context only describes what *should* happen, not what *must* or *does* happen. Therefore, we cannot prove whether Priya suspected cheating or not.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Priya : obj
axiom SuspectsCheating : obj → Prop
axiom Talked : obj → Prop
axiom Reassessed : obj → Prop

-- Context: If someone suspects cheating, they should talk and reassess.
-- However, these are normative and do not force actual behavior.
axiom R1 : ∀ p : obj, SuspectsCheating p → Talked p   -- "should" does not imply "did"
axiom R2 : ∀ p : obj, SuspectsCheating p → Reassessed p

-- Given: Priya either didn't talk or didn't reassess.
axiom T1 : ¬Talked Priya ∨ ¬Reassessed Priya

-- Cannot prove SuspectsCheating Priya or its negation.
-- Why? 
--   - If Priya suspected cheating, R1/R2 say she *should* talk/reassess, but she might not have (T1 allows this).
--   - If Priya didn't suspect, T1 is consistent (no obligation to talk/reassess).
