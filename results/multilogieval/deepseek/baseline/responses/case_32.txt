axiom Citizen : Type
axiom Jane : Citizen
axiom ExerciseRegularly : Citizen → Prop
axiom EatsNutritious : Citizen → Prop
axiom Fit : Citizen → Prop
axiom HasEnergy : Citizen → Prop
axiom ValuesWellness : Citizen → Prop

-- If someone exercises regularly, they are fit
axiom A1 : ∀ c : Citizen, ExerciseRegularly c → Fit c
-- If someone eats nutritious foods, they have energy
axiom A2 : ∀ c : Citizen, EatsNutritious c → HasEnergy c
-- Not everyone was active (fit) or energetic (has energy)
axiom A3 : ∃ c : Citizen, ¬(Fit c ∨ HasEnergy c)
-- Some citizens don't exercise or don't eat well
axiom A4 : ∃ c : Citizen, ¬ExerciseRegularly c ∨ ¬EatsNutritious c
-- If someone values wellness, they exercise regularly
axiom A5 : ∀ c : Citizen, ValuesWellness c → ExerciseRegularly c

-- Jane eats nutritious foods
axiom JaneEats : EatsNutritious Jane
