The context provides two implications:
1. If a person finds their account hacked, they reset their password.
2. If a person detects unauthorized access, they notify their bank.

The given information states that Lucy either did not reset her password or did not notify her bank (or both). We need to determine if Lucy's account was hacked.

Key observations:
- We know Lucy didn't reset her password or didn't notify her bank
- If she didn't reset, she didn't find her account hacked (by contrapositive of 1)
- If she didn't notify, she didn't detect unauthorized access (by contrapositive of 2)
- However, "account hacked" is not equivalent to "finds hacked" or "detects unauthorized access":
  - An account could be hacked without the user discovering it
  - Unauthorized access doesn't necessarily imply full account hacking
- There are no axioms linking "account hacked" directly to the observed behaviors

Thus, we cannot prove Lucy's account was hacked (since she might not have discovered it), nor can we prove it wasn't hacked (since it could have been hacked without her knowledge).

axiom Person : Type
axiom Lucy : Person
axiom FindsHacked : Person → Prop
axiom ResetsPassword : Person → Prop
axiom DetectsUnauthorizedAccess : Person → Prop
axiom NotifiesBank : Person → Prop
axiom AccountHacked : Person → Prop

axiom reset_rule : ∀ p : Person, FindsHacked p → ResetsPassword p
axiom notify_rule : ∀ p : Person, DetectsUnauthorizedAccess p → NotifiesBank p

axiom lucy_behavior : ¬ ResetsPassword Lucy ∨ ¬ NotifiesBank Lucy

-- Cannot prove AccountHacked Lucy
-- Cannot prove ¬AccountHacked Lucy
