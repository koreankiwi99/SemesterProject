The context provides recommendations for when someone is having computer problems, but it does not establish any logical implications between the predicates. Specifically:
- "If someone is having computer problems, they should try restarting" does not mean that having problems implies restarting occurred (it's advice, not a fact).
- "If there are issues, the user should check for updates" similarly provides no factual link between problems and update checks.

The question states that Mary either did not restart or did not install updates (¬Restart Mary ∨ ¬CheckUpdates Mary). There are no axioms connecting:
- Problems to Restart
- Problems to CheckUpdates
- Restart/CheckUpdates to Problems

Thus, we cannot derive whether Mary had problems (Problems Mary) or not (¬Problems Mary) from the given information.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mary : obj
axiom Problems : obj → Prop
axiom Restart : obj → Prop
axiom CheckUpdates : obj → Prop
axiom given : ¬ Restart Mary ∨ ¬ CheckUpdates Mary

-- No axioms link Problems to Restart/CheckUpdates. 
-- The disjunction about Mary's actions does not constrain Problems Mary.
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain
