The context describes a scenario involving a quiz on Monday and studying habits. The key predicates are:
- `Monday`: It is Monday.
- `quiz`: There is a quiz.
- `do_well`: Someone does well on the quiz.
- `study_hard`: Someone studies hard.
- `good_at_math`: Someone is good at math.

Axioms:
1. If it's Monday, there's a quiz: `Monday → quiz`
2. Doing well implies studying hard: `do_well → study_hard`
3. Either Monday, or not studying hard: `Monday ∨ ¬study_hard`
4. Being good at math implies doing well: `good_at_math → do_well`

Question: If there was no quiz (`¬quiz`), is Alex good at math (`good_at_math`)?

Proof in Lean:
- From `¬quiz` and `Monday → quiz`, we get `¬Monday`.
- From `¬Monday` and `Monday ∨ ¬study_hard`, we get `¬study_hard`.
- From `¬study_hard` and `do_well → study_hard`, we get `¬do_well`.
- From `¬do_well` and `good_at_math → do_well`, we get `¬good_at_math`.

Thus, under `¬quiz`, we prove `¬good_at_math`, meaning Alex is not good at math.
