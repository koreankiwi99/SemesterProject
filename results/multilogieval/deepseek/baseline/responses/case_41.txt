The reasoning involves Priya's plants. The context provides axioms about watering, drought, water restrictions, and plant health. The key is to derive that Priya's plants wilted and died given they did not grow well.

**Lean Proof:**
<lean>
axiom WatersDaily : Prop
axiom GrowsWell : Prop
axiom Drought : Prop
axiom Restrictions : Prop
axiom EnoughWater : Prop
axiom WiltAndDie : Prop

axiom A1 : WatersDaily → GrowsWell
axiom A2 : Drought → Restrictions
axiom A3 : WatersDaily ∨ Drought
axiom A4 : Restrictions → ¬ EnoughWater
axiom A5 : ¬ EnoughWater → WiltAndDie
axiom T1 : ¬ GrowsWell  -- Priya's plants did not grow well

theorem plants_wilt : WiltAndDie := by
  have notWater : ¬ WatersDaily := fun h => T1 (A1 h)  -- ¬GrowsWell implies ¬WatersDaily
  cases A3 with  -- Case split on WatersDaily ∨ Drought
  | inl w => contradiction  -- WatersDaily case contradicts notWater
  | inr d => 
      have r : Restrictions := A2 d  -- Drought implies Restrictions
      have noWater : ¬ EnoughWater := A4 r  -- Restrictions imply ¬EnoughWater
      exact A5 noWater  -- ¬EnoughWater implies WiltAndDie
</lean>

**Explanation:**
- From `¬GrowsWell` (T1) and `WatersDaily → GrowsWell` (A1), we derive `¬WatersDaily`.
- Using `WatersDaily ∨ Drought` (A3), we eliminate the `WatersDaily` case (as it contradicts `¬WatersDaily`), leaving `Drought`.
- `Drought` implies `Restrictions` (A2), which implies `¬EnoughWater` (A4), which finally implies `WiltAndDie` (A5).

The proof holds, confirming Priya's plants wilted and died.
