The context provides information about transit conditions and their implications, but it does not specify James's mode of transit beyond stating he did not take the bus. The axioms allow us to reason about individuals who take the subway or bus, but James might have used another form of transit. Without knowing if James took the subway, we cannot apply the axiom that subway takers arrive on time. Conversely, there is no information to prove he was late. Thus, the outcome is uncertain.

axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person

axiom SubwayRunningOnSchedule : Prop
axiom BusHasRoom : Prop

axiom TakesSubway : Person → Prop
axiom TakesBus : Person → Prop
axiom SmoothSailing : Person → Prop
axiom OnTime : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : SubwayRunningOnSchedule → ∃ p, TakesSubway p
axiom A2 : BusHasRoom → ∃ q, TakesBus q
axiom A3 : ∀ p, (TakesSubway p ∨ TakesBus p) → SmoothSailing p
axiom A4 : ∀ p, TakesSubway p → OnTime p

-- Given: James did not take the bus
axiom no_bus : ¬ TakesBus James

-- We cannot prove OnTime James or ¬OnTime James
-- James might have taken the subway (then OnTime James by A4) or another transit (unknown outcome)

ANSWER: Uncertain
