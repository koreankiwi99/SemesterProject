The reasoning is translated into Lean by defining the necessary propositions and axioms based on the context. The key steps are:
1. If Mark did not need to care for plants, then he did not plant a garden (contrapositive of axiom A1).
2. Since he didn't plant, the disjunction (axiom A3) forces a drought.
3. Drought leads to a watering ban (axiom A2).
4. However, without a garden, the watering ban doesn't imply insufficient water for Mark (axiom A4 requires a garden).
5. Crucially, a garden cannot fail to thrive if it doesn't exist (axiom A6: `FailToThrive → PlantsGarden`).
6. Thus, given no garden, we prove the garden did not fail to thrive.

<lean>
axiom PlantsGarden : Prop
axiom Drought : Prop
axiom NeedsWater : Prop
axiom NeedsCare : Prop
axiom BanOnWatering : Prop
axiom EnoughWater : Prop
axiom FailToThrive : Prop

axiom A1 : PlantsGarden → (NeedsWater ∧ NeedsCare)
axiom A2 : Drought → BanOnWatering
axiom A3 : PlantsGarden ∨ Drought
axiom A4 : BanOnWatering → (PlantsGarden → ¬EnoughWater)
axiom A5 : (PlantsGarden ∧ ¬EnoughWater) → FailToThrive
axiom A6 : FailToThrive → PlantsGarden

-- Given: Mark did not need to care for garden plants
axiom Given : ¬NeedsCare

theorem garden_not_fail : ¬FailToThrive :=
  fun hFail : FailToThrive =>
    have hPlant : PlantsGarden := A6 hFail
    have hNeeds : NeedsWater ∧ NeedsCare := A1 hPlant
    show False from Given hNeeds.2
