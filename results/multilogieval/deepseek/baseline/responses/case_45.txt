The reasoning involves Matt not redoing his living room and the given context. The key steps are:

1. From the context: If someone gains decorating skills, they redo their living room (A2). Since Matt did not redo his living room (A3), he did not gain decorating skills.
2. If Matt had watched DIY videos, he would have gained decorating skills (A1). Since he did not gain skills, he did not watch DIY videos.
3. The context states that everyone either watches DIY videos, reads blogs, or both (A4). Since Matt did not watch DIY videos, he must have read interior design blogs.
4. If someone reads blogs, they get new decorating ideas (A5). Therefore, Matt gets new decorating ideas.

The Lean code formalizes this reasoning:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Matt : Person
axiom WatchedDIY : Person → Prop
axiom ReadBlogs : Person → Prop
axiom GainedSkills : Person → Prop
axiom RedoLivingRoom : Person → Prop
axiom NewIdeas : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ p, WatchedDIY p → GainedSkills p
axiom A2 : ∀ p, GainedSkills p → RedoLivingRoom p
axiom A4 : ∀ p, WatchedDIY p ∨ ReadBlogs p
axiom A5 : ∀ p, ReadBlogs p → NewIdeas p
axiom A3 : ¬ RedoLivingRoom Matt

theorem matt_gets_ideas : NewIdeas Matt := by
  have no_skills : ¬ GainedSkills Matt := by
    intro h_skills
    have h_redo : RedoLivingRoom Matt := A2 Matt h_skills
    exact A3 h_redo
  have no_watch : ¬ WatchedDIY Matt := by
    intro h_watch
    exact no_skills (A1 Matt h_watch)
  have disjunction : WatchedDIY Matt ∨ ReadBlogs Matt := A4 Matt
  cases disjunction
  case inl watch => exact False.elim (no_watch watch)
  case inr read => exact A5 Matt read
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes
