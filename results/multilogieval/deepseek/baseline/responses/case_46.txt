The context provides several implications and a disjunction. The key is interpreting the disjunction correctly: "Either someone volunteers, or they do not provide a home, or they volunteer and do not provide a home." This simplifies to: For all individuals, either they volunteer or they do not provide a home (since the third option is redundant). This is equivalent to: If someone provides a home, then they volunteer.

Given:
1. Volunteering implies helping the community.
2. Adopting a pet implies providing a home.
3. Providing a home implies volunteering (from the simplified disjunction).
4. Helping the community implies feeling fulfilled.

Chaining these: Adopting → Providing home → Volunteering → Helping community → Fulfillment. Thus, if Casey adopts, she feels fulfilled.

-- If someone adopts, they provide a home
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Adopt x → ProvideHome x
-- Simplified disjunction: Providing a home implies volunteering
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, ProvideHome x → Volunteer x
-- Helping the community implies fulfillment
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, HelpCommunity x → Fulfillment x
