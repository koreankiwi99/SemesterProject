The reasoning can be translated into Lean by defining the necessary predicates and axioms. The context states that if someone learns botany, they understand plant needs, and if they understand plant needs, their plants thrive. Additionally, they either learn botany or seek advice (or both). Given that Mary's plants did not thrive, we must determine if she sought advice.

By contraposition:
1. Since Mary's plants didn't thrive (¬GrowThriving Mary), she did not understand plant needs (¬UnderstandNeeds Mary).
2. Since she didn't understand plant needs, she did not learn botany (¬LearnedBotany Mary).
3. From the disjunction (LearnedBotany Mary ∨ SoughtAdvice Mary), the negation of the first option forces the second: SoughtAdvice Mary.

Thus, the theorem is proven.
