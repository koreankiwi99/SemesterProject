The context provides several logical relationships, and the question asks whether there was a lot of booing given that the crowd did not cheer loudly. The key steps are:

1. From "If the crowd gets pumped up, they start cheering loudly" and "The crowd did not start cheering loudly", we derive ¬PumpedUp (contraposition).
2. From "If the team scores early, the crowd gets pumped up" and ¬PumpedUp, we derive ¬ScoreEarly (contraposition).
3. From "Either the team scores early, or they play their rival team, or both" and ¬ScoreEarly, we derive PlayRival (disjunction elimination).
4. The axiom "If crowd is pumped up, there will be lot of booing" only provides Booing under PumpedUp, which is false. There are no axioms linking PlayRival (or other factors) to Booing when ¬PumpedUp holds.

Thus, while PlayRival is true, this does not imply Booing. Similarly, there is no evidence that Booing is false. Therefore, Booing cannot be proven or disproven from the given information.

The compilation errors occurred because the `hypothesis` keyword was used incorrectly in Lean 4. Instead, we should use the `variable` command to declare the hypothesis (¬ CheerLoudly) as an ambient assumption. Additionally, the Lean code must be structured to properly define the axioms and theorems under this hypothesis.

After analyzing the logical relationships:
1. From ¬CheerLoudly and A2 (PumpedUp → CheerLoudly), we can prove ¬PumpedUp.
2. From ¬PumpedUp and A1 (ScoreEarly → PumpedUp), we can prove ¬ScoreEarly.
3. From ¬ScoreEarly and A3 (ScoreEarly ∨ PlayRival), we can prove PlayRival.
4. However, A4 (PumpedUp → Booing) cannot be used to prove Booing since we have ¬PumpedUp.
5. There are no axioms linking PlayRival or other factors to Booing when ¬PumpedUp holds.
6. Similarly, no axioms establish ¬Booing under these conditions.

Thus, we cannot prove Booing or its negation from the given axioms and hypothesis.

<lean>
axiom ScoreEarly : Prop
axiom PlayRival : Prop
axiom PumpedUp : Prop
axiom CheerLoudly : Prop
axiom Booing : Prop

axiom A1 : ScoreEarly → PumpedUp
axiom A2 : PumpedUp → CheerLoudly
axiom A3 : ScoreEarly ∨ PlayRival
axiom A4 : PumpedUp → Booing

variable (not_cheer : ¬ CheerLoudly)

theorem not_pumped : ¬ PumpedUp :=
  fun h => not_cheer (A2 h)

theorem not_early : ¬ ScoreEarly :=
  fun h => not_pumped (A1 h)

theorem play_rival : PlayRival :=
  Or.elim A3 not_early id

-- Booing cannot be proven: no axiom yields Booing without PumpedUp
-- ¬Booing cannot be proven: no axiom prevents Booing when ¬PumpedUp

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to two main issues:
1. The `hypothesis` keyword was incorrectly used instead of declaring the hypothesis as a variable.
2. The `Or.elim` function was misapplied - it requires two functions: one for each disjunct. The first function must handle the left disjunct (ScoreEarly) by producing the goal type (PlayRival), but we provided a negation (¬ScoreEarly) instead. The solution is to explicitly handle the contradiction in the ScoreEarly case.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom ScoreEarly : Prop
axiom PlayRival : Prop
axiom PumpedUp : Prop
axiom CheerLoudly : Prop
axiom Booing : Prop

axiom A1 : ScoreEarly → PumpedUp
axiom A2 : PumpedUp → CheerLoudly
axiom A3 : ScoreEarly ∨ PlayRival
axiom A4 : PumpedUp → Booing

variable (not_cheer : ¬ CheerLoudly)

theorem not_pumped : ¬ PumpedUp :=
  fun h => not_cheer (A2 h)

theorem not_early : ¬ ScoreEarly :=
  fun h => not_pumped (A1 h)

theorem play_rival : PlayRival :=
  Or.elim A3 
    (fun h_early => False.elim (not_early h_early)) 
    (fun h_rival => h_rival)

-- Cannot prove Booing or ¬Booing:
-- 1. A4 requires PumpedUp for Booing, but we have ¬PumpedUp
-- 2. No axioms link PlayRival or other factors to Booing
-- 3. No axioms establish ¬Booing when ¬PumpedUp holds
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

Explanation:
1. From ¬CheerLoudly and A2 (PumpedUp → CheerLoudly), we prove ¬PumpedUp
2. From ¬PumpedUp and A1 (ScoreEarly → PumpedUp), we prove ¬ScoreEarly
3. From ¬ScoreEarly and A3 (ScoreEarly ∨ PlayRival), we prove PlayRival
4. However:
   - A4 (PumpedUp → Booing) cannot prove Booing since we have ¬PumpedUp
   - There are no axioms connecting PlayRival to Booing
   - No axioms establish that Booing must be false in this scenario
Thus we cannot determine whether there was booing.
