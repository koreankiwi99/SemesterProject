The reasoning problem involves determining if low attendance implies the movie is a sequel based on the given context. The context provides several logical statements:

1. **Good reviews imply high attendance**: `GoodReviews → HighAttendance`
2. **Either good reviews, low attendance, or both**: `GoodReviews ∨ ¬HighAttendance` (which is logically equivalent to `¬GoodReviews → ¬HighAttendance`)
3. **Big star implies good reviews**: `BigStar → GoodReviews`
4. **Either big star, sequel, or both**: `BigStar ∨ Sequel`

The question asks: **If attendance is low, is it a sequel?** (`¬HighAttendance → Sequel`)

### Proof Sketch:
- **Step 1:** From `GoodReviews → HighAttendance` and `GoodReviews ∨ ¬HighAttendance`, we derive `GoodReviews ↔ HighAttendance` (good reviews and high attendance are equivalent).
- **Step 2:** Low attendance (`¬HighAttendance`) implies no good reviews (`¬GoodReviews`).
- **Step 3:** No good reviews (`¬GoodReviews`) implies no big star (`¬BigStar`), because if there were a big star, there would be good reviews.
- **Step 4:** No big star (`¬BigStar`) and `BigStar ∨ Sequel` force the conclusion that it must be a sequel (`Sequel`).

### Lean Code and Proof:
<lean>
axiom GoodReviews : Prop
axiom HighAttendance : Prop
axiom BigStar : Prop
axiom Sequel : Prop

axiom T1 : GoodReviews → HighAttendance
axiom T3 : GoodReviews ∨ ¬HighAttendance
axiom T4 : BigStar → GoodReviews
axiom T5 : BigStar ∨ Sequel

theorem low_attendance_implies_sequel : ¬HighAttendance → Sequel :=
  by
    intro hLow       -- Assume attendance is low
    have hNotGood : ¬GoodReviews := fun hGood => hLow (T1 hGood)  -- No good reviews (from T1 and low attendance)
    have hNotBig : ¬BigStar := fun hBig => hNotGood (T4 hBig)      -- No big star (from T4 and no good reviews)
    cases T5 with    -- Cases on T5: big star or sequel
    | inl hBig => contradiction  -- Big star case contradicts ¬BigStar
    | inr hSeq => exact hSeq     -- Sequel case directly proves the goal
</lean>

### Conclusion:
The proof shows that **low attendance necessarily implies the movie is a sequel** (`¬HighAttendance → Sequel`). Therefore, the answer to the question is **Yes**.
