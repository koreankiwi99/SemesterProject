The context states that if there is excessive rain, reservoirs overflow, and if reservoirs overflow, flooding occurs. However, the context does not explicitly state that heavy rainfall implies excessive rain. The question provides that there is heavy rainfall in Dallas, but without an axiom connecting heavy rainfall to excessive rain, we cannot prove flooding occurs. Similarly, we cannot prove that flooding does not occur since there is no information negating the possibility that heavy rainfall leads to excessive rain.

Therefore, the answer is Uncertain.

<lean>
axiom City : Type
axiom Dallas : City
axiom HeavyRain : City → Prop
axiom ExcessiveRain : City → Prop
axiom ReservoirsOverflow : City → Prop
axiom Flooding : City → Prop
axiom rule1 : ∀ c : City, ExcessiveRain c → ReservoirsOverflow c
axiom rule2 : ∀ c : City, ReservoirsOverflow c → Flooding c
axiom fact : HeavyRain Dallas

-- Cannot prove Flooding Dallas without HeavyRain → ExcessiveRain link
-- Cannot disprove Flooding Dallas either
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain
