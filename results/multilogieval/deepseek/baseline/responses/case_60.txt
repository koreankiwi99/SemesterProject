The reasoning is based on logical implications and disjunctions from the context. The key steps are:

1. From "if the alarm went off, then it was time to get ready" (A1) and "it is not the time to get ready" (given), we derive ¬alarm_went_off.
2. From "either the alarm went off or they weren't late for school" (A3) and ¬alarm_went_off, we derive ¬late_for_school.
3. From "if they missed the bus, then they'd be late for school" (A2) and ¬late_for_school, we derive ¬missed_bus.
4. From "if they got up late, then they miss the bus" (A4) and ¬missed_bus, we derive ¬got_up_late.
5. From "if they went to bed late, then they get up late" (A5) and ¬got_up_late, we derive ¬went_to_bed_late.

Thus, John did not go to bed late.
