The reasoning shows that if Priya attended lectures regularly and studied diligently, then she would excel in the course. However, she studied diligently but did not excel. Therefore, she must not have attended lectures regularly.

<lean>
axiom Student : Type
axiom Priya : Student
axiom AttendsRegularly : Student → Prop
axiom StudiesDiligently : Student → Prop
axiom ExcelsInCourse : Student → Prop

axiom context : ∀ s : Student, AttendsRegularly s → StudiesDiligently s → ExcelsInCourse s
axiom fact1 : StudiesDiligently Priya
axiom fact2 : ¬ ExcelsInCourse Priya

theorem Priya_not_attending : ¬ AttendsRegularly Priya :=
  fun h : AttendsRegularly Priya =>
    have must_excel : ExcelsInCourse Priya := context Priya h fact1
    show False from fact2 must_excel
</lean>

ANSWER: No
