The context states: If someone plants disease-resistant varieties, then proper watering and feeding leads to a bountiful harvest.  
Linda watered and fed properly but did not have a bountiful harvest.  
We prove that Linda did **not** plant disease-resistant varieties.  

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Linda : obj
axiom PlantsDiseaseResistant : obj → Prop
axiom WatersAndFeedsProperly : obj → Prop
axiom HasBountifulHarvest : obj → Prop

-- Context: If disease-resistant varieties are planted, then proper watering/feeding implies a bountiful harvest.
axiom Rule : ∀ x : obj, PlantsDiseaseResistant x → (WatersAndFeedsProperly x → HasBountifulHarvest x)

-- Given: Linda watered and fed properly, but did not have a bountiful harvest.
axiom LindaWatered : WatersAndFeedsProperly Linda
axiom LindaNoHarvest : ¬ HasBountifulHarvest Linda

-- Prove Linda did NOT plant disease-resistant varieties.
theorem linda_not_planted : ¬ PlantsDiseaseResistant Linda :=
  fun hPlant : PlantsDiseaseResistant Linda =>
    have : WatersAndFeedsProperly Linda → HasBountifulHarvest Linda := Rule Linda hPlant
    have : HasBountifulHarvest Linda := this LindaWatered
    LindaNoHarvest this
</lean>
