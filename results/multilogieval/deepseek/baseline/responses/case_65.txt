ANSWER: No

Explanation:
- The context states: HighQuality wood implies that precise joints lead to a sturdy product.
- We know joints were precise (T1) but the bookshelf was not sturdy (T2).
- Applying modus tollens: If high-quality wood had been used, the bookshelf would have been sturdy (from R1 and T1). Since it wasn't sturdy (T2), the wood cannot be high-quality.
- The proof shows ¬HighQuality bookshelf (wood_not_high_quality), so the answer to "Was the wood high quality?" is provably false. Thus, the answer is "No".

The compilation errors occurred because the `variable` declarations were not properly handled. The corrected code uses `axiom` for all declarations to ensure consistency and avoid scoping issues. The proof demonstrates that the wood was not of high quality.

axiom bookshelf : obj
axiom HighQuality : obj → Prop
axiom PreciseJoints : obj → Prop
axiom SturdyProduct : obj → Prop
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, HighQuality x → (PreciseJoints x → SturdyProduct x)

axiom T2 : ¬ SturdyProduct bookshelf
theorem wood_not_high_quality : ¬ HighQuality bookshelf :=

    intro h
    exact T2 (R1 bookshelf h T1)
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**  
- Assume the wood was high quality (`h : HighQuality bookshelf`).  
- By `R1`, precise joints imply a sturdy product: `R1 bookshelf h T1 : SturdyProduct bookshelf`.  
- This contradicts axiom `T2` (¬SturdyProduct bookshelf).  
- Hence, the assumption must be false: ¬HighQuality bookshelf.  

The question asks: "Was the wood he used of high quality?" Since we proved the wood was **not** high quality, the answer to the question is **No**.
