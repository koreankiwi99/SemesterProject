The reasoning involves analyzing the logical implications of the given context and facts. The context states a general belief: if a student studies hard for an exam, then getting enough sleep before that exam implies they will ace it. Symbolically, this is:  
∀ student ∀ exam, StudiesHard(student, exam) → (GetsEnoughSleep(student, exam) → AcesTest(student, exam)).  

Given:  
- Emma got enough sleep before her biology exam (`GetsEnoughSleep(emma, bio)`).  
- Emma did not ace the biology exam (`¬AcesTest(emma, bio)`).  

We need to determine if Emma studied hard (`StudiesHard(emma, bio)`).  

Assume Emma studied hard. By the belief:  
- `StudiesHard(emma, bio)` and `GetsEnoughSleep(emma, bio)` imply `AcesTest(emma, bio)`.  
This contradicts `¬AcesTest(emma, bio)`. Thus, the assumption must be false.  

Therefore, Emma did not study hard (`¬StudiesHard(emma, bio)`).  

This is formalized and proven in Lean:

<lean>
axiom Student : Type
axiom Exam : Type
axiom emma : Student
axiom bio : Exam
axiom StudiesHard : Student → Exam → Prop
axiom GetsEnoughSleep : Student → Exam → Prop
axiom AcesTest : Student → Exam → Prop
axiom belief : ∀ (s : Student) (e : Exam), StudiesHard s e → GetsEnoughSleep s e → AcesTest s e
axiom enough_sleep : GetsEnoughSleep emma bio
axiom not_aced : ¬ AcesTest emma bio

theorem emma_not_hard : ¬ StudiesHard emma bio :=
  fun h : StudiesHard emma bio =>
    have aced : AcesTest emma bio := belief emma bio h enough_sleep
    show False from not_aced aced
</lean>

The Lean proof demonstrates that `StudiesHard(emma, bio)` is false. Thus, the answer to "Did Emma study hard?" is **No**.

ANSWER: No
