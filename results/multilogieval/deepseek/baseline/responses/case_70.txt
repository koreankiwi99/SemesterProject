The context states a conditional rule: if seeds are planted properly, then adequate sunlight and watering lead to large, plentiful tomatoes. Farmer Joe provided adequate sunlight and watering, but his tomatoes did not grow large and plentiful. This implies that the antecedent (seeds planted properly) must be false, as otherwise, the consequent (tomatoes growing) would follow.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Joe : obj

axiom AdequateSunlight : obj → Prop
axiom AdequateWatering : obj → Prop
axiom GrowsLargePlentiful : obj → Prop

axiom Rule : ∀ x : obj, PlantedProperly x → (AdequateSunlight x ∧ AdequateWatering x → GrowsLargePlentiful x)
axiom Sunlight : AdequateSunlight Joe
axiom Watering : AdequateWatering Joe
axiom NoGrowth : ¬ GrowsLargePlentiful Joe

theorem not_planted_properly : ¬ PlantedProperly Joe :=
  fun (H : PlantedProperly Joe) =>
    have H1 : AdequateSunlight Joe ∧ AdequateWatering Joe → GrowsLargePlentiful Joe := Rule Joe H
    have H2 : AdequateSunlight Joe ∧ AdequateWatering Joe := And.intro Sunlight Watering
    have Growth : GrowsLargePlentiful Joe := H1 H2
    NoGrowth Growth
