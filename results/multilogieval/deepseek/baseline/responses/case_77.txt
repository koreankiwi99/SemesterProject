The context provides several logical relationships, but no specific information about James. The question asks whether the implication ¬W(James) → Y(James) holds. The Lean formalization includes axioms derived from the context:

1. If someone practices hard, they play well: ∀x, P x → W x  
2. If picked to start, they are talented: ∀x, S x → T x  
3. Either practiced hard or not talented: ∀x, P x ∨ ¬T x  
4. If natural ability, then picked to start: ∀x, N x → S x  
5. If top youth player, then natural ability: ∀x, Y x → N x  

A key lemma is proven: ∀x, ¬W x → ¬Y x. This shows that if James did not play well, he was not a top youth player. However, the original theorem ¬W(James) → Y(James) cannot be proven, as it would require showing Y(James) under the assumption ¬W(James), but the lemma proves the opposite (¬Y(James)).  

The negation of the theorem ¬(¬W(James) → Y(James)) is equivalent to ¬W(James) ∧ ¬Y(James). While the lemma shows that ¬W(James) implies ¬Y(James), the conjunction ¬W(James) ∧ ¬Y(James) cannot be proven unconditionally without knowing whether ¬W(James) is true. Thus, neither the theorem nor its negation can be proven from the axioms alone.

    fun h_y => h_not_n (A5 x h_y)

-- The original theorem ¬W James → Y James cannot be proven
-- Its negation ¬(¬W James → Y James) (i.e., ¬W James ∧ ¬Y James) also cannot be proven unconditionally
