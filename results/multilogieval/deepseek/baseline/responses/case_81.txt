The context describes a scenario involving learning guitar, with implications about practice, muscle memory, playing songs, and music theory. The key elements are:

- Practicing chords daily leads to muscle memory (`∀ p, PracticesChords p → MuscleMemory p`)
- Muscle memory enables playing simple songs (`∀ p, MuscleMemory p → CanPlaySongs p`)
- One either practices chords daily, learns music theory, or both (`∀ p, PracticesChords p ∨ LearnsTheory p`)
- Learning music theory gives knowledge about song structure (`∀ p, LearnsTheory p → KnowledgeSongStructure p`)

Given that Amy cannot play any songs (`¬CanPlaySongs Amy`), we derive:
1. If Amy cannot play songs, she lacks muscle memory (contrapositive of the second axiom).
2. If she lacks muscle memory, she does not practice chords daily (contrapositive of the first axiom).
3. Since she does not practice chords, she must learn music theory (from the disjunction axiom).
4. Learning music theory implies she has knowledge about song structure.

Thus, Amy must have knowledge about song structure.
