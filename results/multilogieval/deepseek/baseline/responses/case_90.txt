ANSWER: Yes

Explanation:
1. From ¬Invested and A2 (Rivalry → Invested), we derive ¬Rivalry using contraposition.
2. From A3 (Winning ∨ Rivalry) and ¬Rivalry, we get Winning via disjunctive syllogism.
3. From Winning and A1 (Winning → Loud), we get Loud.
4. From Loud and A4 (Loud → Electric), we get Electric.

Thus, ¬Invested → Electric is provable for any event.
