The reasoning is based on the given context and the assumption that Mary did not meet her friends. The key steps are:

1. If Mary did not meet friends (¬MeetFriends), then by contraposition of the errand rule (FinishErrands → MeetFriends), Mary did not finish her errands (¬FinishErrands).
2. The disjunction states that either the weather clears (Clear) or errands are finished (FinishErrands) (or both). Since errands are not finished (¬FinishErrands), the weather must clear (Clear).
3. If the weather clears (Clear), the game goes on (GameOn) by the first rule.
4. If the game is on (GameOn), fans cheer (Cheer) by the fourth rule.
5. If fans cheer (Cheer), it is an exciting night (Exciting) by the fifth rule.

Thus, under the assumption that Mary did not meet friends, it must be an exciting night. The Lean proof formalizes this reasoning.

<lean>
axiom Clear : Prop
axiom FinishErrands : Prop
axiom MeetFriends : Prop
axiom GameOn : Prop
axiom Cheer : Prop
axiom Exciting : Prop

axiom R1 : Clear → GameOn
axiom R2 : FinishErrands → MeetFriends
axiom T1 : Clear ∨ FinishErrands
axiom R3 : GameOn → Cheer
axiom R4 : Cheer → Exciting

theorem answer (h : ¬MeetFriends) : Exciting := by
  have h1 : ¬FinishErrands := fun fe => h (R2 fe)
  cases T1 with
  | inl c => 
      have g : GameOn := R1 c
      have ch : Cheer := R3 g
      exact R4 ch
  | inr fe => 
      exact False.elim (h1 fe)
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes
