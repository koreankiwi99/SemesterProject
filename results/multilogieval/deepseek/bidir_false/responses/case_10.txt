axiom Person : Type
axiom Alex : Person
axiom StudyHard : Person → Prop
axiom GoodGrades : Person → Prop
axiom Participate : Person → Prop
axiom MakeFriends : Person → Prop
axiom Invited : Person → Prop

-- If studied hard, get good grades
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, StudyHard x → GoodGrades x
-- If participated, make new friends
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Person, Participate x → MakeFriends x
-- Alex either studied hard or participated
axiom T1 : StudyHard Alex ∨ Participate Alex
-- If make new friends, get invited
axiom R3 : ∀ x : Person, MakeFriends x → Invited x

-- Given: Alex did not get good grades
axiom T2 : ¬ GoodGrades Alex

-- Attempt to prove ¬Invited Alex (Alex does not get invited)
-- We can derive:
--   From T2 and R1: ¬StudyHard Alex (contraposition of R1)
--   From T1 and ¬StudyHard Alex: Participate Alex (disjunctive syllogism)
--   From Participate Alex and R2: MakeFriends Alex
--   From MakeFriends Alex and R3: Invited Alex
-- Thus we have proven Invited Alex, so we cannot prove ¬Invited Alex.
