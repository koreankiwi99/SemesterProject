The context provides logical premises about business strategies. Let's model this in Lean and attempt to prove that Alex did **not** expand his business, given that he didn't attract more customers.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Alex : obj
axiom AdvertiseCleverly : obj → Prop
axiom OfferDiscounts : obj → Prop
axiom AttractMoreCustomers : obj → Prop
axiom IncreaseSales : obj → Prop
axiom ExpandBusiness : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x, AdvertiseCleverly x → AttractMoreCustomers x
axiom T2 : ∀ x, OfferDiscounts x → IncreaseSales x
axiom T3 : ∀ x, AdvertiseCleverly x ∨ OfferDiscounts x
axiom T4 : ∀ x, IncreaseSales x → ExpandBusiness x
axiom Given : ¬AttractMoreCustomers Alex

-- Attempt to prove ¬ExpandBusiness Alex
theorem goal : ¬ExpandBusiness Alex := by
  -- We know Alex didn't attract more customers (Given)
  -- From T1: If Alex advertised cleverly, he'd attract customers (contradiction with Given)
  have no_advertise : ¬AdvertiseCleverly Alex := fun h => Given (T1 Alex h)
  -- From T3: Alex must offer discounts since he didn't advertise cleverly
  have must_offer : OfferDiscounts Alex := by
    cases T3 Alex
    · contradiction
    · assumption
  -- From T2: Offering discounts implies increased sales
  have increased_sales : IncreaseSales Alex := T2 Alex must_offer
  -- From T4: Increased sales imply business expansion
  have expands : ExpandBusiness Alex := T4 Alex increased_sales
  -- We now have ExpandBusiness Alex, contradicting the goal ¬ExpandBusiness Alex
  contradiction
</lean>

The proof fails because the premises actually **force** Alex to expand his business:
1. No attract more customers → No clever advertising (contrapositive of T1)
2. No clever advertising → Must offer discounts (from disjunction T3)
3. Offer discounts → Increased sales (T2)
4. Increased sales → Business expansion (T4)

Since we derived `ExpandBusiness Alex`, we cannot prove its negation.

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was used incorrectly. The context contained `expands : ExpandBusiness Alex` and the goal was `¬ExpandBusiness Alex`, but these don't directly contradict each other since `¬P` is equivalent to `P → False`. The proof should have assumed `ExpandBusiness Alex` and derived `False`, but this is impossible because the premises actually prove `ExpandBusiness Alex`.

Here's the corrected Lean code showing that we can prove `ExpandBusiness Alex`, making it impossible to prove the negation:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Alex : obj
axiom AdvertiseCleverly : obj → Prop
axiom OfferDiscounts : obj → Prop
axiom AttractMoreCustomers : obj → Prop
axiom IncreaseSales : obj → Prop
axiom ExpandBusiness : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x, AdvertiseCleverly x → AttractMoreCustomers x
axiom T2 : ∀ x, OfferDiscounts x → IncreaseSales x
axiom T3 : ∀ x, AdvertiseCleverly x ∨ OfferDiscounts x
axiom T4 : ∀ x, IncreaseSales x → ExpandBusiness x
axiom Given : ¬AttractMoreCustomers Alex

-- Proof that Alex expands his business
theorem Alex_expands : ExpandBusiness Alex := by
  have no_advertise : ¬AdvertiseCleverly Alex := fun h => Given (T1 Alex h)
  have must_offer : OfferDiscounts Alex := by
    cases T3 Alex with
    | inl adv => contradiction  -- contradicts no_advertise
    | inr off => exact off
  exact T4 Alex (T2 Alex must_offer)

-- Cannot prove ¬ExpandBusiness Alex since we proved ExpandBusiness Alex
</lean>

The premises force Alex to expand his business:
1. No attracted customers → No clever advertising (contrapositive of T1)
2. No clever advertising → Must offer discounts (from disjunction T3)
3. Offering discounts → Increased sales (T2)
4. Increased sales → Business expansion (T4)

Since we've proven `ExpandBusiness Alex`, we cannot prove its negation.
