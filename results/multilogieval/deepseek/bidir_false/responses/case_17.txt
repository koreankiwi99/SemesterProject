The reasoning involves translating the context into logical axioms and attempting to prove that James does not join the public speaking club given that he cannot speak confidently. The premises are:

1. If someone practices thoroughly, they feel prepared: `∀ p, ThoroughlyPractice p → FeelPrepared p`
2. If someone feels prepared, they speak confidently: `∀ p, FeelPrepared p → ConfidentSpeaking p`
3. For improvement, either they practice thoroughly, join the club, or both: `∀ p, ThoroughlyPractice p ∨ JoinClub p`

Given that James cannot speak confidently (`¬ConfidentSpeaking James`), we derive:
- James does not feel prepared (contrapositive of axiom 2).
- James does not practice thoroughly (contrapositive of axiom 1).

From axiom 3, since James does not practice thoroughly, he must join the club to satisfy the disjunction. Thus, we prove `JoinClub James`, meaning we **cannot** prove the negation (that he does not join the club).

axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person
axiom ThoroughlyPractice : Person → Prop
axiom FeelPrepared : Person → Prop
axiom ConfidentSpeaking : Person → Prop
axiom JoinClub : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ p : Person, ThoroughlyPractice p → FeelPrepared p
axiom A2 : ∀ p : Person, FeelPrepared p → ConfidentSpeaking p
axiom A3 : ∀ p : Person, ThoroughlyPractice p ∨ JoinClub p

axiom T1 : ¬ ConfidentSpeaking James

theorem not_prepared : ¬ FeelPrepared James := 
  fun h : FeelPrepared James => T1 (A2 James h)

theorem not_practiced : ¬ ThoroughlyPractice James := 
  fun h : ThoroughlyPractice James => not_prepared (A1 James h)

theorem joins_club : JoinClub James := 
  Or.elim (A3 James) 
    (fun tp : ThoroughlyPractice James => False.elim (not_practiced tp)) 
    (fun jc : JoinClub James => jc)

-- Proving ¬JoinClub James is impossible since joins_club shows JoinClub James.
