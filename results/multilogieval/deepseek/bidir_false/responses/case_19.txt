ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic in the first branch didn't automatically detect that `GreatService` and `¬GreatService` form a contradiction. This is fixed by explicitly deriving `False` using `T1 gs`. 

However, even after fixing this, the proof fails in the second branch because:
1. When `HostEvents` is true, we derive `RevenueImproves`
2. We cannot prove `¬RevenueImproves` (revenue didn't improve) when we have evidence that revenue improved

The premises imply that revenue must have improved since:
- Service quality decreased (`¬GreatService`)
- The store must host events (from `GreatService ∨ HostEvents` and `¬GreatService`)
- Hosting events leads to more customers and improved revenue

Thus we cannot prove the revenue didn't improve.
