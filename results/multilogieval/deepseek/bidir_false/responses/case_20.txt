The context provides information about employees, promotions, influence, and motivation. The key elements are:
- Working hard leads to promotions.
- Impressing bosses leads to gaining influence.
- Not all employees achieved both (there exists an employee without promotion or without influence).
- Motivation leads to working hard.

Given that Mark impresses his bosses, we know he gains influence. However, there is no direct link between impressing bosses and motivation. Assuming Mark is motivated would imply he works hard and gets a promotion (along with gaining influence), but this doesn't contradict the existence of some other employee who lacks both. There are no premises connecting impressing bosses to motivation (or its absence), so we cannot prove Mark is not motivated.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Mark : obj
axiom WorksHard : obj → Prop
axiom GetsPromotion : obj → Prop
axiom ImpressesBoss : obj → Prop
axiom GainsInfluence : obj → Prop
axiom Motivated : obj → Prop

axiom hard_to_promotion : ∀ e, WorksHard e → GetsPromotion e
axiom impress_to_influence : ∀ e, ImpressesBoss e → GainsInfluence e
axiom not_all_succeed : ∃ e, ¬GetsPromotion e ∨ ¬GainsInfluence e
axiom motivated_works_hard : ∀ e, Motivated e → WorksHard e

axiom Mark_impresses : ImpressesBoss Mark

-- Prove ¬Motivated Mark? Attempt fails:
-- Mark impresses bosses → GainsInfluence Mark
-- If Motivated Mark, then WorksHard Mark → GetsPromotion Mark
-- But Mark having both doesn't contradict ∃e, ¬GetsPromotion e ∨ ¬GainsInfluence e
-- No axiom links ImpressesBoss to ¬Motivated
