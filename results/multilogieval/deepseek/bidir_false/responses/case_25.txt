The context does not provide a link between giving effective presentations and being perceptive. The premise states that perceptive salespeople build rapport, but there is no information connecting rapport to effective presentations or Emma's perceptiveness. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that Emma is not perceptive from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Salesperson : Type
axiom Emma : Salesperson
axiom Perceptive : Salesperson → Prop
axiom BuildsRapport : Salesperson → Prop
axiom EffectivePresentation : Salesperson → Prop
axiom T1 : ∀ s : Salesperson, Perceptive s → BuildsRapport s
axiom T2 : EffectivePresentation Emma

-- No axiom connects EffectivePresentation to Perceptive/BuildsRapport.
-- Cannot prove ¬Perceptive Emma from given premises.
