The context provides two implications:
1. Losing an important game causes disappointment.
2. Losing a big match causes demoralization.

The given statement asserts that players are neither disappointed nor demoralized. We aim to prove that the team did NOT lose a significant game (where "significant" means either important or big).

Using contraposition:
- If the team lost an important game, players would be disappointed (by context 1). But players aren't disappointed, so they didn't lose any important game.
- If the team lost a big match, players would be demoralized (by context 2). But players aren't demoralized, so they didn't lose any big match.

Thus, the team lost no significant games. This proves the answer to "Did the team lose a significant game?" is No.
