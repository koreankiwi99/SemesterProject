The context provides three premises:
1. If Team A scores more points, they win: `ScoreMore A → Win A`.
2. If Team B fumbles multiple times, they lose: `FumbleMultiple B → Lose B`.
3. Either Team A scores more or Team B fumbles (or both): `ScoreMore A ∨ FumbleMultiple B`.

The statement to evaluate is: "If Team B did not lose, then Team A scored more points" (`¬Lose B → ScoreMore A`).

To prove the negation of this statement (i.e., `¬(¬Lose B → ScoreMore A)`), which is equivalent to `¬Lose B ∧ ¬ScoreMore A`), we attempt a proof by contradiction:
- Assume `¬Lose B` and `¬ScoreMore A`.
- From `¬ScoreMore A` and the disjunction (`ScoreMore A ∨ FumbleMultiple B`), we get `FumbleMultiple B`.
- From `FumbleMultiple B` and the second premise, we get `Lose B`.
- This contradicts `¬Lose B`.

However, this contradiction means the assumption `¬Lose B ∧ ¬ScoreMore A` is false. Thus, we cannot prove the negation of the original implication. The implication `¬Lose B → ScoreMore A` holds under the given premises.
