The context does not provide sufficient information to conclude that Mark is not dedicated to his sport. While the context states that dedication leads to proper training, and healthy eating increases strength, there is no direct link between eating healthy and dedication. Additionally, the context indicates that athletes may lack skill or strength, but this does not imply anything about Mark's dedication since healthy eating alone does not address dedication. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that Mark is not dedicated.

<lean>
axiom Athlete : Type
axiom Mark : Athlete
axiom EatHealthy : Athlete → Prop
axiom Dedicated : Athlete → Prop
axiom TrainProperly : Athlete → Prop
axiom mark_eats_healthy : EatHealthy Mark
axiom dedication_training : ∀ a : Athlete, Dedicated a → TrainProperly a
-- No axioms link EatHealthy to Dedicated or provide a contradiction for Dedicated Mark
-- Cannot prove ¬Dedicated Mark from the given context
