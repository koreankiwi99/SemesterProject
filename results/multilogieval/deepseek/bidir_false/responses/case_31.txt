The context provides two implications:
1. If someone suspects cheating, they should have an open conversation.
2. Infidelity concerns warrant re-evaluating the relationship.

The given statement is: Priya either didn't talk to her partner or didn't reassess the relationship.

To prove: Priya did NOT suspect cheating (negation of the question).

**Proof structure:**
- Assume Priya suspected cheating (for contradiction).
- By context rules, this implies she both talked to her partner and reassessed the relationship.
- This directly contradicts the given disjunction (she must have done both, but the statement says at least one didn't happen).
