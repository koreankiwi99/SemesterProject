The context provides several premises and the mayor's conclusion. The key points are:
1. If someone exercises regularly, they are fit.
2. If someone eats nutritious foods, they have energy.
3. Not everyone is both active and energetic (meaning there exists at least one person who is either not active or not energetic).
4. The mayor concluded that some citizens do not exercise regularly or do not eat nutritious foods.
5. If someone values wellness, they exercise regularly.
6. Jane eats nutritious foods.

The goal is to determine if Jane values wellness. However, there is no direct link between eating nutritious foods and valuing wellness. The premises only state that valuing wellness implies exercising regularly, but do not connect eating habits to valuing wellness. While Jane eats well, we have no information about her exercise habits. The mayor's conclusion about some citizens failing in exercise or eating does not specify Jane, so we cannot conclude she fails in exercise. Therefore, we cannot prove that Jane does not value wellness.

axiom obj : Type
axiom ExerciseRegularly : obj → Prop
axiom EatNutritiousFoods : obj → Prop
axiom ValueWellness : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : ∃ x, ¬ExerciseRegularly x ∨ ¬EatNutritiousFoods x
axiom R1 : ∀ x, ValueWellness x → ExerciseRegularly x
axiom Jane : obj
axiom Jane_eats : EatNutritiousFoods Jane

-- We cannot prove ¬ValueWellness Jane because:
-- 1. R1 only gives ValueWellness Jane → ExerciseRegularly Jane
-- 2. Jane_eats shows EatNutritiousFoods Jane
-- 3. T1 shows there exists someone who fails in exercise or eating, but it might not be Jane
-- Since Jane eats well, if she were the witness in T1, she must fail in exercise (¬ExerciseRegularly Jane).
-- But T1 does not specify that Jane is the witness, so we cannot assume ¬ExerciseRegularly Jane.
-- Without ¬ExerciseRegularly Jane, we cannot use R1 to prove ¬ValueWellness Jane.
