After analyzing the context and the statement using Lean, we model the problem as follows:

- We define a type `Farmer` for farmers in the village.
- `Bob` is a specific farmer.
- Predicates:
  - `UsesOrganic` : farmer uses organic methods.
  - `RotatesCrops` : farmer rotates crops well.
  - `Healthy` : farmer's crops are healthy.
  - `Nutrients` : farmer's crops have nutrients.
  - `Aware` : farmer is aware.
  - `OneWithNature` : farmer is one with nature.
- Axioms from context:
  - `A1` : Organic methods → healthy crops (∀f, UsesOrganic f → Healthy f).
  - `A2` : Crop rotation → nutrients maintained (∀f, RotatesCrops f → Nutrients f).
  - `A3` : Crops are unhealthy or lack nutrients (∀f, ¬Healthy f ∨ ¬Nutrients f).
  - `A4` : Awareness implies that being one with nature leads to organic methods (∀f, Aware f → (OneWithNature f → UsesOrganic f)).
- Given fact: `Bob` rotates crops well (`RotatesCrops Bob`).

**Lean Analysis:**

<lean>
axiom Farmer : Type
axiom Bob : Farmer
axiom UsesOrganic : Farmer → Prop
axiom RotatesCrops : Farmer → Prop
axiom Healthy : Farmer → Prop
axiom Nutrients : Farmer → Prop
axiom Aware : Farmer → Prop
axiom OneWithNature : Farmer → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ f : Farmer, UsesOrganic f → Healthy f
axiom A2 : ∀ f : Farmer, RotatesCrops f → Nutrients f
axiom A3 : ∀ f : Farmer, ¬Healthy f ∨ ¬Nutrients f
axiom A4 : ∀ f : Farmer, Aware f → (OneWithNature f → UsesOrganic f)
axiom T1 : RotatesCrops Bob   -- Bob rotates crops

-- Prove nutrients for Bob (from A2 and T1)
theorem T2 : Nutrients Bob := A2 Bob T1

-- Derive that Bob's crops are not healthy (from A3 and T2)
theorem T3 : ¬Healthy Bob := by
  have h : ¬Healthy Bob ∨ ¬Nutrients Bob := A3 Bob
  cases h with
  | inl h1 => exact h1
  | inr h2 => contradiction   -- T2 contradicts ¬Nutrients Bob

-- Prove Bob does not use organic methods (from A1 and T3)
theorem T4 : ¬UsesOrganic Bob := by
  intro h_use
  have h_healthy : Healthy Bob := A1 Bob h_use
  contradiction   -- T3 contradicts h_healthy

-- Attempt to prove Bob is NOT one with nature
-- Problem: We lack proof that Bob is "Aware" to use A4.
-- Without `Aware Bob`, we cannot link OneWithNature to UsesOrganic.
-- Thus, ¬OneWithNature Bob is unprovable.
</lean>

**Conclusion:**  
We cannot prove that Bob is **not** one with nature. The critical missing piece is whether Bob is `Aware` (required to activate A4). Without this, we cannot connect `OneWithNature` to `UsesOrganic`, and our proof fails.

After analyzing the compilation errors, I've revised the Lean code to fix the issues. The main problem was that the `contradiction` tactic wasn't finding the necessary contradictions automatically, so I've made the proofs more explicit.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Farmer : Type
axiom Bob : Farmer
axiom UsesOrganic : Farmer → Prop
axiom RotatesCrops : Farmer → Prop
axiom Healthy : Farmer → Prop
axiom Nutrients : Farmer → Prop
axiom Aware : Farmer → Prop
axiom OneWithNature : Farmer → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ f : Farmer, UsesOrganic f → Healthy f
axiom A2 : ∀ f : Farmer, RotatesCrops f → Nutrients f
axiom A3 : ∀ f : Farmer, ¬Healthy f ∨ ¬Nutrients f
axiom A4 : ∀ f : Farmer, Aware f → (OneWithNature f → UsesOrganic f)
axiom T1 : RotatesCrops Bob   -- Bob rotates crops

-- Prove nutrients for Bob
theorem T2 : Nutrients Bob := A2 Bob T1

-- Derive that Bob's crops are not healthy
theorem T3 : ¬Healthy Bob := by
  have h : ¬Healthy Bob ∨ ¬Nutrients Bob := A3 Bob
  cases h with
  | inl h1 => exact h1
  | inr h2 => 
      -- h2 claims no nutrients, but T2 proves nutrients
      exact False.elim (h2 T2)  -- Explicit contradiction

-- Prove Bob does not use organic methods
theorem T4 : ¬UsesOrganic Bob := by
  intro h_use
  have h_healthy : Healthy Bob := A1 Bob h_use
  exact T3 h_healthy  -- Direct contradiction of T3 and h_healthy

-- Attempt to prove Bob is NOT one with nature
-- We have T4: ¬UsesOrganic Bob
-- A4 requires Aware Bob to link OneWithNature to UsesOrganic
-- Without Aware Bob, we cannot establish the connection
-- Thus ¬OneWithNature Bob is unprovable
</lean>

**Explanation of Fixes:**
1. In `T3`: For the `inr` case, I explicitly show the contradiction between `h2 (¬Nutrients Bob)` and `T2 (Nutrients Bob)` using `False.elim (h2 T2)`
2. In `T4`: Instead of using `contradiction`, I directly apply `T3` to `h_healthy` to show the contradiction

**Conclusion:**
While we can prove that Bob doesn't use organic methods (`T4`), we cannot prove that Bob is not one with nature because:
- Axiom `A4` only links "one with nature" to organic methods for *aware* farmers
- We have no information about whether Bob is aware (`Aware Bob`)
- Without this critical link, we cannot connect the proven fact about organic methods (`T4`) to the question about being one with nature
