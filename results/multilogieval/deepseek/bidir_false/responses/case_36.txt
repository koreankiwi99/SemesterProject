The context provides two premises:  
1. If someone has computer problems, they should restart the computer.  
2. If someone has computer problems, they should check for software updates.  

The statement to evaluate is: "Either Mary did not restart her computer or she did not install the latest updates."  

We need to determine if we can prove that Mary was **not** having computer problems (¬Problems(Mary)).  

Key observations:  
- The premises describe **obligations** ("should restart", "should check"), not necessarily actual actions.  
- The given statement describes **actual actions** (Mary did not restart or did not install updates).  
- There is no axiom linking "should check" to "installing updates".  
- There is no axiom stating that obligations imply actual actions (e.g., "should restart" does not imply "did restart").  

Thus:  
- From ¬Restart(Mary), we cannot infer ¬Problems(Mary) because "should restart" ≠ "did restart".  
- From ¬InstallUpdates(Mary), we cannot infer anything about Problems(Mary) since no premise connects problems to installation.  
- The disjunction (¬Restart ∨ ¬InstallUpdates) does not provide enough information to prove ¬Problems(Mary).  

Conclusion: We cannot prove ¬Problems(Mary).

axiom obj : Type
axiom Mary : obj
axiom Problems : obj → Prop
axiom ShouldRestart : obj → Prop
axiom ShouldCheckUpdates : obj → Prop
axiom DidRestart : obj → Prop
axiom DidInstallUpdates : obj → Prop

-- Context: If someone has problems, they should restart
axiom R1 : ∀ x, Problems x → ShouldRestart x

-- Context: If someone has problems, they should check for updates
axiom R2 : ∀ x, Problems x → ShouldCheckUpdates x

-- Given statement: Mary did not restart OR did not install updates
axiom given : ¬ DidRestart Mary ∨ ¬ DidInstallUpdates Mary

-- Attempt to prove Mary had no problems
theorem no_problems : ¬ Problems Mary := by 
  -- No axioms link obligations (ShouldRestart/ShouldCheckUpdates) to actions (DidRestart/DidInstallUpdates)
  -- Cannot derive ¬Problems(Mary) from the disjunction
  sorry  -- Proof fails
