The context provides logical relationships between marketing investment, production costs, and sales increases. The statement to evaluate assumes sales did not increase and asks whether production costs increased. The goal is to prove that production costs did **not** increase (the negation of the conclusion) from the premises.

**Analysis:**
- Premise 1: If invested in marketing (`InvestedInMarketing`), then sales increase (`SalesIncreased`).  
  `T1 : InvestedInMarketing → SalesIncreased`
- Premise 2: Either invested in marketing, or production costs increased (`ProductionCostsIncreased`), or both.  
  `T2 : InvestedInMarketing ∨ ProductionCostsIncreased`
- Given: Sales did not increase (`¬SalesIncreased`).

From `T1` and `¬SalesIncreased`, we deduce `¬InvestedInMarketing` (using contraposition). Combining this with `T2` (which requires at least one of `InvestedInMarketing` or `ProductionCostsIncreased`), we conclude `ProductionCostsIncreased` must be true. Therefore, it is **impossible** to prove that production costs did **not** increase (`¬ProductionCostsIncreased`). The negation of the conclusion cannot be proven.

  h_contra  -- Attempt to derive contradiction fails in Case 2
-- Proof fails: Case 2 (ProductionCostsIncreased) aligns with h_pc, so no contradiction arises.
</lean>

**Explanation:**  
- The Lean code attempts to prove `¬ProductionCostsIncreased` by assuming `ProductionCostsIncreased` and deriving a contradiction.  
- From `given` (¬SalesIncreased) and `T1`, we get `¬InvestedInMarketing`.  
- Using `T2`, we case-split:  
  - If `InvestedInMarketing`, it contradicts `¬InvestedInMarketing`.  
  - If `ProductionCostsIncreased`, it matches the assumption `h_pc`, so **no contradiction** occurs.  
- Thus, the proof of `¬ProductionCostsIncreased` fails.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The errors in the previous Lean code occurred because the term `h_pc` was incorrectly applied as a function when it's actually a proposition. The proof attempt also contained logical inconsistencies due to a misunderstanding of the disjunction elimination. 

After reevaluation, we can prove constructively that production costs *did* increase from the premises. Therefore, it's impossible to prove the negation (that production costs did not increase). The corrected Lean code defines the axioms and proves the positive case, making the negative case unprovable.

axiom InvestedInMarketing : Prop
axiom ProductionCostsIncreased : Prop
axiom SalesIncreased : Prop

axiom T1 : InvestedInMarketing → SalesIncreased
axiom T2 : InvestedInMarketing ∨ ProductionCostsIncreased
axiom given : ¬SalesIncreased

-- Proof that production costs must have increased
theorem production_costs_increased : ProductionCostsIncreased := by
  cases T2 with
  | inl invest => 
      have : SalesIncreased := T1 invest
      exact False.elim (given this)  -- Contradiction: sales increased but given says no
  | inr pc => exact pc              -- Direct proof of production cost increase

-- Attempt to prove ¬ProductionCostsIncreased fails because 
-- we have already proven ProductionCostsIncreased. 
-- No valid proof of negation exists.
