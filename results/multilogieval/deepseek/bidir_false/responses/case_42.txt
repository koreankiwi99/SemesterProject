The context states that flu season started, which implies many children get sick (K). The disjunction (S ∨ ¬K ∨ (S ∧ ¬K)) simplifies to S when K is true, as the other cases lead to contradiction. This means it must be sunny (S). Sunny weather implies children play outside (P), which in turn implies they sleep well (W). Therefore, we cannot prove that children do not sleep well (¬W).

axiom S : Prop  -- Sunny
axiom F : Prop  -- Flu season started
axiom P : Prop  -- Children play outside
axiom K : Prop  -- Many children get sick
axiom W : Prop  -- Children sleep well

The compilation errors occurred due to naming conflicts between the proposition `K` and a local variable `K`. To resolve this, I renamed the propositions to use descriptive names in lowercase, avoiding reserved keywords. 

The corrected Lean code attempts to prove that children do not sleep well (¬sleepWell) by assuming sleepWell and deriving a contradiction. The disjunction simplifies to sunny when manySick is true (which follows from flu_started). In the sunny case, we derive sleepWell without contradiction. In other cases, we get contradictions from ¬manySick vs manySick. However, since sunny is forced and leads to sleepWell, we cannot derive a contradiction in all cases.

<lean>
axiom sunny : Prop
axiom fluStarted : Prop
axiom playOutside : Prop
axiom manySick : Prop
axiom sleepWell : Prop

axiom sunny_play : sunny → playOutside
axiom flu_sick : fluStarted → manySick
axiom disjunction : sunny ∨ ¬manySick ∨ (sunny ∧ ¬manySick)
axiom play_sleep : playOutside → sleepWell
axiom flu_started : fluStarted

theorem not_sleep_well : ¬sleepWell :=
  fun hW : sleepWell => 
  have ms : manySick := flu_sick flu_started
  match disjunction with
  | Or.inl s => 
      have po : playOutside := sunny_play s
      have sw : sleepWell := play_sleep po
      -- No contradiction: sleepWell holds
      sorry  -- Cannot derive False
  | Or.inr (Or.inl not_ms) => 
      False.elim (not_ms ms)  -- Contradiction: manySick and ¬manySick
  | Or.inr (Or.inr ⟨s, not_ms⟩) => 
      False.elim (not_ms ms)  -- Contradiction: manySick and ¬manySick
