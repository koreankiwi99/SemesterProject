The context provides information about transit conditions and commutes, but does not mention James or his commute method. The premises establish:
1. If the subway runs on schedule, someone takes it.
2. If the bus has room, someone takes it.
3. Anyone taking subway or bus has a smooth commute (on time).
4. Subway takers get to work on time (redundant with 3).

The statement assumes James did not take the bus. However:
- James might have taken the subway, which would imply he is on time (by axiom 3).
- James might have used another transit method (e.g., car), where on-time status is unknown.
- No axioms force James to use transit or link his bus avoidance to lateness.

Thus, we cannot prove James did not get to work on time from the premises.

axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person
axiom SubwayOnSchedule : Prop
axiom BusHasRoom : Prop
axiom TakesSubway : Person → Prop
axiom TakesBus : Person → Prop
axiom OnTime : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : SubwayOnSchedule → ∃ p, TakesSubway p
axiom A2 : BusHasRoom → ∃ p, TakesBus p
axiom A3 : ∀ p, (TakesSubway p ∨ TakesBus p) → OnTime p

-- Attempt to prove: If James didn't take the bus, he didn't get to work on time.
-- Fails due to lack of information about James's commute method.

    intro hOnTime
    -- We know ¬TakesBus James, but James might have taken the subway (making OnTime James true by A3).
    -- We have no contradiction since we cannot prove ¬TakesSubway James or other constraints.
    -- Therefore, the proof fails at this point.
