The reasoning involves proving that Max did not learn new skills from the given premises and the fact that he was unable to pick up the materials. The Lean formalization shows that the axioms lead to Max learning new skills, making it impossible to prove the negation.

<lean>
axiom ArrivesOnTime : Prop
axiom HasSpecialOrder : Prop
axiom StartNewProject : Prop
axiom CanPickUpMaterials : Prop
axiom LearnNewSkills : Prop

axiom P1 : ArrivesOnTime → StartNewProject
axiom P2 : HasSpecialOrder → CanPickUpMaterials
axiom P3 : ArrivesOnTime ∨ HasSpecialOrder
axiom P4 : StartNewProject → LearnNewSkills

axiom Given : ¬CanPickUpMaterials

-- Proof that Max must learn new skills
theorem must_learn : LearnNewSkills := by
  have no_special : ¬HasSpecialOrder := fun h => Given (P2 h)
  have arrives : ArrivesOnTime := by
    cases P3 with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr h => exact absurd h no_special
  exact P4 (P1 arrives)

-- Cannot prove ¬LearnNewSkills (contradiction)
</lean>
