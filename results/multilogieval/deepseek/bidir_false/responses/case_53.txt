The context and statement are translated into Lean as follows. The goal is to prove that Mary did not learn new methods and mediums (i.e., `¬ LearnNewMethods Mary`). However, the premises lead to the conclusion that Mary *did* learn new methods, making it impossible to prove the negation.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mary : obj
axiom PracticedOften : obj → Prop
axiom TechniqueImproves : obj → Prop
axiom StandOut : obj → Prop
axiom TookArtClass : obj → Prop
axiom LearnNewMethods : obj → Prop

axiom practice_imp_technique : ∀ x, PracticedOften x → TechniqueImproves x
axiom technique_imp_standout : ∀ x, TechniqueImproves x → StandOut x
axiom practice_or_class : ∀ x, PracticedOften x ∨ TookArtClass x
axiom class_imp_learn : ∀ x, TookArtClass x → LearnNewMethods x
axiom mary_not_standout : ¬ StandOut Mary

-- Attempt to prove ¬LearnNewMethods Mary (i.e., Mary did NOT learn new methods)
theorem disprove_learn_new : ¬ LearnNewMethods Mary :=
  -- Assume Mary learned new methods and derive contradiction? 
  -- But premises show she must have learned, so negation is unprovable.
  fun hLearn : LearnNewMethods Mary => 
  -- First, show Mary's technique did not improve (from ¬StandOut and technique_imp_standout)
  have no_tech : ¬ TechniqueImproves Mary := 
    fun hTech : TechniqueImproves Mary => 
    mary_not_standout (technique_imp_standout Mary hTech)
  -- Then, show Mary did not practice often (from no_tech and practice_imp_technique)
  have no_practice : ¬ PracticedOften Mary := 
    fun hPractice : PracticedOften Mary => 
    no_tech (practice_imp_technique Mary hPractice)
  -- By practice_or_class, Mary must have taken an art class
  have took_class : TookArtClass Mary := 
    Or.elim (practice_or_class Mary) 
      (fun hPractice => False.elim (no_practice hPractice)) 
      (fun hClass => hClass)
  -- Thus, Mary learned new methods (from class_imp_learn)
  have learned : LearnNewMethods Mary := class_imp_learn Mary took_class
  -- But hLearn is the assumption that LearnNewMethods Mary holds, so no contradiction.
  -- We cannot derive False here because the premises force learned to be true.
  -- This shows ¬LearnNewMethods Mary is unprovable (contradiction would require ¬hLearn, but learned is true).
  learned -- This is a term of type LearnNewMethods Mary, not False.
-- The above proof fails to construct a contradiction. Instead, it confirms LearnNewMethods Mary.
</lean>

The Lean code demonstrates:
1. `mary_not_standout` implies `¬ TechniqueImproves Mary` (contrapositive of `technique_imp_standout`).
2. `¬ TechniqueImproves Mary` implies `¬ PracticedOften Mary` (contrapositive of `practice_imp_technique`).
3. `¬ PracticedOften Mary` and `practice_or_class Mary` force `TookArtClass Mary`.
4. `TookArtClass Mary` implies `LearnNewMethods Mary` (by `class_imp_learn`).

Thus, `LearnNewMethods Mary` holds, and `¬ LearnNewMethods Mary` cannot be proven. The attempt to prove the negation fails.

To resolve the type mismatch error, we need to demonstrate that assuming `LearnNewMethods Mary` leads to a contradiction. However, the premises force `LearnNewMethods Mary` to hold regardless of the assumption. Here's the corrected code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mary : obj
axiom PracticedOften : obj → Prop
axiom TechniqueImproves : obj → Prop
axiom StandOut : obj → Prop
axiom TookArtClass : obj → Prop
axiom LearnNewMethods : obj → Prop

axiom practice_imp_technique : ∀ x, PracticedOften x → TechniqueImproves x
axiom technique_imp_standout : ∀ x, TechniqueImproves x → StandOut x
axiom practice_or_class : ∀ x, PracticedOften x ∨ TookArtClass x
axiom class_imp_learn : ∀ x, TookArtClass x → LearnNewMethods x
axiom mary_not_standout : ¬ StandOut Mary

theorem disprove_learn_new : ¬ LearnNewMethods Mary := by
  intro hLearn
  -- From Mary's artwork not standing out, her technique did not improve
  have no_tech := mary_not_standout  ∘ technique_imp_standout Mary
  -- Thus, she did not practice often
  have no_practice := no_tech ∘ practice_imp_technique Mary
  -- Therefore, she must have taken an art class
  cases practice_or_class Mary with
  | inl hPractice => contradiction  -- Contradiction with no_practice
  | inr hClass =>
    -- She learned new methods from the class
    have learned := class_imp_learn Mary hClass
    -- Now we have both hLearn and learned as proofs of LearnNewMethods Mary
    -- This is a direct contradiction (A ∧ ¬A)
    contradiction
</lean>

**Final Explanation:**

The corrected code uses `contradiction` to handle the case where `hLearn` (assumed `¬LearnNewMethods Mary`) conflicts with the derived `learned` (proof of `LearnNewMethods Mary`). However, the premises ensure that `learned` is always true when `Mary`'s artwork doesn't stand out, making `hLearn` (`¬LearnNewMethods Mary`) impossible. Lean's `contradiction` tactic detects this inconsistency, but since the premises logically enforce `LearnNewMethods Mary`, the negation **cannot** be proven. 

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was used incorrectly. The premises imply that Mary *did* learn new methods, so assuming she didn't (to try to prove ¬LearnNewMethods) cannot lead to a contradiction. The corrected analysis shows:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mary : obj
axiom PracticedOften : obj → Prop
axiom TechniqueImproves : obj → Prop
axiom StandOut : obj → Prop
axiom TookArtClass : obj → Prop
axiom LearnNewMethods : obj → Prop

axiom practice_imp_technique : ∀ x, PracticedOften x → TechniqueImproves x
axiom technique_imp_standout : ∀ x, TechniqueImproves x → StandOut x
axiom practice_or_class : ∀ x, PracticedOften x ∨ TookArtClass x
axiom class_imp_learn : ∀ x, TookArtClass x → LearnNewMethods x
axiom mary_not_standout : ¬ StandOut Mary

-- Prove that Mary MUST have learned new methods
theorem must_learn : LearnNewMethods Mary := by
  -- If technique improves, artwork stands out → but Mary's didn't → technique didn't improve
  have no_tech : ¬ TechniqueImproves Mary := 
    fun hTech => mary_not_standout (technique_imp_standout Mary hTech)
  -- If practiced often, technique improves → didn't practice often
  have no_practice : ¬ PracticedOften Mary := 
    fun hPractice => no_tech (practice_imp_technique Mary hPractice)
  -- Must have taken art class (since no practice)
  have took_class : TookArtClass Mary := by
    cases practice_or_class Mary
    case inl h => exact False.elim (no_practice h)
    case inr h => exact h
  -- Therefore learned new methods
  exact class_imp_learn Mary took_class

-- Since must_learn proves LearnNewMethods Mary, we CANNOT prove ¬LearnNewMethods Mary
</lean>

**Explanation:**  
1. `mary_not_standout` and `technique_imp_standout` imply ¬TechniqueImproves Mary  
2. ¬TechniqueImproves Mary and `practice_imp_technique` imply ¬PracticedOften Mary  
3. ¬PracticedOften Mary and `practice_or_class` force TookArtClass Mary  
4. `class_imp_learn` then proves LearnNewMethods Mary  

Thus, ¬LearnNewMethods Mary is false and cannot be proven.
