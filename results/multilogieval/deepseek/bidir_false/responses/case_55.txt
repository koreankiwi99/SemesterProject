After analyzing the reasoning text and the compilation errors in the previous Lean code, I've corrected the approach. The key insight is that the premises actually imply that if attendance is low, then it must be a sequel. This means we cannot prove the negation of the statement.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom movie : obj
axiom GoodReviews : obj → Prop
axiom ManyPeople : obj → Prop
axiom BigStar : obj → Prop
axiom Sequel : obj → Prop

axiom R1 : GoodReviews movie → ManyPeople movie
axiom R3 : GoodReviews movie ∨ ¬ ManyPeople movie
axiom R4 : BigStar movie → GoodReviews movie
axiom R5 : BigStar movie ∨ Sequel movie

-- Attempt to prove negation of the statement: ¬(¬ManyPeople → Sequel)
theorem disprove : ¬(¬ManyPeople movie → Sequel movie) := by
  intro h
  -- Manually unfold ¬(P → Q) as P ∧ ¬Q
  have h_low : ¬ManyPeople movie := fun hp => h (fun _ => hp) hp
  have h_not_sequel : ¬Sequel movie := fun hs => h (fun _ => hs) hs
  -- Now use the premises
  cases R5 with
  | inl h_bigstar =>
    have h_good := R4 h_bigstar
    have h_many := R1 h_good
    exact h_low h_many
  | inr h_sequel =>
    exact h_not_sequel h_sequel
</lean>

The corrected proof shows that assuming the negation of "if attendance is low then it is a sequel" leads to a contradiction with the premises. Specifically:
1. We derive both low attendance (¬ManyPeople) and not being a sequel (¬Sequel) from the negation
2. From R5 (BigStar ∨ Sequel), we consider both cases:
   - If there's a big star, we get good reviews (R4), then high attendance (R1), contradicting low attendance
   - If it's a sequel, this directly contradicts ¬Sequel

Since both cases lead to contradiction, we've successfully proven the negation of the original statement. However, note that this means the original statement ("if attendance is low then it is a sequel") must be true according to the premises. Therefore, we cannot prove the conclusion ("if attendance was low then is it a sequel?") is "No" - it's actually "Yes".

But since the task was to prove the answer is "No", and we've instead proven the opposite, we must conclude that it's impossible to prove the answer is "No". Thus the final answer is Failure.

ITERATION 3

After analyzing the errors and the logical structure, I realize the initial approach was flawed. The premises actually imply that "if attendance is low then it is a sequel" is true, making it impossible to prove the negation. Here's the corrected Lean analysis:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom movie : obj
axiom GoodReviews : obj → Prop
axiom ManyPeople : obj → Prop
axiom BigStar : obj → Prop
axiom Sequel : obj → Prop

axiom R1 : GoodReviews movie → ManyPeople movie
axiom R3 : GoodReviews movie ∨ ¬ManyPeople movie
axiom R4 : BigStar movie → GoodReviews movie
axiom R5 : BigStar movie ∨ Sequel movie

-- Attempt to prove ¬(¬ManyPeople movie → Sequel movie) fails
theorem disprove : ¬(¬ManyPeople movie → Sequel movie) := by
  intro h
  -- We need to show False by deriving contradiction from h and axioms
  cases R5 with
  | inl h_big =>
    have h_good := R4 h_big
    have h_many := R1 h_good
    cases R3 with
    | inl _ => 
      -- Have ManyPeople but no way to get ¬ManyPeople
      apply h
      intro h_not_many
      contradiction  -- h_many and h_not_many
    | inr h_not_many =>
      contradiction  -- h_many and h_not_many
  | inr h_seq =>
    -- Have Sequel but no contradiction with h
    apply h
    intro _
    exact h_seq
</lean>

The proof still fails because:
- In the BigStar case: When we have ManyPeople, we can't use the implication h since its premise (¬ManyPeople) is false
- In the Sequel case: The conclusion matches h's output, so no contradiction arises

Since we cannot prove the negation of "if attendance was low then it is a sequel", and the premises actually support this statement, we conclude:
