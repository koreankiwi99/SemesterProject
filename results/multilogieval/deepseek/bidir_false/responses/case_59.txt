ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After analyzing the reasoning, I've corrected the Lean code to properly handle the proof attempt. The key insight is that the premises actually imply that Emma *does* gain knowledge of music theory, making it impossible to prove the negation (¬KnowsTheory Emma).

ANSWER: Failure

Explanation:
1. The error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was used without an actual contradiction in the premises
2. The corrected proof shows:
   - Emma can't entertain → can't play songs (T2)
   - Can't play songs → didn't learn chords (T1)
   - Didn't learn chords → must have taken lessons (T3)
   - Took lessons → gains music theory knowledge (T4)
3. This proves *KnowsTheory Emma*, making ¬KnowsTheory Emma unprovable
4. The `sorry` is used to satisfy Lean's syntax but marks the unprovable negation
