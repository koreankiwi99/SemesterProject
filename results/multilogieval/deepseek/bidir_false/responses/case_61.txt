The context states that regular attendance implies that diligent study leads to excelling. Priya studied diligently but did not excel. To determine if she attended regularly, we prove she did not.

axiom Student : Type
axiom Priya : Student
axiom AttendsRegularly : Student → Prop
axiom StudiesDiligently : Student → Prop
axiom Excels : Student → Prop
axiom A1 : ∀ s : Student, AttendsRegularly s → (StudiesDiligently s → Excels s)
axiom A2 : StudiesDiligently Priya
axiom A3 : ¬ Excels Priya

theorem Priya_not_attends : ¬ AttendsRegularly Priya :=
  fun hAttend : AttendsRegularly Priya =>
  have hImplies : StudiesDiligently Priya → Excels Priya := A1 Priya hAttend
  have hExcels : Excels Priya := hImplies A2
  show False from A3 hExcels

ANSWER: No
