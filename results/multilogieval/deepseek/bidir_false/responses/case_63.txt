The context states that if someone plants disease-resistant varieties and waters and feeds properly, they will have a bountiful harvest. Linda watered and fed properly but did not have a bountiful harvest. Therefore, Linda must not have planted disease-resistant varieties, as otherwise, she would have had a bountiful harvest.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Linda : obj
axiom PlantsDR : obj → Prop
axiom WaterFeedProperly : obj → Prop
axiom BountifulHarvest : obj → Prop

axiom Context : ∀ x : obj, PlantsDR x → (WaterFeedProperly x → BountifulHarvest x)
axiom T1 : WaterFeedProperly Linda
axiom T2 : ¬ BountifulHarvest Linda

theorem linda_not_plantsDR : ¬ PlantsDR Linda :=
  fun h : PlantsDR Linda =>
  have wf_implies_bh : WaterFeedProperly Linda → BountifulHarvest Linda := Context Linda h
  have bh : BountifulHarvest Linda := wf_implies_bh T1
  show False from T2 bh
</lean>

ANSWER: No
