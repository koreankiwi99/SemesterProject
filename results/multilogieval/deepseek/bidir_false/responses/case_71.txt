-- Premises
axiom P1 : Sunny
axiom P2 : ∀ x : Person, ApplySunscreen x → ¬GetBurnt x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : Person, GoSwimming x → GetExercise x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : Person, ApplySunscreen x ∨ ¬GetExercise x
axiom P5 : WarmWater → ∀ x : Person, GoSwimming x
axiom P6 : Sunny → WarmWater

-- Prove that if Alex got sunburnt, then the weather was sunny (¬(GetBurnt Alex → Sunny))
theorem weather_sunny : GetBurnt Alex → Sunny := by
  intro h_burnt
  -- From P1, Sunny is already true, so weather was sunny regardless of Alex's burn.
