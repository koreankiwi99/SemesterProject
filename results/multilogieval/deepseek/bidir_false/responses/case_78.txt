The context provides a general rule for novelists: if a novelist develops compelling characters and crafts an intriguing plot, their book connects with readers. The premises state that Lauren crafted an intriguing plot and her book did not connect with readers. However, the context does not explicitly state that Lauren is a novelist. Without this information, the general rule for novelists cannot be applied to Lauren. Therefore, it is impossible to prove whether Lauren developed compelling characters or not based solely on the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Writer : Type
axiom Lauren : Writer
axiom CompellingCharacters : Writer → Prop
axiom IntriguingPlot : Writer → Prop
axiom Connects : Writer → Prop
axiom Novelist : Writer → Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ w : Writer, Novelist w → (CompellingCharacters w → (IntriguingPlot w → Connects w))
axiom P1 : IntriguingPlot Lauren
axiom P2 : ¬ Connects Lauren

-- Cannot prove ¬CompellingCharacters Lauren without knowing Novelist Lauren
