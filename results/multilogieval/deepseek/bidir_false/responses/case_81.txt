-- If they practice, they develop muscle memory

-- If they develop muscle memory, they can play simple songs
axiom memory_to_play : ∀ x : obj, MuscleMemory x → PlaySongs x
-- Practice implies play songs (derived from above)

-- Either practices or focused on theory or both
axiom practice_or_theory : ∀ x : obj, Practice x ∨ FocusTheory x
-- If focused on theory, they gain knowledge
axiom theory_to_knowledge : ∀ x : obj, FocusTheory x → Knowledge x

-- Amy cannot play any songs
axiom amy_cannot_play : ¬ PlaySongs Amy

-- Attempt to prove: Amy does NOT have knowledge (¬Knowledge Amy)
-- We can prove FocusTheory Amy, which implies Knowledge Amy, so ¬Knowledge Amy is unprovable
theorem cannot_prove_negation : ¬ Knowledge Amy → False := by

  -- Amy must have FocusTheory since she doesn't practice (because practice leads to playing songs)
  have no_practice : ¬ Practice Amy := by
    intro practice_amy
    exact amy_cannot_play (practice_to_play Amy practice_amy)
  cases practice_or_theory Amy with
  | inl practice => contradiction
  | inr focused => 
      have : Knowledge Amy := theory_to_knowledge Amy focused
      contradiction
