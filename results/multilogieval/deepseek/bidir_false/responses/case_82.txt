The reasoning involves evaluating whether the house felt homey and cozy given that James did not celebrate. The premises provide conditions that could lead to a homey feeling, but they do not sufficiently link James not celebrating to the absence of a homey environment. Specifically:

- James not celebrating implies he did not win a contest (by axiom R2), but others might have won and celebrated.
- Peaches being in season or someone winning a contest (R3) does not directly prevent the farmer's market from having ripe peaches, which could lead to pie baking (R1), amazing smells (R4), and a homey feeling (R5).
- No premise connects James not celebrating to the absence of ripe peaches or pie baking.

Thus, it is impossible to prove that the house did not feel homey and cozy.

axiom HasRipePeaches : Prop
axiom BakePie : obj → Prop
axiom WonContest : obj → Prop
axiom Celebrate : obj → Prop
axiom HouseSmellsAmazing : Prop
axiom HomeyCozy : Prop
axiom PeachesInSeason : Prop
axiom R1 : HasRipePeaches → ∃ p : obj, BakePie p
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, WonContest x → Celebrate x
axiom R3 : PeachesInSeason ∨ (∃ x : obj, WonContest x)
axiom R4 : ∀ p : obj, BakePie p → HouseSmellsAmazing
axiom R5 : HouseSmellsAmazing → HomeyCozy
-- Given: ¬Celebrate James
-- Goal: ¬HomeyCozy
-- Cannot prove ¬HomeyCozy from the axioms and ¬Celebrate James
