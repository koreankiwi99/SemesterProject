The reasoning context involves several premises about office events and their implications. The key elements are:
- If someone finishes their project early, they can take a long lunch.
- If it's a birthday, people bring treats.
- Either projects are done early, or it's a birthday, or both.
- Long lunches lead to feeling recharged, which leads to productivity.

The question asks: If John did not bring treats, did he have a productive afternoon? We need to prove that John did **not** have a productive afternoon (¬Productive John) from the premises. If this proof is impossible, we return "Failure".

**Analysis**:
1. **Premise breakdown**:
   - `FinishesAhead x` → `CanTakeLongLunch x`
   - `IsBirthday` → ∃y, `BringsTreats y`
   - Global disjunction: (∃x, `FinishesAhead x`) ∨ `IsBirthday`
   - `CanTakeLongLunch x` → `Recharged x`
   - `Recharged x` → `Productive x`
   - Given: ¬`BringsTreats John`

2. **Attempting proof**:
   - We know John didn't bring treats (¬`BringsTreats John`), but this doesn't prove ¬`IsBirthday` because others might have brought treats (per `R2`).
   - The disjunction (`R3`) allows two cases:
     - **Case 1**: ∃x, `FinishesAhead x`. Some individual finishes early, but this could be someone other than John. John's productivity remains unknown.
     - **Case 2**: `IsBirthday`. Treats exist (∃y, `BringsTreats y`), but not necessarily from John. No link to John's work status.
   - There's no axiom connecting John's lack of treat-bringing to his project status or lunch break. John might have finished early (taking a productive lunch) regardless of treats, or not finished early but still been productive through other means.

**Conclusion**: The premises do not force John to be unproductive. We cannot prove ¬`Productive John`.
