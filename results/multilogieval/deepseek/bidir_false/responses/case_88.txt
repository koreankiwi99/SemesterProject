The compilation errors occurred because `Prop` is a built-in type in Lean and should not be redeclared. Additionally, the theorem attempted to prove `HasEggs → ¬GuestsHappy` but instead derived `GuestsHappy` under the assumption of `HasEggs`, leading to a contradiction in the proof structure. The corrected code properly uses Lean's built-in `Prop` and demonstrates the failed proof attempt via `sorry`.
