The goal is to prove that the answer to the question "If it is monsoon season, will the farmer make a good profit?" is "No". This requires proving that it is **not** the case that monsoon season implies a good profit, formally `¬(monsoon_season → good_profit)`, which is equivalent to `monsoon_season ∧ ¬good_profit`.

However, from the premises:
1. If monsoon season, then heavy rains (`monsoon_season → heavy_rains`).
2. Heavy rains imply the farmer waters crops (`heavy_rains → farmer_waters`).
3. Watering crops leads to healthy crops (`farmer_waters → crops_healthy`).
4. Healthy crops lead to a bountiful harvest (`crops_healthy → harvest_bountiful`).
5. A bountiful harvest leads to good profit (`harvest_bountiful → good_profit`).

We can **prove** that monsoon season implies good profit:
- Assume monsoon season.
- Then heavy rains (by premise 1).
- Then the farmer waters crops (by premise 2).
- Then crops are healthy (by premise 3).
- Then harvest is bountiful (by premise 4).
- Then good profit occurs (by premise 5).

Thus, we have `monsoon_season → good_profit`, which contradicts `monsoon_season ∧ ¬good_profit`. Therefore, we **cannot prove** that the conclusion ("No") holds.

-- Since we cannot prove monsoon_season ∧ ¬good_profit standalone (only its negation),
