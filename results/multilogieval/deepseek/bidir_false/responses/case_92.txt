The reasoning context is formalized in Lean. The key steps are:

1. From `pests_invade`, we derive `some_crops_destroyed` using axiom T2.
2. Axiom T3 states: `enough_water ∨ ¬some_crops_destroyed ∨ (enough_water ∧ some_crops_destroyed)`. With `some_crops_destroyed` true, the middle disjunct `¬some_crops_destroyed` is false. The remaining disjuncts both imply `enough_water` (either directly or via conjunction).
3. Thus, `enough_water` must hold.
4. From `enough_water` and T1, we get `grow_well`.
5. From `grow_well` and T4, we get `bountiful`.
6. From `bountiful` and T5, we get `good_profit`.

Therefore, under the assumption `pests_invade`, we derive `good_profit`. This means we **cannot prove** that if pests invaded, the farmer did NOT make good profit (i.e., we cannot prove `pests_invade → ¬good_profit`). The attempt to prove the negation fails.

axiom some_crops_destroyed : Prop

axiom good_profit : Prop

axiom T1 : enough_water → grow_well
axiom T2 : pests_invade → some_crops_destroyed
axiom T3 : enough_water ∨ ¬some_crops_destroyed ∨ (enough_water ∧ some_crops_destroyed)
axiom T4 : grow_well → bountiful
axiom T5 : bountiful → good_profit

    let h_invade : pests_invade := by admit  -- We assume pests_invade exists for the proof attempt

    have h_grow : grow_well := T1 h_water
    have h_bountiful : bountiful := T4 h_grow
    have h_profit : good_profit := T5 h_bountiful
    have h_no_profit : ¬good_profit := h_neg h_invade
    show False from h_no_profit h_profit
-- Proof fails at `admit` since we cannot construct `pests_invade` without additional context
-- More fundamentally: We derived `good_profit` under `pests_invade`, so negation is unprovable
