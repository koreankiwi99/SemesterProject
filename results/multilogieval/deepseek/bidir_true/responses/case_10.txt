The error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic failed to recognize the contradiction in the `inl` branch. The goal was `Invited Alex`, not `False`, so we need to explicitly derive a contradiction and then use ex falso quodlibet. Here's the corrected code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Alex : obj
axiom StudiesHard : obj → Prop
axiom GoodGrades : obj → Prop
axiom Participates : obj → Prop
axiom MakesNewFriends : obj → Prop
axiom Invited : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, StudiesHard x → GoodGrades x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Participates x → MakesNewFriends x
axiom A3 : StudiesHard Alex ∨ Participates Alex
axiom A4 : ∀ x, MakesNewFriends x → Invited x
axiom A5 : ¬ GoodGrades Alex

theorem alex_invited : Invited Alex := by
  cases A3 with
  | inl studied_hard => 
    have good_grades : GoodGrades Alex := A1 Alex studied_hard
    -- Derive explicit contradiction
    have false : False := A5 good_grades
    -- Use ex falso to prove any goal
    exact False.elim false
  | inr participated =>
    have new_friends : MakesNewFriends Alex := A2 Alex participated
    exact A4 Alex new_friends
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes

**Explanation of the fix:**
1. In the `inl` branch (where Alex studied hard):
   - We first derive `good_grades : GoodGrades Alex` using axiom A1
   - We then explicitly construct `false : False` by applying `A5` (¬GoodGrades Alex) to `good_grades`
   - Finally, we use `False.elim false` to prove the goal `Invited Alex` (since ex falso quodlibet allows deriving any proposition from false)

2. The `inr` branch remains unchanged as it was correct:
   - Participation leads to new friends (A2)
   - New friends lead to invitations (A4)

The proof now successfully shows that Alex gets invited to social events through the participation path, while the study path leads to a contradiction with the given premise that Alex didn't get good grades.
