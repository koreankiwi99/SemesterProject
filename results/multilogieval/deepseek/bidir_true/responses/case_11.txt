The reasoning can be formalized in Lean as follows. The context describes a specific project, so we define predicates for properties of this project. The axioms correspond to the given statements, and we have the additional premise that the judges were not impressed. The goal is to prove that the project received an award.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom project : obj
axiom NiceDisplay : obj → Prop
axiom ImpressedJudges : obj → Prop
axiom ThoroughResearch : obj → Prop
axiom ExpertsTakeSeriously : obj → Prop
axiom ReceiveAward : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, NiceDisplay x → ImpressedJudges x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, ThoroughResearch x → ExpertsTakeSeriously x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, NiceDisplay x ∨ ThoroughResearch x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, ExpertsTakeSeriously x → ReceiveAward x
axiom given : ¬ ImpressedJudges project

theorem project_receives_award : ReceiveAward project := by
  have not_nice : ¬ NiceDisplay project := fun h => given (A1 project h)
  have research : ThoroughResearch project := by
    cases (A3 project) with
    | inl nice => contradiction
    | inr th => exact th
  have serious : ExpertsTakeSeriously project := A2 project research
  exact A4 project serious
</lean>

The proof proceeds as follows:
1. From `A1` and `given` (judges not impressed), we derive that the display is not nice (`not_nice`).
2. From `A3` (either nice display or thorough research) and `not_nice`, we deduce thorough research (`research`).
3. From `A2` and `research`, we get that experts take the project seriously (`serious`).
4. From `A4` and `serious`, we conclude the project receives an award.

Since the award follows from the premises, the answer is Yes.

ANSWER: Yes
