The reasoning can be formalized in Lean by representing the propositions and using the given premises. The key steps are:
1. Service quality decreased (¬greatService)
2. From premise "owner either provides excellent service or hosts events" (greatService ∨ hostEvents), we derive hostEvents (since service decreased)
3. From premise "if they host author events, more customers visit" (hostEvents → moreCustomers), we derive moreCustomers
4. From premise "if customer traffic increases, revenue improves" (moreCustomers → revenueImproves), we derive revenueImproves

Thus, the store's revenue improved.

<lean>
axiom greatService : Prop
axiom hostEvents : Prop
axiom moreCustomers : Prop
axiom revenueImproves : Prop
axiom reputationGrows : Prop

-- Premises from context
axiom A1 : greatService → reputationGrows
axiom A2 : hostEvents → moreCustomers
axiom A3 : greatService ∨ hostEvents
axiom A4 : moreCustomers → revenueImproves

-- Given: service quality decreased (¬greatService)
theorem store_revenue_improved (h_neg_service : ¬greatService) : revenueImproves := by
  cases A3 with
  | inl gs => contradiction  -- Contradicts h_neg_service
  | inr he =>
    apply A4                -- moreCustomers → revenueImproves
    apply A2                -- hostEvents → moreCustomers
    exact he                -- hostEvents
</lean>
