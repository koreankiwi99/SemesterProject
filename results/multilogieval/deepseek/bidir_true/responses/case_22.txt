The context provides two implications:
1. If a city experiences a drought, authorities implement water restrictions: `∀ x, Drought x → EnforceRestrictions x`
2. Drought conditions require rationing water usage: `∀ x, Drought x → RationWater x`

The given statement is a disjunction: either the city did not enforce water restrictions (`¬EnforceRestrictions c`) or it did not ration water (`¬RationWater c`).

To prove the city is undergoing a drought (`Drought c`), we would need evidence that satisfies both implications. However, the disjunction indicates at least one measure (restrictions or rationing) is absent. By contraposition of the implications:
- `¬EnforceRestrictions c → ¬Drought c`
- `¬RationWater c → ¬Drought c`

Since the disjunction covers both cases, we can derive `¬Drought c` in all scenarios. Therefore, we cannot prove `Drought c`.

The compilation errors occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was used without having both a proposition and its negation in the context. The proof attempt for `Drought c` failed because the premises actually imply that the city is NOT undergoing a drought. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom City : Type
axiom c : City
axiom Drought : City → Prop
axiom EnforceRestrictions : City → Prop
axiom RationWater : City → Prop

-- If drought occurs, restrictions are enforced
axiom R1 : ∀ x : City, Drought x → EnforceRestrictions x
-- Drought requires rationing
axiom R2 : ∀ x : City, Drought x → RationWater x

-- Given: either restrictions not enforced or water not rationed
axiom given : ¬ EnforceRestrictions c ∨ ¬ RationWater c

-- We can prove the city is NOT undergoing a drought
theorem not_drought : ¬ Drought c := by
  intro h_drought
  have enforce : EnforceRestrictions c := R1 c h_drought
  have ration : RationWater c := R2 c h_drought
  cases given with
  | inl no_enforce => exact no_enforce enforce
  | inr no_ration => exact no_ration ration

-- Since we proved ¬Drought c, we cannot prove Drought c
</lean>
