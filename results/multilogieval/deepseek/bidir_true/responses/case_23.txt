The context provides several relationships but does not establish a connection between planning one's day and having self-discipline. Specifically:
- Self-discipline implies waking up early (`∀x, SelfDiscipline x → WakesUpEarly x`)
- Waking up early implies being energized (`∀x, WakesUpEarly x → Energized x`)
- Planning the day implies being productive (`∀x, PlansDay x → Productive x`)
- There exists someone lacking energy or productivity (`∃x, ¬Energized x ∨ ¬Productive x`)

Mark plans his day (`PlansDay Mark`), which implies he is productive. However, there is no axiom linking productivity or planning to self-discipline. The existential statement about some people lacking energy or productivity does not provide information about Mark. Therefore, we cannot prove that Mark has self-discipline.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mark : obj
axiom WakesUpEarly : obj → Prop
axiom Energized : obj → Prop
axiom Productive : obj → Prop
axiom PlansDay : obj → Prop
axiom SelfDiscipline : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, WakesUpEarly x → Energized x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, PlansDay x → Productive x
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, ¬ Energized x ∨ ¬ Productive x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, SelfDiscipline x → WakesUpEarly x

axiom Mark_plans : PlansDay Mark

theorem mark_self_discipline : SelfDiscipline Mark :=
  by
  -- Mark plans his day, so he is productive (by A2)
  have hProductive : Productive Mark := A2 Mark Mark_plans
  -- However, no axiom connects Productive or PlansDay to SelfDiscipline
  -- A4 only gives SelfDiscipline → WakesUpEarly, not the converse
  -- A3 shows some individual lacks energy/productivity, but doesn't constrain Mark
  -- Thus, we cannot prove SelfDiscipline Mark
  sorry -- Proof incomplete
