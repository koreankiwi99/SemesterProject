The context provides information about salespersons, including that perceptive salespersons build rapport, which leads to trusting relationships. Effective presentations lead to sales conversions. However, there is no direct link between giving effective presentations and being perceptive. Emma's effective presentations imply she converts sales (by the context), but this does not necessitate that she builds rapport or is perceptive. The axiom linking perceptiveness to rapport building cannot be applied here due to missing connections between presentations and perceptiveness/rapport. Therefore, we cannot prove that Emma is perceptive.

axiom Salesperson : Type
axiom Emma : Salesperson
axiom BuildRapport : Salesperson → Prop
axiom TrustingRelationship : Salesperson → Prop
axiom EffectivePresentation : Salesperson → Prop
axiom ConvertSales : Salesperson → Prop
axiom Perceptive : Salesperson → Prop

axiom rapport_leads_to_trust : ∀ s : Salesperson, BuildRapport s → TrustingRelationship s
axiom effective_presentations_convert : ∀ s : Salesperson, EffectivePresentation s → ConvertSales s
axiom not_all_build_trust_or_convert : ∃ s : Salesperson, ¬TrustingRelationship s ∧ ¬ConvertSales s
axiom perceptive_build_rapport : ∀ s : Salesperson, Perceptive s → BuildRapport s

axiom emma_effective : EffectivePresentation Emma

-- No axiom links EffectivePresentation to Perceptive or BuildRapport
-- Cannot prove Perceptive Emma from given premises
