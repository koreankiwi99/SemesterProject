The context states two implications:
1. If a team loses an important game, the players feel disappointed: ∀t, LosesImportantGame t → Disappointed t
2. If a team loses a big match (interpreted as an important game), the players feel demoralized: ∀t, LosesImportantGame t → Demoralized t

The premise is: The players are not disappointed and not demoralized (¬Disappointed T ∧ ¬Demoralized T).

The conclusion to prove is: "Yes, the team lost a significant game" (LosesImportantGame T).

However, the premise and context imply the opposite. Using the contrapositive of the given implications:
- ¬Disappointed T → ¬LosesImportantGame T (from axiom A1)
- ¬Demoralized T → ¬LosesImportantGame T (from axiom A2)

Since the premise provides both ¬Disappointed T and ¬Demoralized T, we can derive ¬LosesImportantGame T. This means we have evidence that the team did **not** lose a significant game, making it impossible to prove the positive conclusion (LosesImportantGame T). Therefore, we cannot prove the conclusion that the team lost a significant game.

<lean>
axiom Team : Type
axiom T : Team
axiom LosesImportantGame : Team → Prop
axiom Disappointed : Team → Prop
axiom Demoralized : Team → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ t, LosesImportantGame t → Disappointed t
axiom A2 : ∀ t, LosesImportantGame t → Demoralized t

axiom Premise : ¬ Disappointed T ∧ ¬ Demoralized T

-- Attempt to prove LosesImportantGame T fails
-- Proof of ¬LosesImportantGame T exists, but not required for the conclusion
