The reasoning involves analyzing the premises and determining if the conclusion follows. The key premises are:

1. If it's close to lunchtime (L), then coworkers are hungry (H): L → H
2. If John prepares well (P), he's ready for the meeting (R): P John → R John
3. Either L is true, or John isn't ready (¬R John), or both: L ∨ ¬R John (which simplifies to L ∨ ¬R John)
4. If John is diligent (D), he prepares well: D John → P John

The question asks: If coworkers are not hungry (¬H), is John diligent (D John)?

Assuming ¬H:
- From L → H and ¬H, we get ¬L (modus tollens).
- From ¬L and L ∨ ¬R John, we get ¬R John (disjunctive syllogism).
- From P John → R John and ¬R John, we get ¬P John (modus tollens).
- From D John → P John and ¬P John, we get ¬D John (modus tollens).

Thus, ¬H leads to ¬D John, not D John. Therefore, we cannot prove D John from ¬H.

The error occurred because the `intro hd` tactic was used when the goal was `D John`, which is not a function type. This is unnecessary and incorrect. After removing this, the proof attempt shows that in the `inr` branch, we can derive `¬D John` from the premises, but we still need to prove `D John`, which is impossible. Therefore, the theorem `¬H → D John` is unprovable.

Corrected Lean code:

axiom obj : Type
axiom John : obj

axiom L : Prop  -- Close to lunchtime
axiom H : Prop  -- Coworkers are hungry

axiom P : obj → Prop  -- Prepared well for presentation
axiom R : obj → Prop  -- Ready for meeting
axiom D : obj → Prop  -- Diligent

axiom A1 : L → H
axiom A2 : ∀ (x : obj), P x → R x
axiom A3 : L ∨ ¬ (R John)
axiom A4 : ∀ (x : obj), D x → P x

-- Attempt to prove: If ¬H, then D John
theorem goal : ¬H → D John := by
  intro nh
  have nl : ¬L := fun l => nh (A1 l)
  cases A3 with
  | inl l => exact False.elim (nl l)
  | inr nr =>
      have np : ¬P John := fun p => nr (A2 John p)
      have nd : ¬D John := fun d => np (A4 John d)
      -- We have ¬D John but need to prove D John → contradiction
      -- No way to prove D John from current premises
      exact nd  -- This would require D John as argument, but we don't have it
      -- Alternatively: apply nd would fail since goal is D John, not False
</lean>

The proof fails in the `inr` branch because:
1. `nl : ¬L` and `nr : ¬R John` are derived from premises
2. `np : ¬P John` comes from `nr` and axiom A2
3. `nd : ¬D John` comes from `np` and axiom A4
4. The goal remains `D John` with no way to satisfy it given `nd`

Since we can prove `¬H → ¬D John` but not `¬H → D John`, the original statement is unprovable.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The error occurred because the proof attempted to use `¬D John` (nd) where `D John` was required. This is a type mismatch since `nd` is a function from `D John` to false, not a proof of `D John`. 

The correct approach shows that from the premises:
1. ¬H (coworkers not hungry) implies ¬L (not lunchtime)
2. ¬L and the disjunction in A3 lead to ¬R John (John not ready)
3. ¬R John implies ¬P John (John didn't prepare well)
4. ¬P John implies ¬D John (John is not diligent)

Thus, we can prove ¬H → ¬D John, but not ¬H → D John. The original goal is unprovable.

Corrected Lean code:

axiom obj : Type

axiom L : Prop  -- Close to lunchtime
axiom H : Prop  -- Coworkers are hungry

axiom P : obj → Prop  -- Prepared well for presentation
axiom R : obj → Prop  -- Ready for meeting
axiom D : obj → Prop  -- Diligent

axiom A1 : L → H
axiom A2 : ∀ (x : obj), P x → R x
axiom A3 : L ∨ ¬ (R John)
axiom A4 : ∀ (x : obj), D x → P x

-- We can prove ¬H → ¬D John, but not ¬H → D John
theorem counter : ¬H → ¬D John := by
  intro nh d
  have nl : ¬L := fun l => nh (A1 l)
  cases A3 with
  | inl l => exact nl l
  | inr nr => 
      have p : P John := A4 John d
      have r : R John := A2 John p
      exact nr r
</lean>

The proof shows ¬H leads to ¬D John, making the original goal (¬H → D John) unprovable.
