The context provides two premises:
1. If someone gets injured, they should see a doctor: `∀x, Injured x → SeeDoctor x`
2. Getting hurt warrants resting the affected area: `∀x, Hurt x → RestInjury x`

The statement to evaluate is: "Either Jane did not see a doctor or she did not rest her injury." This translates to `¬ SeeDoctor Jane ∨ ¬ RestInjury Jane`.

The question is: "Did Jane get hurt?" meaning we need to prove `Hurt Jane`.

However, note that the premises use "injured" and "hurt" interchangeably. We'll use `Hurt` for both to maintain consistency. The contrapositive of the premises leads to:
- `∀x, ¬ SeeDoctor x → ¬ Hurt x`
- `∀x, ¬ RestInjury x → ¬ Hurt x`

Given the disjunction `¬ SeeDoctor Jane ∨ ¬ RestInjury Jane`, we can derive:
- If Jane didn't see a doctor, then `¬ Hurt Jane` (from first contrapositive).
- If Jane didn't rest her injury, then `¬ Hurt Jane` (from second contrapositive).

Thus, in both cases, we conclude `¬ Hurt Jane`. This means we **cannot** prove `Hurt Jane` from the premises and the given statement. In fact, the axioms imply Jane was not hurt.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Jane : obj
axiom Hurt : obj → Prop
axiom SeeDoctor : obj → Prop
axiom RestInjury : obj → Prop
axiom A1 : ∀ x, Hurt x → SeeDoctor x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Hurt x → RestInjury x
axiom A3 : ¬ SeeDoctor Jane ∨ ¬ RestInjury Jane

-- Cannot prove Hurt Jane from the axioms.
-- A3 and the contrapositives of A1/A2 imply ¬Hurt Jane.
