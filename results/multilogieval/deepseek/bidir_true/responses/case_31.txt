The context provides two implications:
1. If someone suspects their partner is cheating, they should have an open conversation.
2. Infidelity concerns (suspecting cheating) warrant re-evaluating the relationship.

The statement to evaluate is: Priya either did not talk to her partner or did not reassess the relationship.

We aim to prove whether Priya thought her partner was unfaithful (i.e., suspected cheating). However, the given disjunction indicates that at least one action (talking or reassessing) did not occur. Using the context implications:
- Suspecting cheating would require both actions to occur (by the two implications).
- The disjunction means at least one action did not occur, which (by contraposition) implies Priya could not have suspected cheating.

Thus, we cannot prove that Priya suspected cheating; we can only prove the opposite. Therefore, the answer is Failure.

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `intro` tactic was used incorrectly. The goal was to prove `SuspectsCheating Priya`, which is a single proposition, not an implication. Therefore, `intro` cannot be applied here since there are no binders to introduce.

After analyzing the premises:
- If someone suspects cheating, they must have an open conversation (A1).
- If someone suspects cheating, they must reassess the relationship (A2).
- Priya either did not have an open conversation or did not reassess the relationship (Premise).

To prove `SuspectsCheating Priya`, we would need direct evidence or a way to derive it from the axioms. However:
- The premises A1 and A2 only provide implications from suspecting cheating to actions, not vice versa.
- The Premise states that at least one action did not occur, which contradicts the consequences of suspecting cheating but doesn't help prove that Priya suspected cheating.
- There is no axiom or premise that directly or indirectly provides evidence of Priya suspecting cheating.

Thus, it is impossible to prove `SuspectsCheating Priya` from the given premises.
