The context provides logical relationships, but there is insufficient information to prove that Bob is one with nature based on crop rotation alone. The key points are:
- Crop rotation ensures soil nutrients are maintained (A2).
- Crops are unhealthy or lack nutrients (A3), leading to Bob having unhealthy crops since nutrients are maintained.
- Unhealthy crops imply Bob doesn't use organic methods (contrapositive of A1).
- Awareness links being one with nature to using organic methods (A4), but Bob's awareness is unknown.

Since Bob's awareness status is not provided, we cannot establish the link between being one with nature and organic methods for Bob. Thus, we cannot prove Bob is one with nature.

We would need:

But ¬usesOrganic Bob implies ¬oneWithNature Bob IF aware Bob.
Without knowing aware Bob, we cannot prove oneWithNature Bob.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was not sufficient to resolve the proofs. The proofs for `not_healthy_Bob` and `not_organic_Bob` have been corrected using explicit reasoning:

1. In `not_healthy_Bob`, the `inr` case now uses `absurd` to handle the contradiction between `soilNutrients_Bob` and `h2`.
2. In `not_organic_Bob`, the proof now directly applies `not_healthy_Bob` to the healthy crops derived from the organic methods assumption.

The proof for `oneWithNature Bob` remains impossible due to lack of information about Bob's awareness.
