The context provides two rules:
1. If a person's account is hacked, they must reset their password.
2. If unauthorized access is detected (which implies hacking), they must notify their bank.

The given statement indicates that Lucy either did not reset her password or did not notify her bank. This means Lucy did not perform both required actions. Since the rules state that both actions are necessary if her account was hacked, the failure to perform both actions implies her account was not hacked. Therefore, we cannot prove that Lucy's account was hacked.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Lucy : obj
axiom hacked : obj → Prop
axiom reset_password : obj → Prop
axiom notify_bank : obj → Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ p : obj, hacked p → reset_password p
axiom R2 : ∀ p : obj, hacked p → notify_bank p
axiom Given : ¬ reset_password Lucy ∨ ¬ notify_bank Lucy

theorem cannot_prove_hacked : ¬ hacked Lucy :=
  fun h : hacked Lucy =>
  have reset : reset_password Lucy := R1 Lucy h
  have notify : notify_bank Lucy := R2 Lucy h
  Or.elim Given
    (fun no_reset : ¬ reset_password Lucy => no_reset reset)
    (fun no_notify : ¬ notify_bank Lucy => no_notify notify)
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure
