The context provides the following logical structure:
- Investing in marketing (M) leads to increased customers, which leads to increased sales (S): so M → S.
- Either marketing was focused (M), or production costs increased (P), or both: so M ∨ P.
- Sales did not increase: ¬S.

From ¬S and M → S, we derive ¬M (modus tollens). With ¬M and M ∨ P, we derive P (disjunctive syllogism). Therefore, the statement "production costs increased" follows from the premises.

<lean>
axiom M : Prop
axiom P : Prop
axiom S : Prop
axiom marketing_increases_sales : M → S
axiom factors : M ∨ P
axiom sales_flat : ¬S

theorem production_costs_increased : P := by
  intro h
  have : ¬M := fun m : M => sales_flat (marketing_increases_sales m)
  cases factors with
  | inl m => contradiction
  | inr p => exact p
</lean>

The error occurred because `intro h` was used unnecessarily when there were no assumptions to introduce. The goal is simply `P`, so we can directly proceed with the proof. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom M : Prop
axiom P : Prop
axiom S : Prop
axiom marketing_increases_sales : M → S
axiom factors : M ∨ P
axiom sales_flat : ¬S

theorem production_costs_increased : P := by
  have not_M : ¬M := fun m : M => sales_flat (marketing_increases_sales m)
  cases factors with
  | inl m => contradiction
  | inr p => exact p
</lean>

**Explanation of the proof:**
1. **Modus Tollens:** From `marketing_increases_sales : M → S` and `sales_flat : ¬S`, we derive `¬M` (if marketing happened, sales would increase – but sales didn't increase, so marketing didn't happen).
2. **Disjunctive Syllogism:** The `factors` axiom states `M ∨ P`. Since we have `¬M`, the only remaining possibility is `P` (production costs increased).

The proof uses case analysis on `factors`:
- If `M` is true (`inl m`), it contradicts `¬M` (leading to `contradiction`).
- If `P` is true (`inr p`), we directly use it (`exact p`).

ANSWER: Yes
