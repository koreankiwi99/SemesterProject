The reasoning follows from the given context and the premise that Matt did not redo his living room. Here's the formal proof in Lean:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Matt : Person
axiom WatchesDIY : Person → Prop
axiom GainsSkills : Person → Prop
axiom RedoesLivingRoom : Person → Prop
axiom ReadsBlogs : Person → Prop
axiom GetsNewIdeas : Person → Prop

-- If someone watches DIY videos, they gain decorating skills
axiom A1 : ∀ x, WatchesDIY x → GainsSkills x

-- If someone gains decorating skills, they redo their living room
axiom A2 : ∀ x, GainsSkills x → RedoesLivingRoom x

-- Either watches DIY videos or reads blogs (or both)
axiom A3 : ∀ x, WatchesDIY x ∨ ReadsBlogs x

-- Reading blogs gives new decorating ideas
axiom A4 : ∀ x, ReadsBlogs x → GetsNewIdeas x

-- Matt does not redo his living room
axiom Fact : ¬ RedoesLivingRoom Matt

theorem Matt_gets_ideas : GetsNewIdeas Matt := by
  -- Show Matt didn't gain skills (since no redo)
  have T1 : ¬ GainsSkills Matt := by
    intro hSkills
    have hRedo : RedoesLivingRoom Matt := A2 Matt hSkills
    exact Fact hRedo

  -- Show Matt didn't watch DIY videos (would gain skills if he did)
  have T2 : ¬ WatchesDIY Matt := by
    intro hWatch
    exact T1 (A1 Matt hWatch)

  -- From disjunction: since Matt didn't watch videos, he must read blogs
  have T3 : ReadsBlogs Matt := by
    cases (A3 Matt) with
    | inl hWatch => contradiction
    | inr hRead => exact hRead

  -- Therefore, Matt gets new ideas
  exact A4 Matt T3
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes
