The reasoning is structured to determine if the statement "Mary did not stock up on groceries" implies "prices went up at the supermarket recently" based on the given context. The formalization in Lean uses the following elements:

- **Person** as a type for individuals, with **mary** as a constant.
- **Sale**, **Payday**, **PriceUp** as propositions about the supermarket.
- **StockUp**, **MakesList**, **Plans** as predicates over **Person**.

The axioms correspond to the premises:
1. If there's a sale, everyone stocks up: `Sale → ∀ x, StockUp x`
2. Making a list implies planning: `∀ x, MakesList x → Plans x`
3. Sale or not everyone plans: `Sale ∨ ¬ (∀ x, Plans x)`
4. Payday implies everyone makes a list: `Payday → ∀ x, MakesList x`
5. Payday or price increase (or both): `Payday ∨ PriceUp`

Given that Mary did not stock up (`¬ StockUp mary`), the proof proceeds as follows:
- **Step 1**: If there were a sale, Mary would stock up (Axiom 1). Contradiction with `¬ StockUp mary`, so `¬ Sale`.
- **Step 2**: From `¬ Sale` and Axiom 3, `¬ (∀ x, Plans x)` (not everyone plans).
- **Step 3**: If payday occurred, everyone would make a list (Axiom 4) and thus everyone would plan (Axiom 2). But `¬ (∀ x, Plans x)`, so `¬ Payday`.
- **Step 4**: From `¬ Payday` and Axiom 5, `PriceUp` must hold.

Thus, the conclusion **PriceUp** follows from the premises and the assumption about Mary.
