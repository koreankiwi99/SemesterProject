The context and statement are translated into Lean axioms. The goal is to prove that if attendance was low, then the movie is a sequel. The proof uses contrapositive reasoning and case analysis:

1. **Axioms**:
   - `A1`: Good reviews imply high attendance.
   - `A3`: Either good reviews, low attendance, or both (simplified to `good_reviews ∨ ¬high_attendance`).
   - `A4`: A big star implies good reviews.
   - `A5`: Either a big star or a sequel (or both).
   - `A2` (about tickets) is included but unused in the proof.

2. **Proof**:
   - Assume low attendance (`¬high_attendance`).
   - By contrapositive of `A1`: `¬high_attendance → ¬good_reviews`.
   - By contrapositive of `A4`: `¬good_reviews → ¬big_star`.
   - From `A5` (`big_star ∨ sequel`), since `¬big_star` holds, `sequel` must be true.

The Lean proof uses `intro`, `have`, and `cases` tactics to derive the result.

axiom A2 : ∀ p : Person, BuysTicket p → PlansToSee p

axiom good_reviews : Prop
axiom high_attendance : Prop
axiom big_star : Prop
axiom sequel : Prop

axiom A1 : good_reviews → high_attendance
axiom A3 : good_reviews ∨ ¬ high_attendance
axiom A4 : big_star → good_reviews
axiom A5 : big_star ∨ sequel

theorem low_attendance_implies_sequel : ¬ high_attendance → sequel := by

    intro h_good
    exact h_low (A1 h_good)
