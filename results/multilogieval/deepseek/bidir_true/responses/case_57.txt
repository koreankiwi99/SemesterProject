The reasoning follows from the premises. From the context, we know that John did not buy more items. By the first premise, if there's a sale, people buy more items, so there must be no sale. The third premise states that either there's a sale, or John didn't get everything, or both. Since there's no sale, John must not have gotten everything. The second premise says that if John went shopping, he would get everything. Thus, John did not go shopping. The fourth premise states that if it's the beginning of the month, John goes shopping. Therefore, it's not the beginning of the month. Finally, the fifth premise says that either it's the beginning of the month or John's cereal is sold out. Since it's not the beginning of the month, John's cereal must be sold out.
