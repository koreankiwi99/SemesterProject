The reasoning involves determining if Priya attended lectures regularly based on the given premises. The context states that if a student attends lectures regularly, then diligent study leads to excelling. Priya studied diligently but did not excel. To prove she attended regularly, we would need to derive `AttendsRegularly Priya` from the axioms. However:

- The axiom `R1` requires `AttendsRegularly s` to imply that diligent study leads to excelling.  
- For Priya, diligent study (`T1`) and not excelling (`T2`) imply that the condition `AttendsRegularly Priya → (StudiesDiligently Priya → ExcelsInCourse Priya)` leads to a contradiction if we assume she attended.  
- This contradiction proves `¬AttendsRegularly Priya`, not `AttendsRegularly Priya`.  

Since we cannot prove `AttendsRegularly Priya` (the desired conclusion), the result is **Failure**.

<lean>
axiom Student : Type
axiom Priya : Student
axiom AttendsRegularly : Student → Prop
axiom StudiesDiligently : Student → Prop
axiom ExcelsInCourse : Student → Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ s : Student, AttendsRegularly s → (StudiesDiligently s → ExcelsInCourse s)
axiom T1 : StudiesDiligently Priya
axiom T2 : ¬ ExcelsInCourse Priya

-- Attempt to prove AttendsRegularly Priya fails
-- We can prove ¬AttendsRegularly Priya (not required), but not the affirmative.

ANSWER: Failure
