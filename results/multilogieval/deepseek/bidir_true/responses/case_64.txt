The context and premises are translated into Lean, with the goal to prove that Priya attended lectures regularly. The context states that if a student attends lectures regularly, then sufficient revision implies good exam performance. The premises are that Priya revised sufficiently but did not perform well. 

To prove: `AttendsRegularly Priya`  
However, from the premises and context:  
1. If Priya attended regularly, then (since she revised sufficiently) she would have performed well.  
2. But she did not perform well.  
3. Therefore, assuming she attended leads to a contradiction.  

This shows that it is impossible for Priya to have attended lectures regularly, meaning we **cannot prove** `AttendsRegularly Priya`. Hence, the proof fails.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Priya : obj
axiom AttendsRegularly : obj → Prop
axiom SpendsSufficientTimeRevising : obj → Prop
axiom PerformsWell : obj → Prop
axiom context : ∀ s : obj, AttendsRegularly s → (SpendsSufficientTimeRevising s → PerformsWell s)
axiom premise1 : SpendsSufficientTimeRevising Priya
axiom premise2 : ¬ PerformsWell Priya
-- We cannot prove AttendsRegularly Priya from the given axioms.
