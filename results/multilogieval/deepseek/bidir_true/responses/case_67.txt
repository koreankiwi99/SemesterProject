The context provides information about breakfast preparation, stove usage, and hunger. The key logical relationships are:  
- If the stove is on, the kitchen gets hot.  
- If someone makes pancakes, they use the stove.  
- Either the stove was on or no one used the stove (equivalent: if the stove was used, it was on).  
- If someone is hungry, they make pancakes.  
- If Sam did not eat dinner last night, he was hungry this morning.  

Given the premise that the kitchen did not get hot, we can prove Sam ate dinner last night:  
1. ¬kitchen_hot implies ¬stove_on (contraposition of stove_on → kitchen_hot).  
2. ¬stove_on and stove_on ∨ ¬use_stove imply ¬use_stove.  
3. ¬use_stove implies no one made pancakes (since ∀p, makes_pancakes p → use_stove).  
4. No one made pancakes implies no one is hungry (since ∀p, hungry p → makes_pancakes p).  
5. No one is hungry implies Sam is not hungry.  
6. Sam is not hungry and ¬eat_dinner → hungry Sam imply Sam ate dinner (by contradiction).

The errors in the previous Lean code stemmed from incorrect variable declarations and scoping issues. Here's the corrected version:

<lean>
open Classical

axiom Person : Type
axiom Sam : Person
axiom makes_pancakes : Person → Prop
axiom hungry : Person → Prop
axiom use_stove : Prop
axiom stove_on : Prop
axiom kitchen_hot : Prop
axiom eat_dinner : Prop

axiom stove_hot : stove_on → kitchen_hot
axiom pancakes_use_stove : ∀ p : Person, makes_pancakes p → use_stove
axiom stove_on_or_not_used : stove_on ∨ ¬use_stove
axiom hungry_make_pancakes : ∀ p : Person, hungry p → makes_pancakes p
axiom no_dinner_hungry : ¬eat_dinner → hungry Sam

theorem answer : ¬kitchen_hot → eat_dinner := by
  intro h_not_hot
  have h_no_stove : ¬stove_on := by
    intro h_stove
    exact h_not_hot (stove_hot h_stove)
  cases stove_on_or_not_used with
  | inl h_stove => contradiction
  | inr h_not_used =>
      apply by_contradiction
      intro h_not_eat
      have h_hungry_Sam : hungry Sam := no_dinner_hungry h_not_eat
      have h_pancakes_Sam : makes_pancakes Sam := hungry_make_pancakes Sam h_hungry_Sam
      have h_used : use_stove := pancakes_use_stove Sam h_pancakes_Sam
      contradiction
</lean>

The proof demonstrates that if the kitchen didn't get hot, Sam must have eaten dinner last night:
1. ¬kitchen_hot implies ¬stove_on (contraposition)
2. The disjunction (stove_on ∨ ¬use_stove) with ¬stove_on gives ¬use_stove
3. Assuming Sam didn't eat dinner leads to contradiction:
   - ¬eat_dinner → hungry Sam
   - hungry Sam → makes_pancakes Sam
   - makes_pancakes Sam → use_stove
   - But we have ¬use_stove → contradiction
4. Thus Sam must have eaten dinner (by contradiction)

The compilation error occurred due to using `by_contradiction` instead of the correct `by_contra` tactic in Lean 4. The proof has been revised to use explicit contradiction via `exact h_not_used h_used` rather than relying on the `contradiction` tactic, ensuring clarity and correctness.

Here's the corrected Lean 4 code:

axiom Person : Type
axiom Sam : Person
axiom makes_pancakes : Person → Prop
axiom hungry : Person → Prop
axiom use_stove : Prop
axiom stove_on : Prop
axiom kitchen_hot : Prop

axiom stove_causes_hot : stove_on → kitchen_hot
axiom pancakes_require_stove : ∀ p : Person, makes_pancakes p → use_stove
axiom stove_disjunction : stove_on ∨ ¬use_stove
axiom hunger_causes_pancakes : ∀ p : Person, hungry p → makes_pancakes p
axiom no_dinner_causes_hunger : ¬eat_dinner → hungry Sam

theorem answer : ¬kitchen_hot → eat_dinner := by
  intro h_not_hot
  have h_no_stove : ¬stove_on := by
    intro h_stove
    exact h_not_hot (stove_causes_hot h_stove)
  cases stove_disjunction with
  | inl h_stove => contradiction
  | inr h_not_used =>
      by_contra h_not_eat
      have h_hungry_Sam : hungry Sam := no_dinner_causes_hunger h_not_eat
      have h_sam_makes_pancakes : makes_pancakes Sam := hunger_causes_pancakes Sam h_hungry_Sam
      have h_stove_used : use_stove := pancakes_require_stove Sam h_sam_makes_pancakes
      exact h_not_used h_stove_used
</lean>

**Proof explanation**:  
1. Assume the kitchen is not hot (`¬kitchen_hot`).  
2. Prove the stove is not on (`¬stove_on`) by contradiction (if stove were on, kitchen would be hot).  
3. Use the disjunction `stove_on ∨ ¬use_stove`:  
   - If stove was on, contradiction with `¬stove_on`.  
   - If stove not used (`¬use_stove`), proceed.  
4. Assume Sam didn't eat dinner (`¬eat_dinner`) for contradiction.  
5. Derive:  
   - Sam is hungry (from `no_dinner_causes_hunger`)  
   - Sam makes pancakes (from `hunger_causes_pancakes`)  
   - Stove is used (from `pancakes_require_stove`)  
6. Contradiction between `use_stove` and `¬use_stove`.  
7. Thus, Sam must have eaten dinner (`eat_dinner`).
