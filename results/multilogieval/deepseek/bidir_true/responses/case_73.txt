The context states a conditional rule for athletes: if someone trains with dedication and gets adequate rest, they will perform at their peak. The premises are that Simone got adequate rest but did not perform at her peak. The question is whether Simone trained with dedication. 

In Lean, we model the scenario as follows:
- `Person` is the type of individuals.
- `Athlete` is a predicate indicating someone is an athlete.
- `TrainsWithDedication`, `AdequateRest`, and `PerformAtPeak` are predicates.
- Axioms include the contextual rule (applicable only to athletes), the premises about Simone, and the implicit assumption that Simone is an athlete.

Attempt to prove that Simone trained with dedication (`TrainsWithDedication simone`):
- The contextual rule requires both training and rest to imply peak performance.
- We know Simone had adequate rest (`T2`) but did not perform at her peak (`T3`).
- If Simone had trained with dedication, the rule would imply she should have performed at her peak, contradicting `T3`.
- This contradiction allows us to prove that Simone did **not** train with dedication (`¬ TrainsWithDedication simone`), but it does **not** prove the affirmative statement that she did train.

Since the goal is to prove the positive conclusion (`TrainsWithDedication simone`), and no such proof exists from the given premises, the attempt fails.

axiom simone : Person
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, Athlete x → TrainsWithDedication x → AdequateRest x → PerformAtPeak x

axiom T3 : ¬ PerformAtPeak simone
axiom Athlete_Simone : Athlete simone
-- Attempt to prove TrainsWithDedication simone fails.
-- Instead, we can prove ¬TrainsWithDedication simone:
theorem no_train : ¬ TrainsWithDedication simone := 
  fun h : TrainsWithDedication simone => 
    have peak : PerformAtPeak simone := R1 simone Athlete_Simone h T2
    T3 peak
-- But this does not prove the desired conclusion (affirmative training).
