The reasoning problem is translated into Lean by defining the necessary propositions and axioms based on the context. The goal is to prove that if Alex did not relax, then he did not make a to-do list (i.e., ¬MadeToList).

**Lean Proof:**
- We model the propositions: `Weekend` (the weekend is coming), `Relax` (Alex relaxes), `ClearMind` (Alex has a clear mind), `FinishTasks` (Alex finishes tasks), `Organized` (Alex is organized), and `MadeToList` (Alex makes a to-do list).
- Axioms represent the context:
  1. `A1`: If the weekend comes, Alex relaxes (`Weekend → Relax`).
  2. `A2`: If Alex finishes tasks, he has a clear mind (`FinishTasks → ClearMind`).
  3. `A3`: Either the weekend comes or Alex lacks a clear mind (`Weekend ∨ ¬ClearMind`).
  4. `A4`: If Alex is organized, he finishes tasks (`Organized → FinishTasks`).
  5. `A5`: If Alex makes a to-do list, he is organized (`MadeToList → Organized`).
- Given `notRelax` (Alex did not relax), we prove `¬MadeToList` by contradiction:
  - Assume Alex made a to-do list (`MadeToList`).
  - By `A5`, he is organized, leading to `FinishTasks` (`A4`), then `ClearMind` (`A2`).
  - By `A3`, `ClearMind` implies `Weekend` (if not, the disjunction `A3` would contradict `ClearMind`).
  - By `A1`, `Weekend` implies `Relax`, contradicting `notRelax`.

The proof succeeds, confirming that Alex did **not** make a to-do list.
