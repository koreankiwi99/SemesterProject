The context provides several premises, but there is no explicit link between focusing on music theory and actually learning it. Therefore, while we can deduce that Amy must be focused on music theory (since she doesn't practice chords), we cannot prove that she has gained knowledge about song structure without an additional premise connecting focus to learning.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Amy : Person
axiom PracticeBasicChords : Person → Prop
axiom DevelopMuscleMemory : Person → Prop
axiom PlaySimpleSongs : Person → Prop
axiom FocusOnMusicTheory : Person → Prop
axiom LearnMusicTheory : Person → Prop
axiom GainKnowledgeSongStructure : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ p : Person, PracticeBasicChords p → DevelopMuscleMemory p
axiom A2 : ∀ p : Person, DevelopMuscleMemory p → PlaySimpleSongs p
axiom A3 : ∀ p : Person, PracticeBasicChords p ∨ FocusOnMusicTheory p
axiom A4 : ∀ p : Person, LearnMusicTheory p → GainKnowledgeSongStructure p

-- Premise: Amy cannot play any songs (interpreted as ¬PlaySimpleSongs Amy)
theorem no_play : ¬ PlaySimpleSongs Amy := by
  sorry  -- Given as fact

-- We can derive that Amy does not practice basic chords
theorem no_practice : ¬ PracticeBasicChords Amy := by
  intro h
  have : DevelopMuscleMemory Amy := A1 Amy h
  exact no_play (A2 Amy this)

-- From A3, Amy must be focused on music theory
theorem focused : FocusOnMusicTheory Amy := by
  cases A3 Amy with
  | inl practice => exact absurd practice no_practice
  | inr focus => exact focus

-- BUT: No axiom links FocusOnMusicTheory to LearnMusicTheory
-- Cannot prove GainKnowledgeSongStructure Amy
