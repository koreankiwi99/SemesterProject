The reasoning context establishes logical connections between team preparation, player injury, game outcomes, and celebration. The key is to determine if an injury to the star player still leads to a team dinner celebration. 

- Axiom 1: Hard practice implies preparation (`hard → prepared`)
- Axiom 2: Player injury or lack thereof is linked to practice via `hard ∨ ¬injured`
- Axiom 3: Preparation leads to winning (`prepared → wins`)
- Axiom 4: Winning leads to celebration (`wins → celebrate`)

The critical insight: If the player is injured (`injured`), the disjunction `hard ∨ ¬injured` (Axiom 2) forces `hard` to be true (since `¬injured` becomes false). This triggers the chain:
`injured → hard → prepared → wins → celebrate`

Thus, injury implies celebration. The proof formalizes this chain using propositional logic and Lean's case analysis to handle the disjunction.

<lean>
axiom hard : Prop
axiom injured : Prop
axiom prepared : Prop
axiom wins : Prop
axiom celebrate : Prop

axiom A1 : hard → prepared
axiom A3 : hard ∨ ¬ injured
axiom A4 : prepared → wins
axiom A5 : wins → celebrate

theorem injury_implies_dinner : injured → celebrate := by
  intro h_inj
  cases A3 with
  | inl h_hard => 
      exact A5 (A4 (A1 h_hard))
  | inr not_inj => 
      contradiction
