The reasoning involves multiple exams (biology and history) and days. The context provides information about the biology exam and a specific day (its exam day), but the history exam is on a different day. The premises only connect severe weather to class cancellation for the biology exam day via the disjunction in the third premise. There are no premises linking severe weather on the history exam day to Alex's preparation or satisfaction for the history exam. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given context.

axiom R1 : ∀ (x : Person) (e : Exam), StudiesHard x e → Confident x e
axiom T3 : StudiesHard Alex BiologyExam ∨ ¬ ClassCanceled (dayOf BiologyExam)
axiom R2 : ∀ (x : Person) (e : Exam), Confident x e → DoWell x e
axiom R3 : ∀ (x : Person) (e : Exam), DoWell x e → Satisfied x e

theorem target : SevereWeatherOn (dayOf HistoryExam) → Satisfied Alex HistoryExam :=
  fun h => by
    -- No premises connect severe weather on history exam day to Alex's history exam satisfaction
    -- Information about biology exam day does not apply to history exam
    sorry  -- Proof fails
