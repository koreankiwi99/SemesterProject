The reasoning from the context leads to the conclusion that if the kids are not hyper all afternoon, then the students will have lots of homework. Here's the step-by-step logical deduction:

1. **Premises:**
   - If there's a substitute teacher (Sub), students goof off (GoofOff): `Sub → GoofOff`
   - If pizza is served (Pizza), kids are hyper (Hyper): `Pizza → Hyper`
   - Either Sub, Pizza, or both: `Sub ∨ Pizza`
   - If students goof off, they don't learn much (¬LearnMuch): `GoofOff → ¬LearnMuch`
   - If they don't learn much, they have lots of homework (LotsOfHomework): `¬LearnMuch → LotsOfHomework`

2. **Goal:** `¬Hyper → LotsOfHomework`

3. **Proof:**
   - Assume `¬Hyper` (kids are not hyper).
   - From `Pizza → Hyper` and `¬Hyper`, by contrapositive, we get `¬Pizza`.
   - From `Sub ∨ Pizza` and `¬Pizza`, we deduce `Sub` (disjunctive syllogism).
   - From `Sub` and `Sub → GoofOff`, we get `GoofOff`.
   - From `GoofOff` and `GoofOff → ¬LearnMuch`, we get `¬LearnMuch`.
   - From `¬LearnMuch` and `¬LearnMuch → LotsOfHomework`, we get `LotsOfHomework`.

Thus, `¬Hyper` implies `LotsOfHomework`.

The compilation errors occurred due to using reserved keywords like `Sub` (which is a built-in Lean function) and other potential naming conflicts. The solution involves renaming the axioms to avoid these conflicts while preserving the logical structure. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Substitute : Prop
axiom PizzaServed : Prop
axiom StudentsGoofOff : Prop
axiom KidsHyper : Prop
axiom StudentsLearnMuch : Prop
axiom LotsOfHomework : Prop

axiom A1 : Substitute → StudentsGoofOff
axiom A2 : PizzaServed → KidsHyper
axiom A3 : Substitute ∨ PizzaServed
axiom A4 : StudentsGoofOff → ¬ StudentsLearnMuch
axiom A5 : ¬ StudentsLearnMuch → LotsOfHomework

theorem homework_when_not_hyper : ¬ KidsHyper → LotsOfHomework := by
  intro not_hyper
  have no_pizza : ¬ PizzaServed := fun pizza => not_hyper (A2 pizza)
  cases A3 with
  | inl sub =>
      have goof_off : StudentsGoofOff := A1 sub
      have not_learn : ¬ StudentsLearnMuch := A4 goof_off
      exact A5 not_learn
  | inr pizza => contradiction
</lean>

**Explanation of Corrections:**
1. Renamed `Sub` → `Substitute` (avoids conflict with built-in `Sub`)
2. Renamed `Pizza` → `PizzaServed`
3. Renamed `GoofOff` → `StudentsGoofOff`
4. Renamed `Hyper` → `KidsHyper`
5. Renamed `LearnMuch` → `StudentsLearnMuch`
6. Kept `LotsOfHomework` as-is
7. Updated axiom/theorem references accordingly

**Proof Logic:**
The proof shows that if kids are not hyper (`¬ KidsHyper`), then students must have lots of homework:
1. `¬ KidsHyper` implies no pizza was served (contrapositive of A2)
2. Since either substitute or pizza must occur (A3), no pizza forces substitute
3. Substitute causes students to goof off (A1)
4. Goofing off causes not learning (A4)
5. Not learning causes lots of homework (A5)
