The reasoning involves translating the given context into logical axioms and attempting to prove that the project did not receive an award (¬Award project) from the premises and the given fact that the judges were not impressed (¬ImpressedJudges project).

Premises:
1. If the display looks nice, judges are impressed: `NiceDisplay project → ImpressedJudges project`
2. If research is thorough, experts take it seriously: `ThoroughResearch project → TakenSeriously project`
3. The project has either a nice display or thorough research: `NiceDisplay project ∨ ThoroughResearch project`
4. If experts take a project seriously, it receives an award: `TakenSeriously project → Award project`

Given: `¬ImpressedJudges project`

From premise 1 and the given, we derive `¬NiceDisplay project`. Using premise 3, by disjunctive syllogism, we get `ThoroughResearch project`. Then, from premise 2, `TakenSeriously project` follows. Finally, premise 4 gives `Award project`.

Thus, we have proven `Award project`. Attempting to prove the negation `¬Award project` leads to a contradiction with `Award project`. Therefore, we cannot prove the negation.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic in the `neg_goal` theorem was used incorrectly. It was applied to two identical hypotheses (`Award project`), which doesn't produce a contradiction. Instead, we should recognize that we've already proven `Award project`, making `¬Award project` unprovable. The corrected code focuses on proving `Award project` and omits the invalid negation attempt.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom project : obj
axiom NiceDisplay : obj → Prop
axiom ImpressedJudges : obj → Prop
axiom ThoroughResearch : obj → Prop
axiom TakenSeriously : obj → Prop
axiom Award : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x : obj, NiceDisplay x → ImpressedJudges x
axiom T2 : ∀ x : obj, ThoroughResearch x → TakenSeriously x
axiom T3 : ∀ x : obj, NiceDisplay x ∨ ThoroughResearch x
axiom T4 : ∀ x : obj, TakenSeriously x → Award x
axiom given : ¬ ImpressedJudges project

theorem award_proof : Award project := by
  have not_nice : ¬ NiceDisplay project := fun h => given (T1 project h)
  have disj : NiceDisplay project ∨ ThoroughResearch project := T3 project
  cases disj with
  | inl nice => contradiction
  | inr thorough => exact T4 project (T2 project thorough)

-- Since award_proof shows Award project, ¬Award project is unprovable
</lean>
