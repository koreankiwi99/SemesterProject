The premises lead to the conclusion that James must watch cooking shows for inspiration, given that he does not gain confidence in the kitchen. Specifically:
- James is a chef (premise).
- If a chef follows recipes precisely, their dishes turn out well (premise).
- If dishes turn out well, the chef gains confidence (premise).
- James does not gain confidence (given), so his dishes do not turn out well, and thus he does not follow recipes precisely.
- Chefs either follow recipes precisely, watch cooking shows, or both (premise).
- Since James does not follow recipes precisely, he must watch cooking shows.

Therefore, it is impossible to prove that James does not watch cooking shows (the negation). The attempt to prove the negation fails.
