The premises are translated into Lean as follows:
- `obj` represents the type of entities (people/businesses).
- `Alex` is a specific constant of type `obj`.
- Predicates: `AdvertisesCleverly`, `AttractMoreCustomers`, `OffersDiscounts`, `IncreaseSales`, `ExpandBusiness` are properties of entities.
- Premises:
  1. `T1`: If someone advertises cleverly, they attract more customers (universal).
  2. `T2`: If someone offers discounts, they increase sales (universal).
  3. `T3`: There exists someone who either advertises cleverly or offers discounts (existential).
  4. `T4`: If someone increases sales, they expand their business (universal).
- Given: `¬AttractMoreCustomers Alex`.

The goal is to prove that Alex did not expand his business (`¬ExpandBusiness Alex`). However, the existential premise `T3` does not specify that Alex is the one who advertises cleverly or offers discounts. From `¬AttractMoreCustomers Alex` and `T1`, we can derive `¬AdvertisesCleverly Alex`. But there is no information about whether Alex offered discounts or not. If Alex offered discounts, then by `T2` and `T4`, he could have expanded his business despite not attracting more customers. Since the premises do not force Alex to lack discounts, we cannot prove that he did not expand his business.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Alex : obj
axiom AdvertisesCleverly : obj → Prop
axiom AttractMoreCustomers : obj → Prop
axiom OffersDiscounts : obj → Prop
axiom IncreaseSales : obj → Prop
axiom ExpandBusiness : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x : obj, AdvertisesCleverly x → AttractMoreCustomers x
axiom T2 : ∀ x : obj, OffersDiscounts x → IncreaseSales x
axiom T3 : ∃ x : obj, AdvertisesCleverly x ∨ OffersDiscounts x
axiom T4 : ∀ x : obj, IncreaseSales x → ExpandBusiness x
axiom Given : ¬AttractMoreCustomers Alex

-- Attempt to prove ¬ExpandBusiness Alex fails because:
-- We have ¬AdvertisesCleverly Alex from Given and T1.
example : ¬AdvertisesCleverly Alex := fun h_adv => Given (T1 Alex h_adv)

-- But T3 only guarantees existence of some entity satisfying the disjunction, not necessarily Alex.
-- No premise links Alex to OffersDiscounts or directly prevents IncreaseSales Alex.
-- Thus, we cannot prove ¬ExpandBusiness Alex.
