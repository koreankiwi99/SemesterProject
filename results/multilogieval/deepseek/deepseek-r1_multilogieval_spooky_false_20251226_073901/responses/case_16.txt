The reasoning involves analyzing the premises and the given statement about Sarah. The premises are:

1. If Sarah practiced guitar scales and chords daily (P), then her technique would improve (T): P → T.
2. If her technique improved (T), then she could learn songs faster (F): T → F.
3. To progress, Sarah either practiced regularly (P), listened attentively to music (L), or both: P ∨ L (simplified from P ∨ L ∨ (P ∧ L)).

Given that Sarah is not able to learn songs faster (¬F), we derive:
- From ¬F and T → F, we get ¬T (technique did not improve).
- From ¬T and P → T, we get ¬P (did not practice regularly).

The key ambiguity is whether premise 3 is a general rule Sarah learned or a fact about her actions. If it's a general rule (Progressed Sarah → (P ∨ L)), we lack information on whether Sarah progressed. Without knowing if she progressed, we cannot conclude L from ¬P. Thus, we cannot prove that Sarah listens attentively (L) or that she does not (¬L). Therefore, proving the negation (¬L) is not possible.

axiom learned1 : ∀ p : Person, Practiced p → TechniqueImproved p
axiom learned2 : ∀ p : Person, TechniqueImproved p → LearnFaster p
axiom learned3 : ∀ p : Person, Progressed p → Practiced p ∨ Listened p
axiom given : ¬ LearnFaster Sarah

-- We can prove she did not practice
theorem no_practice : ¬ Practiced Sarah := by
  intro h
  have tech_imp : TechniqueImproved Sarah := learned1 Sarah h
  have learn_fast : LearnFaster Sarah := learned2 Sarah tech_imp
  exact given learn_fast

-- But we cannot prove she does not listen (¬Listened Sarah)
-- Counterexample: Assume she did not progress and did not listen
example : ¬ (∀ (_ : Person), ¬ Listened Sarah) := by
  intro h
  have := h Sarah  -- This forces ¬Listened Sarah universally, but we can have models where it's false
  -- Without knowing Progressed Sarah, we cannot derive a contradiction from ¬Listened Sarah
  sorry

-- Since we cannot prove ¬Listened Sarah, we return Failure
