The goal is to prove that Sam was not assigned to lead a new team (¬Lead Sam) given the premises. However, the premises and the fact that Sam did not get a promotion lead to the conclusion that Sam was assigned to lead a new team (Lead Sam). Therefore, it is impossible to prove ¬Lead Sam.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Sam : obj
axiom Impressed : obj → Prop
axiom Promotion : obj → Prop
axiom Extra : obj → Prop
axiom Experience : obj → Prop
axiom Lead : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : Impressed Sam → Promotion Sam
axiom P2 : Extra Sam → Experience Sam
axiom P3 : Impressed Sam ∨ Extra Sam
axiom P4 : ∀ x, Experience x → Lead x
axiom notPromotion : ¬ Promotion Sam

-- Attempt to prove ¬Lead Sam fails because we can prove Lead Sam
theorem lead_Sam : Lead Sam := by
  have not_impressed : ¬ Impressed Sam := fun h => notPromotion (P1 h)
  cases P3 with
  | inl imp => contradiction
  | inr ex => exact P4 Sam (P2 ex)

-- Since lead_Sam proves Lead Sam, ¬Lead Sam is false and cannot be proven
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure
