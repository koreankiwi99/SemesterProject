The context provides information about employees, promotions, influence, and motivation, but does not directly link Mark's boss-impressing behavior to his motivation. The key premises are:

1. Hard work leads to promotions.
2. Impressing bosses leads to influence.
3. Some employee lacks both promotions and influence.
4. An ambitious employee believes motivation leads to hard work.

Mark impresses his bosses, so he gains influence. However, there is no premise connecting:
- Impressing bosses to motivation
- Motivation to impressing bosses
- Mark specifically to the ambitious employee

Thus, there is insufficient information to prove Mark is not motivated.
