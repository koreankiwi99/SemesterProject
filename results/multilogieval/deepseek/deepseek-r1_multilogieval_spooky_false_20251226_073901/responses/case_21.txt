The natural language reasoning is translated into Lean by defining the relevant predicates and axioms. The context provides two implications:
1. If someone is cold, they put on more layers: `∀ x, Cold x → Layers x`
2. If someone feels a chill, they turn up the heat: `∀ x, Chill x → Heat x`

The given statement about Linda is: `¬ Layers Linda ∨ ¬ Heat Linda`

The goal is to prove that Linda is not feeling cold (`¬ Cold Linda`). However, after attempting the proof:
- Assuming `Cold Linda` leads to `Layers Linda` (by axiom `R1`).
- The given disjunction `¬ Layers Linda ∨ ¬ Heat Linda` splits into two cases:
  - Case 1: `¬ Layers Linda` directly contradicts `Layers Linda`.
  - Case 2: `¬ Heat Linda` does not lead to a contradiction because there is no axiom linking `Cold` to `Chill` or `Chill` to `Cold`. Without such a connection, `¬ Heat Linda` (which implies `¬ Chill Linda` by contraposition of `R2`) does not contradict `Cold Linda`.

Since no contradiction is found in Case 2, the proof of `¬ Cold Linda` cannot be completed. Therefore, the attempt to prove the negation fails.
