The reasoning involves translating the natural language context into logical axioms and attempting to prove that Mark does not have self-discipline. The premises are:

1. If someone wakes up early, they feel energized: `∀ p, WakesUpEarly p → Energized p`
2. If someone plans their day, they are productive: `∀ p, PlansDay p → Productive p`
3. Some people lack energy or productivity: `∃ p, ¬Energized p ∨ ¬Productive p`
4. If someone has self-discipline, they wake up early: `∀ p, SelfDiscipline p → WakesUpEarly p`

Given that Mark plans his day (`PlansDay Mark`), we aim to prove `¬SelfDiscipline Mark`. However, the premises do not provide a link between planning the day and self-discipline or waking up early. While Mark is productive (from premise 2), and self-discipline would imply he is energized (via premises 4 and 1), the existence of someone lacking energy or productivity (premise 3) does not force Mark to lack these attributes. Thus, no contradiction arises, and the negation cannot be proven.

axiom P1 : ∀ p : Person, WakesUpEarly p → Energized p
axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, PlansDay p → Productive p
axiom P3 : ∃ p : Person, ¬Energized p ∨ ¬Productive p
axiom P4 : ∀ p : Person, SelfDiscipline p → WakesUpEarly p

axiom MarkPlansDay : PlansDay Mark

theorem mark_not_self_discipline : ¬SelfDiscipline Mark :=
  fun h : SelfDiscipline Mark =>
  have h1 : WakesUpEarly Mark := P4 Mark h
  have h2 : Energized Mark := P1 Mark h1
  have h3 : Productive Mark := P2 Mark MarkPlansDay
  match P3 with
  | ⟨q, hq⟩ =>
    -- hq : ¬Energized q ∨ ¬Productive q
    -- But q might not be Mark, so no contradiction with h2 or h3
    False.elim (sorry) -- No way to derive False
