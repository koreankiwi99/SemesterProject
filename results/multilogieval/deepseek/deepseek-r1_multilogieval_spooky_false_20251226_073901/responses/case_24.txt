The goal is to prove that if there is no snow on the ground, then Mary does not love winter. However, the premises do not provide any information linking Mary to the snow conditions or freezing temperatures. Specifically:

- Premises establish relationships for a specific person (S) regarding freezing temperatures, snow, and snowman building.
- The general rule about loving winter and building snowmen applies to all persons, but there is no axiom stating that building a snowman requires enough snow for anyone other than S.
- Under the assumption of no snow, we can derive that it is not freezing and there is not enough snow. This implies S does not build a snowman and thus S does not love winter, but this does not constrain Mary.
- Assuming Mary loves winter leads to her building a snowman, but without a link between Mary's snowman building and global snow conditions, no contradiction arises.

Therefore, the negation (that Mary does not love winter) cannot be proven from the premises and the condition of no snow.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `no_snow` hypothesis was declared as a variable but not included in the theorem's premises. After correction, the proof attempt still fails because:

1. From ¬SnowOnGround and A1 (Freezing → SnowOnGround), we derive ¬Freezing
2. From A3 (Freezing ∨ ¬EnoughSnow) and ¬Freezing, we derive ¬EnoughSnow
3. From A4 (∀p, LovesWinter p → BuildsSnowman p) and LovesWinter Mary, we get BuildsSnowman Mary
4. However, axiom A2 (BuildsSnowman S → EnoughSnow) only applies to person S, not Mary
5. There is no axiom linking Mary's snowman-building to global snow conditions
6. Thus, we cannot derive a contradiction from BuildsSnowman Mary and ¬EnoughSnow

The negation (¬LovesWinter Mary) cannot be proven under the assumption of no snow.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred due to incorrect usage of `show False from sorry`. The proof should end with `sorry` to admit the unprovable goal. After correction:

1. The premises establish:
   - Freezing → SnowOnGround (A1)
   - BuildsSnowman S → EnoughSnow (A2)
   - Freezing ∨ ¬EnoughSnow (A3)
   - ∀p, LovesWinter p → BuildsSnowman p (A4)

2. Under ¬SnowOnGround:
   - We derive ¬Freezing (using A1)
   - From A3 and ¬Freezing, we get ¬EnoughSnow

3. For Mary:
   - If she loves winter (h_mary_loves), she builds a snowman (via A4)
   - But there's no axiom linking Mary's snowman-building to EnoughSnow
   - A2 only applies to person S, not Mary

4. Thus, we cannot derive a contradiction from BuildsSnowman Mary and ¬EnoughSnow
