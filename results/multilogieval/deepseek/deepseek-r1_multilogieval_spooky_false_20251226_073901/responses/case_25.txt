The context provides premises about salespersons, but there is no direct link between giving effective presentations and being perceptive. The premises are:

1. Building rapport leads to trust: `∀ s, BuildRapport s → BuildTrust s`
2. Effective presentations lead to sales conversion: `∀ s, EffectivePresentation s → ConvertSales s`
3. There exists a salesperson who neither builds trust nor converts sales: `∃ s, ¬(BuildTrust s ∨ ConvertSales s)`
4. Perceptiveness leads to building rapport: `∀ s, Perceptive s → BuildRapport s`

Given that Emma gives effective presentations, we know `ConvertSales Emma` holds (from premise 2). However, there is no premise connecting `EffectivePresentation` or `ConvertSales` to `Perceptive`. Emma could be perceptive (satisfying premises 4 and 1, leading to trust) or not perceptive (while still converting sales). Premise 3 ensures some salesperson fails at both trust and conversion, but this does not constrain Emma.

Attempting to prove the negation (that Emma is not perceptive) fails because the premises are consistent with both possibilities. Therefore, we cannot prove `¬Perceptive Emma`.

  -- We have no contradiction: Emma can be non-perceptive while still converting sales.
  -- Constructing a model where Emma is not perceptive is consistent:
  --   Let BuildRapport Emma be false (since not perceptive, P4 doesn't force it).
  --   Let BuildTrust Emma be false (P1 holds vacuously as BuildRapport Emma is false).
  --   ConvertSales Emma is true (by P2 and EmmaEffective).
  --   P3 is satisfied by some other salesperson (not Emma).
  -- Thus, no proof of ¬Perceptive Emma exists from the premises.
  -- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation.
