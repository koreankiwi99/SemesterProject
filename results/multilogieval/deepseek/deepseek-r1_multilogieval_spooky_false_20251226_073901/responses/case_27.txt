The goal is to prove the negation of the statement: "If John's coworkers are not hungry, then John is diligent." This negation is equivalent to "John's coworkers are not hungry and John is not diligent." However, the premises do not provide enough information to establish this conjunction, particularly because there is no link between John and the specific "someone" mentioned in the context. The premises allow scenarios where John is diligent even when coworkers are not hungry, depending on whether John is the same as the "someone" or not. Therefore, the negation cannot be proven.
