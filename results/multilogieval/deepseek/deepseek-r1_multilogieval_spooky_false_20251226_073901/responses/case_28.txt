The textual context provides two premises:
1. If someone gets injured, they should see a doctor: `∀x, Injured x → ShouldSeeDoctor x`.
2. Getting hurt warrants resting the affected area: `∀x, Hurt x → ShouldRest x`.

The statement to evaluate is: "Either Jane did not see a doctor or she did not rest her injury." This is formalized as `¬ShouldSeeDoctor Jane ∨ ¬ShouldRest Jane`.

The question is: "Did Jane get hurt?" which we interpret as proving `¬Hurt Jane` if possible.

### Analysis:
- Premises establish that being injured/hurt implies two recommendations: seeing a doctor and resting.
- The disjunction states Jane failed to follow at least one recommendation.
- However, failing to follow recommendations does not logically imply Jane was not hurt. She could have been hurt but neglected one or both recommendations.
- The phrase "rest her injury" in the disjunction presupposes an injury (implying she was hurt), but this is not explicitly stated in the premises. Without additional axioms linking `ShouldRest` to the existence of an injury, we cannot infer `Hurt Jane` or its negation solely from the disjunction.
- Both scenarios are consistent with the premises:
  - If Jane was hurt, she should have seen a doctor and rested, but the disjunction allows for her not doing so.
  - If Jane was not hurt, the premises impose no requirements, so the disjunction holds trivially (both recommendations might be false).

Thus, we cannot prove `¬Hurt Jane` from the given premises and the disjunction.

  -- This proof assumes the disjunction contradicts the recommendations under Hurt Jane.
  -- However, in natural language, failing to follow recommendations does not preclude being hurt.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the direction of the synonym axiom was incorrect. The original code used `(Synonymous Jane).mp` to derive `Injured Jane` from `Hurt Jane`, but `.mp` requires `Injured Jane` as input to yield `Hurt Jane`. The correct direction is `.mpr`, which uses `Hurt Jane` to derive `Injured Jane`.

However, after fixing this, a deeper issue remains: the premises describe normative recommendations ("should see a doctor", "warrants resting"), while the disjunction describes actual actions ("did not see", "did not rest"). There are no axioms connecting normative obligations to actual behavior, so no contradiction can be derived from assuming Jane was hurt. The proof attempt fails due to this logical gap.
