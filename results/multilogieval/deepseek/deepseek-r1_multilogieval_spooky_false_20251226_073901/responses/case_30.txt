The context provides information about athletes and their dedication, training, nutrition, and performance. Mark is introduced as eating a healthy diet, but the context does not explicitly state that Mark is an athlete. However, since the entire context is about professional sports athletes and the question pertains to Mark's dedication to his sport, it is reasonable to assume Mark is an athlete. The axioms are defined accordingly.

The key premises are:
1. Athletes lack skill or are deficient in strength.
2. Proper training enhances skills (for athletes).
3. Healthy nutrition increases strength (for athletes).
4. Dedication leads to proper training.
5. Mark eats a healthy diet (so he has healthy nutrition).

Using these, we prove that Mark is not dedicated:
- Mark's healthy nutrition implies increased strength (from premise 3).
- Increased strength means Mark is not deficient in strength (by definition).
- Since athletes lack skill or are deficient in strength (premise 1), and Mark is not deficient in strength, he must lack skill.
- Lacking skill means Mark does not have enhanced skills (by definition).
- If Mark were dedicated, he would train properly (premise 4), which would enhance his skills (premise 2).
- But Mark does not have enhanced skills, so he cannot be dedicated.

This reasoning is formalized in Lean, proving that Mark is not dedicated.
