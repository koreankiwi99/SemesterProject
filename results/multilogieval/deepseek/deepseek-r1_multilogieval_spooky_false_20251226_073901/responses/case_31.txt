The textual context provides normative statements ("should have", "warrant") about actions when infidelity is suspected, but these do not logically entail actual behavior. The given statement describes Priya's actual actions (either no conversation or no reassessment). There is no premise linking suspicion to obligatory actions being necessarily performed, so we cannot derive that Priya did not suspect infidelity from her failure to perform one or both actions.

  fun hSuspect : SuspectsCheating Priya =>
  -- We have no premises that force actual actions from suspicion.
  -- Normative "should" does not translate to factual implication.
  -- Thus, we cannot derive a contradiction from the disjunction.
