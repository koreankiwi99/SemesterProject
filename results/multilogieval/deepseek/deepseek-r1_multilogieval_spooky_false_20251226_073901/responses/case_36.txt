The translation of the natural language reasoning into Lean code involves defining the relevant entities and predicates based on the context and the statement to evaluate. The context provides two premises:
1. If someone is having computer problems, they should try restarting it. This is formalized as `∀ x, Problems x → Restart x`.
2. If there are issues with a computer, its user should check for any software updates. This is formalized as `∀ x, Problems x → CheckUpdate x`.

The statement to evaluate is: "Either Mary did not restart her computer or she did not install the latest updates." This is formalized as `¬Restart Mary ∨ ¬InstallUpdate Mary`.

The question is: "Was Mary having problems with her computer?" To answer this, we attempt to prove the negation, i.e., that Mary was not having problems (`¬Problems Mary`), using the premises and the given statement.

However, the proof fails because:
- Assuming `Problems Mary` leads to `Restart Mary` (from the first premise) and `CheckUpdate Mary` (from the second premise).
- The given statement (`¬Restart Mary ∨ ¬InstallUpdate Mary`) must hold. Since `Restart Mary` is true, the first disjunct is false, so `¬InstallUpdate Mary` must be true.
- There is no premise linking `CheckUpdate` to `InstallUpdate`. Thus, `CheckUpdate Mary` does not contradict `¬InstallUpdate Mary`, and no contradiction is obtained.

Therefore, it is impossible to prove `¬Problems Mary` from the given axioms.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mary : obj
axiom Problems : obj → Prop
axiom Restart : obj → Prop
axiom CheckUpdate : obj → Prop
axiom InstallUpdate : obj → Prop

-- Context premises
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Problems x → Restart x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Problems x → CheckUpdate x

-- Given statement: Either Mary did not restart or did not install updates
axiom given : ¬Restart Mary ∨ ¬InstallUpdate Mary

-- Attempt to prove Mary was not having problems
theorem neg_problems : ¬Problems Mary := by
  intro h  -- Assume Problems Mary
  have r : Restart Mary := A1 Mary h  -- From A1
  have c : CheckUpdate Mary := A2 Mary h  -- From A2
  cases given with
  | inl not_restart => exact not_restart r  -- Contradiction: ¬Restart and Restart
  | inr not_install => 
      -- We have ¬InstallUpdate Mary, but no axiom forces InstallUpdate Mary from Problems Mary or CheckUpdate Mary.
      -- No contradiction possible.
      admit  -- Proof fails here
