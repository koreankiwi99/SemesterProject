The Lean code models the given context and attempts to prove that James did not get to work on time. The premises are translated as follows:
- `SubwayRunning` and `BusHasRoom` are propositions about transit conditions.
- `TakesSubway` and `CatchesBus` are predicates over `Person`.
- `OnTime` indicates whether a person arrives on time.
- `A1` and `A2` state that if transit conditions are met, someone uses that transit.
- `A3_sub` and `A3_bus` (from the third premise) ensure that using either transit results in being on time.
- `A4` restates the subway part (redundant with `A3_sub` but included for faithfulness).
- `James_no_bus` states James did not take the bus.

The theorem `james_not_on_time` attempts to prove `¬OnTime James` (that James did not get to work on time). However:
- There is no premise linking "not taking the bus" to "not being on time".
- James might have used the subway (but `TakesSubway James` is unknown) or another unmodeled transit.
- No premise forces James to use transit or connects absence of bus usage to lateness.

Thus, the negation cannot be proven from the premises.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person
axiom SubwayRunning : Prop
axiom BusHasRoom : Prop
axiom TakesSubway : Person → Prop
axiom CatchesBus : Person → Prop
axiom OnTime : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : SubwayRunning → ∃ p, TakesSubway p
axiom A2 : BusHasRoom → ∃ q, CatchesBus q
axiom A3_sub : ∀ p, TakesSubway p → OnTime p
axiom A3_bus : ∀ p, CatchesBus p → OnTime p
axiom A4 : ∀ p, TakesSubway p → OnTime p  -- Redundant with A3_sub
axiom James_no_bus : ¬ CatchesBus James

theorem james_not_on_time : ¬ OnTime James :=
by
  -- No premises connect ¬CatchesBus James to ¬OnTime James.
  -- James might have taken the subway (but we don't know) or another transit.
  -- Thus, we cannot prove the negation.
