The context provides general principles about redecorating, but the statement about Matt lacks information on whether he wants to redecorate. This is critical because the implication from gaining skills to redoing the living room (used in the context's reasoning) depends on the person wanting to redecorate. Without knowing Matt's intention, we cannot establish the necessary link between his lack of redoing and gaining skills. Consequently, we cannot prove that Matt does not get new decorating ideas.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because I incorrectly applied a proof term as if it were a function. Specifically, `h_newideas` is a proof of `NewIdeas Matt`, not a function that can take arguments. The attempt to derive a contradiction in the case where Matt reads blogs was flawed because there's no inherent contradiction between having new ideas and not redoing the living room.

After careful analysis:
1. The premises establish that watching videos gains skills, reading blogs gains new ideas, and everyone does at least one
2. Matt did not redo his living room
3. There is NO premise linking new ideas to redoing the living room
4. There is NO premise linking skills to redoing the living room
5. Matt could have:
   - Watched videos (gaining skills) but not redone the living room
   - Read blogs (gaining new ideas) but not redone the living room
   - Done both but still not redone the living room

Thus, we cannot prove that Matt does not get new decorating ideas.
