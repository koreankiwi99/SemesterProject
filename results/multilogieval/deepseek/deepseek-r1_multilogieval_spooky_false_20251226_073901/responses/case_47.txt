The reasoning involves evaluating whether Max learned new skills given the premises and the fact that he was unable to pick up the materials. The premises are:

1. If the package arrives on time, people can start a new project (`ArrivesOnTime → StartProject`).
2. If the office supply store has the special order in stock, they can pick up the materials (`InStock → PickUpMaterials`).
3. Either the package arrives on time or the special order is ready (or both) (`ArrivesOnTime ∨ InStock`).
4. If someone starts a new project, they learn new skills (`StartProject → LearnSkills`).

Given that Max was unable to pick up the materials (`¬PickUpMaterials`), we derive:
- From premise 2 and `¬PickUpMaterials`, we get `¬InStock` (by contraposition).
- From premise 3 and `¬InStock`, we get `ArrivesOnTime` (disjunction elimination).
- From premise 1 and `ArrivesOnTime`, we get `StartProject`.
- From premise 4 and `StartProject`, we get `LearnSkills`.

Thus, we prove that Max learned new skills (`LearnSkills`). The task requires attempting to prove the negation (that Max did not learn new skills, i.e., `¬LearnSkills`). However, since we have proven `LearnSkills`, `¬LearnSkills` is false and cannot be proven from the premises. Therefore, the attempt to prove the negation fails.
