The goal is to prove that there was no lot of booing (¬B) given the premises and the additional fact that the crowd did not start cheering loudly (¬C). 

Premises:
1. If the team scores early (S), then the crowd gets pumped up (P): S → P
2. If the crowd gets pumped up (P), then they start cheering loudly (C): P → C
3. Either the team scores early (S), or they play their rival team (R), or both: S ∨ R
4. If the crowd is pumped up (P), then there will be a lot of booing (B): P → B
Additional fact: ¬C

From ¬C and P → C, we derive ¬P (modus tollens). From ¬P and S → P, we derive ¬S (modus tollens). From ¬S and S ∨ R, we derive R. However, we have no premise linking R to B. Since P is false, P → B is vacuously true but does not constrain B. Thus, ¬B cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom S : Prop  -- Team scores early
axiom P : Prop  -- Crowd pumped up
axiom C : Prop  -- Crowd cheers loudly
axiom R : Prop  -- Play rival team
axiom B : Prop  -- Lot of booing

axiom P1 : S → P
axiom P2 : P → C
axiom P3 : S ∨ R
axiom P4 : P → B
axiom A1 : ¬C       -- Crowd did not cheer loudly

theorem notP : ¬P := fun hP : P => A1 (P2 hP)
theorem notS : ¬S := fun hS : S => notP (P1 hS)
theorem hasR : R :=
  match P3 with
  | Or.inl s => False.elim (notS s)
  | Or.inr r => r

-- Cannot prove ¬B: No premise forces ¬B when P is false
