The reasoning involves translating the natural language context into logical premises and then attempting to prove the negation of the statement: "If Emma is unable to have real conversations in Spanish, then she gains valuable listening comprehension." The negation of this implication is "Emma is unable to have real conversations and she does not gain valuable listening comprehension" (¬C Emma ∧ ¬G Emma).

The Lean code defines the necessary types and predicates, along with the given premises:
1. Speaking daily with native speakers (S) leads to improved fluency (F).
2. Improved fluency (F) leads to the ability to have real conversations (C).
3. For any person, they either speak with native speakers (S), listen to educational podcasts (L), or both.
4. Listening to educational podcasts (L) leads to gaining valuable listening comprehension (G).

The attempt to prove ¬C Emma ∧ ¬G Emma fails because:
- From ¬C Emma, we derive ¬S Emma (using contraposition on premises 1 and 2).
- From ¬S Emma and premise 3 (S Emma ∨ L Emma), we derive L Emma.
- From L Emma and premise 4, we derive G Emma.
- Thus, ¬C Emma implies G Emma, making ¬C Emma ∧ ¬G Emma impossible under the premises.

Since the negation cannot be proven, the result is Failure.
