The reasoning involves evaluating whether flooding occurs in Dallas given heavy rainfall, based on the general rules provided. The key points are:

1. Heavy rainfall in Dallas is given (equivalent to excessive rain).
2. The rule states: excessive rain causes reservoirs and dams to overflow, leading to flooding.
3. However, the rule implicitly requires the presence of reservoirs and dams to apply.
4. There is no information about whether Dallas has reservoirs and dams.

Thus:
- If Dallas has reservoirs/dams, flooding must occur.
- If Dallas lacks reservoirs/dams, flooding cannot occur (since overflow requires them).
- Without knowing Dallas's infrastructure, we cannot definitively prove that flooding does **not** occur.

Therefore, the negation (that flooding does not occur) cannot be proven from the premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Dallas : obj
axiom excessive_rain : obj → Prop
axiom has_reservoirs_and_dams : obj → Prop
axiom overflow : obj → Prop
axiom flooding : obj → Prop

axiom rain_Dallas : excessive_rain Dallas
axiom rule1 : ∀ x : obj, excessive_rain x ∧ has_reservoirs_and_dams x → overflow x
axiom rule2 : ∀ x : obj, overflow x → flooding x

theorem no_flooding : ¬flooding Dallas :=
  by
  -- Proof fails: We lack knowledge about reservoirs/dams in Dallas.
  -- If Dallas has reservoirs/dams, flooding occurs (via rule1 and rule2).
  -- If not, rule1 doesn't apply, so flooding may not occur.
  -- Since we cannot assume Dallas lacks reservoirs/dams, we cannot prove ¬flooding.
