The reasoning involves proving that if Mark did not enjoy the first day of school, then he did not introduce himself to classmates. The premises are formalized in Lean, and the theorem `mark_case` demonstrates the implication `¬EnjoySchool Mark → ¬IntroducedThemselves Mark`. This proves that the answer to the question "If Mark did not enjoy the first day of school, then did he introduce himself to classmates?" is **No**, because under the condition that Mark did not enjoy school, he did not introduce himself.
