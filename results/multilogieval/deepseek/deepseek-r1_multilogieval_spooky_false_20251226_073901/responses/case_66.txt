After careful analysis, the reasoning is translated into Lean. The key insight is that while we can prove Acme did not develop an innovative product *for the specific gadget*, the premises do not allow us to conclude that Acme developed no innovative product *at all* (since other products might exist). The negation requiring proof is that Acme developed *any* innovative product (existential), but the given facts only concern the gadget.

<lean>
axiom Company : Type
axiom Product : Type
axiom Acme : Company
axiom gadget : Product

axiom DevelopsInnovative : Company → Product → Prop
axiom MarketsEffectively : Company → Product → Prop
axiom CommerciallySuccessful : Product → Prop

axiom GeneralRule : ∀ (c : Company) (p : Product), 
  DevelopsInnovative c p → MarketsEffectively c p → CommerciallySuccessful p

axiom MarketedEffectively : MarketsEffectively Acme gadget
axiom NotSuccessful : ¬ CommerciallySuccessful gadget

-- Prove the gadget was not developed as innovative by Acme
theorem not_innov_for_gadget : ¬ DevelopsInnovative Acme gadget := by
  intro h_innov
  have h_success : CommerciallySuccessful gadget := GeneralRule Acme gadget h_innov MarketedEffectively
  exact NotSuccessful h_success

-- Attempt to prove Acme developed NO innovative product (existential negation)
theorem no_innov_product : ¬ (∃ p : Product, DevelopsInnovative Acme p) := by
  intro ⟨p, h_innov⟩
  -- We only have information about the gadget, not arbitrary p
  -- If p ≠ gadget, we cannot derive contradiction
  -- Thus, proof fails for existential case
  sorry  -- Proof incomplete
</lean>

The first theorem `not_innov_for_gadget` succeeds, proving the gadget specifically was not innovative. However, the second theorem `no_innov_product` (which represents the negation of "Acme developed an innovative product") cannot be proven because the premises lack information about other products. Since the question asks whether Acme developed *an* innovative product (existential) and we cannot prove the negation, the answer is Failure.

ANSWER: Failure
