The context provides explicit information that the plants produced lots of vegetables, which directly indicates an abundant harvest. Additionally, the rule that healthy plants yield bigger harvests is given, and the plants are stated to be healthy ("grew strong"), further supporting the abundance. The gardener's belief about soil nutrients is not used as a factual premise since it is presented as a belief, not an established truth. There is no information suggesting the harvest was not abundant. Therefore, attempting to prove the negation of abundant harvest fails due to contradictory evidence in the premises.

<lean>
axiom enriched_soil : Prop
axiom healthy_plants : Prop
axiom abundant_harvest : Prop
axiom added_enrichment : enriched_soil
axiom plants_strong : healthy_plants
axiom produced_lots : abundant_harvest
axiom yield_rule : healthy_plants → abundant_harvest

-- Attempt to prove ¬abundant_harvest fails due to `produced_lots` and `yield_rule plants_strong`
theorem harvest_abundant : abundant_harvest := produced_lots

-- Trying to prove the negation (¬abundant_harvest) leads to contradiction
theorem cannot_prove_negation : ¬abundant_harvest → False :=
  fun h => h produced_lots

-- Since we cannot prove ¬abundant_harvest, we return Failure
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure
