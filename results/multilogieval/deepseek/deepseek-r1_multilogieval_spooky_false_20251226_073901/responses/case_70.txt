The reasoning involves translating the natural language statements into logical propositions and attempting to prove that Farmer Joe did not plant the seeds properly.

Premises:
1. General rule: If seeds are planted properly (P), then adequate sunlight and watering (S) implies tomatoes grow large and plentiful (G).  
   Symbolized as: ∀x, P x → (S x → G x)
2. Farmer Joe had adequate sunlight and watering: S joe
3. Farmer Joe's tomatoes did not grow large and plentiful: ¬G joe

Goal: Prove ¬P joe (Farmer Joe did not plant seeds properly)

Proof strategy:
- Assume P joe (for contradiction).
- Apply the general rule to joe: P joe → (S joe → G joe)
- With P joe and S joe, derive G joe.
- This contradicts ¬G joe, proving ¬P joe.

axiom obj : Type
axiom joe : obj
axiom P : obj → Prop  -- Planted seeds properly
axiom S : obj → Prop  -- Adequate sunlight and watering
axiom G : obj → Prop  -- Tomatoes grew large and plentiful

-- Premises

ANSWER: No
