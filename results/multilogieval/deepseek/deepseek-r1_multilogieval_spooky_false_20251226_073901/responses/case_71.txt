The Lean code formalizes the given premises and attempts to prove the negation of the conclusion "If Alex got sunburnt, then the weather was sunny" (i.e., `Sunburnt Alex ∧ ¬ Sunny`). However, the premises do not provide sufficient information to prove that Alex specifically got sunburnt or that the weather was not sunny. The universal quantifiers apply generally, but no premises force Alex to be sunburnt or directly link Alex's actions to the weather conditions in a way that yields the required conjunction. Thus, the proof fails.

The Lean code attempts to prove the negation of the conditional statement "If Alex got sunburnt, then the weather was sunny" (i.e., `Sunburnt Alex ∧ ¬ Sunny`). However, the premises do not provide sufficient information to prove either conjunct:

1. **`Sunburnt Alex` cannot be proven**: No premise forces Alex to be sunburnt. While `P4` and `P1` relate sunscreen use to avoiding sunburn, they do not guarantee sunburn occurs without sunscreen.
2. **`¬ Sunny` cannot be proven**: Assuming `Sunny` leads to Alex not being sunburnt (via `P6 → P5 → P3 → P4`), but this contradicts nothing since `Sunburnt Alex` is unprovable. The `contradiction` tactic fails in the `inl` branch without `Sunburnt Alex`.

Thus, the proof fails.
