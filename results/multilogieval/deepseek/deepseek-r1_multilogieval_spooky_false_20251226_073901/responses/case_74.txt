The reasoning establishes that James must not have planned his schedule well based on the given premises. The key steps involve:

1. From planning schedule well → studies everyday → finishes homework → can watch game
2. Premise 3: Either Friday night or no one watches game
3. James not going to party:
   - If Friday night, all go to party (contradiction)
   - Thus not Friday night, so no one can watch game
4. Contradiction: James can watch game from step 1

This proves that James planning his schedule well leads to contradiction.
