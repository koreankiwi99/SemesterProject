The premises state that for novelists, if a writer develops compelling characters, then crafting an intriguing plot implies their book connects with readers. Given that Lauren crafted an intriguing plot but her book did not connect with readers, we prove she did not develop compelling characters.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Novelist : obj → Prop
axiom CC : obj → Prop   -- Develops compelling characters
axiom IP : obj → Prop   -- Crafts intriguing plot
axiom CR : obj → Prop   -- Book connects with readers
axiom Lauren : obj
axiom Premise : ∀ x : obj, Novelist x → (CC x → (IP x → CR x))
axiom Lauren_novelist : Novelist Lauren
axiom Lauren_intriguing_plot : IP Lauren
axiom Lauren_not_connect : ¬ CR Lauren

theorem not_compelling_characters : ¬ CC Lauren := by
  intro h_CC
  have step1 : CC Lauren → (IP Lauren → CR Lauren) := Premise Lauren Lauren_novelist
  have step2 : IP Lauren → CR Lauren := step1 h_CC
  have Lauren_connect : CR Lauren := step2 Lauren_intriguing_plot
  exact Lauren_not_connect Lauren_connect
</lean>
