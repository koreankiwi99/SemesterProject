The natural language reasoning is translated into Lean by defining propositions for each key element and the premises as axioms. The goal is to prove the negation of the statement: if the cake batter contained eggs, then the guests at the party will be happy. The negation is ¬(Eggs → Happy), which is equivalent to Eggs ∧ ¬Happy.

The premises are:
1. If the oven is set to 350 degrees (O350), the cake bakes properly (Bake).
2. If the batter contains eggs (Eggs), the cake is fluffy (Fluffy).
3. Either the oven was set correctly (Correct) or the batter does not contain eggs (¬Eggs).
4. If the cake bakes properly (Bake), it is delicious (Delicious).
5. If the cake is delicious (Delicious), the guests are happy (Happy).

Note that "set correctly" (Correct) and "set to 350 degrees" (O350) are distinct propositions without a defined relationship. Similarly, fluffiness (Fluffy) is not connected to other outcomes like baking properly or taste.

Attempt to prove Eggs ∧ ¬Happy:
- Assume Eggs is true. By premise 3, Correct must be true (since ¬Eggs is false).
- However, Correct being true does not imply O350 (no premise links them), so O350 may be false.
- If O350 is false, premise 1 does not force Bake to be true (Bake could be false).
- If Bake is false, premise 4 does not force Delicious to be true (Delicious could be false).
- If Delicious is false, premise 5 does not force Happy to be true (Happy could be false).
- Thus, Eggs true and Happy false is possible.

However, this scenario is not entailed by the premises alone. It is also possible that:
- Correct implies O350 (though unstated), leading to Bake, Delicious, and Happy when Eggs is true.
- The premises do not contradict Eggs ∧ ¬Happy, but they do not prove it either, as other models satisfy the premises with Eggs true and Happy true.

Since Eggs ∧ ¬Happy cannot be proven from the premises (the negation is not derivable), the proof fails.

axiom Correct : Prop
axiom O350 : Prop
axiom Eggs : Prop
axiom Bake : Prop
axiom Fluffy : Prop
axiom Delicious : Prop
axiom Happy : Prop

axiom P1 : O350 → Bake
axiom P2 : Eggs → Fluffy
axiom P3 : Correct ∨ ¬Eggs
axiom P4 : Bake → Delicious
axiom P5 : Delicious → Happy

theorem prove_negation : Eggs ∧ ¬Happy := by
  -- We need to show Eggs and ¬Happy, but:
  -- - From Eggs and P3, Correct must hold, but no link between Correct and O350.
  -- - Without O350, we cannot ensure Bake (P1), hence no chain to Happy.
  -- - However, we cannot force ¬Happy solely from Eggs; it remains unprovable.
  -- Thus, the proof fails.
