The goal is to prove that if there was no noise level up, then the police were not called. However, the premises lead to the opposite conclusion: if there is no noise level up (i.e., no drums), then there must be a party (by premise 3), which leads to complaints (by premise 1 and 4) and then police intervention (by premise 5). Thus, it is impossible to prove that the police were not called under the condition of no noise level up.

axiom Party : Prop
axiom Drums : Prop
axiom NoiseLevelUp : Prop
axiom Complaints : Prop
axiom Police : Prop

axiom premise1 : Party → Complaints
axiom premise2 : Drums → NoiseLevelUp
axiom premise3 : Party ∨ Drums
axiom premise5 : Complaints → Police

-- Attempt to prove: ¬NoiseLevelUp → ¬Police
theorem prove_negation : ¬NoiseLevelUp → ¬Police :=
  fun (hNoNoise : ¬NoiseLevelUp) =>
  -- From premise2, ¬NoiseLevelUp implies ¬Drums (contrapositive)
  have hNoDrums : ¬Drums := fun (hD : Drums) => hNoNoise (premise2 hD)
  -- From premise3, ¬Drums implies Party must hold
  have hParty : Party := by
    cases premise3 with
    | inl hP => exact hP
    | inr hD => exact absurd hD hNoDrums
  -- From premise1, Party implies Complaints
  have hComplaints : Complaints := premise1 hParty
  -- From premise5, Complaints implies Police
  have hPolice : Police := premise5 hComplaints
  -- We have Police, so we cannot prove ¬Police
  fun (hNoPolice : ¬Police) => hNoPolice hPolice

-- The above proof shows that assuming ¬NoiseLevelUp leads to Police, making ¬Police impossible.
-- Therefore, the theorem prove_negation cannot be proven.

The error occurred because the proof attempted to construct a term of type `¬Police` (Police → False) while having evidence of `Police`. This is impossible since the premises show that no noise actually leads to police intervention. The corrected code uses `sorry` to indicate the unprovable nature of the theorem.

axiom Drums : Prop
