The reasoning involves evaluating whether pests invading the field implies the farmer did not make good profit. The premises are translated into logical propositions, and an attempt is made to prove the negation of the conclusion (i.e., that pests invading leads to no good profit). However, the analysis shows that pests invading actually forces the field to have enough water (due to the disjunction premise), leading to good crop growth, a bountiful harvest, and good profit. Thus, the negation cannot be proven.

axiom W : Prop  -- Field gets enough water
axiom P : Prop  -- Pests invade
axiom D : Prop  -- Crops destroyed (by pests)
axiom G : Prop  -- Crops grow well
axiom B : Prop  -- Harvest bountiful
axiom Profit : Prop  -- Farmer makes good profit

-- Premises:
axiom P1 : W → G  -- Enough water → crops grow well
axiom P2 : P → D  -- Pests invade → crops destroyed
axiom P3 : W ∨ ¬D ∨ (W ∧ D)  -- Disjunction: adequate water ∨ no crop damage ∨ (water but damage)
axiom P4 : G → B  -- Crops grow well → bountiful harvest
axiom P5 : B → Profit  -- Bountiful harvest → good profit

-- Attempt to prove: If pests invade, farmer does NOT make good profit (P → ¬Profit)
theorem target : P → ¬Profit :=
fun hP : P =>
  have hD : D := P2 hP  -- Pests invade → crops destroyed
  -- Process disjunction P3 under hD (which is true)

  | Or.inl hW =>  -- Case: Adequate water
    have hG : G := P1 hW
    have hB : B := P4 hG
    have hProfit : Profit := P5 hB
    show ¬Profit from fun _ => hProfit  -- Contradiction: Profit holds, cannot prove ¬Profit
  | Or.inr (Or.inl hnD) =>  -- Case: No crop damage
    show ¬Profit from False.elim (hnD hD)  -- Contradiction: hD and hnD conflict
  | Or.inr (Or.inr ⟨hW, _⟩) =>  -- Case: Water but damage (crops destroyed)
    have hG : G := P1 hW
    have hB : B := P4 hG
    have hProfit : Profit := P5 hB
    show ¬Profit from fun _ => hProfit  -- Contradiction: Profit holds
  -- All cases lead to Profit when P is true, so ¬Profit is unprovable

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the proof for `¬Profit` (which is `Profit → False`) was not correctly constructed. In the cases where `Profit` holds, attempting to return `hProfit` directly as a proof of `False` is invalid. Instead, a valid function from `Profit` to `False` must be provided, but this is impossible since no contradiction exists when `Profit` holds. 

After reanalysis:
1. From `P` (pests invade), we derive `D` (crops destroyed) via `P2`.
2. The disjunction `P3` (water adequate OR no crop damage OR water adequate with damage) must hold.
3. Given `D`, the "no crop damage" case is contradictory and eliminated.
4. Both remaining cases (water adequate OR water adequate with damage) imply `W` (water adequate).
5. `W` leads to `G` (crops grow well) via `P1`, then `B` (bountiful harvest) via `P4`, then `Profit` via `P5`.
6. Thus, `P` implies `Profit` is provable, meaning `P → ¬Profit` is unprovable.
