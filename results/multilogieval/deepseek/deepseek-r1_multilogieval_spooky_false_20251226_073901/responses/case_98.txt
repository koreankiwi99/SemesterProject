The premises lead to a derivation that if it is very hot outside, the team wins. Specifically:
- If it is hot, the game is postponed (premise 2).
- The disjunction (premise 3) forces the team to have practiced hard when the game is postponed.
- Hard practice leads to preparedness (premise 1), which leads to playing well (premise 4), and then winning (premise 5).

Thus, `hot → win` holds. Attempting to prove the negation (that the team did not win when it was hot) fails because it contradicts the derived implication. Therefore, the proof of negation is unsuccessful.
