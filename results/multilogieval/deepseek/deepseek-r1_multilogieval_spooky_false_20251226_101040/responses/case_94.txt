The textual context describes a specific individual ("someone") and their reasoning about sprint training, recovery, and race performance. The premises are:

1. If they trained hard weekly (sprint workouts several times a week), their speed would improve: `T someone → I someone`.
2. If their speed improved, they could run races faster: `I someone → R someone`.
3. They either trained hard, stretched regularly after runs, or both: `T someone ∨ S someone`.
4. If they stretched after runs, they took recovery seriously: `S someone → C someone`.
5. If they took recovery seriously, they focused on muscle flexibility: `C someone → F someone`.

The statement to evaluate is about Lauren: "If Lauren does not run races faster, does she focus on flexibility to prevent injury?" This translates to proving whether `¬R Lauren → F Lauren` holds. However, the premises are about "someone," not Lauren. There is no information linking Lauren to "someone" or indicating that the premises apply universally to all individuals, including Lauren. Therefore, no premises constrain Lauren's behavior, and we cannot derive any conclusion about Lauren from the given context.

Attempting to prove the negation (that `¬R Lauren` does not imply `F Lauren`, i.e., `¬(¬R Lauren → F Lauren)` which is equivalent to `¬R Lauren ∧ ¬F Lauren`) fails because there are no premises about Lauren. Consequently, we cannot prove that Lauren does not focus on flexibility when she does not run races faster.

axiom someone : Person
axiom Lauren : Person

axiom T : Person → Prop   -- trained hard weekly
axiom S : Person → Prop   -- stretched regularly after runs
axiom I : Person → Prop   -- speed improves
axiom R : Person → Prop   -- run races faster
axiom C : Person → Prop   -- took recovery seriously
axiom F : Person → Prop   -- focused on flexibility

-- Premises about the specific person "someone"
axiom P1 : T someone → I someone
axiom P2 : I someone → R someone
axiom P3 : T someone ∨ S someone
axiom P4 : S someone → C someone
axiom P5 : C someone → F someone

-- We want to prove: ¬R Lauren ∧ ¬F Lauren (to disprove ¬R Lauren → F Lauren)

  -- No premises about Lauren; cannot prove anything about her
  sorry  -- Proof fails
