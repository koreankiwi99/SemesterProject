The reasoning involves proving whether the person bought their dream home given that they could not afford a down payment. The premises establish:

1. Saving aggressively implies affording a down payment.
2. Improving credit implies qualifying for a mortgage.
3. The person either saves aggressively or improves their credit.
4. Qualifying for a mortgage implies buying the dream home.

Given that the person cannot afford a down payment, they must not be saving aggressively (from premise 1). Therefore, by premise 3, they must have improved their credit. This leads to qualifying for a mortgage (premise 2) and ultimately buying the dream home (premise 4). The Lean proof formalizes this reasoning.

axiom obj : Type
axiom P : obj
axiom SavedAggressively : obj → Prop
axiom AffordDownPayment : obj → Prop
axiom ImprovedCredit : obj → Prop
axiom QualifyMortgage : obj → Prop
axiom BuyDreamHome : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, SavedAggressively x → AffordDownPayment x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, ImprovedCredit x → QualifyMortgage x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, SavedAggressively x ∨ ImprovedCredit x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, QualifyMortgage x → BuyDreamHome x
axiom given : ¬ AffordDownPayment P

theorem bought_home : BuyDreamHome P := by
  have not_saved : ¬ SavedAggressively P := fun h => given (A1 P h)
  have must_improve : ImprovedCredit P := by
    cases A3 P with
    | inl saved => contradiction
    | inr improved => exact improved
  have qualified : QualifyMortgage P := A2 P must_improve
  exact A4 P qualified
