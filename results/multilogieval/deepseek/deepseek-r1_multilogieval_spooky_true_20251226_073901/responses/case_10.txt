ANSWER: Yes

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic failed to automatically detect the contradiction in the first case. To fix this, we explicitly handle the contradiction by using `exfalso` to change the goal to `False` and then apply the contradictory hypotheses.

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Alex : obj
axiom StudyHard : obj → Prop
axiom GoodGrades : obj → Prop
axiom Participate : obj → Prop
axiom MakeFriends : obj → Prop
axiom Invited : obj → Prop

-- Premises:
axiom P1 : StudyHard Alex → GoodGrades Alex
axiom P2 : Participate Alex → MakeFriends Alex
axiom P3 : StudyHard Alex ∨ Participate Alex
axiom P4 : ∀ x, MakeFriends x → Invited x

-- Given condition:
axiom notGood : ¬ GoodGrades Alex

-- We want to prove Invited Alex
theorem alex_invited : Invited Alex := by
  cases P3 with
  | inl studied =>
    -- Contradiction: studied hard implies good grades (P1), but Alex has no good grades (notGood)
    exfalso        -- Changes goal to False
    exact notGood (P1 studied)
  | inr participated =>
    -- Participated implies made friends (P2), which leads to invitation (P4)
    exact P4 Alex (P2 participated)
</lean>
