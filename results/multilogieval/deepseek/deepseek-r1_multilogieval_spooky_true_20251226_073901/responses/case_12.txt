The reasoning involves proving that if James does not gain confidence, then he must watch cooking shows for inspiration. The premises establish:
- Following recipes precisely leads to dishes turning out well (F → W).
- Dishes turning out well lead to gaining confidence (W → C).
- Chefs either follow recipes precisely or watch cooking shows (or both) (F ∨ S).

Given ¬C (James does not gain confidence), we derive:
1. Contrapositive of W → C: ¬C → ¬W (so James's dishes do not turn out well).
2. Contrapositive of F → W: ¬W → ¬F (so James does not follow recipes precisely).
3. From ¬F and F ∨ S, we conclude S (James watches cooking shows).

Thus, the statement is proven.
