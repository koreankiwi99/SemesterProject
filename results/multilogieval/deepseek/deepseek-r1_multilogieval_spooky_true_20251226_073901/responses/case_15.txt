The reasoning involves translating the natural language statements into logical premises and proving whether, given the student did not excel academically, they were chosen as class prefect.

**Premises:**
1. If the student studies diligently, they excel academically: `Study → Excel`
2. If the student participates actively, they gain leadership skills: `Participate → Leader`
3. The student either studies diligently or participates actively: `Study ∨ Participate`
4. Anyone who gains leadership skills is selected as class prefect: `∀ x, Leader x → Prefect x`

**Given:** The student did not excel academically (`¬Excel`).

**Proof:**
- From premise 1 and `¬Excel`, by contraposition, the student did not study diligently (`¬Study`).
- From premise 3 (`Study ∨ Participate`) and `¬Study`, the student participates actively (`Participate`).
- From premise 2 and `Participate`, the student gains leadership skills (`Leader`).
- From premise 4 and `Leader`, the student is selected as class prefect (`Prefect`).

Thus, the student was chosen as class prefect.
