The reasoning involves general rules and a specific instance about Sarah. The premises are:

1. Practicing scales and chords daily (P) leads to improved technique (T): ∀x, P x → T x
2. Improved technique (T) leads to learning songs faster (F): ∀x, T x → F x
3. Progress requires practicing regularly (P) or listening attentively (L) (or both): ∀x, Progress x → (P x ∨ L x)

Given that Sarah cannot learn songs faster (¬F Sarah), we can derive that she did not practice (¬P Sarah) via contraposition on the first two rules. However, the third premise requires progress (Progress Sarah) to conclude P Sarah ∨ L Sarah. Without knowing if Sarah progressed, we cannot use this premise to establish L Sarah. The context does not specify that Sarah is the same as the "someone" mentioned or that she progressed. Therefore, we cannot prove that Sarah listens attentively to music.

The compilation error occurred because the `assumption` tactic was used without having the required premise in the context. The premise "Sarah is not able to learn songs faster" must be explicitly declared as an axiom. Additionally, the proof of `L Sarah` fails because the premise about progress (`Progress Sarah`) is missing.
