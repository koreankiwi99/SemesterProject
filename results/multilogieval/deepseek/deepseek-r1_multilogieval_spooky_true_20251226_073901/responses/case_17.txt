The reasoning involves proving that James joins a public speaking club given the premises and the fact that he cannot speak confidently. The key steps are:

1. **Universal implications**: 
   - If anyone practices thoroughly, they feel prepared (`∀p, PracticesThoroughly p → FeelsPrepared p`).
   - If anyone feels prepared, they speak confidently (`∀p, FeelsPrepared p → SpeakConfidently p`).
   - Combining these, if James practiced thoroughly, he would speak confidently (`PracticesThoroughly James → SpeakConfidently James`).

2. **Contradiction from fact**: 
   - James cannot speak confidently (`¬SpeakConfidently James`).
   - Thus, James cannot have practiced thoroughly (by modus tollens: `¬PracticesThoroughly James`).

3. **Disjunctive premise**: 
   - For everyone, they either practice thoroughly, join the club, or both (`∀p, PracticesThoroughly p ∨ JoinsClub p`).
   - Applying this to James: since he didn't practice thoroughly, he must have joined the club (disjunctive syllogism).

Therefore, James joins the public speaking club.

The compilation errors were due to incorrect pattern matching in the `cases` tactic and scoping issues with auxiliary lemmas. The corrected code defines all necessary predicates and axioms, then proves the theorem directly within a single proof block using the `contradiction` tactic to handle the false case.

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect pattern names in the `cases` tactic. In Lean 4, for disjunctive cases (∨), the proper patterns are `inl` and `inr` without the `Or.` prefix. The corrected code uses these patterns directly and maintains the logical flow.
