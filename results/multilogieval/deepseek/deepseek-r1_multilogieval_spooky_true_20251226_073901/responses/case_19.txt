The reasoning involves analyzing the bookstore scenario using logical propositions. The key steps are:

1. Define propositions:
   - `great_service`: Offering great customer service
   - `host_events`: Hosting author events
   - `more_customers`: More customers visit
   - `revenue_improves`: Revenue improves

2. Axioms from context:
   - `ax1`: Great service → reputation grows (not used in proof)
   - `ax2`: Host events → more customers visit
   - `ax3`: Either great service or host events
   - `ax4`: More customers → revenue improves

3. Given premise: Service quality decreased (¬great_service)

4. Proof structure:
   - From `ax3` and ¬great_service, deduce `host_events`
   - From `host_events` and `ax2`, deduce `more_customers`
   - From `more_customers` and `ax4`, deduce `revenue_improves`

The Lean proof formalizes this reasoning:

<lean>
axiom great_service : Prop
axiom host_events : Prop
axiom more_customers : Prop
axiom revenue_improves : Prop

axiom ax2 : host_events → more_customers
axiom ax3 : great_service ∨ host_events
axiom ax4 : more_customers → revenue_improves

theorem result (h_no_service : ¬great_service) : revenue_improves := by
  have h_host : host_events := by
    cases ax3 with
    | inl h_great => contradiction
    | inr h_host => exact h_host
  exact ax4 (ax2 h_host)
</lean>

The proof successfully demonstrates that revenue improves when service quality decreases.
