The context states that if a city experiences a drought, authorities must implement water restrictions and ration water usage. The given statement indicates that either water restrictions were not enforced or water rationing did not occur. To determine if the city is undergoing a drought, we formalize the premises and the statement in Lean.

We define:
- `Drought` as the proposition that the city is undergoing a drought.
- `ImplementRestrictions` as the proposition that water restrictions were implemented.
- `RationWater` as the proposition that water usage was rationed.

Premises:
1. If there is a drought, restrictions must be implemented: `Drought → ImplementRestrictions`.
2. If there is a drought, water must be rationed: `Drought → RationWater`.

Given statement: Restrictions were not implemented or water was not rationed: `¬ImplementRestrictions ∨ ¬RationWater`.

We attempt to prove `Drought` (that the city is undergoing a drought). However, the given statement `¬ImplementRestrictions ∨ ¬RationWater` implies that at least one of the necessary conditions (restrictions or rationing) is missing. If `Drought` were true, both conditions would hold by the premises, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, `Drought` cannot be true under the given premises and statement.

In Lean, we show that assuming `Drought` leads to a contradiction, proving `¬Drought`. Since we cannot construct a proof of `Drought`, the attempt to prove the city is undergoing a drought fails.

<lean>
axiom Drought : Prop
axiom ImplementRestrictions : Prop
axiom RationWater : Prop

axiom P1 : Drought → ImplementRestrictions
axiom P2 : Drought → RationWater
axiom given : ¬ImplementRestrictions ∨ ¬RationWater

-- Attempt to prove Drought fails due to contradiction
theorem drought_proof : Drought :=
  have hI : ImplementRestrictions := P1 ‹Drought›
  have hR : RationWater := P2 ‹Drought›
  match given with
  | Or.inl hNI => False.elim (hNI hI)
  | Or.inr hNR => False.elim (hNR hR)
</lean>

The proof above is incomplete and uses `‹Drought›` as an assumption, but it leads to a contradiction when combined with `given`. Since `Drought` cannot be proven from the premises and the given statement, the attempt fails.

The compilation error occurred because the proof attempted to use the assumption `Drought` without having it in the context. The proof for `drought_proof` assumed `Drought` was true to derive a contradiction, but this approach cannot prove `Drought` itself. Instead, the premises imply that `Drought` must be false. The corrected Lean code formally proves `¬Drought` (not drought), demonstrating that `Drought` cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Drought : Prop
axiom ImplementRestrictions : Prop
axiom RationWater : Prop

axiom P1 : Drought → ImplementRestrictions
axiom P2 : Drought → RationWater
axiom given : ¬ImplementRestrictions ∨ ¬RationWater

theorem not_drought : ¬Drought :=
  fun hD : Drought =>
  have hI : ImplementRestrictions := P1 hD
  have hR : RationWater := P2 hD
  match given with
  | Or.inl hNI => hNI hI
  | Or.inr hNR => hNR hR
</lean>

The proof shows that assuming `Drought` leads to a contradiction with the given disjunction (`¬ImplementRestrictions ∨ ¬RationWater`). Since `Drought` cannot be proven (and is in fact disproven), the answer is Failure.
