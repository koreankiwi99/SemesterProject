The context provides several premises about salespersons:
1. Building rapport leads to trusting relationships.
2. Effective presentations convert sales.
3. Not every salesperson builds trust or converts sales (i.e., there exists a salesperson who neither builds trust nor converts sales).
4. Perceptive salespersons build rapport.

The statement claims that Emma gives effective presentations and asks whether Emma must be perceptive. However, there is no premise linking effective presentations to perceptiveness. Emma's effective presentations imply she converts sales (by premise 2), but this doesn't require her to build rapport or be perceptive. The existential premise (3) confirms some salespersons lack trust-building or sales conversion, but this doesn't constrain Emma. Since no premise connects effective presentations to perceptiveness, Emma's perceptiveness cannot be proven from the given information.

theorem emma_perceptive : Perceptive Emma :=
  by
  -- There are no premises linking EffectivePresentations to Perceptive or BuildsRapport.
  -- We know Emma converts sales (from effective_presentations_convert and emma_effective), 
  -- but this doesn't imply she builds rapport or is perceptive.
  -- The existential in not_all_trust_or_convert doesn't provide information about Emma.
  -- Thus, we cannot prove Perceptive Emma.
  sorry -- Proof fails

-- Since the proof fails, we conclude:
