The conclusion "If Team B did not lose the game, then Team A scored more points" follows logically from the premises. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Premise 3** states: Either Team A scores more points (A_more) or Team B fumbles multiple times (B_fumble), or both.
2. **Premise 2** states: If Team B fumbles multiple times, then they lose (B_fumble → LoseB).
3. By contraposition of Premise 2: If Team B did not lose (¬LoseB), then Team B did not fumble multiple times (¬B_fumble).
4. From Premise 3 and step 3: If ¬LoseB implies ¬B_fumble, then the disjunction forces A_more to be true (since ¬B_fumble leaves only A_more as possible).

Thus, ¬LoseB → A_more holds. Premise 1 (A_more → WinA) is not needed for this deduction.

axiom A_more : Prop
axiom B_fumble : Prop
axiom LoseB : Prop
axiom P2 : B_fumble → LoseB
axiom P3 : A_more ∨ B_fumble

theorem answer : ¬ LoseB → A_more := by
  intro not_loseB
  have not_fumble : ¬ B_fumble := by
    intro h_fumble
    apply not_loseB
    exact P2 h_fumble
  cases P3 with
  | inl hA => exact hA
  | inr hB => contradiction
