The reasoning involves evaluating whether production costs increased given that sales did not increase last quarter, based on the provided context.

### Key Premises:
1. **Marketing investment (M) leads to more customers (C)**: \( M \rightarrow C \)
2. **More customers (C) lead to increased sales (S)**: \( C \rightarrow S \)
3. **Either marketing investment (M), production cost increase (P), or both occurred**: \( M \lor P \)
4. **Sales did not increase last quarter**: \( \neg S \)

### Proof Strategy:
- From premises 1 and 2, \( M \rightarrow S \) (by transitivity).
- Given \( \neg S \), we derive \( \neg M \) (contrapositive of \( M \rightarrow S \)).
- With \( \neg M \) and \( M \lor P \) (premise 3), we conclude \( P \) (disjunctive syllogism).

### Lean Formalization:
<lean>
axiom M : Prop   -- Invested in marketing
axiom C : Prop   -- Gained more customers
axiom S : Prop   -- Sales increased
axiom P : Prop   -- Production costs increased

axiom P1 : M → C
axiom P2 : C → S
axiom P3 : M ∨ P

theorem production_costs_increased (notS : ¬S) : P :=
  have notM : ¬M := fun m : M => notS (P2 (P1 m))
  Or.elim P3 (fun m => False.elim (notM m)) (fun p => p)
</lean>

### Explanation:
- **Premises**: `P1`, `P2`, and `P3` directly encode the context.
- **Theorem**: `production_costs_increased` takes `¬S` as input and proves `P`:
  1. Assume `M` leads to `C` (`P1`) and `C` leads to `S` (`P2`), so `M → S`.
  2. Given `¬S`, `M` must be false (`¬M`).
  3. With `M ∨ P` (`P3`) and `¬M`, `P` holds by case elimination.

The proof is successful, confirming that production costs increased.
