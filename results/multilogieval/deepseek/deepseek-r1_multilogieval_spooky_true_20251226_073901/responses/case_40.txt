The reasoning involves proving that James indulged in unhealthy snacks based on the given premises and the fact that he was not motivated to workout. The premises are interpreted as logical implications:

1. If James starts a new workout, he will be motivated: `StartsWorkout → Motivated`
2. If the gym closes, James cannot follow his routine: `GymCloses → CannotFollowRoutine`
3. James started a new workout or the gym closed (or both): `StartsWorkout ∨ GymCloses`
4. If James cannot follow his routine, he feels frustrated: `CannotFollowRoutine → Frustrated`
5. If James feels frustrated, he indulges in unhealthy snacks: `Frustrated → IndulgeUnhealthy`

Given that James was not motivated (`¬Motivated`), we derive:
- `¬StartsWorkout` (from contraposition of premise 1)
- `GymCloses` (from premise 3 and `¬StartsWorkout`)
- `CannotFollowRoutine` (from premise 2 and `GymCloses`)
- `Frustrated` (from premise 4 and `CannotFollowRoutine`)
- `IndulgeUnhealthy` (from premise 5 and `Frustrated`)

Thus, James indulged in unhealthy snacks.
