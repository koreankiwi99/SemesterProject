The reasoning context provides premises about transit conditions and commutes, but does not specify whether James took the subway or whether transit conditions (subway running/bus having room) hold. The key points are:

1. Premises establish conditional existence (if subway runs, *someone* takes it; if bus has room, *someone* takes it)
2. Premises link subway use to on-time arrival
3. James not taking the bus doesn't imply he took the subway
4. No premise forces James to be the person referenced in existential quantifiers
5. No premise guarantees subway/bus conditions actually hold

Thus, we cannot prove James arrived on time from the given information.

axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj

axiom SubwayRunningOnSchedule : Prop
axiom BusHasRoom : Prop
axiom TakesSubway : obj → Prop
axiom TakesBus : obj → Prop
axiom GetsToWorkOnTime : obj → Prop

axiom Premise1 : SubwayRunningOnSchedule → ∃ p, TakesSubway p
axiom Premise2 : BusHasRoom → ∃ p, TakesBus p
axiom Premise3 : (SubwayRunningOnSchedule ∨ BusHasRoom) → ∃ p, GetsToWorkOnTime p
axiom Premise4 : ∀ p, TakesSubway p → GetsToWorkOnTime p

axiom JamesNoBus : ¬ TakesBus James

-- Cannot prove James gets to work on time
theorem james_ontime : GetsToWorkOnTime James := by
  -- No information about James taking subway or transit conditions
  -- Premise3 gives existence but not specificity
  -- Premise4 requires subway use which isn't established
  sorry  -- Proof fails
