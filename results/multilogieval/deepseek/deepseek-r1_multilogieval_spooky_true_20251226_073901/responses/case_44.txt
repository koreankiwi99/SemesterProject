The reasoning involves evaluating whether Mark's garden failed to thrive given that he did not need to care for garden plants. The premises establish relationships between planting a garden, drought conditions, watering bans, plant water intake, and garden thriving. The key steps are:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - If Mark plants a garden, he must care for it (including watering).
   - A drought causes a watering ban.
   - Mark either plants a garden, experiences a drought, or both.
   - A watering ban means plants don't get enough water.
   - Insufficient water causes the garden to fail.

2. **Given Information**:
   - Mark did not need to care for garden plants (`¬NeedToCare`).

3. **Logical Deduction**:
   - Since Mark didn't need to care, he couldn't have planted a garden (otherwise, premise 1 would require care, contradicting the given).
   - Thus, the disjunction (premise 3) forces the drought case to be true.
   - Drought implies a watering ban (premise 2), which causes insufficient water (premise 4), leading to garden failure (premise 5).

The Lean code formalizes this reasoning using propositions and proves the garden failure.

<lean>
axiom PlantGarden : Prop
axiom drought : Prop
axiom watering_ban : Prop
axiom PlantsNotEnoughWater : Prop
axiom GardenFail : Prop
axiom NeedToCare : Prop

axiom P1 : PlantGarden → NeedToCare
axiom P2 : drought → watering_ban
axiom P3 : PlantGarden ∨ drought
axiom P4 : watering_ban → PlantsNotEnoughWater
axiom P5 : PlantsNotEnoughWater → GardenFail

axiom given : ¬ NeedToCare

theorem mark_garden_fail : GardenFail := by
  cases P3 with
  | inl pg => 
      have : NeedToCare := P1 pg
      contradiction
  | inr d => 
      exact P5 (P4 (P2 d))
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic requires the goal to be `False` when a contradiction is present in the context. In the original code, the goal was `GardenFail` in the `inl` branch despite having contradictory hypotheses (`NeedToCare` and `¬NeedToCare`). The fix uses `False.elim` to explicitly derive `GardenFail` from the contradiction.

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom PlantGarden : Prop
axiom drought : Prop
axiom watering_ban : Prop
axiom PlantsNotEnoughWater : Prop
axiom GardenFail : Prop
axiom NeedToCare : Prop

axiom P1 : PlantGarden → NeedToCare
axiom P2 : drought → watering_ban
axiom P3 : PlantGarden ∨ drought
axiom P4 : watering_ban → PlantsNotEnoughWater
axiom P5 : PlantsNotEnoughWater → GardenFail

axiom given : ¬ NeedToCare

theorem mark_garden_fail : GardenFail := by
  cases P3 with
  | inl pg => exact False.elim (given (P1 pg))
  | inr d => exact P5 (P4 (P2 d))
</lean>

**Proof Explanation:**  
- The disjunction `P3` (planting or drought) is case-split:
  - `inl pg` (planting case): `P1 pg` derives `NeedToCare`, contradicting `given ¬NeedToCare`. `False.elim` resolves this by deriving `GardenFail` from the contradiction.
  - `inr d` (drought case): `P2 d` → `watering_ban`, `P4` → `PlantsNotEnoughWater`, `P5` → `GardenFail`.

The proof demonstrates that Mark's garden must fail to thrive regardless of whether he plants or faces drought, given that he didn't need to care for the plants (which eliminates the planting scenario).
