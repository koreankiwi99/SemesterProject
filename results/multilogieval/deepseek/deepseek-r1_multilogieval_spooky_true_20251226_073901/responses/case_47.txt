The reasoning involves translating the given context into logical propositions and proving whether Max learned new skills based on the premises and the given fact that Max was unable to pick up the materials.

**Premises:**
1. If the package arrives on time, then the project starts: `ArrivesOnTime → StartNewProject`
2. If the store has the special order in stock, then materials can be picked up: `SpecialOrderInStock → CanPickUpMaterials`
3. Either the package arrives on time or the special order is ready (or both): `ArrivesOnTime ∨ SpecialOrderInStock`
4. If the project starts, then new skills are learned: `StartNewProject → LearnNewSkills`

**Given:** Max was unable to pick up the materials (`¬CanPickUpMaterials`)

**Goal:** Prove `LearnNewSkills`

**Proof:**
- From premise 2 and the given fact (`¬CanPickUpMaterials`), by contraposition, the special order is not in stock (`¬SpecialOrderInStock`).
- From premise 3 (`ArrivesOnTime ∨ SpecialOrderInStock`) and `¬SpecialOrderInStock`, it follows that the package arrives on time (`ArrivesOnTime`).
- From premise 1 and `ArrivesOnTime`, the project starts (`StartNewProject`).
- From premise 4 and `StartNewProject`, new skills are learned (`LearnNewSkills`).

Thus, Max learned new skills.

<lean>
axiom ArrivesOnTime : Prop
axiom SpecialOrderInStock : Prop
axiom CanPickUpMaterials : Prop
axiom StartNewProject : Prop
axiom LearnNewSkills : Prop

axiom P1 : ArrivesOnTime → StartNewProject
axiom P2 : SpecialOrderInStock → CanPickUpMaterials
axiom P3 : ArrivesOnTime ∨ SpecialOrderInStock
axiom P4 : StartNewProject → LearnNewSkills

axiom Given : ¬CanPickUpMaterials

theorem max_learned : LearnNewSkills := by
  have not_ready : ¬SpecialOrderInStock := fun h => Given (P2 h)
  have arrives : ArrivesOnTime := by
    cases P3 with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr h => contradiction
  have start : StartNewProject := P1 arrives
  exact P4 start
