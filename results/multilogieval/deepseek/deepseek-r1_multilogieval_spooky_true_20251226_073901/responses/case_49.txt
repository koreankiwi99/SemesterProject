The reasoning involves proving that the sponge was soapy given that it didn't rain recently, based on the provided premises. The steps are:

1. **Premise 1**: If the driveway is wet, it rained recently.  
   Contrapositive: If it didn't rain recently, the driveway isn't wet.  
   Given no rain, driveway is not wet.

2. **Premise 3**: Driveway is wet OR no water was used OR (wet without water).  
   Simplified: Driveway wet OR no water used (since the third case is redundant).  
   Driveway not wet (from step 1), so no water was used.

3. **Premise 2**: If car washed, water used.  
   Contrapositive: If no water used, car not washed.  
   Thus, car not washed.

4. **Premise 4**: If hose uncoiled, car washed.  
   Contrapositive: If car not washed, hose not uncoiled.  
   Thus, hose not uncoiled.

5. **Premise 5**: Hose uncoiled OR sponge soapy (or both).  
   Hose not uncoiled (from step 4), so sponge must be soapy.

Therefore, the sponge was soapy.
