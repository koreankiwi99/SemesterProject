The reasoning involves Mary, a home owner. The premises establish:
- Learning botany implies understanding plant needs.
- Understanding plant needs implies thriving plants.
- Either learn botany or seek advice (or both).

Given that Mary's plants did not thrive, she must not have understood plant needs (contrapositive of second premise). Therefore, she could not have learned botany (contrapositive of first premise). Since she must have done at least one (learn botany or seek advice), and she didn't learn botany, she must have sought advice.

The compilation errors occurred due to a typo in the theorem declaration (`themary` instead of `theorem`) and incorrect application of the predicate. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mary : obj
axiom LearnedBotany : obj → Prop
axiom UnderstandNeeds : obj → Prop
axiom GrowThrivingPlants : obj → Prop
axiom SoughtAdvice : obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, LearnedBotany x → UnderstandNeeds x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, UnderstandNeeds x → GrowThrivingPlants x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, LearnedBotany x ∨ SoughtAdvice x

-- Given fact
axiom Fact : ¬GrowThrivingPlants Mary

theorem mary_seeks_advice : SoughtAdvice Mary := by
  have no_understand : ¬UnderstandNeeds Mary := by
    intro h_understand
    have thrive : GrowThrivingPlants Mary := P2 Mary h_understand
    exact Fact thrive
  have no_botany : ¬LearnedBotany Mary := by
    intro h_botany
    have understand : UnderstandNeeds Mary := P1 Mary h_botany
    exact no_understand understand
  cases P3 Mary with
  | inl botany => exact False.elim (no_botany botany)
  | inr advice => exact advice
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes

**Explanation of Corrections:**
1. Fixed theorem declaration from `themary` to `theorem`
2. Replaced `contradiction` with explicit falsification:
   - Used `Fact thrive` to contradict `GrowThrivingPlants Mary`
   - Used `no_understand understand` to contradict `¬UnderstandNeeds Mary`
   - Used `False.elim` for the disjunction case
3. Maintained logical flow:
   - From ¬GrowThrivingPlants → ¬UnderstandNeeds (contrapositive of P2)
   - From ¬UnderstandNeeds → ¬LearnedBotany (contrapositive of P1)
   - Disjunction in P3 forces SoughtAdvice when LearnedBotany is false

The proof demonstrates that Mary must have sought advice since her plants didn't thrive and she couldn't have learned botany.
