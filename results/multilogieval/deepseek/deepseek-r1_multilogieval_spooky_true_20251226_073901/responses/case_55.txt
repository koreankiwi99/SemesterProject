The reasoning text is translated into Lean code to evaluate the statement: "If attendance at the movie was low, then is it a sequel?" The key predicates are formalized, and the proof demonstrates that low attendance implies the movie is a sequel using the provided premises.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom BuysTicket : Person → Prop
axiom PlansToSee : Person → Prop
axiom GoodReviews : Prop
axiom HighAttendance : Prop
axiom BigStar : Prop
axiom Sequel : Prop

axiom T1 : GoodReviews → HighAttendance
axiom R2 : ∀ (p : Person), BuysTicket p → PlansToSee p
axiom T3 : GoodReviews ∨ ¬ HighAttendance
axiom T4 : BigStar → GoodReviews
axiom T5 : BigStar ∨ Sequel

theorem low_attendance_implies_sequel : ¬ HighAttendance → Sequel := by
  intro h_attendance_low
  have not_good_reviews : ¬ GoodReviews := fun good_rev => h_attendance_low (T1 good_rev)
  have not_big_star : ¬ BigStar := fun big_star => not_good_reviews (T4 big_star)
  cases T5 with
  | inl big_star => contradiction
  | inr sequel => exact sequel
</lean>

The proof proceeds as follows:
1. Assume low attendance (`¬ HighAttendance`).
2. Derive `¬ GoodReviews` because good reviews would imply high attendance (premise 1), contradicting low attendance.
3. Derive `¬ BigStar` because a big star would imply good reviews (premise 4), contradicting the absence of good reviews.
4. Use premise 5 (`BigStar ∨ Sequel`): 
   - If there is a big star, it contradicts `¬ BigStar`.
   - Thus, it must be a sequel.

Premise 2 (about advance tickets) is included but unused, as it does not relate to attendance conclusions. Premise 3 (`GoodReviews ∨ ¬ HighAttendance`) holds under the low attendance assumption but is not directly needed in the proof.

The statement is proven: low attendance implies the movie is a sequel.

ANSWER: Yes
