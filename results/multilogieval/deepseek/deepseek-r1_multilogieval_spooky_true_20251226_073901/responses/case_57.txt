The reasoning involves translating the context into logical propositions and deriving the conclusion. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Premise 1**: If the store has a sale, then people buy more items.  
   - Formalized as: `Sale → BuyMore`  
   (where `BuyMore` applies to John, as the conclusion concerns him)

2. **Premise 2**: If someone goes grocery shopping, they get everything on their list.  
   - Formalized for John: `GroceryShopping → GetsEverything`

3. **Premise 3**: Either the store has a sale, or John didn't get everything, or both (sale and didn't get everything).  
   - Simplified to: `Sale ∨ ¬GetsEverything`  
   (the third disjunct is redundant as it's subsumed by the first two)

4. **Premise 4**: If it's the beginning of the month, people go grocery shopping.  
   - Formalized for John: `BeginningOfMonth → GroceryShopping`

5. **Premise 5**: Either it's the beginning of the month, or John's favorite cereal is sold out, or both.  
   - Formalized: `BeginningOfMonth ∨ SoldOut`

6. **Given**: John did not buy more items (`¬BuyMore`).  
   **Prove**: John's favorite cereal was sold out (`SoldOut`).

**Proof**:  
- From `¬BuyMore` and Premise 1 (`Sale → BuyMore`), we get `¬Sale` (modus tollens).  
- With `¬Sale` and Premise 3 (`Sale ∨ ¬GetsEverything`), we get `¬GetsEverything` (disjunctive syllogism).  
- With `¬GetsEverything` and Premise 2 (`GroceryShopping → GetsEverything`), we get `¬GroceryShopping` (modus tollens).  
- With `¬GroceryShopping` and Premise 4 (`BeginningOfMonth → GroceryShopping`), we get `¬BeginningOfMonth` (modus tollens).  
- With `¬BeginningOfMonth` and Premise 5 (`BeginningOfMonth ∨ SoldOut`), we get `SoldOut` (disjunctive syllogism).  

Thus, the conclusion follows.
