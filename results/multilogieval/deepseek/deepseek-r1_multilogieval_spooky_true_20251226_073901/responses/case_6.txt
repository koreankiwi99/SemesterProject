The reasoning involves general rules about cities and rainfall, applied specifically to Dallas. The premises establish:
1. Heavy rainfall (excessive rain) in any city causes reservoirs and dams to overflow.
2. Reservoir overflow in any city causes flooding.
Given heavy rainfall in Dallas, we derive reservoir overflow in Dallas, leading to flooding in Dallas.

<lean>
axiom City : Type
axiom Dallas : City
axiom heavy_rainfall : City → Prop
axiom reservoirs_overflow : City → Prop
axiom flooding : City → Prop

axiom rule1 : ∀ c : City, heavy_rainfall c → reservoirs_overflow c
axiom rule2 : ∀ c : City, reservoirs_overflow c → flooding c
axiom fact : heavy_rainfall Dallas

theorem dallas_flooding : flooding Dallas := by
  apply rule2 Dallas
  apply rule1 Dallas
  exact fact
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes
