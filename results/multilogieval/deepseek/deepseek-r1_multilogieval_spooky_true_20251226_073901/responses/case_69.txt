The context states a general rule preached by coaches: for any athlete, if they train hard and remain focused during competition, they will perform to the best of their ability. The specific facts about Lebron are that he remained focused during the game but did not perform to the best of his ability. The question is whether Lebron trained hard.

In Lean, we formalize the domain as `Player` (representing athletes). The predicates are:
- `trains_hard`: whether a player trains hard.
- `remains_focused`: whether a player remains focused during competition.
- `performs_best`: whether a player performs to the best of their ability.

The premises are:
1. The preached rule: ∀ players, training hard implies that if they remain focused, they perform best.
2. Lebron remained focused.
3. Lebron did not perform best.

We attempt to prove that Lebron trained hard (`trains_hard Lebron`). However, the premises lead to the opposite conclusion. If Lebron had trained hard, the rule combined with the fact that he remained focused would force him to perform best, contradicting the premise that he did not perform best. Thus, we must conclude that Lebron did not train hard. Since we cannot prove that he did train hard (the desired conclusion), the proof fails.

<lean>
axiom Player : Type
axiom Lebron : Player
axiom trains_hard : Player → Prop
axiom remains_focused : Player → Prop
axiom performs_best : Player → Prop

axiom rule : ∀ x : Player, trains_hard x → (remains_focused x → performs_best x)
axiom focused : remains_focused Lebron
axiom not_best : ¬ performs_best Lebron

theorem lebron_trained_hard : trains_hard Lebron :=
  by
    -- Attempt to prove Lebron trained hard.
    -- From the rule: if Lebron trained hard, then since he remained focused, he must perform best.
    -- But we know he did not perform best, leading to a contradiction if we assume he trained hard.
    -- However, this contradiction proves ¬trains_hard Lebron, not trains_hard Lebron.
    -- There is no positive evidence for trains_hard Lebron, so the proof fails.
    sorry  -- Proof cannot be completed.
