The natural language reasoning is translated into Lean by defining the necessary predicates and axioms. The goal is to prove whether Farmer Joe planted the tomato seeds properly based on the given premises.

Premises:
1. If tomato seeds are planted properly, then adequate sunlight and watering imply large and plentiful tomatoes.
2. Farmer Joe provided adequate sunlight and watering.
3. Farmer Joe's tomatoes did not grow large and plentiful.

The conclusion to prove is that Farmer Joe planted the tomato seeds properly (i.e., `PlantProperly Joe`). However, the premises lead to a contradiction if we assume proper planting, as shown in the Lean code. Specifically:
- Assuming `PlantProperly Joe` (using `hPlant`).
- Applying the general rule (axiom `A1`) gives `AdequateSunWater Joe → GrowWell Joe`.
- With `A2` (adequate sunlight and watering), we derive `GrowWell Joe`.
- But `A3` states `¬ GrowWell Joe`, leading to a contradiction.

This proves that `PlantProperly Joe` must be false (i.e., `¬ PlantProperly Joe`). However, the task requires proving the *positive* conclusion (`PlantProperly Joe`). Since we cannot prove `PlantProperly Joe` (only its negation), the proof for the positive conclusion fails.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because `intro` was used incorrectly. The goal was `PlantProperly Joe`, a simple proposition, not an implication. Since no axioms directly support `PlantProperly Joe`, and attempting to derive it leads to a contradiction (as shown in the comments), the proof fails.

Corrected Lean code:
<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Joe : obj
axiom PlantProperly : obj → Prop
axiom AdequateSunWater : obj → Prop
axiom GrowWell : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, PlantProperly x → (AdequateSunWater x → GrowWell x)
axiom A2 : AdequateSunWater Joe
axiom A3 : ¬ GrowWell Joe

theorem planted_properly : PlantProperly Joe := by
  -- Attempt to apply axiom A1: requires PlantProperly Joe as premise (circular)
  apply A1 Joe   -- Now requires proof of PlantProperly Joe
  · exact ?h     -- No evidence for PlantProperly Joe
  · exact A2     -- AdequateSunWater Joe is known
  -- Stuck: cannot prove PlantProperly Joe
  sorry          -- Admission of failure
</lean>

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `apply` tactic was misused. The axiom `A1 Joe` has type `PlantProperly Joe → (AdequateSunWater Joe → GrowWell Joe)`, which cannot be applied to prove `PlantProperly Joe` since it requires `PlantProperly Joe` as a premise. 

After careful analysis:
1. The premises allow us to derive `¬PlantProperly Joe` through modus tollens
2. There are no premises that directly support `PlantProperly Joe`
3. Attempting to prove `PlantProperly Joe` leads to contradiction with axiom `A3`

Therefore, the positive statement "Farmer Joe planted tomato seeds properly" cannot be proven from the given premises.

Corrected Lean code:
<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Joe : obj
axiom PlantProperly : obj → Prop
axiom AdequateSunWater : obj → Prop
axiom GrowWell : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, PlantProperly x → (AdequateSunWater x → GrowWell x)
axiom A2 : AdequateSunWater Joe
axiom A3 : ¬ GrowWell Joe

theorem planted_properly : PlantProperly Joe := by
  -- No axioms provide direct evidence for PlantProperly Joe
  -- Attempting to use A1 requires PlantProperly Joe as input
  -- No other tactics can construct proof of PlantProperly Joe
  sorry  -- Proof failure
