The reasoning involves proving that if Alex got sunburnt, then the weather was sunny. Given the premises, including that it was sunny, the implication holds trivially since the weather being sunny is already established.

<lean>
axiom Sunny : Prop
axiom Warm : Prop
axiom Swimming : Prop
axiom Exercise : Prop
axiom ApplySunscreen : Prop
axiom Sunburnt : Prop

-- Premises
axiom T1 : Sunny  -- "It was a sunny day"
axiom R1 : ApplySunscreen → ¬ Sunburnt  -- If applied sunscreen, not burnt
axiom R2 : Swimming → Exercise          -- Swimming implies exercise
axiom R3 : ApplySunscreen ∨ ¬ Exercise  -- Applied sunscreen or no exercise
axiom R4 : Warm → Swimming              -- Warm water implies swimming
axiom R5 : Sunny → Warm                 -- Sunny implies warm water

-- Prove: Sunburnt → Sunny
theorem sunburnt_implies_sunny : Sunburnt → Sunny :=
  fun _ => T1  -- Sunny is true regardless of Sunburnt
</lean>
