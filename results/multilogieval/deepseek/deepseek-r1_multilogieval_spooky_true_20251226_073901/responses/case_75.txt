ITERATION 2

The compilation errors occurred because the variables were declared with parameters, leading to mismatches in function applications. Specifically, `LizCar` was treated as a function rather than a type, and predicates like `QualityParts` were not properly recognized. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Car : Type
axiom lizCar : Car
axiom PreventiveMaintenance : Car → Prop
axiom QualityParts : Car → Prop
axiom LongServiceLife : Car → Prop

axiom premise : ∀ c : Car, PreventiveMaintenance c → QualityParts c → LongServiceLife c
axiom used_quality_parts : QualityParts lizCar
axiom not_long_life : ¬ LongServiceLife lizCar

theorem no_preventive_maintenance : ¬ PreventiveMaintenance lizCar := by
  intro h  -- Assume preventive maintenance was done
  have H : LongServiceLife lizCar := premise lizCar h used_quality_parts
  exact not_long_life H  -- Contradiction
</lean>

**Explanation of Corrections:**
1. **Fixed Type Declaration**: Declared `Car` as a standalone type (not parameterized)
2. **Explicit Constants**: Defined `lizCar` as a concrete car instance
3. **Direct Predicates**: Declared predicates directly on `Car` type
4. **Simplified Axioms**: Used non-quantified axioms for Liz's specific car
5. **Premise Application**: Used the implication directly (`premise lizCar h used_quality_parts`) to derive the contradiction

The proof shows that assuming preventive maintenance was done leads to a contradiction with the given facts, proving preventive maintenance was **not** done.
