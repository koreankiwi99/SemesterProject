The reasoning context is translated into Lean axioms. The statement to evaluate is a conditional: if James did not play well, then he was a top player in youth leagues. After formalizing the premises and attempting to prove this conditional, it becomes clear that the premises lead to the opposite conclusion: if James did not play well, then he was *not* a top player in youth leagues. This is derived through the following steps:

1. If James did not play well (assumption), then by axiom R1, he did not practice hard.
2. By axiom R3 (either practiced hard or not talented), since he did not practice hard, he is not talented.
3. By axiom R2 (if picked to start then talented), since he is not talented, he was not picked to start.
4. By axiom R4 (if natural ability then picked to start), since not picked to start, he has no natural ability.
5. By axiom R5 (if top player in youth leagues then natural ability), since no natural ability, he was not a top player.

Thus, the conditional "if James did not play well, then he was a top player" cannot be proven from the premises. Instead, the negation holds. Therefore, the proof attempt fails.

The compilation error occurred because the `no_talent` proof incorrectly attempted to use a disjunction case analysis without properly handling the function type requirement for `¬Talented James`. The corrected proof constructs a function that takes evidence of talent and derives a contradiction through case analysis of axiom R3.

However, after correctly formalizing the premises and attempting to prove the goal "If James did not play well, then he was a top player in youth leagues" (`¬PlayWell James → TopPlayerYouth James`), we find:
1. From `¬PlayWell James` and R1, we derive `¬PracticeHard James`
2. From R3 (`PracticeHard ∨ ¬Talented`), we derive `¬Talented James`
3. Through R2 and R4, we get `¬NaturalAbility James`
4. Via R5, this implies `¬TopPlayerYouth James`

The proof requires `TopPlayerYouth James` but derives its negation. Since no contradiction exists between the derived negation and the premises, the goal cannot be proven.
