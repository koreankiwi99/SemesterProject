The reasoning involves evaluating whether the statement "If John's muscles are not sore today, then it rained" follows from the given premises. The Lean formalization captures the propositions and premises, but the proof attempt shows that assuming no soreness leads to the conclusion that it did not rain, not that it rained. This contradiction means the desired implication cannot be proven.

The compilation error occurred because in the `inl` branch of the disjunction `P3`, we had `hh : hard` and needed to produce `¬relaxed` (which is `relaxed → False`). However, `nh hh` directly gives `False`, not a function. The fix involves wrapping `nh hh` in a function that ignores its argument to match the required type.

<lean>
axiom raining : Prop
axiom cold : Prop
axiom shower : Prop
axiom hard : Prop
axiom sore : Prop
axiom relaxed : Prop

axiom P1 : hard → sore
axiom P2 : shower → relaxed
axiom P3 : hard ∨ ¬relaxed
axiom P4 : cold → shower
axiom P5 : raining → cold

theorem not_sore_implies_raining : ¬sore → raining :=
fun h : ¬sore =>
  have nh : ¬hard := fun hh : hard => h (P1 hh)
  have nrelaxed : ¬relaxed := by
    cases P3 with
    | inl hh => exact (fun _ => nh hh)  -- Fixed: converts `False` to `¬relaxed`
    | inr nr => exact nr
  have nshower : ¬shower := fun s : shower => nrelaxed (P2 s)
  have ncold : ¬cold := fun c : cold => nshower (P4 c)
  have nraining : ¬raining := fun r : raining => ncold (P5 r)
  -- Cannot prove `raining`; derived `¬raining` instead
  sorry  -- Proof stuck here
</lean>

**Analysis**:  
Assuming `¬sore` leads to:  
1. `¬hard` (from P1)  
2. `¬relaxed` (from P3 and ¬hard)  
3. `¬shower` (from P2 and ¬relaxed)  
4. `¬cold` (from P4 and ¬shower)  
5. `¬raining` (from P5 and ¬cold)  

This proves `¬sore → ¬raining`, which **contradicts** the desired conclusion `¬sore → raining`. Since the premises imply the opposite of the conclusion, the statement cannot be proven.
