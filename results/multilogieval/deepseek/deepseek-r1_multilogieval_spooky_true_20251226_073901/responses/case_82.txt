The reasoning involves translating the premises into Lean and attempting to prove the conclusion. The key challenge is the lack of a direct link between "peaches are in season" and "ripe peaches at the market," which prevents proving that the house feels homey and cozy when James does not celebrate.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person
axiom PeachesInSeason : Prop
axiom RipePeaches : Prop
axiom BakePie : Person → Prop
axiom WinContest : Person → Prop
axiom Celebrate : Person → Prop
axiom HouseSmellAmazing : Prop
axiom HouseHomeyCozy : Prop

axiom P1 : RipePeaches → ∃ p : Person, BakePie p
axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, WinContest p → Celebrate p
axiom P3 : PeachesInSeason ∨ (∃ p : Person, WinContest p)
axiom P4 : (∃ p : Person, BakePie p) → HouseSmellAmazing
axiom P5 : HouseSmellAmazing → HouseHomeyCozy

theorem target : ¬ Celebrate James → HouseHomeyCozy :=
  fun h_noCelebrateJames => 
  have noWinJames : ¬ WinContest James := 
    fun h_winJames => h_noCelebrateJames (P2 James h_winJames)
  match P3 with
  | Or.inl h_season => 
    -- Cannot derive RipePeaches from PeachesInSeason → stuck
    sorry
  | Or.inr h_winner => 
    let ⟨winner, h_win⟩ := h_winner
    -- If winner is James, contradicts noWinJames; else, Celebrate winner irrelevant
    have h_winner_not_james : winner ≠ James := 
      fun h_eq => noWinJames (h_eq ▸ h_win)
    -- No premise links WinContest to RipePeaches → stuck
    sorry
</lean>

The proof fails because:
1. Premise 3 provides "peaches in season OR someone won a contest," but:
   - "Peaches in season" does not imply "ripe peaches" (Premise 1 requires ripe peaches for baking).
   - A contest winner (even if not James) does not trigger baking (no link between winning and ripe peaches).
2. Without ripe peaches, baking cannot occur, preventing the smell/cozy chain (Premises 4-5).
3. James not celebrating only negates James winning (via Premise 2), but doesn't force peaches or baking.

Thus, the conditional conclusion cannot be proven from the premises.

ANSWER: Failure
