The reasoning involves proving that if it was sunny, then the team held their heads up high, based on the given premises. The proof proceeds as follows:

1. Assume it was sunny (to prove the implication).
2. From premise 2, sunny implies children play at the park, so children played at the park.
3. Premise 3 states that either the team practiced daily or children did not play at the park.
4. Since children played at the park (step 2), the team must have practiced daily (by disjunctive syllogism).
5. Premise 1 states that practicing daily implies being prepared, so the team was prepared.
6. Premise 4 states that being prepared implies confidence, so the team was confident.
7. Premise 5 states that confidence implies holding heads high, so the team held their heads high.

Thus, sunny implies the team held their heads high.
