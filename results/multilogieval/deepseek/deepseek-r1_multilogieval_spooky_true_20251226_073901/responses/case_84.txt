The reasoning involves evaluating whether Sarah's creativity flourished given that she did not release an album. The context provides several premises about the musician's actions and their consequences. However, the connection between releasing an album and the conditions for creativity flourishing is not fully established.

- **Premises**:
  1. Practicing new melodies daily expands repertoire: `P → R`
  2. Expanded repertoire leads to more material: `R → M`
  3. More material enables composing an album: `M → A`
  4. Thus, practicing leads to composing an album: `P → A` (derived from 1-3)
  5. The musician either practiced, jammed, or both: `P ∨ J`
  6. Jamming provides inspiration: `J → I`
  7. Inspiration leads to creativity flourishing: `I → C`
  8. Releasing an album requires composing it: `Released → A` (assumed as necessary step)

- **Statement to evaluate**: `¬Released → C`

- **Analysis**:
  - Given `¬Released`, we cannot conclude `¬A` (since composing does not guarantee releasing).
  - Case 1: If `¬A` (no composition), then `¬P` (from `P → A` contrapositive). From `P ∨ J` and `¬P`, we get `J`, leading to `I` and `C`.
  - Case 2: If `A` (composition occurred), then `P` must be true (only path to `A`). However, `P` alone does not require `J` (from `P ∨ J`). Without `J`, there is no inspiration (`I`) or creativity flourishing (`C`).
  - Thus, when `¬Released` and `A` hold but `J` is false, `C` is false. This scenario is possible under the premises.

Since `¬Released` does not universally imply `C`, the statement cannot be proven.
