The reasoning involves proving that if pests invade the field, the farmer makes good profit. The key insight is from the disjunction: "Either the farmer watered adequately, or pests did not damage crops, or the field got enough water but pests damaged crops." When pests invade, crops are destroyed (by premise 2). This forces the disjunction to imply that the field had enough water (since the other options become contradictory or still require enough water). With enough water, crops grow well (premise 1), leading to a bountiful harvest (premise 4) and good profit (premise 5).

<lean>
axiom EnoughWater : Prop
axiom PestsInvade : Prop
axiom CropsDestroyed : Prop
axiom GrowWell : Prop
axiom Bountiful : Prop
axiom GoodProfit : Prop

axiom P1 : EnoughWater → GrowWell
axiom P2 : PestsInvade → CropsDestroyed
axiom P3 : EnoughWater ∨ ¬CropsDestroyed ∨ (EnoughWater ∧ CropsDestroyed)
axiom P4 : GrowWell → Bountiful
axiom P5 : Bountiful → GoodProfit

theorem answer : PestsInvade → GoodProfit :=
fun hInvade =>
  have hCD : CropsDestroyed := P2 hInvade
  have hWater : EnoughWater := by
    cases P3 with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr h => cases h with
      | inl notCD => contradiction
      | inr h3 => exact h3.1
  have hGrow : GrowWell := P1 hWater
  have hBountiful : Bountiful := P4 hGrow
  show GoodProfit from P5 hBountiful
