The reasoning involves proving that if the star player is injured, the team will celebrate with a team dinner. The premises are translated into logical propositions, and the proof proceeds as follows:

1. **Premises**:
   - `P → Prep`: If the team practices hard, they are prepared.
   - `I → ¬Play`: If injured, the star player cannot play (though `Play` is unused).
   - `P ∨ ¬I`: Either the team practiced hard or the star player is not injured.
   - `Prep → Win`: If prepared, the team wins.
   - `Win → C`: If they win, they celebrate.

2. **Proof of `I → C`**:
   - Assume `I` (star player injured).
   - From `P ∨ ¬I`, since `I` is true, `¬I` is false, so `P` must be true (by case analysis).
   - From `P → Prep`, `Prep` holds.
   - From `Prep → Win`, `Win` holds.
   - From `Win → C`, `C` holds (team celebrates).

Thus, `I → C` is proven. The unused premise about playing does not affect the conclusion.

The compilation errors occurred due to improper declaration of variables and the use of `variable` instead of `axiom` for propositional constants. The `contradiction` tactic failed because the disjunction case analysis wasn't properly handling the negation. 

The corrected approach:
1. Declares all propositions as axioms
2. Uses explicit case analysis with named cases
3. Handles the contradiction case by applying `notI` to `hI`
4. Maintains the logical chain: Injury → Practice → Prepared → Win → Celebrate

Here's the fixed Lean code:

<lean>
axiom P : Prop -- team practices hard
axiom I : Prop -- star player injured
axiom Play : Prop -- star player plays (unused)
axiom Prep : Prop -- team prepared
axiom Win : Prop -- team wins
axiom C : Prop -- team celebrates

axiom practice_prep : P → Prep
axiom injured_no_play : I → ¬ Play
axiom practice_or_not_injured : P ∨ ¬I
axiom prep_win : Prep → Win
axiom win_celebrate : Win → C

theorem injured_celebrate : I → C :=
fun hI : I =>
have hP : P := by 
  cases practice_or_not_injured with
  | inl h => exact h
  | inr notI => exact False.elim (notI hI)
have hPrep : Prep := practice_prep hP
have hWin : Win := prep_win hPrep
win_celebrate hWin
</lean>
