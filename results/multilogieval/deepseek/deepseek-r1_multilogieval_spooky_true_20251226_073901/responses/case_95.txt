The reasoning shows that if Mary did not meet her friends for dinner (¬M), it leads to an exciting night (X) through the following steps:  
1. ¬M implies ¬E (by contraposition of premise 2: E → M)  
2. ¬E and C ∨ E (premise 3) imply C  
3. C implies G (premise 1: C → G)  
4. G implies F (premise 4: G → F)  
5. F implies X (premise 5: F → X)  

Thus, ¬M → X is provable from the premises.

axiom C : Prop -- weather clears up
axiom E : Prop -- Mary finishes errands
axiom G : Prop -- baseball game goes on
axiom M : Prop -- Mary meets friends for dinner
axiom F : Prop -- fans cheer
axiom X : Prop -- exciting night

-- Premises
axiom P1 : C → G
axiom P2 : E → M
axiom P3 : C ∨ E
axiom P4 : G → F
axiom P5 : F → X

-- Prove: If Mary didn't meet friends (¬M), then it was exciting (X)
theorem result : ¬M → X :=
  fun hnm : ¬M =>
  have hne : ¬E := fun he => hnm (P2 he) -- ¬M → ¬E (contraposition)
  have hc : C := Or.elim P3 
    (fun c => c) 
    (fun e => absurd e hne) -- C ∨ E and ¬E imply C
  have hg : G := P1 hc -- C → G
  have hf : F := P4 hg -- G → F
  show X from P5 hf -- F → X
