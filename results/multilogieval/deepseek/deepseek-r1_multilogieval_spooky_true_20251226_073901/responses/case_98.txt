axiom PracticeHard : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop
axiom VeryHot : Prop
axiom Postponed : Prop
axiom PlayWell : Prop
axiom Win : Prop

axiom T1 : PracticeHard → Prepared
axiom T2 : VeryHot → Postponed
axiom T3 : PracticeHard ∨ ¬Postponed
axiom T4 : Prepared → PlayWell
axiom T5 : PlayWell → Win

theorem answer : VeryHot → Win := by
  intro hVeryHot
  have postponed : Postponed := T2 hVeryHot
  cases T3
  case inl ph => 
    have prepared : Prepared := T1 ph
    have playWell : PlayWell := T4 prepared
    exact T5 playWell
  case inr np => 
    contradiction
