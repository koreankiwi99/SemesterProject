The reasoning involves evaluating whether, given the premises, we can prove that if the Lakers did not limit inside scoring, then they did not force many turnovers (i.e., the answer to the question is "No"). The premises are:
1. Strong perimeter defense forces many turnovers: \( P \to T \)
2. Protecting the paint limits inside scoring: \( B \to L \)
3. Either perimeter defense is strong or the paint is protected (or both): \( P \lor B \)

We aim to prove the negation: that under \(\neg L\), we have \(\neg T\). However, assuming \(\neg L\):
- From \( B \to L \) and \(\neg L\), by modus tollens, we get \(\neg B\).
- From \( P \lor B \) and \(\neg B\), we get \( P \).
- From \( P \) and \( P \to T \), we get \( T \).

Thus, \(\neg L\) implies \( T \), meaning if inside scoring was not limited, turnovers were forced. Therefore, we cannot prove that turnovers were not forced (\(\neg T\)) under \(\neg L\). The attempt to prove the negation fails.
