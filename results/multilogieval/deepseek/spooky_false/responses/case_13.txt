The context provides premises about the restaurant and the owner's beliefs, but does not include any information connecting positive reviews to long lines forming. The statement confirms the restaurant uses fresh, organic ingredients, leading to positive reviews (via the owner's beliefs). However, there is no premise stating that positive reviews cause long lines, nor any premise that would directly prevent long lines from forming. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that long lines did not form (¬LongLines R).

axiom obj : Type
axiom R : obj
axiom AdvertisesFreshOrganic : obj → Prop
axiom UsesFreshOrganic : obj → Prop
axiom TastesAmazing : obj → Prop
axiom PositiveReviewsSpread : obj → Prop
axiom LongLines : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : AdvertisesFreshOrganic R
axiom OwnerBelief1 : ∀ x : obj, UsesFreshOrganic x → TastesAmazing x
axiom OwnerBelief2 : ∀ x : obj, TastesAmazing x → PositiveReviewsSpread x
axiom A2 : UsesFreshOrganic R

theorem positive_reviews : PositiveReviewsSpread R := 
  OwnerBelief2 R (OwnerBelief1 R A2)

-- Attempt to prove ¬LongLines R fails due to missing premises
-- No axiom links PositiveReviewsSpread to LongLines (or negation)

ANSWER: Failure
