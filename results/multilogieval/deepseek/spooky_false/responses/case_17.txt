The reasoning involves translating the natural language statements into logical propositions and attempting to prove that James does not join the public speaking club (¬C James) given that he cannot speak confidently (¬R James). The premises are:

1. If someone practices thoroughly (P), they feel prepared (Q): ∀x, P x → Q x
2. If someone feels prepared (Q), they speak confidently (R): ∀x, Q x → R x
3. Someone either practices thoroughly or joins a club (C) or both: ∀x, P x ∨ C x (equivalent to ∀x, P x ∨ C x since "both" is redundant in disjunction)

Given ¬R James, we derive:
- ¬Q James (from ¬R James and ∀x, Q x → R x)
- ¬P James (from ¬Q James and ∀x, P x → Q x)

From ∀x, P x ∨ C x and ¬P James, we deduce C James. Thus, we prove that James joins the club, making it impossible to prove ¬C James.

axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj
axiom P : obj → Prop   -- practices thoroughly
axiom Q : obj → Prop   -- feels prepared
axiom R : obj → Prop   -- speaks confidently
axiom C : obj → Prop   -- joins a public speaking club

axiom A1 : ∀ x, P x → Q x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Q x → R x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, P x ∨ C x

axiom James_not_confident : ¬ R James

theorem must_join : C James := by
  have no_Q : ¬ Q James := fun hQ => James_not_confident (A2 James hQ)
  have no_P : ¬ P James := fun hP => no_Q (A1 James hP)
  cases A3 James with
  | inl hP => contradiction
  | inr hC => exact hC

-- Attempt to prove ¬C James fails since we proved C James

ANSWER: Failure
