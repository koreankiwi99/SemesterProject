The reasoning involves evaluating whether the grass and plants were watered naturally given that the weather was very hot. The premises are:
1. If it rains, the grass and plants are watered naturally.
2. If the weather is very hot, children play in sprinklers.
3. Either it rained today or the children did not play in sprinklers.

Assuming the weather was very hot:
- From premise 2, children played in sprinklers.
- From premise 3, since children played in sprinklers (making the second disjunct false), it must have rained.
- From premise 1, since it rained, the grass and plants were watered naturally.

Thus, the grass and plants were watered naturally. The negation (that they were not watered naturally) cannot be proven.

The compilation errors occurred because `have` statements were used outside a theorem proof context. The corrected Lean code structures the proof properly within a theorem.

In this problem, we aim to prove that "the grass and plants did NOT get watered naturally today" (i.e., ¬W) is true. However, the premises and given condition (hot weather) lead to a proof that the plants *were* watered (W). Therefore, we cannot prove ¬W.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type

axiom R : Prop -- It rained today
axiom W : Prop -- Grass and plants were watered naturally
axiom H : Prop -- Weather was very hot
axiom S : Prop -- Children played in sprinklers

axiom P1 : R → W           -- Rain causes natural watering
axiom P2 : H → S           -- Hot weather causes sprinkler play
axiom P3 : R ∨ ¬S          -- Either rained or no sprinkler play
axiom hot_today : H        -- Given: weather was very hot

theorem not_negW : ¬(¬W) := by
  have s : S := P2 hot_today  -- Hot weather implies sprinklers were played
  cases P3 with
  | inl r => 
      have w : W := P1 r      -- Rain implies watering
      intro nw
      exact nw w
  | inr not_s => 
      have contra : False := not_s s  -- Contradiction: sprinklers played vs. not_s
      contradiction
