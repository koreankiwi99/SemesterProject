The premises state that if a city experiences a drought, authorities should implement water restrictions and ration water usage. However, the word "should" indicates a normative statement about what ought to happen, not necessarily what actually happens. The disjunction provided ("either the city did not enforce water limits, or it did not ration water usage") refers to actual events, not normative requirements. There is no axiom linking the normative "should" to actual implementation. Therefore, the absence of enforcement or rationing does not logically imply the absence of a drought, as authorities might fail to act as they should. Consequently, it is impossible to prove that the city is not undergoing a drought from the given premises and disjunction.

<lean>
axiom Drought : Prop
axiom ShouldImplementRestrictions : Prop
axiom RequireRation : Prop
axiom ImplementedRestrictions : Prop
axiom Rationed : Prop
axiom P1 : Drought → ShouldImplementRestrictions
axiom P2 : Drought → RequireRation
axiom Disjunction : ¬ImplementedRestrictions ∨ ¬Rationed

-- Attempt to prove ¬Drought
theorem not_drought : ¬Drought :=
  fun hD : Drought =>
  have sh : ShouldImplementRestrictions := P1 hD
  have rr : RequireRation := P2 hD
  -- Cannot connect normative predicates (ShouldImplementRestrictions, RequireRation) 
  -- to actual events (ImplementedRestrictions, Rationed) to derive a contradiction.
  -- Disjunction provides no link to normative predicates.
  sorry -- Proof fails
