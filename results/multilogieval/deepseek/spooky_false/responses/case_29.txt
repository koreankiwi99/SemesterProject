The reasoning involves translating the natural language context into logical predicates and attempting to prove that Ty did not suspect identity theft (¬SIT Ty) from the given premises. The premises are:

1. If someone suspects identity theft, they should check their credit report: ∀x, SIT x → CCR x
2. If fraud is suspected, they should contact their bank: ∀x, FraudSuspected x → CB x

The statement to evaluate is: Either Ty did not verify his credit report or did not get in touch with his bank: ¬CCR Ty ∨ ¬CB Ty

The goal is to prove ¬SIT Ty. However, the proof fails because:
- Premise 1 links identity theft suspicion to checking credit reports.
- Premise 2 links fraud suspicion to contacting the bank, but identity theft is not explicitly defined as fraud in the context.
- The disjunction (¬CCR Ty ∨ ¬CB Ty) does not provide enough information: if ¬CCR Ty holds, it contradicts SIT Ty via Premise 1, but if ¬CB Ty holds, there is no link to identity theft suspicion without assuming identity theft implies fraud (which is not stated).

Thus, the proof cannot be completed due to the missing connection between identity theft and fraud.
