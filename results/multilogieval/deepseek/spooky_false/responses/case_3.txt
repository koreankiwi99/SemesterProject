The aim is to prove that if Team B did not lose the game, then Team A did not score more points. However, the premises lead to the opposite conclusion. Specifically:

- Premise: If Team A scores more points, they win (but this does not specify that winning requires scoring more).
- Premise: If Team B fumbles multiple times, they lose.
- Premise: Either Team A scores more points or Team B fumbles multiple times (or both).
- Given: Team B did not lose.

From these, we derive:
1. Since Team B did not lose, it follows that Team B did not fumble multiple times (by contraposition of the second premise).
2. Using the disjunction (third premise), if Team B did not fumble, then Team A must have scored more points.

Thus, under the given condition that Team B did not lose, Team A must have scored more points. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that Team A did not score more points. Attempting to do so results in a failure.

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the term `or_elim` was applied to two arguments (`notBfumble` and `a`), but `or_elim` was defined as a function taking only one argument (¬FumbleMultiple TeamB) and returning ScoreMore TeamA. Applying it to two arguments is invalid. More importantly, the proof strategy was flawed because no contradiction exists in the case where Team A scores more points.

After correcting the code, we see:
- Under the assumption that Team B did not lose (¬Lose TeamB), we derive ¬FumbleMultiple TeamB
- From the disjunction (P3) and ¬FumbleMultiple TeamB, we derive ScoreMore TeamA
- When attempting to prove ¬ScoreMore TeamA under ¬Lose TeamB, we assume ScoreMore TeamA but find no contradiction since the premises actually imply ScoreMore TeamA in this scenario

The branch where Team A scores more points (Or.inl) yields no contradiction, making the proof impossible to complete. Therefore, we cannot prove that "If Team B did not lose, then Team A did not score more points."
