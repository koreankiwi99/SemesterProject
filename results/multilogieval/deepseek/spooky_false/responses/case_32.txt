The reasoning involves translating the natural language context into logical predicates and then attempting to prove the negation of the statement "Jane values wellness" given the premises. The key steps are:

1. **Formalizing the context**:
   - `obj` represents citizens.
   - Predicates: `ExercisesRegularly`, `Fit`, `EatsNutritious`, `Energetic`, `ValuesWellness`.
   - Premises:
     - Regular exercise leads to fitness: `∀x, ExercisesRegularly x → Fit x`
     - Nutritious eating leads to energy: `∀x, EatsNutritious x → Energetic x`
     - Not everyone is fit or energetic: `∃x, ¬Fit x ∧ ¬Energetic x`
     - Valuing wellness implies regular exercise: `∀x, ValuesWellness x → ExercisesRegularly x`
   - Additional fact: Jane eats nutritious foods (`EatsNutritious Jane`).

2. **Deriving the mayor's conclusion**:
   - From `∃x, ¬Fit x ∧ ¬Energetic x`, using contraposition on the implications, we prove there exists someone who doesn't exercise or doesn't eat well: `∃x, ¬ExercisesRegularly x ∨ ¬EatsNutritious x`.

3. **Evaluating Jane's case**:
   - Jane eats nutritious foods, so she is energetic (by `∀x, EatsNutritious x → Energetic x`).
   - To prove Jane does **not** value wellness (`¬ValuesWellness Jane`), we would need to show she doesn't exercise regularly (since `ValuesWellness Jane → ExercisesRegularly Jane`).
   - However, no premise links eating habits to exercise habits or wellness valuation. Jane's eating habits do not constrain her exercise behavior.
   - The existential premise only confirms some citizen lacks fitness/energy, but Jane's energy means she isn't that citizen.
   - Thus, we cannot prove `¬ExercisesRegularly Jane`, and consequently cannot prove `¬ValuesWellness Jane`.

Since the negation cannot be proven from the premises, the result is "Failure".
