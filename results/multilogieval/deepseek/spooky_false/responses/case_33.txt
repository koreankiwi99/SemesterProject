The Lean code attempts to prove ¬OneWithNature Bob. However, the proof requires knowing that Bob is aware (Aware Bob) to apply T4. Since the context does not provide Bob's awareness status, we cannot complete the proof. The 'sorry' indicates an unprovable step. Therefore, we cannot prove the negation.
