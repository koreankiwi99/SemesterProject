The context establishes that professors at the university were neither experts nor recognized leaders. Publishing research would make them experts, and collaborating would make them recognized leaders. However, the context states that either research was not published or collaborations did not happen. Additionally, curiosity leads to publishing research.

Given that Dr. Lee collaborates with top scholars, this implies recognition as a leader. However, the context states no professor is a recognized leader, creating a contradiction. Despite this, the context alone (without considering Dr. Lee's collaboration) implies no professor published research (since publishing would make them an expert, but no professor is an expert). Since curiosity leads to publishing, no professor is curious. Therefore, Dr. Lee cannot be curious.

The compilation errors occurred because the axioms were applied incorrectly in term mode. The corrected code uses tactic mode with proper structuring and introduces the `IsProfessor` predicate to accurately reflect the context. The proof demonstrates that Dr. Lee cannot be curious due to a contradiction derived from the premises.

ITERATION 3

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect axiom formatting and missing type annotations in the `have` statements. The axioms were improperly structured with parentheses around implications, causing parsing issues. Additionally, the `have` statements lacked explicit type declarations, leading to inference failures. The corrected code removes unnecessary parentheses from axioms and adds explicit type annotations to all `have` statements.
