The premises state that if a person finds their account hacked, they must reset their password, and if they detect unauthorized access, they should notify their bank. The given statement indicates that Lucy either did not reset her password or notified her bank. To answer whether Lucy's account was hacked, we attempt to prove that it was *not* hacked (the negation).

In Lean, we formalize the scenario with predicates for hacking, password reset, unauthorized access, and bank notification. The premises are:
1. If hacked, then reset password.
2. If unauthorized access detected, then notify bank.
The given statement is: ¬ResetPassword(lucy) ∨ NotifyBank(lucy).

We try to prove ¬Hacked(lucy). Assuming Hacked(lucy), Premise 1 implies ResetPassword(lucy). The given statement then reduces to NotifyBank(lucy) (since ¬ResetPassword(lucy) is false). However, NotifyBank(lucy) does not contradict any premise, as there is no axiom linking hacking directly to unauthorized access detection or requiring bank notification specifically for hacking. Thus, no contradiction arises, and we cannot prove ¬Hacked(lucy).

axiom Person : Type
axiom lucy : Person
axiom Hacked : Person → Prop
axiom ResetPassword : Person → Prop
axiom UnauthorizedAccess : Person → Prop
axiom NotifyBank : Person → Prop

axiom Premise1 : ∀ (p : Person), Hacked p → ResetPassword p
axiom Premise2 : ∀ (p : Person), UnauthorizedAccess p → NotifyBank p
axiom GivenStatement : ¬ ResetPassword lucy ∨ NotifyBank lucy

theorem prove_negation : ¬ Hacked lucy :=
  fun h : Hacked lucy =>
  have reset : ResetPassword lucy := Premise1 lucy h
  have : ¬ ResetPassword lucy ∨ NotifyBank lucy := GivenStatement
  have bank_notify : NotifyBank lucy := by
    cases this with
    | inl not_reset => exact False.elim (not_reset reset)
    | inr notify => exact notify
  -- No contradiction: NotifyBank lucy does not violate any premise.
  -- Cannot derive False without additional links (e.g., Hacked → UnauthorizedAccess).
  sorry  -- Proof fails here
