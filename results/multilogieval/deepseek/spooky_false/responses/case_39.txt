The reasoning involves translating the natural language context into logical axioms and attempting to prove that if there was no quiz, then Alex is not good at math. The context provides premises about a specific person (referred to as "someone") and general rules, but does not link Alex to this person. The key premises are:

1. If it is Monday, there is a quiz (`monday → quiz`).
2. Doing well on the quiz implies studying hard for the specific person (`wellOnQuiz P → studiedHard P`).
3. Either it is Monday, or the specific person did not study hard (`monday ∨ ¬studiedHard P`).
4. A general rule: Being good at math implies doing well on quizzes (`∀ p, goodAtMath p → wellOnQuiz p`).

The goal is to prove `¬quiz → ¬goodAtMath Alex`. However, the premises do not provide any information about Alex's attributes or actions. The absence of a quiz (`¬quiz`) leads to the conclusion that it is not Monday (`¬monday`) and that the specific person did not study hard (`¬studiedHard P`), but this does not relate to Alex. The general rule about being good at math requires doing well on quizzes, but without a quiz, there is no way to evaluate Alex's performance or math ability. Since Alex is not mentioned in the premises, no conclusion about Alex can be drawn from `¬quiz`.

Therefore, the negation (that Alex is not good at math under the assumption of no quiz) cannot be proven from the given premises.

axiom Person : Type
axiom P : Person  -- The specific person ("someone") from the context
axiom Alex : Person  -- Alex, who is not linked to the context

axiom monday : Prop
axiom quiz : Prop
axiom studiedHard : Person → Prop
axiom wellOnQuiz : Person → Prop
axiom goodAtMath : Person → Prop

-- Premises:
axiom P1 : monday → quiz
axiom P2 : wellOnQuiz P → studiedHard P  -- Specific to person P
axiom P3 : monday ∨ ¬ studiedHard P  -- Simplified disjunction
axiom P4 : ∀ p : Person, goodAtMath p → wellOnQuiz p  -- General rule

-- Attempt to prove: If there is no quiz, then Alex is not good at math.
theorem target (no_quiz : ¬quiz) : ¬ goodAtMath Alex :=
by
  -- From ¬quiz and P1 (monday → quiz), derive ¬monday
  have no_monday : ¬monday := fun h_m => no_quiz (P1 h_m)
  -- From P3 (monday ∨ ¬studiedHard P) and ¬monday, derive ¬studiedHard P
  have not_studied_P : ¬ studiedHard P := by
    cases P3 with
    | inl h_m => contradiction
    | inr h => exact h
  -- Now, we need to show ¬goodAtMath Alex.
  -- Assume Alex is good at math (to derive contradiction)
  intro h_goodAlex
  -- By P4, Alex being good at math implies wellOnQuiz Alex
  have h_wellAlex := P4 Alex h_goodAlex
  -- However, we have no premise linking ¬quiz to ¬wellOnQuiz.
  -- Specifically, we lack: ∀p, ¬quiz → ¬wellOnQuiz p
  -- Without this, we cannot contradict h_wellAlex.
  -- Also, the premises about P do not involve Alex.
  -- Thus, we cannot complete the proof.
  sorry  -- Proof fails here
