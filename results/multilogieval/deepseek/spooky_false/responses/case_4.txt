</lean>

Explanation: The proof shows a contradiction when trying to establish ¬ProductionCostIncreased. From the given sales decrease, we derive that marketing investment didn't occur. The disjunction forces production costs to have increased when marketing didn't occur. Therefore, **we cannot prove the negation** (that costs didn't increase).

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The error occurred because the proof attempted to use `h_cost` (which has type `ProductionCostIncreased`) as a proof of `¬ProductionCostIncreased` in the `inr` branch. This is a type mismatch since `h_cost` is evidence that production costs increased, while the goal was to prove they did not increase.

After re-examining the premises:
1. If marketing investment occurs, sales increase
2. Either marketing investment or cost increase (or both) occurred
3. Sales did not increase

We can derive:
- Marketing investment did NOT occur (from 1 and 3)
- Therefore, production costs MUST have increased (from 2 and the above)

This means we can prove `ProductionCostIncreased` but cannot prove its negation (`¬ProductionCostIncreased`). The corrected Lean code below includes proofs of these facts and acknowledges that the negation cannot be proven.
