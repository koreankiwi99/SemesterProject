The reasoning involves evaluating whether Priya's plants wilted and died given that they did not grow well, based on the provided premises. The Lean code models the scenario and attempts to prove the negation of the conclusion (that the plants did not wilt and die) from the premises and the given fact that the plants did not grow well.

<lean>
axiom W : Prop      -- Priya watered plants daily
axiom D : Prop      -- There was a drought
axiom R : Prop      -- Water restrictions were imposed
axiom E : Prop      -- Plants got enough water
axiom G : Prop      -- Plants grew well
axiom Die : Prop    -- Plants wilted and died

-- Premises:
axiom P1 : W → G   -- Watering daily leads to growth
axiom P2 : D → R   -- Drought causes water restrictions
axiom P3 : W ∨ D   -- Either watered daily, drought, or both
axiom P4 : R → ¬E  -- Restrictions imply not enough water
axiom P5 : ¬E → Die -- Lack of water causes death

-- Given fact:
axiom notG : ¬G    -- Plants did not grow well

-- Attempt to prove ¬Die (negation of the conclusion)
theorem target : ¬Die := by
  -- From ¬G and P1 (W → G), derive ¬W via contraposition
  have notW : ¬W := fun w => notG (P1 w)
  -- From P3 (W ∨ D) and ¬W, derive D
  cases P3 with
  | inl w => contradiction  -- Contradiction from w and notW
  | inr d => 
      -- From D and P2 (D → R), derive R
      have r : R := P2 d
      -- From R and P4 (R → ¬E), derive ¬E
      have notE : ¬E := P4 r
      -- From ¬E and P5 (¬E → Die), derive Die
      have die : Die := P5 notE
      -- Now, assume a proof of Die (d) is given to this function
      intro d_val
      -- We have two proofs of Die: die (from premises) and d_val (assumed)
      -- But no contradiction exists between Die and ¬Die yet
      -- Attempt to derive False without additional resources fails
      -- No axiom links Die to other propositions to create contradiction
      sorry  -- Admission of failure: Cannot derive False
</lean>

The Lean code demonstrates that ¬Die cannot be proven. The premises and ¬G lead to a proof of Die (plants wilted and died), making ¬Die unprovable. Since the negation of the conclusion cannot be proven, the result is Failure.

ANSWER: Failure
