The reasoning involves translating the natural language context into Lean axioms and attempting to prove that Mark's garden did not fail to thrive (i.e., `Thrive Mark`), given that Mark did not need to care for the plants. The premises are:

1. If someone plants a garden, they need to water and care for the plants: `∀ p, PlantsGarden p → NeedsToWaterAndCare p`.
2. If there is a drought, there is a ban on watering gardens: `Drought → BanOnWatering`.
3. Mark either plants a garden or there is a drought (or both): `PlantsGarden Mark ∨ Drought`.
4. If there is a watering ban, garden plants do not get enough water: `BanOnWatering → ∀ p, PlantsGarden p → ¬ EnoughWater p`.
5. If garden plants do not get enough water, the garden fails to thrive: `∀ p, PlantsGarden p → ¬ EnoughWater p → ¬ Thrive p`.

Given that Mark did not need to care (`¬NeedsToWaterAndCare Mark`), we derive:
- From premise 1 (contrapositive): `¬NeedsToWaterAndCare Mark → ¬PlantsGarden Mark`, so `¬PlantsGarden Mark`.
- From premise 3: `¬PlantsGarden Mark` implies `Drought`.
- From premise 2: `Drought` implies `BanOnWatering`.
- From premise 4: `BanOnWatering` implies for any person who planted a garden, their plants do not get enough water (`∀ p, PlantsGarden p → ¬ EnoughWater p`). However, since `¬PlantsGarden Mark`, this does not provide information about Mark's water situation.
- Premise 5 requires `PlantsGarden p` to conclude `¬ Thrive p` from `¬ EnoughWater p`. Without `PlantsGarden Mark`, we cannot apply this to Mark.

There are no axioms about gardens that were not planted or about `Thrive` without planting. Thus, we cannot determine if Mark's garden thrived or failed, and specifically, we **cannot prove** that Mark's garden did not fail to thrive (`Thrive Mark`).

axiom Thrive : Person → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ p, PlantsGarden p → NeedsToWaterAndCare p
axiom P2 : Drought → BanOnWatering
axiom P3 : PlantsGarden Mark ∨ Drought
axiom P4 : BanOnWatering → ∀ p, PlantsGarden p → ¬ EnoughWater p
axiom P5 : ∀ p, PlantsGarden p → ¬ EnoughWater p → ¬ Thrive p

axiom given : ¬ NeedsToWaterAndCare Mark

  -- Cannot apply P4 or P5 to Mark without PlantsGarden Mark
