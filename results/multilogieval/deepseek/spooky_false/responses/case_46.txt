The natural language premises are translated into Lean with careful attention to the existential quantifiers in the third premise, as "someone" suggests existential rather than universal quantification. The goal is to prove that Casey adopting a pet does not entail that she feels a sense of fulfillment, i.e., to prove ¬Fulfillment Casey from the premises and the assumption that Casey adopts.

However, the premises do not force ¬Fulfillment Casey. Specifically:
- Premise 3 is interpreted existentially: there exists at least one volunteer or at least one person who did not provide a home (or both). This does not require Casey to volunteer.
- From adoption (Adopt Casey), Premise 2 provides ProvideHome Casey.
- Fulfillment Casey requires HelpCommunity Casey (Premise 4), which in turn requires Volunteer Casey (Premise 1). But no premise forces Casey to volunteer.
- Premise 3 can be satisfied by other individuals (e.g., another person not providing a home), leaving Casey's volunteer status undetermined.

Thus, ¬Fulfillment Casey cannot be proven from the premises and Adopt Casey. The attempt to prove it fails.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Casey : Person

axiom Volunteer : Person → Prop
axiom HelpCommunity : Person → Prop
axiom Adopt : Person → Prop
axiom ProvideHome : Person → Prop
axiom Fulfillment : Person → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ p, Volunteer p → HelpCommunity p
axiom P2 : ∀ p, Adopt p → ProvideHome p
axiom P3 : (∃ p, Volunteer p) ∨ (∃ p, ¬ ProvideHome p) ∨ (∃ p, Volunteer p ∧ ¬ ProvideHome p)
axiom P4 : ∀ p, HelpCommunity p → Fulfillment p

axiom Adoption : Adopt Casey

theorem not_fulfilled : ¬ Fulfillment Casey :=
  fun h : Fulfillment Casey =>
  -- Attempt to derive a contradiction: Fulfillment Casey implies HelpCommunity Casey via P4? 
  -- But P4 is an implication, not an equivalence. We cannot derive HelpCommunity Casey from Fulfillment Casey.
  -- Even if we assume HelpCommunity Casey, P1 would require Volunteer Casey, which is not forced by any premise.
  have hc : HelpCommunity Casey := by 
    -- Cannot be proven; P4 only gives Fulfillment p from HelpCommunity p, not vice versa.
    sorry
  have vc : Volunteer Casey := by 
    -- P1 requires Volunteer Casey for HelpCommunity Casey, but we have no evidence for Volunteer Casey.
    -- Premise 3 is existential and does not specify Casey.
    sorry
  -- No contradiction derived; proof fails.
  sorry
