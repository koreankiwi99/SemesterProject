The premises and the given fact that it didn't rain recently lead to the conclusion that the sponge was soapy. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that the sponge was not soapy (the negation of the conclusion). The attempt to prove ¬Soapy fails because the axioms and assumptions result in Soapy being true.

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was used inappropriately. In the branch where `P5` yields `Soapy`, there is no contradiction since both the assumption and the case provide proof of `Soapy`. The goal was to derive `Uncoiled` to obtain a contradiction via `nUncoiled`, but `Soapy` does not provide `Uncoiled`.

The corrected Lean code properly demonstrates:
1. `soapy` is provable from the premises and `¬Rained`
2. Attempting to prove `¬Soapy` fails because it contradicts the provable `Soapy`
