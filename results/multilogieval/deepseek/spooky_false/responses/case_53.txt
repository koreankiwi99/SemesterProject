ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After correcting the compilation error by replacing the `variable` declaration with an axiom for the given fact about Mary, the Lean code now compiles. The goal is to prove the negation of the conclusion (¬Learn Mary) from the premises. 

The premises state:
1. Practicing improves technique (∀x, Practice x → Technique x)
2. Improved technique makes artwork stand out (∀x, Technique x → StandOut x)
3. Mary either practiced or took an art class (or both) (∀x, Practice x ∨ ArtClass x)
4. Taking an art class implies learning (∀x, ArtClass x → Learn x)
Given: Mary's artwork did not stand out (¬StandOut Mary)

The proof attempt for ¬Learn Mary proceeds as follows:
- Assume Learn Mary (to derive a contradiction)
- From ¬StandOut Mary and premise 2, derive ¬Technique Mary
- From ¬Technique Mary and premise 1, derive ¬Practice Mary
- Using premise 3 (disjunction for Mary):
  - If Mary practiced, ¬Practice Mary yields contradiction
  - If Mary took an art class, premise 4 proves Learn Mary, but this matches the assumption. No contradiction occurs since the premises do not link learning to technique/standout in a way that contradicts ¬StandOut Mary.

The proof fails in the art class branch because Learn Mary is consistent with the premises and given. Thus, ¬Learn Mary cannot be proven.
