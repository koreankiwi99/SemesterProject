The goal is to prove that the statement "If attendance at the movie was low, then it is a sequel" is false (i.e., prove that low attendance does not imply it is a sequel). This requires showing that the premises allow a scenario where attendance is low but the movie is not a sequel. The Lean code attempts to prove the negation of the conditional: `¬(¬H → Q)`, which is equivalent to `¬H ∧ ¬Q`.

### Lean Analysis:
```lean
axiom Person : Type
axiom buys_ticket : Person → Prop
axiom plans_to_see : Person → Prop
axiom R : Prop   -- Movie got good reviews
axiom H : Prop   -- High attendance (many people went)
axiom S : Prop   -- Big star is in the movie
axiom Q : Prop   -- Movie is a sequel

axiom P1 : R → H                     -- Good reviews imply high attendance
axiom P2 : ∀ p : Person, buys_ticket p → plans_to_see p  -- Buying tickets implies planning to see
axiom P3 : R ∨ ¬H                     -- Good reviews or low attendance (simplified from disjunction)
axiom P4 : S → R                      -- Big star implies good reviews
axiom P5 : S ∨ Q                      -- Big star or sequel (or both)

-- Attempt to prove: low attendance (¬H) and not a sequel (¬Q)
theorem prove_negation : ¬H ∧ ¬Q → False := by
  intro ⟨h_att_low, h_not_sequel⟩  -- Assume ¬H and ¬Q
  cases P5 with
  | inl h_star =>                   -- Case 1: Big star (S) is true
    have h_reviews : R := P4 h_star -- S → R, so R holds
    have h_high_att : H := P1 h_reviews -- R → H, so H holds
    exact h_att_low h_high_att      -- Contradiction: ¬H and H
  | inr h_sequel =>                 -- Case 2: Sequel (Q) is true
    exact h_not_sequel h_sequel     -- Contradiction: ¬Q and Q
```

### Explanation:
- **Premises**: 
  - `P1`: Good reviews (`R`) imply high attendance (`H`).
  - `P2`: Buying tickets implies planning to see (not directly used).
  - `P3`: Simplified to `R ∨ ¬H` (good reviews or low attendance).
  - `P4`: Big star (`S`) implies good reviews (`R`).
  - `P5`: Big star or sequel (`S ∨ Q`).
- **Proof Attempt**: 
  - Assume `¬H` (low attendance) and `¬Q` (not a sequel).
  - From `P5`, either `S` (big star) or `Q` (sequel) holds.
  - If `S` holds, `P4` gives `R`, and `P1` gives `H`, contradicting `¬H`.
  - If `Q` holds, it directly contradicts `¬Q`.
  - Both cases lead to contradiction, so `¬H ∧ ¬Q` is impossible.

### Conclusion:
The negation of the conditional (that low attendance implies it is a sequel) **cannot be proven** because the premises force that whenever attendance is low, the movie must be a sequel (to avoid contradictions). Thus, the attempt to prove "No" (that the statement is false) fails.
