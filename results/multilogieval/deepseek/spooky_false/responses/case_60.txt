The reasoning involves proving that John did not go to bed late given the premises. The key steps are:

1. From John's knowledge (with factivity):
   - Knows (alarm → time to get ready) → (alarm → time to get ready)
   - Knows ¬(time to get ready) → ¬(time to get ready)

2. Using modus tollens:
   - ¬(time to get ready) and (alarm → time to get ready) → ¬alarm

3. From disjunction:
   - ¬alarm and (alarm ∨ ¬late for school) → ¬late for school

4. Chaining implications:
   - ¬late for school and (miss bus → late for school) → ¬miss bus
   - ¬miss bus and (get up late → miss bus) → ¬get up late
   - ¬get up late and (go to bed late → get up late) → ¬go to bed late

Thus, John did not go to bed late.
