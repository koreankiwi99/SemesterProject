ANSWER: No

The Lean proof establishes that Linda did not plant disease-resistant varieties:
1. The gardener's saying is formalized as a universal conditional.
2. Assuming Linda planted resistant varieties leads to a contradiction:
   - Applying the saying to Linda yields: proper watering/feeding → bountiful harvest.
   - With confirmed proper watering/feeding, we must have a bountiful harvest.
   - This contradicts the given fact of no bountiful harvest.
Thus, the initial assumption is false, proving ¬PlantsResistant Linda.
