The goal is to prove that Simone did not train with dedication based on the premises. 

Premises:
1. For athletes: If someone trains with dedication and gets adequate rest, they perform at their peak.
2. Simone got adequate rest.
3. Simone did not perform at her peak.

We formalize this in Lean:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Simone : obj
axiom Athlete : obj → Prop
axiom TrainsWithDedication : obj → Prop
axiom AdequateRest : obj → Prop
axiom PerformAtPeak : obj → Prop

-- Premise: For all athletes, training with dedication and adequate rest implies peak performance
axiom coach_rule : ∀ x : obj, Athlete x → (TrainsWithDedication x → (AdequateRest x → PerformAtPeak x))

-- Premise: Simone is an athlete (implied by context)
axiom simone_athlete : Athlete Simone

-- Premise: Simone got adequate rest
axiom simone_rest : AdequateRest Simone

-- Premise: Simone did not perform at peak
axiom not_peak : ¬PerformAtPeak Simone

-- We prove Simone did NOT train with dedication
theorem no_dedication : ¬TrainsWithDedication Simone := by
  intro h_dedication  -- Assume she trained with dedication
  have H : PerformAtPeak Simone := by
    apply coach_rule Simone simone_athlete h_dedication simone_rest
  exact not_peak H  -- Contradiction

-- The proof shows ¬TrainsWithDedication Simone
</lean>

The Lean proof demonstrates that assuming Simone trained with dedication leads to a contradiction with the given premises. Therefore, we conclude she did not train with dedication.

ANSWER: No
