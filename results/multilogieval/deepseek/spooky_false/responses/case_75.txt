Based on the context and statement provided, I will formalize the reasoning in Lean. The goal is to prove that preventive maintenance was **not** done on Liz's car, given the premises.

**Formalization:**
- `Car` is a type representing all cars.
- `LizCar` is a specific constant of type `Car`.
- `PM c`: Preventive maintenance was done on car `c`.
- `QP c`: Quality parts were used in repairs of car `c`.
- `LL c`: Car `c` has a long service life.

**Premises:**
1. Context:  
   ```lean
   axiom Mech : ∀ c : Car, PM c → (QP c → LL c)
   ```
   This captures: "If preventive maintenance is done, then if quality parts are used, the car has a long service life."

2. Given statements:  
   ```lean
   axiom PartQuality : QP LizCar
   axiom NotLongLife : ¬ LL LizCar
   ```

**Proof Strategy:**  
We need to prove `¬ PM LizCar` (preventive maintenance was **not** done). Using the contrapositive of the context axiom, we derive:  
`(QP c ∧ ¬ LL c) → ¬ PM c`.  
For `c := LizCar`, this becomes:  
`QP LizCar ∧ ¬ LL LizCar → ¬ PM LizCar`.  
This directly follows from the given axioms.

<lean>
def Car : Type
def LizCar : Car
def PM (c : Car) : Prop
def QP (c : Car) : Prop
def LL (c : Car) : Prop

axiom Mech : ∀ c : Car, PM c → (QP c → LL c)
axiom PartQuality : QP LizCar
axiom NotLongLife : ¬ LL LizCar

theorem no_preventive_maintenance : ¬ PM LizCar := by
  intro h_pm
  have h1 : QP LizCar → LL LizCar := Mech LizCar h_pm
  have h_contradiction : LL LizCar := h1 PartQuality
  exact NotLongLife h_contradiction
</lean>

**Conclusion:**  
We successfully prove that preventive maintenance was **not** done on Liz's car.

ITERATION 2

The compilation errors occurred because `def` declarations require a definition body. Changing to `axiom` for all declarations resolves this. The corrected Lean proof demonstrates that preventive maintenance was not done on Liz's car.

<lean>
axiom Car : Type
axiom LizCar : Car
axiom PM : Car → Prop
axiom QP : Car → Prop
axiom LL : Car → Prop

axiom Mech : ∀ c : Car, PM c → (QP c → LL c)
axiom PartQuality : QP LizCar
axiom NotLongLife : ¬ LL LizCar

theorem no_preventive_maintenance : ¬ PM LizCar := by
  intro h_pm
  have h1 : QP LizCar → LL LizCar := Mech LizCar h_pm
  have h2 : LL LizCar := h1 PartQuality
  exact NotLongLife h2
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**  
1. Assume `PM LizCar` is true (for contradiction)  
2. By `Mech`, since PM was done: `QP LizCar → LL LizCar`  
3. By `PartQuality`, `QP LizCar` is true, so `LL LizCar` must be true  
4. But `NotLongLife` says `¬ LL LizCar` - contradiction  
5. Therefore `¬ PM LizCar`  

ANSWER: No
