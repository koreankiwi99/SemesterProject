The goal is to prove the negation of the statement: "If James did not play well, then he was a top player in youth leagues." This negation is equivalent to: James did not play well and he was not a top player. However, the premises do not provide specific information about James, and they are consistent with scenarios where James plays well or not, and is a top player or not. Therefore, it is impossible to prove the conjunction ¬PlayWell James ∧ ¬TopPlayer James solely from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj
axiom PracticedHard : obj → Prop
axiom PlayWell : obj → Prop
axiom PickedStart : obj → Prop
axiom Talented : obj → Prop
axiom NaturalAbility : obj → Prop
axiom TopPlayer : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, PracticedHard x → PlayWell x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, PickedStart x → Talented x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, PracticedHard x ∨ ¬Talented x
axiom P5 : ∀ x : obj, NaturalAbility x → PickedStart x
axiom P6 : ∀ x : obj, TopPlayer x → NaturalAbility x

-- The negation of the conditional "¬PlayWell James → TopPlayer James" is:
-- ¬(¬PlayWell James → TopPlayer James) ↔ ¬(PlayWell James ∨ TopPlayer James) ↔ ¬PlayWell James ∧ ¬TopPlayer James
theorem goal : ¬PlayWell James ∧ ¬TopPlayer James := by
  -- We cannot prove this theorem because the premises do not force James to have ¬PlayWell and ¬TopPlayer.
  -- For example, James might have practiced hard (so PlayWell James holds) or might be talented (leading to other outcomes).
  -- Since no premise specifies James' attributes, the conjunction is unprovable.
