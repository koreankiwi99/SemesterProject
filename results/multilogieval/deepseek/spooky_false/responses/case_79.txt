The reasoning involves proving that if John's muscles are not sore today, then it did not rain. The premises lead to a contradiction when assuming it rained, given the absence of soreness.

<lean>
axiom Rained : Prop
axiom Cold : Prop
axiom TakeShower : Prop
axiom WorkedOutHard : Prop
axiom SoreToday : Prop
axiom MusclesRelax : Prop

axiom T2 : WorkedOutHard → SoreToday
axiom T3 : TakeShower → MusclesRelax
axiom T4 : WorkedOutHard ∨ ¬MusclesRelax
axiom T5 : Cold → TakeShower
axiom T6 : Rained → Cold

theorem no_rain (h : ¬SoreToday) : ¬Rained :=
  fun (rain : Rained) =>
    have cold : Cold := T6 rain
    have shower : TakeShower := T5 cold
    have relax : MusclesRelax := T3 shower
    have hw : WorkedOutHard := by
      cases T4 with
      | inl h => exact h
      | inr nr => exact absurd relax nr
    have sore : SoreToday := T2 hw
    h sore
</lean>

ANSWER: No
