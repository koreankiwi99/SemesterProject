The Lean code below formalizes the given premises and attempts to prove the negation of the statement: "If the kids did not go for a swim, then the players have smiles on their faces." The negation of this implication is equivalent to "The kids did not go for a swim and the players did not have smiles." However, the premises entail that if the kids did not swim (¬S), then the pool is closed (¬P), leading to no rain (¬R), which triggers the softball game (G), player enjoyment (E), and finally smiles (M). This creates a contradiction when assuming ¬S ∧ ¬M, making the negation unprovable.

axiom R : Prop  -- It rains today
axiom P : Prop  -- Swimming pool is open
axiom S : Prop  -- Kids go for a swim
axiom G : Prop  -- Softball team has their game
axiom E : Prop  -- Players enjoy catching and batting
axiom M : Prop  -- Players have smiles on their faces

axiom A1 : ¬R → G  -- If no rain, game happens
axiom A2 : P → S    -- If pool open, kids swim
axiom A3 : ¬R ∨ P   -- Either no rain or pool open (or both)
axiom A4 : G → E    -- If game, players enjoy
axiom A5 : E → M    -- If enjoy, players smile

-- Attempt to prove ¬S ∧ ¬M (negation of ¬S → M)
