The goal is to prove that if Amy cannot play any songs, then she does not have knowledge about song structure. However, the premises lead to a contradiction when assuming both that Amy cannot play songs and that she lacks knowledge. Specifically, the disjunction in premise 3 forces Amy to either practice daily (leading to playing songs, contradicting the assumption) or learn theory (leading to knowledge, contradicting the lack of knowledge). Thus, the negation cannot be proven.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Amy : obj
axiom PracticesDaily : obj → Prop
axiom DevelopsMuscleMemory : obj → Prop
axiom CanPlaySongs : obj → Prop
axiom LearnsTheory : obj → Prop
axiom HasKnowledge : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ p : obj, PracticesDaily p → DevelopsMuscleMemory p
axiom A2 : ∀ p : obj, DevelopsMuscleMemory p → CanPlaySongs p
axiom A3 : ∀ p : obj, PracticesDaily p ∨ LearnsTheory p
axiom A4 : ∀ p : obj, LearnsTheory p → HasKnowledge p
