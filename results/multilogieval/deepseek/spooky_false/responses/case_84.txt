The textual context describes a specific musician and their actions, but the statement to evaluate concerns Sarah, who is not mentioned in the context. There is no premise linking Sarah to the musician described. Therefore, no information about Sarah's album release or creativity can be derived from the given premises. Attempting to prove the negation of the statement ("If Sarah did not release an album, then her creativity did not flourish") fails due to the lack of relevant premises about Sarah.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
-- The musician from the context
axiom Musician : obj
-- Sarah (introduced for the statement, but no premises about her)
axiom Sarah : obj

-- Predicates for the musician (applied to any object, but premises only constrain Musician)
axiom PracticeMelodies : obj → Prop
axiom JamWithFriends : obj → Prop
axiom GainInspiration : obj → Prop
axiom CreativityFlourishes : obj → Prop
axiom ComposeAlbum : obj → Prop

-- Premises (only about Musician)
axiom P3 : PracticeMelodies Musician → ComposeAlbum Musician
axiom P4 : PracticeMelodies Musician ∨ JamWithFriends Musician
axiom P5 : ∀ x, JamWithFriends x → GainInspiration x
axiom P6 : ∀ x, GainInspiration x → CreativityFlourishes x

-- Attempt to prove the negation for Sarah: 
-- ¬(¬ComposeAlbum Sarah → CreativityFlourishes Sarah) 
-- which is equivalent to: ¬ComposeAlbum Sarah ∧ ¬CreativityFlourishes Sarah
theorem prove_negation : ¬ComposeAlbum Sarah ∧ ¬CreativityFlourishes Sarah := by
  -- No premises mention Sarah, so we cannot construct a proof
  -- We have no information about Sarah's actions or outcomes
  sorry -- Proof fails

-- Alternatively, attempt to prove the original statement for Sarah fails too
theorem original_statement : ¬ComposeAlbum Sarah → CreativityFlourishes Sarah := by
  sorry -- No premises about Sarah, cannot prove
