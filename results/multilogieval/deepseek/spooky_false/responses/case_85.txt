The textual context provides premises about gardening, but does not define "soil high quality." The premises only mention "soil quality improves," which is a process, not an absolute state. There is no link between improved soil quality and high soil quality in the given context. Therefore, even though we can prove that John's soil quality improves (due to the premises and the condition that his garden does not attract more bees and butterflies), we cannot prove anything about "soil high quality" as it is undefined and unconnected to the premises.
