ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The error occurred because the proof attempted to derive a contradiction after establishing `IceCream Priya`, but no contradiction exists in the premises. The correct approach shows that under the assumption of `Snowstorm`, we can derive `IceCream Priya` through the premises. Therefore, we cannot prove the negation (that Priya's parents did NOT take her out for ice cream). The proof of the negation is incomplete and requires `sorry`.
