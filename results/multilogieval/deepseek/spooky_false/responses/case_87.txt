The reasoning involves translating the natural language context into Lean axioms and attempting to prove that John did not have a very productive afternoon given that he did not bring in treats. The key steps are:

1. **Premise Translation**:
   - `Person` is a type representing individuals.
   - `John` is a specific person.
   - `FinishesAhead p` means person `p` finishes their project ahead of schedule.
   - `TakeLongLunch p` means person `p` takes a long lunch break.
   - `Birthday` indicates it's a coworker's birthday.
   - `BringsTreats p` means person `p` brings in treats.
   - `Recharged p` means person `p` comes back recharged.
   - `ProductiveAfternoon p` means person `p` has a very productive afternoon.

   Axioms:
   - `T1`: If someone finishes ahead, they take a long lunch: `∀ p, FinishesAhead p → TakeLongLunch p`.
   - `T2`: If it's a birthday, everyone brings treats: `Birthday → ∀ p, BringsTreats p`.
   - `T3`: Either someone finishes ahead, or it's a birthday (or both): `(∃ p, FinishesAhead p) ∨ Birthday`.
   - `T4`: Taking a long lunch leads to being recharged: `∀ p, TakeLongLunch p → Recharged p`.
   - `T5`: Being recharged leads to a productive afternoon: `∀ p, Recharged p → ProductiveAfternoon p`.

2. **Assumption**: John did not bring treats (`¬BringsTreats John`).

3. **Proof Attempt**:
   - From `¬BringsTreats John` and `T2`, deduce `¬Birthday` (if it were a birthday, John would bring treats).
   - From `¬Birthday` and `T3`, deduce `∃ p, FinishesAhead p` (someone finishes ahead).
   - Let `q` be such a person. Then `q` takes a long lunch (`T1`), is recharged (`T4`), and has a productive afternoon (`T5`).
   - However, there is no premise linking John's actions to `q` or restricting long lunches only to those who finish ahead. John might take a long lunch without finishing ahead, leading to productivity.
   - Without evidence that John did not take a long lunch, we cannot prove he was unproductive.

**Conclusion**: The negation (that John did not have a productive afternoon) cannot be proven from the premises and assumption. Thus, the proof fails.
