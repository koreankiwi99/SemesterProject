The premises provide information about Alex's biology exam and general relationships between studying, confidence, performance, and satisfaction. However, the query asks about Alex's satisfaction with his **history exam** under the condition of severe weather. The premises do not mention the history exam, nor do they link severe weather to the history exam. Specifically:

- Premise 3 only discusses the biology exam.
- Premise 2 about severe weather leading to possible class cancellation does not specify which exam day is affected.
- The satisfaction in Premise 5 is exam-specific (i.e., satisfaction with the exam for which the student performed well).

There is no information connecting severe weather to the history exam or Alex's preparation/performance in it. Thus, it is impossible to prove that severe weather implies Alex's satisfaction with the history exam. Moreover, attempting to prove the negation (that severe weather occurred but Alex was not satisfied with the history exam) fails due to the lack of constraints on the history exam in the premises.

axiom Alex : obj
axiom BiologyExam : exam
axiom HistoryExam : exam

axiom ClassCanceledDueToWeather : Prop

-- Premise 1: Studying hard leads to confidence
axiom P1 : ∀ (x : obj) (e : exam), StudiesHard x e → Confident x e
-- Premise 2: Severe weather may cause class cancellation (no direct implication)
-- Premise 3: Alex studied for biology or class was not canceled due to weather
axiom P3 : StudiesHard Alex BiologyExam ∨ ¬ClassCanceledDueToWeather
-- Premise 4: Confidence leads to doing well
axiom P4 : ∀ (x : obj) (e : exam), Confident x e → DoWell x e
-- Premise 5: Doing well leads to satisfaction
axiom P5 : ∀ (x : obj) (e : exam), DoWell x e → Satisfied x e

-- Attempt to prove: If severe weather, Alex was NOT satisfied with history exam.
-- Goal: ¬(SevereWeather → Satisfied Alex HistoryExam) ≡ SevereWeather ∧ ¬Satisfied Alex HistoryExam
theorem disprove : SevereWeather ∧ ¬Satisfied Alex HistoryExam := by 
  -- No premises link SevereWeather to HistoryExam or constrain HistoryExam at all.
  -- Cannot prove ¬Satisfied Alex HistoryExam without information about history exam.
  -- Proof fails.
