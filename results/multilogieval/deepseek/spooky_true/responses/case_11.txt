The reasoning problem involves determining if the project received an award given that the judges were not impressed. The premises establish logical relationships between display quality, research thoroughness, expert recognition, and awards. After translating the natural language into Lean propositions and axioms, a proof is constructed showing that the project must have received an award due to the disjunctive premise and the contrapositive implications.

<lean>
axiom display_nice : Prop
axiom judges_impressed : Prop
axiom research_thorough : Prop
axiom experts_serious : Prop
axiom award : Prop

axiom T1 : display_nice → judges_impressed
axiom T2 : research_thorough → experts_serious
axiom T3 : display_nice ∨ research_thorough
axiom T4 : experts_serious → award

axiom given : ¬ judges_impressed

theorem project_received_award : award := by
  have not_display_nice : ¬ display_nice := fun h => given (T1 h)
  cases T3 with
  | inl dn => contradiction
  | inr rt => exact T4 (T2 rt)
</lean>

The proof proceeds as follows:
1. **Contrapositive from premise 1**: Since judges are not impressed (`given`), the display cannot be nice (`not_display_nice`).
2. **Disjunction resolution**: The disjunction `T3` (display nice or research thorough) is examined:
   - If display nice (`inl dn`), it contradicts `not_display_nice`, leading to absurdity.
   - Thus, research must be thorough (`rt`).
3. **Implication chaining**: Thorough research (`rt`) implies experts take it seriously (`T2 rt`), which then implies an award (`T4`).

This chain of deductions proves the award follows necessarily from the premises and the given condition.

ANSWER: Yes
