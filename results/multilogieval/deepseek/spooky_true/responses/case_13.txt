The context provides premises about the restaurant and implications, but does not connect positive reviews to long lines forming. The statement to evaluate ("The new restaurant uses fresh, organic ingredients") is taken as an additional premise. Using Lean, we formalize the entities and predicates:

- `obj`: Type for entities (restaurants)
- `R`: The new restaurant
- `UsesFreshOrganic`: Predicate for using fresh, organic ingredients
- `TastesAmazing`: Predicate for food tasting amazing
- `PositiveReviewsSpread`: Predicate for positive reviews spreading
- `LongLinesForm`: Predicate for long lines forming outside

Premises:
1. The restaurant uses fresh, organic ingredients (from the statement).
2. If any restaurant uses fresh, organic ingredients, its food tastes amazing.
3. If any restaurant's food tastes amazing, positive reviews spread.

We aim to prove `LongLinesForm R`. However, no premise links positive reviews to long lines forming. Thus, the proof fails.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom R : obj
axiom UsesFreshOrganic : obj → Prop
axiom TastesAmazing : obj → Prop
axiom PositiveReviewsSpread : obj → Prop
axiom LongLinesForm : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : UsesFreshOrganic R
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, UsesFreshOrganic x → TastesAmazing x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, TastesAmazing x → PositiveReviewsSpread x

theorem prove_long_lines : LongLinesForm R := by
  -- Prove intermediate steps
  have tasteAmazing : TastesAmazing R := A2 R A1
  have positiveReviews : PositiveReviewsSpread R := A3 R tasteAmazing
  -- No axiom connects PositiveReviewsSpread to LongLinesForm. Cannot proceed.
