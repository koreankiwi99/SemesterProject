The reasoning involves proving whether Sam was assigned to lead a new team given the premises and the fact that Sam did not get a promotion.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Sam : Person

axiom ImpressManager : Person → Prop  -- x impressed the manager with excellent work
axiom GetPromotion : Person → Prop    -- x gets a promotion
axiom TakeExtra : Person → Prop       -- x took on extra responsibilities
axiom GainExperience : Person → Prop  -- x gains valuable experience
axiom LeadTeam : Person → Prop        -- x is assigned to lead a new team

-- Premises:
axiom Premise1 : ∀ x : Person, ImpressManager x → GetPromotion x
axiom Premise2 : ∀ x : Person, TakeExtra x → GainExperience x
axiom Premise3 : ImpressManager Sam ∨ TakeExtra Sam
axiom Premise4 : ∀ x : Person, GainExperience x → LeadTeam x

-- Given fact: Sam did not get a promotion
axiom Given : ¬ GetPromotion Sam

-- Prove that Sam was assigned to lead a new team
theorem result : LeadTeam Sam := by
  -- Since Sam didn't get a promotion, Sam did not impress the manager (by contraposition of Premise1)
  have not_impress : ¬ ImpressManager Sam := by
    intro hImpress
    have hPromo := Premise1 Sam hImpress
    contradiction
  -- From Premise3 (Sam either impressed manager or took extra work), and since Sam didn't impress, Sam took extra work
  have extra : TakeExtra Sam := by
    cases Premise3 with
    | inl impress => contradiction
    | inr take_extra => exact take_extra
  -- From Premise2, taking extra work implies gaining experience
  have experience : GainExperience Sam := Premise2 Sam extra
  -- From Premise4, gaining experience implies leading a team
  exact Premise4 Sam experience

</lean>

ANSWER: Yes

ITERATION 2

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic failed to recognize the contradiction between `hPromo` and `Given` in the first proof block. This was resolved by explicitly applying `Given` to `hPromo` to derive `False`. The corrected proof uses explicit term application in the first block and retains `contradiction` in the second block where it correctly handles the disjunction.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Sam : Person

axiom ImpressManager : Person → Prop
axiom GetPromotion : Person → Prop
axiom TakeExtra : Person → Prop
axiom GainExperience : Person → Prop
axiom LeadTeam : Person → Prop

axiom Premise1 : ∀ x : Person, ImpressManager x → GetPromotion x
axiom Premise2 : ∀ x : Person, TakeExtra x → GainExperience x
axiom Premise3 : ImpressManager Sam ∨ TakeExtra Sam
axiom Premise4 : ∀ x : Person, GainExperience x → LeadTeam x

axiom Given : ¬ GetPromotion Sam

theorem result : LeadTeam Sam := by
  -- Prove Sam didn't impress manager (using Given and Premise1)
  have not_impress : ¬ ImpressManager Sam := by
    intro hImpress
    exact Given (Premise1 Sam hImpress)  -- Explicit contradiction
  
  -- Prove Sam took extra work (disjunctive syllogism on Premise3)
  have extra : TakeExtra Sam := by
    cases Premise3 with
    | inl impress => contradiction  -- Contradiction with not_impress
    | inr take_extra => exact take_extra
  
  -- Chain implications: extra → experience → lead team
  exact Premise4 Sam (Premise2 Sam extra)
