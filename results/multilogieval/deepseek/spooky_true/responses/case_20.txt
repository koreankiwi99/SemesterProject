The context provides several premises about employees in a company, but there is no direct or indirect logical link between "impressing bosses" and "being motivated." The key relationships are:
- Working hard leads to promotions (∀e, WorkHard(e) → Promotion(e))
- Impressing bosses leads to influence (∀e, ImpressBoss(e) → Influence(e))
- Motivation leads to working hard (∀e, Motivated(e) → WorkHard(e))
- There exists an employee who got neither promotion nor influence (∃e, ¬Promotion(e) ∧ ¬Influence(e))

Given that Mark impresses his bosses, we can infer he has influence (Influence(Mark)). However, influence does not imply motivation, and motivation is only linked to working hard (which itself only guarantees promotion). Since Mark's influence status does not constrain his motivation state, and no premise connects impressing bosses to motivation, we cannot prove Mark is motivated.

<lean>
axiom Employee : Type
axiom Mark : Employee
axiom WorkHard : Employee → Prop
axiom Promotion : Employee → Prop
axiom Influence : Employee → Prop
axiom Motivated : Employee → Prop
axiom ImpressBoss : Employee → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ e, WorkHard e → Promotion e
axiom A2 : ∀ e, ImpressBoss e → Influence e
axiom A3 : ∃ e, ¬ Promotion e ∧ ¬ Influence e
axiom A4 : ∀ e, Motivated e → WorkHard e
axiom mark_impresses : ImpressBoss Mark

theorem mark_motivated : Motivated Mark := by
  -- We have Influence Mark from A2 and mark_impresses
  have h_influence : Influence Mark := A2 Mark mark_impresses
  -- A3 shows there exists an employee without promotion and influence, but Mark has influence
  -- No axiom links Influence or ImpressBoss to Motivated
  -- Motivation only implies WorkHard (A4), but we have no way to derive Motivated Mark
  -- Proof fails due to missing logical connection
