The context provides several premises, but they do not sufficiently link "planning the day" to "having self-discipline." Specifically:
- Planning the day implies productivity (A2).
- Self-discipline implies waking up early (A4), which implies being energized (A1).
- There exists someone lacking energy or productivity (A3), but this does not constrain Mark.

Given that Mark plans his day (and is therefore productive), there is no premise connecting productivity, planning, or energy to self-discipline. Thus, we cannot prove Mark has self-discipline from the given information.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Mark : obj

axiom WakesUpEarly : obj → Prop
axiom Energized : obj → Prop
axiom PlansDay : obj → Prop
axiom Productive : obj → Prop
axiom HasSelfDiscipline : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, WakesUpEarly x → Energized x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, PlansDay x → Productive x
axiom A3 : ∃ x, ¬ Energized x ∨ ¬ Productive x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, HasSelfDiscipline x → WakesUpEarly x

axiom MarkPlans : PlansDay Mark

theorem mark_self_discipline : HasSelfDiscipline Mark := by
  -- We know Mark plans his day, so he is productive (by A2)
  have MarkProd : Productive Mark := A2 Mark MarkPlans
  -- A4 shows self-discipline implies waking up early (and thus energized), 
  -- but we have no link between planning/day/productivity and self-discipline.
  -- A3 indicates someone lacks energy or productivity, but this doesn't involve Mark specifically.
  -- Without additional premises connecting planning to self-discipline, we cannot prove the goal.
  sorry -- Proof fails here
