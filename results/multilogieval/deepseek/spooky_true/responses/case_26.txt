The reasoning involves translating the natural language context into logical predicates and evaluating whether the conclusion that the team lost a significant game can be proven from the given premises.

**Premises:**
1. If a team loses an important game, then the players feel disappointed: `lost_important → disappointed`.
2. Losing a big match is demoralizing: `lost_big → demoralized`.

**Given Statement:**  
The players are neither disappointed nor demoralized: `¬disappointed ∧ ¬demoralized`.

**Question:**  
Did the team lose a significant game? (Here, "significant game" is interpreted as either an important game or a big match, so `lost_significant := lost_important ∨ lost_big`.)

**Analysis:**
- From `¬disappointed` and premise 1, by modus tollens, the team did not lose an important game: `¬lost_important`.
- From `¬demoralized` and premise 2, by modus tollens, the team did not lose a big match: `¬lost_big`.
- Therefore, the team lost neither an important game nor a big match: `¬lost_important ∧ ¬lost_big`.
- This implies the negation of `lost_significant`: `¬(lost_important ∨ lost_big)`.

**Proof Attempt:**  
The goal is to prove `lost_significant` (i.e., that the team lost a significant game). However, the premises and given statement prove the opposite: `¬lost_significant`. Thus, it is impossible to prove `lost_significant`.

**Conclusion:**  
The proof of `lost_significant` fails because the premises imply the team did not lose a significant game.

ITERATION 2

The compilation error occurred because the `fail` tactic was used incorrectly within a proof. In Lean, `fail` is used for debugging and cannot prove a theorem. Instead, we must attempt to construct a valid proof for the conclusion. However, in this case, the conclusion (that the team lost a significant game) cannot be proven from the premises.

**Corrected Lean Code:**

axiom lost_important : Prop
axiom lost_big : Prop
axiom disappointed : Prop
axiom demoralized : Prop
axiom P1 : lost_important → disappointed
axiom P2 : lost_big → demoralized
axiom given : ¬disappointed ∧ ¬demoralized

def lost_significant : Prop := lost_important ∨ lost_big

-- Proof that the team did NOT lose a significant game
theorem not_lost : ¬lost_significant := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl h_imp => 
      have : disappointed := P1 h_imp
      apply given.left
      assumption
  | inr h_big => 
      have : demoralized := P2 h_big
      apply given.right
      assumption

-- Attempt to prove the team lost a significant game fails
theorem prove_significant : lost_significant := by
  have no_imp : ¬lost_important := fun h => given.left (P1 h)
  have no_big : ¬lost_big := fun h => given.right (P2 h)
  -- No evidence for lost_important or lost_big; proof fails
  apply Or.inl   -- Attempt to prove lost_important
  apply no_imp  -- Contradiction: ¬lost_important blocks this path
  done          -- Proof incomplete; goal remains
</lean>

**Explanation:**
- The premises state that losing an important game causes disappointment (`P1`), and losing a big match causes demoralization (`P2`).
- The given statement is that players are neither disappointed nor demoralized (`given`).
- We define a "significant game" as either an important game or a big match (`lost_significant`).
- The theorem `not_lost` proves that the team did **not** lose a significant game using modus tollens on both premises.
- When attempting to prove `lost_significant`, we show:
  1. `¬lost_important` (from `¬disappointed` and `P1`)
  2. `¬lost_big` (from `¬demoralized` and `P2`)
- Neither branch of the disjunction (`Or.inl`/`Or.inr`) can be proven, leading to an incomplete proof.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion that the team lost a significant game cannot be proven from the premises. In fact, the premises prove the opposite.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `prove_significant` theorem attempted to use `apply no_imp` where `no_imp` is a proof of `¬lost_important`, but the goal was to prove `lost_important`. This creates a type mismatch since `¬lost_important` (which is equivalent to `lost_important → False`) cannot be applied to prove `lost_important`.

**Corrected Analysis:**
1. Premises establish:
   - `lost_important → disappointed`
   - `lost_big → demoralized`
2. Given statement: `¬disappointed ∧ ¬demoralized`
3. Using contraposition:
   - `¬disappointed → ¬lost_important`
   - `¬demoralized → ¬lost_big`
4. Thus: `¬lost_important ∧ ¬lost_big`
5. Conclusion `lost_significant` (defined as `lost_important ∨ lost_big`) is unprovable since both disjuncts are false

**Corrected Lean Code:**
<lean>
axiom lost_important : Prop
axiom lost_big : Prop
axiom disappointed : Prop
axiom demoralized : Prop
axiom P1 : lost_important → disappointed
axiom P2 : lost_big → demoralized
axiom given : ¬disappointed ∧ ¬demoralized

def lost_significant : Prop := lost_important ∨ lost_big

-- Prove negation of conclusion
theorem not_lost_significant : ¬lost_significant := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl h_imp => exact given.left (P1 h_imp)
  | inr h_big => exact given.right (P2 h_big)

-- Failed proof attempt for original conclusion
theorem prove_significant : lost_significant := by
  have no_imp : ¬lost_important := fun h => given.left (P1 h)
  have no_big : ¬lost_big := fun h => given.right (P2 h)
  -- Cannot prove either disjunct:
  left; exact no_imp  -- Fails: requires lost_important but has ¬lost_important
</lean>

**Explanation:**
- `not_lost_significant` proves the team did **not** lose a significant game
- `prove_significant` shows the failed proof attempt:
   - `left` tries the `lost_important` case
   - `exact no_imp` fails because `no_imp` proves the negation of the required goal
- The right branch (`lost_big`) would fail similarly

**Conclusion:** The statement "The team lost a significant game" cannot be proven from the premises.
