The context and statement are translated into Lean as follows. The goal is to prove that Mark is dedicated to his sport given that he eats a healthy diet. However, after careful analysis, the premises do not provide sufficient logical connections to establish this conclusion.

<lean>
axiom Athlete : Type
axiom Mark : Athlete

-- Predicates
axiom TrainsProperly : Athlete → Prop
axiom EatsHealthy : Athlete → Prop
axiom EnhancedSkills : Athlete → Prop
axiom IncreasedStrength : Athlete → Prop
axiom LacksSkill : Athlete → Prop
axiom DeficientStrength : Athlete → Prop
axiom Dedicated : Athlete → Prop

-- Context axioms
axiom proper_training : ∀ a : Athlete, TrainsProperly a → EnhancedSkills a
axiom healthy_nutrition : ∀ a : Athlete, EatsHealthy a → IncreasedStrength a
axiom deficiency : ∀ a : Athlete, LacksSkill a ∨ DeficientStrength a
axiom dedication : ∀ a : Athlete, Dedicated a → TrainsProperly a

-- Given fact
axiom mark_healthy : EatsHealthy Mark

-- Attempt to prove Dedicated Mark
theorem mark_dedicated : Dedicated Mark := by
  -- We know Mark eats healthy, so he has increased strength.
  have mark_strength := healthy_nutrition Mark mark_healthy
  -- By the deficiency axiom, Mark either lacks skill or is deficient in strength.
  have mark_deficiency := deficiency Mark
  -- Since Mark has increased strength, assume DeficientStrength Mark is false?
  -- However, no axiom links IncreasedStrength and DeficientStrength as opposites.
  -- Without such a link, we cannot eliminate the disjunction to force LacksSkill Mark.
  -- Even if we could derive LacksSkill Mark, it doesn't connect to Dedicated Mark.
  -- Dedication only links Dedicated to TrainsProperly, not to EatsHealthy or strength.
  -- Thus, no path exists from EatsHealthy Mark to Dedicated Mark.
  sorry -- Proof incomplete
</lean>

The proof fails because:
1. There is no axiom relating `IncreasedStrength` and `DeficientStrength` (e.g., increased strength implying not deficient).
2. Even if Mark lacks skill, no premise connects skill status to dedication or training.
3. Dedication implies training, but training is unrelated to nutrition.

Thus, the conclusion cannot be proven from the premises.

ANSWER: Failure
