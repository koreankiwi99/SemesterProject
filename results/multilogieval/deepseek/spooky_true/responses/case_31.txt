The textual context provides normative statements about what one *should* do if they suspect cheating, but does not establish a factual link between suspicion and actions taken. The given statement describes Priya's actions (either not talking or not reassessing), but without axioms connecting "should" to actual behavior, we cannot prove that Priya suspected cheating. The Lean formalization reflects this gap, and the attempted proof fails due to insufficient logical connection between norms and actions.

variable (obj : Type)
variable (Priya : obj)
variable (SuspectsCheating : obj → Prop)
variable (ShouldHaveConversation : obj → Prop)
variable (ShouldReevaluate : obj → Prop)
variable (HadConversation : obj → Prop)
variable (ReevaluatedRelationship : obj → Prop)

axiom Premise1 : ∀ x, SuspectsCheating x → ShouldHaveConversation x
axiom Premise2 : ∀ x, SuspectsCheating x → ShouldReevaluate x
axiom Given : ¬ HadConversation Priya ∨ ¬ ReevaluatedRelationship Priya

theorem target : SuspectsCheating Priya :=
  by
  -- No axioms link 'ShouldHaveConversation'/'ShouldReevaluate' to actual actions.
  -- 'Given' describes actions, but norms don't imply factual behavior.
  -- Proof fails due to missing connection between obligations and actions.
