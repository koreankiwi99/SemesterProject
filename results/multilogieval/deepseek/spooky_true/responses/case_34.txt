ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to the use of "//" for comments in Lean 4, which is not allowed. The corrected code uses "--" for single-line comments instead. Additionally, the logical analysis revealed that the premises lead to a contradiction when combined with Dr. Lee's collaboration, allowing us to prove the conclusion via the principle of explosion.
