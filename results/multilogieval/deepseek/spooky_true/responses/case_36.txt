The reasoning text involves implications about actions to take when having computer problems and a statement about Mary's actions. I need to determine if we can prove that Mary was having problems with her computer based on the premises.

**Key points from the text:**
1. **Premise 1:** If someone has computer problems, they *should* try restarting.  
   This suggests a conditional relationship: `∀p, Problems p → ShouldRestart`
2. **Premise 2:** If there are computer issues, the user *should* check for updates.  
   Similarly: `∀p, Problems p → ShouldCheck`
3. **Given statement about Mary:** She either did not restart OR did not install updates.  
   Formalized as: `¬ DidRestart Mary ∨ ¬ DidInstall Mary`
4. **Question:** Was Mary having computer problems?  
   We need to prove `Problems Mary`.

**Critical distinction:**  
The premises use *should* (recommendation), but the statement refers to *actual actions* (`DidRestart`, `DidInstall`). There is **no provided link** between:
- What a person *should* do and what they *actually* do.
- The act of *checking* for updates (from premise 2) and *installing* updates (in the statement).

**Lean modeling:**
- Separate predicates for `ShouldRestart`, `ShouldCheck`, `DidRestart`, and `DidInstall`.
- No axioms connect "should" actions to "did" actions.
- No axioms relate checking updates to installing updates.

**Proof attempt:**  
Given the disconnect between recommendations (`Should*`) and actions (`Did*`), we cannot infer `Problems Mary` from the disjunction about her actions.  
- Mary might have problems but ignored recommendations (so `DidRestart` and `DidInstall` could be false).
- Mary might have no problems (making the disjunction true but `Problems Mary` false).

Since we cannot prove `Problems Mary`, the answer is **Failure**.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Mary : Person

axiom Problems : Person → Prop
axiom ShouldRestart : Person → Prop
axiom ShouldCheck : Person → Prop
axiom DidRestart : Person → Prop
axiom DidInstall : Person → Prop

axiom Premise1 : ∀ (p : Person), Problems p → ShouldRestart p
axiom Premise2 : ∀ (p : Person), Problems p → ShouldCheck p
axiom ActionStatement : ¬ DidRestart Mary ∨ ¬ DidInstall Mary

-- No theorems link: ShouldRestart → DidRestart, ShouldCheck → DidInstall, or ShouldCheck → DidInstall
