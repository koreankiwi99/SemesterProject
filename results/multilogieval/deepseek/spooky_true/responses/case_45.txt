The context provides general rules about redecorating, but the disjunction (watching DIY videos or reading blogs) applies only to the specific person mentioned, not necessarily to Matt. For Matt, we know he did not redo his living room, but we lack information about whether he read blogs. The general rules allow us to infer that Matt did not gain skills and did not watch DIY videos, but without the disjunction for Matt, we cannot prove he gets new decorating ideas.

axiom R1 : ∀ p : Person, WatchesDIY p → GainsSkills p

axiom R3 : ∀ p : Person, ReadsBlogs p → GetsNewIdeas p
axiom matt_not_redoes : ¬ RedoesLivingRoom Matt

theorem matt_no_skills : ¬ GainsSkills Matt :=
  fun h_skills : GainsSkills Matt =>
  matt_not_redoes (R2 Matt h_skills)

theorem matt_no_watch : ¬ WatchesDIY Matt :=
  fun h_watch : WatchesDIY Matt =>
  matt_no_skills (R1 Matt h_watch)

-- We cannot prove GetsNewIdeas Matt without knowing ReadsBlogs Matt.
