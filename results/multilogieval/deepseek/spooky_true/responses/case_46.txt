The reasoning involves proving that if Casey adopts a pet, she feels fulfilled. The premises are translated as follows:

- **Premise 1**: Volunteering implies helping the community.
- **Premise 2**: Adopting implies providing a home.
- **Premise 3**: For every person, they either volunteer or do not provide a home (simplified from the disjunction).
- **Premise 4**: Helping the community implies fulfillment.

Given that Casey adopts:
1. By Premise 2, adoption provides a home.
2. By Premise 3, since she provides a home, she must volunteer (as the alternative is false).
3. By Premise 1, volunteering helps the community.
4. By Premise 4, helping leads to fulfillment.

Thus, the entailment holds.
