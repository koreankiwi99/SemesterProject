The context describes a scenario involving a young athlete (Jesse) and their training regimen. The key logical relationships are:

1. If Jesse does sprint workouts (S), then running form/stamina improves (R): `S → R`
2. Jesse either sprints or takes stretching classes (or both): `S ∨ T`
3. If Jesse takes stretching classes (T), then they become more flexible and less injury-prone (F): `T → F`
4. It is given that running form/stamina did NOT improve: `¬R`

From `¬R` and `S → R`, we derive `¬S` (by contraposition). With `S ∨ T` and `¬S`, we conclude `T` (disjunctive syllogism). Finally, `T → F` and `T` imply `F`. Thus, Jesse did become more flexible and less prone to injury.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Jesse : obj
axiom Sprints : obj → Prop
axiom RunningImproved : obj → Prop
axiom TakesStretching : obj → Prop
axiom FlexibleInjuryFree : obj → Prop

-- Premises:
axiom sprint_imp_running : ∀ x : obj, Sprints x → RunningImproved x
axiom disjunction : ∀ x : obj, Sprints x ∨ TakesStretching x
axiom stretching_imp_flex : ∀ x : obj, TakesStretching x → FlexibleInjuryFree x

-- Given fact:
axiom running_not_improved : ¬ RunningImproved Jesse

-- Proof that Jesse is flexible and injury-free:
theorem jesse_flexible : FlexibleInjuryFree Jesse := by
  -- From sprint_imp_running and running_not_improved, Jesse doesn't sprint
  have no_sprint : ¬ Sprints Jesse := fun h => running_not_improved (sprint_imp_running Jesse h)
  -- From disjunction and no_sprint, Jesse must take stretching classes
  have takes_stretch : TakesStretching Jesse := by
    cases disjunction Jesse with
    | inl spr => exact False.elim (no_sprint spr)
    | inr ts => exact ts
  -- Apply stretching implication
  exact stretching_imp_flex Jesse takes_stretch
