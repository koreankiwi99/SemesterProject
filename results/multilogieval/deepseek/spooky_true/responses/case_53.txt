The reasoning involves Mary's situation. Given that her artwork did not stand out, we deduce she did not improve her technique (from premise 2 via contraposition). This implies she did not practice often (from premise 1 via contraposition). Since she either practiced or took a class (premise 3), she must have taken the art class. Therefore, she learned new methods (premise 4).

The compilation errors occurred due to issues with the `cases` tactic and the way hypotheses were handled. The corrected Lean code uses a more robust approach by:
1. Defining the necessary objects and predicates
2. Stating all premises clearly
3. Using contraposition to derive ¬TechniqueImproves Mary and ¬PracticesOften Mary
4. Handling the disjunction (P3) with cases and contradiction tactic
5. Applying P4 directly in the right branch

The corrected proof shows that Mary must have taken an art class (since she didn't practice often), and therefore learned new methods.
