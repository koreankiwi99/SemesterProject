The goal is to determine if "there was a lot of booing" (B) follows from the given premises and the information that "the crowd did not start cheering loudly" (¬C). The premises are:

1. If the team scores early (S), then the crowd gets pumped up (P): `S → P`.
2. If the crowd gets pumped up (P), then they start cheering loudly (C): `P → C`.
3. Either the team scores early (S), or they play their rival team (R), or both: `S ∨ R`.
4. If the crowd is pumped up (P), then there is a lot of booing (B): `P → B`.

Given ¬C, we derive ¬P (from premise 2 by contraposition). Then, from ¬P and premise 1, we derive ¬S (by contraposition). Using ¬S and premise 3, we derive R (by disjunctive syllogism). However, there is no premise linking R (playing the rival team) to B (booing). Premise 4 requires P to derive B, but we have ¬P. Thus, B cannot be proven from the given information.

<lean>
axiom S : Prop   -- team scores early
axiom P : Prop   -- crowd gets pumped up
axiom C : Prop   -- crowd cheers loudly
axiom R : Prop   -- play rival team
axiom B : Prop   -- lot of booing

axiom A1 : S → P
axiom A2 : P → C
axiom A3 : S ∨ R
axiom A4 : P → B

theorem booing_conclusion : ¬C → B :=
  fun h : ¬C =>
  have np : ¬P := fun p : P => h (A2 p)   -- ¬C and A2 imply ¬P
  have ns : ¬S := fun s : S => np (A1 s)   -- ¬P and A1 imply ¬S
  have r : R := Or.resolve_left A3 ns      -- ¬S and A3 imply R
  -- No axiom connects R to B, and A4 requires P (which is false) to prove B
  -- Thus, B cannot be proven
  sorry  -- Proof incomplete; B is not derivable
</lean>

The proof for `B` fails because the premises do not provide a path to conclude `B` when given `¬C`. Therefore, we cannot affirm that there was a lot of booing.

ANSWER: Failure
