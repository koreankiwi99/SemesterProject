The reasoning involves general principles and specific information about Emma. The premises establish:

1. There exists someone who wanted to play guitar songs.
2. For any person, learning basic chords enables playing simple songs.
3. Playing simple songs enables entertaining friends.
4. Anyone who wanted to play either learned chords or took lessons (or both).
5. Taking lessons implies gaining music theory knowledge.

Emma is specified as unable to entertain friends. From the general principles (premises 2 and 3), this implies Emma cannot play simple songs and therefore did not learn basic chords. However, premise 4 (the disjunction) only applies to those who wanted to play. Since there is no evidence that Emma is the person mentioned in premise 1 or that she wanted to play, we cannot apply premise 4 to her. Thus, we have no information about whether she took lessons or gained music theory knowledge. The conclusion cannot be proven from the premises.

-- Prove Emma gains music theory? We cannot.
theorem emma_theory : GainsMusicTheory Emma := 
  -- Derive that Emma cannot play simple songs and didn't learn chords
  have no_simple_songs : ¬ CanPlaySimpleSongs Emma := 
    fun h => emma_cannot_entertain (songs_enable_entertain Emma h)
  have no_chords : ¬ LearnedBasicChords Emma := 
    fun h => no_simple_songs (chords_enable_songs Emma h)
  -- But we lack evidence that Emma wanted to play, so disjunction doesn't apply
  -- No way to prove she took lessons or gained theory
  sorry -- Proof fails here
