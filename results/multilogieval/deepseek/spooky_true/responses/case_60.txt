The reasoning involves determining if John went to bed late given that he knows it is not time to get ready. The premises are translated into logical propositions, and an attempt is made to prove that John went to bed late (`went_to_bed_late`). However, the proof shows that the premises lead to the conclusion that John did **not** go to bed late (`¬ went_to_bed_late`). Since the goal is to prove `went_to_bed_late`, and it cannot be proven (in fact, its negation is proven), the attempt fails.

The compilation error occurred because the `intro` tactic was used incorrectly when the goal was not an implication. The proof attempted to derive a contradiction by assuming `went_to_bed_late`, but this approach was flawed because the goal requires proving `went_to_bed_late` directly, which cannot be done with the given premises.

The corrected Lean code:

axiom alarm : Prop
axiom time_to_get_ready : Prop
axiom missed_bus : Prop
axiom late_for_school : Prop
axiom got_up_late : Prop
axiom went_to_bed_late : Prop

axiom not_ready : ¬ time_to_get_ready
axiom missed_bus_imp_late : missed_bus → late_for_school
axiom disjunction : alarm ∨ ¬ late_for_school
axiom got_up_late_imp_missed : got_up_late → missed_bus
axiom went_to_bed_late_imp_got_up_late : went_to_bed_late → got_up_late

theorem goal : went_to_bed_late := by
  -- Prove ¬alarm from premises
  have no_alarm : ¬ alarm := fun a => not_ready (alarm_imp_ready a)
  -- Case analysis on disjunction
  cases disjunction with
  | inl a => 
      -- Contradiction: alarm is true but no_alarm says it's false
      exact False.elim (no_alarm a)
  | inr not_late =>
      -- Prove ¬missed_bus from ¬late_for_school
      have no_missed_bus : ¬ missed_bus := fun mb => not_late (missed_bus_imp_late mb)
      -- Prove ¬got_up_late from ¬missed_bus
      have no_got_up_late : ¬ got_up_late := fun gul => no_missed_bus (got_up_late_imp_missed gul)
      -- Attempt to prove went_to_bed_late fails here
      -- We have ¬got_up_late and the implication went_to_bed_late → got_up_late,
      -- which allows us to prove ¬went_to_bed_late, but not went_to_bed_late.
      -- No available tactics can prove the positive statement.
      sorry -- Proof fails at this point
</lean>

**Explanation of the proof attempt:**
1. From `¬time_to_get_ready` and `alarm → time_to_get_ready`, we derive `¬alarm`.
2. Using the disjunction `alarm ∨ ¬late_for_school`:
   - If `alarm` is true, we get a contradiction with `¬alarm`.
   - If `¬late_for_school` is true:
     - We derive `¬missed_bus` (from `missed_bus → late_for_school`)
     - Then `¬got_up_late` (from `got_up_late → missed_bus`)
3. At this point, we need to prove `went_to_bed_late`, but:
   - We have `went_to_bed_late → got_up_late`
   - We have `¬got_up_late`
   - This combination proves `¬went_to_bed_late` (via modus tollens), not `went_to_bed_late`.
4. Since there is no positive evidence for `went_to_bed_late` in the premises, the proof fails.
