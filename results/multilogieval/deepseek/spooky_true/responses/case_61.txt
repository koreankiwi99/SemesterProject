The context states a universal principle: if a student attends lectures regularly, then diligent studying implies excelling in the course. The premises are that Priya studied diligently but did not excel. We prove that Priya did not attend lectures regularly by showing that assuming attendance leads to a contradiction (since diligent study would then imply excelling, contradicting the lack of excelling).
