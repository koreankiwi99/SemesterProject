The reasoning involves proving that Linda did not plant disease-resistant varieties based on the given premises. The gardener's saying establishes a conditional relationship: if someone plants disease-resistant varieties and waters/feeds properly, they will have a bountiful harvest. Linda watered and fed properly but did not have a bountiful harvest. Therefore, by contraposition, Linda must not have planted disease-resistant varieties.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Linda : Person

axiom WaterFeedProper : Person → Prop
axiom BountifulHarvest : Person → Prop

axiom gardener_saying : ∀ (p : Person), PlantsDR p → (WaterFeedProper p → BountifulHarvest p)

  intro h_dr
  have h_implication : WaterFeedProper Linda → BountifulHarvest Linda := gardener_saying Linda h_dr
  have h_bountiful : BountifulHarvest Linda := h_implication linda_water_feed
