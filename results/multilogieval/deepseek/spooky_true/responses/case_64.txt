The reasoning text is translated into Lean as follows. The goal is to prove that Priya attended lectures regularly based on the given premises. However, the premises lead to the opposite conclusion.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Priya : obj
axiom Attends : obj → Prop
axiom Revises : obj → Prop
axiom PerformsWell : obj → Prop

-- Premise: If a student attends lectures regularly, then if they spend sufficient time revising, they will perform well on exams.
axiom A1 : ∀ s : obj, Attends s → (Revises s → PerformsWell s)

-- Priya spent sufficient time revising.
axiom A2 : Revises Priya

-- Priya did not perform well on her exams.
axiom A3 : ¬ PerformsWell Priya

-- Attempt to prove: Priya attended lectures regularly.
theorem target : Attends Priya := by
  -- Apply the general premise to Priya
  have H : Attends Priya → (Revises Priya → PerformsWell Priya) := A1 Priya
  -- Assume Attends Priya (the goal) to derive implications
  intro hAttend
  -- Apply H with the attendance assumption
  have H2 : Revises Priya → PerformsWell Priya := H hAttend
  -- Use the fact that Priya revised (A2)
  have H3 : PerformsWell Priya := H2 A2
  -- This contradicts A3 (¬PerformsWell Priya)
  exact A3 H3
  -- The proof leads to a contradiction under the assumption of Attends Priya.
  -- Therefore, Attends Priya cannot be proven from the premises.

</lean>

The Lean code attempts to prove `Attends Priya` but encounters a contradiction: assuming `Attends Priya` leads to `PerformsWell Priya` (via `A1` and `A2`), which contradicts `A3`. This means `Attends Priya` is false under the premises, so it cannot be proven. The proof is incomplete (marked with `sorry`), indicating failure to prove the conclusion.

ITERATION 2

The compilation error occurred because the `intro` tactic was used incorrectly. The goal was `Attends Priya`, which is a simple proposition, not an implication or universally quantified statement. Therefore, `intro` is not applicable here. 

After re-examining the premises:
1. If a student attends lectures regularly, then sufficient revision implies good exam performance.
2. Priya revised sufficiently.
3. Priya did not perform well.

We attempt to prove `Attends Priya`. However, assuming `Attends Priya` leads to a contradiction: it implies `PerformsWell Priya` (via premises 1 and 2), which contradicts premise 3. This means `Attends Priya` must be false, so it cannot be proven from the premises. The Lean code reflects this by leaving the proof incomplete (`sorry`).

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Priya : obj
axiom Attends : obj → Prop
axiom Revises : obj → Prop
axiom PerformsWell : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ s : obj, Attends s → (Revises s → PerformsWell s)
axiom A2 : Revises Priya
axiom A3 : ¬ PerformsWell Priya

theorem target : Attends Priya := by
  -- Attempt to prove by contradiction: assume ¬Attends Priya would require classical logic
  -- but even then, we have no contradiction from ¬Attends Priya. Instead, assuming Attends Priya leads to contradiction.
  have H : Attends Priya → PerformsWell Priya := fun h => A1 Priya h A2
  -- If we had Attends Priya, we'd get PerformsWell Priya (via H), contradicting A3
  -- But this only proves ¬Attends Priya, not Attends Priya.
  sorry  -- No valid proof exists
