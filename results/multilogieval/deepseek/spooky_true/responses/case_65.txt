The reasoning involves evaluating whether the wood was of high quality given the premises and observed outcomes. The key steps are:

1. **Premise**: If the wood is high quality, then precise joints imply a sturdy product.  
   Symbolically: `wood_high → (joints_precise → sturdy)`

2. **Observations**:  
   - Joints were cut precisely (`joints_precise` is true).  
   - The product was not sturdy (`sturdy` is false).  

3. **Analysis**:  
   - If `wood_high` were true, then with `joints_precise`, we must have `sturdy` (by the premise).  
   - But `sturdy` is false, leading to a contradiction.  
   - Thus, `wood_high` must be false.  

However, the query asks: "Was the wood he used of high quality?" This requires proving the **affirmative** statement (`wood_high`). While we can prove `¬wood_high`, we cannot prove `wood_high` itself from the premises. Therefore, the proof attempt for the affirmative conclusion fails.

axiom wood_high : Prop
axiom joints_precise : Prop
axiom sturdy : Prop
axiom premise : wood_high → (joints_precise → sturdy)
axiom given_precise : joints_precise
axiom given_not_sturdy : ¬ sturdy

-- Attempt to prove wood_high (affirmative quality) fails
theorem prove_high_quality : wood_high := by
  -- Assume wood_high to derive contradiction
  have impl : wood_high → sturdy := fun h => premise h given_precise
  have not_wood : ¬ wood_high := fun h => given_not_sturdy (impl h)
  -- Cannot prove wood_high; contradiction blocks affirmation
