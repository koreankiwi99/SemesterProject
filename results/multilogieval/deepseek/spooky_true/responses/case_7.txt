The reasoning involves translating the context into logical propositions and proving whether the harvest was abundant based on the gardener's actions and outcomes.

- **SoilEnriched**: The gardener enriched the soil by adding compost and fertilizer.
- **PlantsHealthy**: The plants grew strong, indicating health.
- **HarvestAbundant**: The plants produced lots of vegetables, meaning an abundant harvest.
- **Rule**: If plants are healthy, they yield bigger harvests (i.e., PlantsHealthy → HarvestAbundant).

The context explicitly states that the plants were healthy and produced lots of vegetables, so **PlantsHealthy** and **HarvestAbundant** are directly given. Additionally, the rule confirms that healthy plants lead to abundant harvests. Therefore, **HarvestAbundant** is provable.
