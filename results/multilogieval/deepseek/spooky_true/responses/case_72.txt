The reasoning involves translating the given context into logical propositions and attempting to prove whether "If Sam starts cooking, then the pantry is empty" follows from the premises. The premises are:

1. If close to dinnertime, then start cooking: `close → start_cooking`
2. If go shopping, then can make dinner: `go_shopping → make_dinner`
3. Either close to dinnertime or won't make dinner: `close ∨ ¬make_dinner`
4. If fridge empty, then must go shopping: `fridge_empty → go_shopping`
5. If no ingredients in pantry, then fridge empty: `pantry_empty → fridge_empty`

The goal is to prove: `start_cooking → pantry_empty`

However, after formalizing the premises in Lean and attempting the proof, it becomes clear that the conclusion does not follow. Specifically:
- Assuming `start_cooking` holds, there is no chain of implications that forces `pantry_empty` to be true.
- The disjunction `close ∨ ¬make_dinner` does not provide sufficient constraints: 
  - If `close` is true, it only confirms `start_cooking` (already known) but does not link to `pantry_empty`.
  - If `¬make_dinner` is true, it prevents deriving `go_shopping` (and thus `pantry_empty`) since `go_shopping` would require `fridge_empty`, which depends on `pantry_empty`.
- Without additional premises (e.g., linking `start_cooking` to `go_shopping` or `close` to `pantry_empty`), the proof fails.

A counterexample exists: 
- Set `pantry_empty = false`, `fridge_empty = false`, `go_shopping = false`, `make_dinner = false`, `close = false`, and `start_cooking = true`. 
- All premises hold, but `start_cooking` is true while `pantry_empty` is false.

Thus, the proof fails.
