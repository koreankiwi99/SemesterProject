The context states a conditional relationship for athletes: if an athlete trains with dedication and gets adequate rest, they will perform at their peak. For Simone, we know she got adequate rest but did not perform at her peak. The goal is to prove that Simone trained with dedication.

In Lean, we model athletes as a type, with Simone as a constant. We define predicates for training with dedication, adequate rest, and peak performance. The coach's statement becomes a universal axiom. The given facts about Simone are also axioms.

Attempting to prove `trains_with_dedication Simone`:
- Assume `trains_with_dedication Simone`.
- By the coach's axiom, with adequate rest (known for Simone), this implies `peak_performance Simone`.
- However, we know `¬ peak_performance Simone`, leading to a contradiction.
- Thus, the assumption `trains_with_dedication Simone` must be false, meaning we cannot prove it.

Therefore, the proof of `trains_with_dedication Simone` fails.

axiom Athlete : Type
axiom Simone : Athlete
axiom trains_with_dedication : Athlete → Prop
axiom adequate_rest : Athlete → Prop
axiom peak_performance : Athlete → Prop

axiom coach_axiom : ∀ (a : Athlete), trains_with_dedication a → adequate_rest a → peak_performance a
axiom simone_rest : adequate_rest Simone
axiom simone_not_peak : ¬ peak_performance Simone

theorem prove_dedication : trains_with_dedication Simone := 
  by 
    -- Attempt to prove dedication
    -- No direct evidence for dedication; using coach_axiom requires peak_performance
    have h_peak : peak_performance Simone := coach_axiom Simone ?_ simone_rest
    -- But simone_not_peak contradicts this
    exact False.elim (simone_not_peak h_peak)
    -- No way to fill the underscore (proof of dedication) without circularity
    sorry -- Proof fails
