The reasoning involves translating the natural language premises into logical propositions and then attempting to prove whether Alex made a to-do list given that he did not relax. The premises are:

1. If it is the weekend, then Alex relaxes: `weekend → relax`
2. If Alex finishes tasks, then he has a clear mind: `finishTasks → clearMind`
3. Either it is the weekend or Alex does not have a clear mind: `weekend ∨ ¬clearMind`
4. If Alex is organized, then he finishes tasks: `organized → finishTasks`
5. If Alex made a to-do list, then he is organized: `madeToList → organized`

Given that Alex does not relax (`¬relax`), we need to determine if he made a to-do list (`madeToList`).

From `¬relax` and premise 1 (`weekend → relax`), we derive `¬weekend` (modus tollens). Using premise 3 (`weekend ∨ ¬clearMind`) and `¬weekend`, we get `¬clearMind`. From premise 2 (`finishTasks → clearMind`) and `¬clearMind`, we derive `¬finishTasks` (contraposition). Using premise 4 (`organized → finishTasks`) and `¬finishTasks`, we get `¬organized`. Finally, from premise 5 (`madeToList → organized`) and `¬organized`, we derive `¬madeToList`.

Thus, we have proven that Alex did **not** make a to-do list (`¬madeToList`). However, the question asks whether we can prove that he **did** make a to-do list (`madeToList`). Since we have proven the negation, we cannot prove the affirmative statement. Therefore, the attempt to prove `madeToList` fails.

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The error occurred because the `apply` tactic was misused. The proof attempted to use `h_not_madeToList` (which is `¬madeToList`) to prove `madeToList`, which is impossible. The derivation from the premises actually proves `¬madeToList`, not `madeToList`. Therefore, the theorem `goal : madeToList` cannot be proven under the given premises.

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom weekend : Prop
axiom relax : Prop
axiom finishTasks : Prop
axiom clearMind : Prop
axiom organized : Prop
axiom madeToList : Prop

axiom P1 : weekend → relax
axiom P3 : finishTasks → clearMind
axiom P4 : weekend ∨ ¬clearMind
axiom P5 : organized → finishTasks
axiom P6 : madeToList → organized

axiom not_relax : ¬relax

theorem goal : madeToList :=
  by
    -- Derive ¬weekend from ¬relax and P1
    have h_not_weekend : ¬weekend := fun w => not_relax (P1 w)
    -- From P4 and ¬weekend, derive ¬clearMind
    have h_not_clearMind : ¬clearMind := by
      cases P4 with
      | inl w => exact absurd w h_not_weekend
      | inr not_clear => exact not_clear
    -- From P3 and ¬clearMind, derive ¬finishTasks
    have h_not_finishTasks : ¬finishTasks := fun ft => h_not_clearMind (P3 ft)
    -- From P5 and ¬finishTasks, derive ¬organized
    have h_not_organized : ¬organized := fun org => h_not_finishTasks (P5 org)
    -- From P6 and ¬organized, derive ¬madeToList
    have h_not_madeToList : ¬madeToList := fun mt => h_not_organized (P6 mt)
    -- Cannot prove madeToList (we have proven its negation)
    admit  -- Proof failure

-- The premises prove ¬madeToList, not madeToList
</lean>

**Explanation of the proof:**
1. `¬relax` and `P1` (weekend → relax) imply `¬weekend`.
2. `¬weekend` and `P4` (weekend ∨ ¬clearMind) imply `¬clearMind`.
3. `¬clearMind` and `P3` (finishTasks → clearMind) imply `¬finishTasks`.
4. `¬finishTasks` and `P5` (organized → finishTasks) imply `¬organized`.
5. `¬organized` and `P6` (madeToList → organized) imply `¬madeToList`.

Since the premises and `¬relax` lead to `¬madeToList`, it is impossible to prove `madeToList`. The `admit` tactic acknowledges the failure to complete the proof.
