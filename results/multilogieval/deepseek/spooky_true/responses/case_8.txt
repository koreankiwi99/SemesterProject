The reasoning involves evaluating whether, given the premises, we can conclude that if the chef cooked a complicated recipe, the food tasted delicious.

**Premises:**
1. If a chef uses fresh ingredients, the food tastes delicious. (Universal: ∀x, UsesFresh x → TastesDelicious x)
2. If a chef cooks a complicated recipe, it takes more time. (Irrelevant to taste)
3. The chef used fresh ingredients. (Specific fact: UsesFresh c)

**Conclusion to evaluate:** CookComplicated c → TastesDelicious c

Since premise 3 states the chef used fresh ingredients, by premise 1, the food must taste delicious (TastesDelicious c). Therefore, regardless of whether the chef cooked a complicated recipe (CookComplicated c), the consequent TastesDelicious c holds. Thus, the implication CookComplicated c → TastesDelicious c is true.
