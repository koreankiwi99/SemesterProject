The reasoning involves propositional logic with implications and disjunctions. The premises establish relationships between rain, the softball game, pool opening, swimming, enjoyment, and smiles. The goal is to prove that if the kids did not swim, then the players smiled.

<lean>
axiom Rain : Prop
axiom Game : Prop
axiom Open : Prop
axiom Swim : Prop
axiom Enjoy : Prop
axiom Smiles : Prop

axiom A1 : ¬Rain → Game
axiom A2 : Open → Swim
axiom A3 : ¬Rain ∨ Open
axiom A4 : Game → Enjoy
axiom A5 : Enjoy → Smiles

theorem target : ¬Swim → Smiles := by
  intro no_swim
  have no_open : ¬Open := by
    intro open_
    apply no_swim
    exact A2 open_
  cases A3
  case inl no_rain =>
    have game : Game := A1 no_rain
    have enjoy : Enjoy := A4 game
    exact A5 enjoy
  case inr open_ =>
    contradiction
</lean>

The proof proceeds as follows:
1. Assume kids didn't swim (¬Swim).
2. Prove pool wasn't open (¬Open) by contraposition of A2 (if pool open then swim).
3. Use disjunction A3 (¬Rain ∨ Open):
   - If ¬Rain: Game occurs (A1), players enjoy (A4), they smile (A5).
   - If Open: Contradiction with ¬Open (from step 2).
Thus, ¬Swim implies Smiles.

ANSWER: Yes
