The reasoning involves deriving whether Amy has knowledge about song structure given that she cannot play any songs. The premises establish logical relationships between practicing chords, developing muscle memory, playing songs, learning music theory, and gaining knowledge. Specifically:

- If someone practices chords daily (P), they develop muscle memory (M): ∀x, P x → M x
- If they develop muscle memory (M), they can play simple songs (S): ∀x, M x → S x
- Either they practice chords daily (P) or learn music theory (T) (or both): ∀x, P x ∨ T x
- If they learn music theory (T), they gain knowledge about song structure (K): ∀x, T x → K x

Given that Amy cannot play any songs (¬S Amy), we derive:
1. ¬S Amy implies ¬M Amy (contrapositive of M → S)
2. ¬M Amy implies ¬P Amy (contrapositive of P → M)
3. Since ¬P Amy and P ∨ T must hold for Amy, T Amy must be true
4. T Amy implies K Amy (from T → K)

Thus, Amy has knowledge about song structure.
