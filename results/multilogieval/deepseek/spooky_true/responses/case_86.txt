The reasoning involves deriving that Priya's parents took her out for ice cream if there was a snowstorm, based on the given premises. Here's the formalization and proof:

<lean>
axiom Student : Type
axiom Priya : Student
axiom Snowstorm : Prop
axiom SchoolCanceled : Prop
axiom StudiesHard : Student → Prop
axiom GoodGrades : Student → Prop
axiom ProudParents : Student → Prop
axiom IceCream : Student → Prop

axiom study_to_grades : ∀ s : Student, StudiesHard s → GoodGrades s
axiom snow_to_cancel : Snowstorm → SchoolCanceled
axiom priya_or_not_cancel : StudiesHard Priya ∨ ¬ SchoolCanceled
axiom grades_to_proud : ∀ s : Student, GoodGrades s → ProudParents s
axiom proud_to_icecream : ∀ s : Student, ProudParents s → IceCream s

theorem snowstorm_icecream : Snowstorm → IceCream Priya := by
  intro h_snow
  have h_cancel : SchoolCanceled := snow_to_cancel h_snow
  have h_study : StudiesHard Priya := by
    cases priya_or_not_cancel with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr nh => contradiction
  have h_grades : GoodGrades Priya := study_to_grades Priya h_study
  have h_proud : ProudParents Priya := grades_to_proud Priya h_grades
  exact proud_to_icecream Priya h_proud
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**  
1. Assume a snowstorm occurs (`h_snow`).  
2. By premise 2, this implies school is canceled (`h_cancel`).  
3. Premise 3 gives a disjunction: Priya studied hard OR school wasn't canceled.  
   - If Priya studied hard, we use that directly.  
   - If school wasn't canceled, it contradicts `h_cancel`, yielding absurdity.  
4. Thus Priya studied hard (`h_study`).  
5. Premise 1 shows this leads to good grades (`h_grades`).  
6. Premise 4 converts good grades to proud parents (`h_proud`).  
7. Premise 5 shows proud parents result in ice cream.  

The conclusion follows: Snowstorm → IceCream Priya.

ANSWER: Yes
