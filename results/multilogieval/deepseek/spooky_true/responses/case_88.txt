The reasoning requires proving that if the cake batter contained eggs, then the guests will be happy. The premises are analyzed as follows:

1. **Premise 1**: Oven temperature set to 350° → cake bakes properly (`OvenTemp350 → BakeProperly`).
2. **Premise 2**: Batter contains eggs → cake is fluffy (`ContainsEggs → Fluffy`). This premise is unused in the proof but is declared for completeness.
3. **Premise 3**: Either oven set correctly (to 350°) OR batter lacks eggs (`OvenTemp350 ∨ ¬ContainsEggs`).
4. **Premise 4**: Cake bakes properly → tastes delicious (`BakeProperly → Tasty`).
5. **Premise 5**: Cake tastes delicious → guests happy (`Tasty → HappyGuests`).

**Proof strategy**:
- Assume `ContainsEggs` (batter contains eggs).
- From Premise 3: `OvenTemp350 ∨ ¬ContainsEggs`. Since `ContainsEggs` is true, `¬ContainsEggs` is false. Thus, `OvenTemp350` must hold (by case analysis and contradiction).
- Apply Premise 1: `OvenTemp350 → BakeProperly`, so `BakeProperly`.
- Apply Premise 4: `BakeProperly → Tasty`, so `Tasty`.
- Apply Premise 5: `Tasty → HappyGuests`, so `HappyGuests`.

Thus, `ContainsEggs → HappyGuests` is proven.
