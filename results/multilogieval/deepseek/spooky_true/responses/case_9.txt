The reasoning involves interpreting the premises and deriving the conclusion that there is enough food at Sam's birthday party. The key steps are:

1. **Premise Interpretation**:
   - If any guest brings a dish, there is enough food for everyone: `∀ g, BringsDish g → EnoughFood`.
   - If it's a birthday party, there is cake and ice cream: `BirthdayParty → Cake ∧ IceCream`.
   - Either someone brought a dish or there was no birthday cake: `(∃ g, BringsDish g) ∨ ¬Cake`.

2. **Given Information**:
   - It is Sam's birthday party: `BirthdayParty`.

3. **Derivation**:
   - From `BirthdayParty` and the second premise, deduce `Cake` (and `IceCream`).
   - With `Cake` true, the disjunction `(∃ g, BringsDish g) ∨ ¬Cake` forces `∃ g, BringsDish g` (since `¬Cake` is false).
   - Using the existential witness `g` where `BringsDish g`, apply the first premise to get `EnoughFood`.

Thus, Sam has enough food for everyone.
