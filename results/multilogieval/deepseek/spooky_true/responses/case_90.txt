The reasoning text is translated into Lean axioms, and the statement "If the fans will not be more emotionally invested, was the atmosphere electric?" is formalized as `¬ emotionally_invested → electric`. The proof demonstrates that under the given premises, if fans are not emotionally invested, the atmosphere must be electric. This is because:
- The home team is winning or it's a rivalry game (or both) by A3.
- If it's a rivalry game, fans would be emotionally invested (A2), contradicting the assumption of no emotional investment.
- Thus, the home team must be winning, leading to a loud and energized crowd (A1), and therefore an electric atmosphere (A4).

The Lean code formalizes this reasoning and successfully proves the theorem.

<lean>
axiom winning : Prop
axiom rivalry : Prop
axiom loud : Prop
axiom energized : Prop
axiom emotionally_invested : Prop
axiom electric : Prop

axiom A1 : winning → (loud ∧ energized)
axiom A2 : rivalry → emotionally_invested
axiom A3 : winning ∨ rivalry
axiom A4 : (loud ∧ energized) → electric

theorem atmosphere_electric : ¬ emotionally_invested → electric :=
  fun h : ¬ emotionally_invested =>
  Or.elim A3
    (fun win : winning => A4 (A1 win))
    (fun riv : rivalry => absurd (A2 riv) h)
