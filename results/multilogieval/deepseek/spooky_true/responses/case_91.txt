The reasoning involves proving that if there was no noise level increase, then the police were called to intervene. The premises establish that noise must occur due to either a party or drum practice (or both), making the absence of noise logically impossible. Thus, assuming no noise leads to a contradiction, from which any conclusion (including police intervention) follows.

<lean>
axiom P : Prop   -- There is a party
axiom D : Prop   -- Someone is practicing drums
axiom N : Prop   -- Noise levels go up
axiom C : Prop   -- Neighbors complain
axiom I : Prop   -- Police are called

axiom T1 : P → N   -- Party causes noise
axiom T2 : D → N   -- Drums cause noise
axiom T3 : P ∨ D   -- At least one event occurs
axiom T4 : P → C   -- Party noise causes complaints
axiom T5 : C → I   -- Complaints trigger police

theorem police_intervention : ¬N → I := by
  intro h_noNoise
  have h_noParty : ¬P := fun h_party => h_noNoise (T1 h_party)
  have h_noDrums : ¬D := fun h_drums => h_noNoise (T2 h_drums)
  cases T3 with
  | inl h_party => exact False.elim (h_noParty h_party)
  | inr h_drums => exact False.elim (h_noDrums h_drums)
</lean>
