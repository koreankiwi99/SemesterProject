ANSWER: Yes

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect syntax for declaring multiple axioms in a single line. The corrected code declares each proposition and premise separately. The theorem proves that if the kids are not hyper, then they have lots of homework by:
1. Assuming ¬Hyper
2. Deriving ¬Pizza from ¬Hyper and P2
3. Case analysis on P3 (SubstituteTeacher ∨ Pizza):
   - If SubstituteTeacher: derive Homework via P1→GoofOff→¬LearnMuch→Homework
   - If Pizza: contradiction (P2 yields Hyper, contradicting ¬Hyper)
4. Both cases yield Homework
