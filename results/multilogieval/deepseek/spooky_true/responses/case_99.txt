The reasoning involves proving that heavy rain leads to attracting butterflies based on the given premises. The proof proceeds as follows:

1. **Premise 2**: Heavy rain (R) implies saturated soil (S).  
   ∴ Given R, we derive S: `S := P2 hR`  
2. **Premise 3**: Either watered routinely (W) or soil not saturated (¬S).  
   With S established (from step 1), ¬S is false. Thus, W must hold (disjunctive syllogism).  
3. **Premise 1**: Watering routinely (W) implies blooming flowers (B).  
   ∴ With W, we derive B: `B := P1 hW`  
4. **Premise 4**: Blooming flowers (B) implies fragrance release (F).  
   ∴ With B, we derive F: `F := P4 hB`  
5. **Premise 5**: Fragrance (F) implies attracting butterflies (A).  
   ∴ With F, we derive A: `A := P5 hF`  

Thus, R → A is proven. The Lean code formalizes this reasoning:

<lean>
axiom W : Prop  -- Watered routinely
axiom R : Prop  -- Heavy rain
axiom S : Prop  -- Soil saturated
axiom B : Prop  -- Flowers bloom
axiom F : Prop  -- Release fragrance
axiom A : Prop  -- Attract butterflies

axiom P1 : W → B
axiom P2 : R → S
axiom P3 : W ∨ ¬S
axiom P4 : B → F
axiom P5 : F → A

theorem rain_attracts_butterflies : R → A := by

  | inl hW => 
      have hB : B := P1 hW
      have hF : F := P4 hB
      exact P5 hF

      contradiction  -- hS and hnotS contradict
