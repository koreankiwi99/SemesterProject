axiom S : Prop  -- offers great customer service
axiom E : Prop  -- hosts author events
axiom R : Prop  -- reputation grows
axiom V : Prop  -- more customers visit (traffic increases)
axiom Rev : Prop  -- revenue improves

axiom h1 : S → R        -- great service implies reputation grows
axiom h2 : E → V        -- hosting events implies more customers visit
axiom h3 : S ∨ E        -- either great service or events
axiom h4 : V → Rev      -- more customers implies revenue improves

axiom decreased_service : ¬ S  -- service quality decreased

theorem revenue_improved : Rev := by
  have e : E := Or.elim h3 (fun s => False.elim (decreased_service s)) (fun e => e)
  have v : V := h2 e
  exact h4 v
