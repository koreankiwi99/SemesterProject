-- If a city experiences a drought, authorities should implement water restrictions.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Drought x → WaterLimits x
-- Drought conditions require rationing water usage.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Drought x → Rationing x

-- Either the city did not enforce water limits, or it did not ration water usage.
