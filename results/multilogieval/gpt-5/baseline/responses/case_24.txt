-- If the temperature dropped below freezing, then there would be snow on the ground.
axiom R1 : BelowFreezing → SnowOnGround

-- If someone builds a snowman, then there is enough snow.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, BuildsSnowman x → EnoughSnow

-- Either it was below freezing, or there was not enough snow, or both.
axiom D : BelowFreezing ∨ ¬EnoughSnow ∨ (BelowFreezing ∧ ¬EnoughSnow)

-- If someone loves winter, then they build snowmen.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, LovesWinter x → BuildsSnowman x

-- From no snow on the ground, Mary does not love winter.
