axiom obj : Type
axiom John : obj

-- Global/time-related proposition
axiom LunchClose : Prop

-- Predicates about a person
axiom Hungry : obj → Prop          -- their coworkers are hungry
axiom PreparedWell : obj → Prop    -- prepared well for the presentation
axiom Ready : obj → Prop           -- ready for the meeting
axiom Diligent : obj → Prop        -- diligent

-- If it was close to lunchtime, then John's coworkers would be hungry
axiom A1 : LunchClose → Hungry John

-- If someone prepared well for the presentation, then they would be ready for the meeting
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, PreparedWell x → Ready x

-- They were certain that either it was close to lunchtime, or John was not ready for the meeting,
-- or it was close to lunchtime and John was not ready for it
axiom A3 : LunchClose ∨ ¬ Ready John ∨ (LunchClose ∧ ¬ Ready John)

-- Everyone understood that if someone was diligent, they would prepare well for presentations
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Diligent x → PreparedWell x

-- Goal: If John's coworkers are not hungry, is he diligent?
-- We cannot derive Diligent John from ¬ Hungry John with the given axioms,
-- nor can we derive its negation from these axioms.
-- No theorem is provable here.
