axiom obj : Type
axiom Ty : obj

-- Predicates
axiom SuspectsID : obj → Prop                 -- suspects identity theft
axiom FraudSuspected : obj → Prop             -- fraud is suspected
axiom ShouldCheckCredit : obj → Prop          -- should check credit report
axiom ShouldContactBank : obj → Prop          -- should contact bank

-- Actions actually taken
axiom VerifiedCredit : obj → Prop             -- verified/checked credit report
axiom ContactedBank : obj → Prop              -- contacted bank

-- Rules from the context
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, SuspectsID x → ShouldCheckCredit x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, FraudSuspected x → ShouldContactBank x

-- Given disjunction about Ty's actions
axiom H : ¬ VerifiedCredit Ty ∨ ¬ ContactedBank Ty

-- From the given information, we cannot derive SuspectsID Ty,
-- nor can we derive ¬ SuspectsID Ty, since "should" does not imply "did",
-- and there is no link between suspecting identity theft and fraud being suspected,
-- nor between "should" and the actual actions.
-- Hence, the statement is undecidable from the provided premises.
