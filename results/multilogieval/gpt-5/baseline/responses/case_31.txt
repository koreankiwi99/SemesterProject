axiom Suspects : Person → Prop
axiom Talked : Person → Prop
axiom Reassessed : Person → Prop

-- If someone suspects infidelity, they talk to their partner.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, Suspects x → Talked x
-- If someone has infidelity concerns, they reassess the relationship.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Person, Suspects x → Reassessed x

-- Given: Either Priya did not talk to her partner, or she did not reassess the relationship.
axiom H : ¬ Talked Priya ∨ ¬ Reassessed Priya

-- From the above, we can conclude Priya did not suspect infidelity.
theorem priya_not_suspects : ¬ Suspects Priya :=

  intro hs
  have ht : Talked Priya := R1 Priya hs
  have hr : Reassessed Priya := R2 Priya hs
