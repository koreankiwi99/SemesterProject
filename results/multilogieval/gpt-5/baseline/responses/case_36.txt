axiom Person : Type
axiom Mary : Person

axiom HasProblems : Person → Prop
axiom Restarted : Person → Prop
axiom CheckedUpdates : Person → Prop
axiom InstalledLatest : Person → Prop

-- If someone is having computer problems, they should try restarting it.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, HasProblems x → Restarted x

-- If someone is having computer issues, they should check for any software updates.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Person, HasProblems x → CheckedUpdates x

-- Given: Either Mary did not restart her computer or she did not install the latest updates.
axiom D : ¬Restarted Mary ∨ ¬InstalledLatest Mary

-- From these axioms, we cannot derive HasProblems Mary or ¬HasProblems Mary.
-- The rules only give consequences of having problems; they do not allow inferring problems
-- from failing to restart or failing to install updates.
