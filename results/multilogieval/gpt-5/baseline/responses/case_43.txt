axiom OnTimeToWork : Person → Prop

-- If the subway is running on schedule, then someone will take it to work.
axiom A1 : SubwayOnSchedule → ∃ p : Person, TakesSubwayToWork p

-- If the bus has room, then someone can catch a ride downtown.
axiom A2 : BusHasRoom → ∃ p : Person, TakesBusDowntown p

-- Whether it's the subway or the bus, someone's commute will be smooth.
axiom A3 : ∀ p : Person, TakesSubwayToWork p → SmoothCommute p
axiom A4 : ∀ p : Person, TakesBusDowntown p → SmoothCommute p

-- If someone takes the subway, they'll get to work on time.
axiom A5 : ∀ p : Person, TakesSubwayToWork p → OnTimeToWork p

-- Given: James did not take the bus downtown.
axiom H1 : ¬ TakesBusDowntown James

-- From the given information, we cannot derive OnTimeToWork James,
-- nor can we derive ¬ OnTimeToWork James.
-- No contradiction or sufficient premise links H1 to OnTimeToWork James.
