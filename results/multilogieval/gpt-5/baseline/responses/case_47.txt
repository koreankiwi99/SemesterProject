  cases R3 with
  | inl h => exact h
  | inr h =>
      have : False := not_special_order h
      exact False.elim this

-- Hence Max is able to start a new project.
theorem max_able_to_start : AbleToStart Max := by

-- However, from AbleToStart Max we cannot derive StartsProject Max,
-- so we cannot prove LearnsSkills Max or its negation from the given axioms.
-- No theorem for LearnsSkills Max or ¬ LearnsSkills Max can be derived here.
