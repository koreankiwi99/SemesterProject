-- If Alex applied sunscreen, then Alex would not get burnt
axiom A1 : Applied Alex → ¬ Burnt Alex
-- If someone goes swimming, they get exercise
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Swim x → Exercise x
-- If the pool water is warm, people go swimming
axiom A3 : Warm → ∀ x : obj, Swim x
-- If the weather was sunny, the pool water will be warm
axiom A4 : Sunny → Warm
-- Either Alex applied sunscreen, or Alex did not get any exercise
axiom A5 : Applied Alex ∨ ¬ Exercise Alex

  -- From A1, if Alex were to have applied sunscreen, contradiction with Burnt Alex

  -- If it were sunny, then warm, then Alex swims, hence exercises: contradiction
