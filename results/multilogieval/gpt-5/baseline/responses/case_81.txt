axiom Person : Type
axiom Amy : Person

-- Predicates
axiom PracticedDaily : Person → Prop
axiom MuscleMemory : Person → Prop
axiom CanPlaySimpleSongs : Person → Prop
axiom CanPlayAnySongs : Person → Prop
axiom LearnedMusicTheory : Person → Prop
axiom KnowledgeSongStructure : Person → Prop
axiom AnalyzeComposition : Person → Prop

-- Rules from the context
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, PracticedDaily x → MuscleMemory x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Person, MuscleMemory x → CanPlaySimpleSongs x
-- Simple songs are songs
axiom R3 : ∀ x : Person, CanPlaySimpleSongs x → CanPlayAnySongs x
-- Either practicing daily or learning music theory (for the person in question)
axiom D1 : PracticedDaily Amy ∨ LearnedMusicTheory Amy
-- Learning theory gives knowledge about song structure
axiom R4 : ∀ x : Person, LearnedMusicTheory x → KnowledgeSongStructure x
-- Knowledge about song structure enables analysis (not needed for the conclusion)
axiom R5 : ∀ x : Person, KnowledgeSongStructure x → AnalyzeComposition x

-- From the assumptions, if Amy cannot play any songs yet, she has knowledge about song structure
theorem amy_knows_if_cannot_play : ¬CanPlayAnySongs Amy → KnowledgeSongStructure Amy :=
  fun hNotAny =>
    -- From ¬(can play any songs) and (practice → simple → any), we get ¬practiced
    have hNotPracticed : ¬PracticedDaily Amy :=
      fun hP => hNotAny (R3 Amy (R2 Amy (R1 Amy hP)))
    -- From (practiced ∨ learned theory) and ¬practiced, we conclude learned theory
    have hLearned : LearnedMusicTheory Amy :=
      Or.elim D1
        (fun hP => False.elim (hNotPracticed hP))
        (fun hL => hL)
    -- Therefore, knowledge about song structure
    show KnowledgeSongStructure Amy from R4 Amy hLearned
