axiom obj : Type
axiom Sarah : obj

-- Predicates
axiom Practice : obj → Prop            -- practiced guitar (scales/chords daily / regularly)
axiom TechniqueImproved : obj → Prop
axiom LearnFaster : obj → Prop
axiom ListenAttentively : obj → Prop   -- listens attentively to music

-- Rules from the context
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Practice x → TechniqueImproved x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, TechniqueImproved x → LearnFaster x
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Practice x ∨ ListenAttentively x

-- Assumption from the statement to evaluate
axiom Hnf : ¬LearnFaster Sarah

-- From the premises and ¬LearnFaster Sarah, we can actually derive that Sarah listens attentively.
theorem listens_attentively_Sarah : ListenAttentively Sarah := by
  -- ¬TechniqueImproved Sarah by modus tollens on R2
  have h_not_TI : ¬TechniqueImproved Sarah := by
    intro hTI
    exact Hnf (R2 Sarah hTI)
  -- ¬Practice Sarah by modus tollens on R1
  have h_not_P : ¬Practice Sarah := by
    intro hP
    exact h_not_TI (R1 Sarah hP)
  -- Use the disjunction Practice ∨ ListenAttentively to conclude ListenAttentively
  have h_or : Practice Sarah ∨ ListenAttentively Sarah := R3 Sarah
  cases h_or with
  | inl hP =>
      exact False.elim (h_not_P hP)
  | inr hL =>
      exact hL

-- Cannot prove ¬ListenAttentively Sarah from given axioms
