-- If the temperature dropped below freezing, then there would be snow on the ground.
axiom R1 : BelowFreezing → SnowOnGround

-- If someone loves winter, then they build snowmen.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Person, LovesWinter x → BuildsSnowman x

-- If someone built a snowman, that meant there was enough snow.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : Person, BuildsSnowman x → EnoughSnow

-- Either it was below freezing, or there was not enough snow, or both.
axiom Certainty : BelowFreezing ∨ ¬EnoughSnow ∨ (BelowFreezing ∧ ¬EnoughSnow)

-- Target to negate: (¬SnowOnGround → LovesWinter Mary)
-- We cannot derive ¬(¬SnowOnGround → LovesWinter Mary) from the given axioms.
-- There is no information implying ¬SnowOnGround, nor any information implying ¬LovesWinter Mary.
-- Hence we cannot produce a contradiction to the implication from the premises.
-- def Target := (¬SnowOnGround → LovesWinter Mary)
-- -- Cannot prove: ¬Target
