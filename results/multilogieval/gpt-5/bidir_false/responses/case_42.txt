axiom ManyKidsSick : Prop

-- If it is sunny, children will want to play outside
axiom R1 : Sunny → WantPlayOutside
-- If flu season starts, many children will get sick
axiom R2 : FluSeasonStarted → ManyKidsSick
-- Either it is sunny, or not many kids get sick, or it is sunny and not many kids get sick
axiom R3 : Sunny ∨ ¬ManyKidsSick ∨ (Sunny ∧ ¬ManyKidsSick)
-- If children play outside, they will sleep well at night
axiom R4 : PlayOutside → SleepWellAtNight

-- Given: Flu season started this month
axiom T1 : FluSeasonStarted

-- Derived facts

  exact R2 T1

theorem sunny : Sunny := by
  have ms : ManyKidsSick := R2 T1
  have hn : ¬¬ManyKidsSick := by
    intro h

  | inr rest =>
    cases rest with
    | inl not_ms => exact False.elim (hn not_ms)
    | inr both => exact both.left

theorem want_play : WantPlayOutside := by
  exact R1 sunny

-- Cannot prove ¬SleepWellAtNight from given axioms
