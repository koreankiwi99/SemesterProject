axiom SpongeSoapy : Prop

-- If the driveway is wet, then it rained recently.
axiom R1 : Wet → Rained
-- If someone washed their car, then they used water on the driveway.
axiom R2 : WashedCar → UsedWaterOnDriveway
-- Either the driveway is wet, or no water was used on the car, or the driveway is wet even though no water was used.
axiom R3 : Wet ∨ ¬WaterUsedOnCar ∨ (Wet ∧ ¬WaterUsedOnCar)
-- If the hose is uncoiled, someone was washing their car.
axiom R4 : HoseUncoiled → WashedCar
-- Either the hose is uncoiled, or the sponge is soapy, or both.
axiom R5 : HoseUncoiled ∨ SpongeSoapy ∨ (HoseUncoiled ∧ SpongeSoapy)
-- Assumption: It didn't rain recently.
axiom H_not_rained : ¬Rained

theorem not_wet : ¬Wet := fun w => H_not_rained (R1 w)

theorem not_water_used_on_car : ¬WaterUsedOnCar := by
  have h := R3
  cases h with
  | inl hWet =>
      exact False.elim (not_wet hWet)
  | inr h2 =>
      cases h2 with
      | inl hNoWater => exact hNoWater
      | inr hBoth => exact hBoth.right

-- Cannot prove ¬SpongeSoapy from given axioms
