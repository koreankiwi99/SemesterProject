axiom Place : Type
axiom City : Place → Prop
axiom Dallas : Place

axiom HeavyRain : Place → Prop
axiom ExcessiveRain : Place → Prop
axiom ReservoirOverflow : Place → Prop
axiom DamOverflow : Place → Prop
axiom Flooding : Place → Prop

-- Context: Some city had heavy rainfall
axiom some_city_heavy : ∃ c : Place, City c ∧ HeavyRain c

-- If there is excessive rain, reservoirs and dams overflow
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Place, ExcessiveRain x → ReservoirOverflow x ∧ DamOverflow x

-- If reservoirs overflow, flooding occurs
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Place, ReservoirOverflow x → Flooding x

-- Statement to evaluate: There is heavy rainfall in Dallas
axiom HR_Dallas : HeavyRain Dallas

-- Cannot prove ¬Flooding Dallas from given axioms
