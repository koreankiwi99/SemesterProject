axiom EnrichedSoil : Prop
axiom EnoughNutrients : Prop
axiom HealthyPlants : Prop
axiom AbundantHarvest : Prop

-- Facts and rules from the context
axiom T1 : EnrichedSoil                          -- The gardener enriched the soil
axiom T2 : HealthyPlants                          -- The plants grew strong
axiom R1 : EnoughNutrients → HealthyPlants        -- If soil has enough nutrients, plants are healthy
axiom R2 : HealthyPlants → AbundantHarvest        -- If plants are healthy, harvest is abundant

-- From healthy plants, we can conclude the harvest was abundant
theorem harvest_abundant : AbundantHarvest := by
  exact R2 T2

-- Cannot prove ¬AbundantHarvest from the given axioms
