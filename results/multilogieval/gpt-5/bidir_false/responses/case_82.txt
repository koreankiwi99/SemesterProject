-- If the farmer's market has ripe, juicy peaches, someone will bake a peach pie.
axiom R1 : FarmerMarketHasRipePeaches → ∃ x : Person, Bake x
-- If someone won a baking contest, they'll celebrate with friends and family.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Person, Won x → Celebrate x
-- Either peaches are in season, or someone won a contest (or both).
axiom R3 : PeachesInSeason ∨ ∃ x : Person, Won x
-- If someone bakes a pie, the house will smell amazing.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : Person, Bake x → HouseSmellsAmazing
-- If the house smells amazing, it feels homey and cozy.
axiom R5 : HouseSmellsAmazing → HomeyCozy

-- Statement to evaluate: (¬Celebrate James) → HomeyCozy
def Statement : Prop := (¬Celebrate James) → HomeyCozy

-- Goal for "No": prove ¬Statement, i.e., (¬Celebrate James) ∧ ¬HomeyCozy.
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive ¬HomeyCozy (nor ¬Celebrate James),
-- so we cannot prove ¬Statement.
-- Cannot prove ¬Statement from given axioms.
