-- If someone practices daily, they will be prepared
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, PracticesDaily x → Prepared x
-- If it is sunny, children will play at the park
axiom R2 : Sunny → KidsAtPark
-- Either the team practiced daily, or kids did not go to the park today
axiom R3 : PracticesDaily Team ∨ ¬KidsAtPark
-- If someone feels prepared, then they will have confidence
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Prepared x → Confident x
-- When people feel confident, they hold their head up high
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Confident x → HeadUp x

-- From the premises, we can prove: If it was sunny, the team holds their head up high.
