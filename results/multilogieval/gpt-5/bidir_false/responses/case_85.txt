-- If someone waters adequately, plants bloom
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Water x → Bloom x
-- If plants bloom, they attract bees and butterflies
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Bloom x → Attract x
-- Either someone waters adequately or uses organic fertilizers (or both)
axiom Rdisj : ∀ x : obj, Water x ∨ Fert x
-- If someone uses organic fertilizers, the soil quality is high
axiom Rfert : ∀ x : obj, Fert x → SoilHigh x
-- If soil quality is high, plants grow healthier
axiom Rimp : ∀ x : obj, SoilHigh x → Healthy x

-- The statement to evaluate: ¬Attract John → SoilHigh John
-- This implication is actually provable from the premises:
theorem john_soil_high_if_not_attract : (¬Attract John → SoilHigh John) :=
by
  intro hNot
  have hWF : Water John ∨ Fert John := Rdisj John
  cases hWF with
  | inl hW =>
      have hb : Bloom John := R1 John hW
      have ha : Attract John := R2 John hb
      exact False.elim (hNot ha)
  | inr hF =>
      exact Rfert John hF

-- Hence we cannot prove the negation ¬(¬Attract John → SoilHigh John) from these axioms
