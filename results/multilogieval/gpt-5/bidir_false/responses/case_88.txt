axiom Set350 : Prop
axiom Eggs : Prop
axiom Fluffy : Prop
axiom BakesProperly : Prop
axiom Delicious : Prop
axiom GuestsHappy : Prop

axiom R1 : Set350 → BakesProperly
axiom R2 : Eggs → Fluffy
axiom R3 : Set350 ∨ ¬Eggs
axiom R4 : BakesProperly → Delicious
axiom R5 : Delicious → GuestsHappy

theorem eggs_implies_guests_happy : Eggs → GuestsHappy :=
by
  intro hEggs

    exact False.elim hFalse

-- Since we proved Eggs → GuestsHappy, we cannot prove its negation from the given premises.
