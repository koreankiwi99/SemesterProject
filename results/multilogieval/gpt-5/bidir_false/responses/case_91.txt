axiom Party : Prop
axiom Drums : Prop
axiom Noise : Prop
axiom Complain : Prop
axiom Police : Prop

axiom R1 : Party → Noise
axiom R2 : Drums → Noise
axiom R3 : Party ∨ Drums
axiom R4 : Party → Complain
axiom R5 : Complain → Police

-- From the disjunction and implications, noise must happen
theorem noise_happens : Noise :=
by
  apply Or.elim R3
  · intro hP
    exact R1 hP
  · intro hD
    exact R2 hD

-- The queried statement is (¬Noise) → Police, which is provable (vacuously)
theorem police_if_no_noise : (¬Noise) → Police :=
by
  intro hNo
  have hN : Noise := noise_happens
  have hF : False := hNo hN
  exact False.elim hF

-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation ¬((¬Noise) → Police) from the given axioms.
-- Cannot prove ¬((¬Noise) → Police) from the premises
