axiom Water : Prop          -- the field gets enough water
axiom Grow : Prop           -- the crops will grow well
axiom Pests : Prop          -- pests invade the field
axiom Damage : Prop         -- some crops will be destroyed
axiom AdequateWatering : Prop -- the farmer watered the field adequately
axiom Harvest : Prop        -- the harvest will be bountiful
axiom Profit : Prop         -- the farmer will make good profit

axiom R1 : Water → Grow
axiom R2 : Pests → Damage
axiom R3 : AdequateWatering ∨ ¬Damage ∨ (Water ∧ Damage)
axiom R4 : Grow → Harvest
axiom R5 : Harvest → Profit

-- Goal to try: prove ¬(Pests → Profit)
-- This would require deriving Pests ∧ ¬Profit from the axioms, which is not possible here.
-- The axioms do not allow us to derive Pests, nor do they allow us to derive ¬Profit.
-- Hence we cannot prove the negation of the statement from the given premises.
