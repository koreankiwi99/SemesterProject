axiom obj : Type

axiom Injured : obj → Prop

axiom Rest : obj → Prop

-- If someone gets injured, they should see a doctor.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Injured x → SeeDoctor x
-- Getting hurt warrants resting the affected area.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Injured x → Rest x

-- Either Jane did not see a doctor or she did not rest her injury.
axiom H : ¬ SeeDoctor Jane ∨ ¬ Rest Jane

-- From the given disjunction and the rules, we can derive that Jane was not injured.
theorem not_injured_jane : ¬ Injured Jane := by
  apply Or.elim H
  · intro hNotSee
    intro hInj
    have : SeeDoctor Jane := R1 Jane hInj
    exact hNotSee this
  · intro hNotRest
    intro hInj
    have : Rest Jane := R2 Jane hInj
    exact hNotRest this

-- Cannot prove Injured Jane from the given premises; in fact we have ¬ Injured Jane.
-- theorems of the form `Injured Jane` are not derivable here.
