-- If someone suspects their partner is cheating, they should have an open conversation about it.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, SuspectsUnfaithful x → TalkedOpenly x
-- Infidelity concerns warrant re-evaluating the relationship.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, SuspectsUnfaithful x → ReassessedRelationship x

-- Given statement: Either Priya did not talk to her partner, or she did not reassess the relationship.
axiom Hdisj : ¬ TalkedOpenly Priya ∨ ¬ ReassessedRelationship Priya

-- From the given disjunction and rules, we can derive that Priya did NOT suspect infidelity.
theorem not_suspects_priya : ¬ SuspectsUnfaithful Priya := by
  intro hs
  cases Hdisj with
  | inl hntalk =>
      have htalk : TalkedOpenly Priya := R1 Priya hs
      exact hntalk htalk
  | inr hnreassess =>
      have hreassess : ReassessedRelationship Priya := R2 Priya hs
      exact hnreassess hreassess

-- Cannot prove SuspectsUnfaithful Priya from the given premises; in fact we proved its negation above.
