-- If the car has gas, then they can drive long distances
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Gas x → DriveLong x
-- If they see the sights, then they are taking a scenic route
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, SeeSights x → Scenic x
-- Either the car has gas, or they are not taking the scenic route, or both gas and not scenic
axiom A3 : Gas Mike ∨ ¬Scenic Mike ∨ (Gas Mike ∧ ¬Scenic Mike)
-- If someone loves road trips, they take the scenic route and see the sights
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, LovesRoadTrips x → Scenic x ∧ SeeSights x

-- From the premises we can actually derive that if Mike cannot drive long distances, then Mike does not love road trips
theorem cannot_drive_implies_not_love : ¬DriveLong Mike → ¬LovesRoadTrips Mike := by
  intro hndl
  -- From ¬DriveLong and (Gas → DriveLong), deduce ¬Gas
  have hngas : ¬Gas Mike := by
    intro hgas
    exact hndl (A1 Mike hgas)
  -- From the disjunction and ¬Gas, deduce ¬Scenic

    cases A3 with

        exact False.elim (hngas hgas)

        | inr hboth =>
            exact False.elim (hngas hboth.left)
  -- From (Loves → Scenic ∧ SeeSights), we have (Loves → Scenic), so ¬Scenic implies ¬Loves
  intro hLove
  have hsc : Scenic Mike := by
    have hpair := A4 Mike hLove
    exact hpair.left
  exact hnsc hsc

-- Therefore, we cannot prove LovesRoadTrips Mike from ¬DriveLong Mike.
-- In fact, we derived the opposite implication above.
