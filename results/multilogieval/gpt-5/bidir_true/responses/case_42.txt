axiom Sunny : Prop

axiom SleepWellAtNight : Prop
axiom FluSeasonStarted : Prop
axiom ManyKidsSick : Prop

-- If the weather is sunny, children will want to play outside.
axiom R1 : Sunny → WantPlayOutside
-- If flu season begins, then many children will get sick.
axiom R2 : FluSeasonStarted → ManyKidsSick
-- Either it is sunny outside, or not many kids get the flu, or it was sunny and many kids did not get sick.
axiom D : Sunny ∨ ¬ ManyKidsSick ∨ (Sunny ∧ ¬ ManyKidsSick)
-- If children play outside, they will sleep well at night.
axiom R3 : PlayOutside → SleepWellAtNight

-- Premise to evaluate: Flu season started this month.
axiom T_Flu : FluSeasonStarted

-- From D and ManyKidsSick (derived from T_Flu), we can deduce Sunny.
theorem sunny : Sunny := by
  have hsick : ManyKidsSick := R2 T_Flu
  cases D with
  | inl hS => exact hS
  | inr h =>
    cases h with
    | inl hNot =>
      exact False.elim (hNot hsick)
    | inr hAnd =>
      exact hAnd.left

-- Hence children want to play outside.
theorem want_to_play : WantPlayOutside := R1 sunny

-- However, there is no premise connecting WantPlayOutside to PlayOutside,
-- so we cannot derive SleepWellAtNight from the given axioms.
-- We would need an additional axiom: WantPlayOutside → PlayOutside.
