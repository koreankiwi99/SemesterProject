-- If the subway is running on schedule, then someone will take it to work.
axiom A1 : SubwayRunningOnSchedule → ∃ x : obj, TookSubwayToWork x
-- If the bus has room, then someone can catch a ride downtown.
axiom A2 : BusHasRoom → ∃ x : obj, TookBusDowntown x
-- Whether it's the subway or the bus, someone's commute will be smooth sailing.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, (TookSubwayToWork x ∨ TookBusDowntown x) → CommuteSmooth x
-- If someone takes the subway, they'll get to work on time.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, TookSubwayToWork x → OnTime x

-- James did not take the bus downtown.
axiom HJamesNotBus : ¬ TookBusDowntown James

-- From these premises, we cannot derive OnTime James.
-- There is no premise linking James to taking the subway, so OnTime James is unprovable here.
