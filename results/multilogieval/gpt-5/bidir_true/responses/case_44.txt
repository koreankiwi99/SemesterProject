-- If someone plants a garden, they need to water and care for the plants.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, PlantsGarden x → NeedsCare x
-- If there is a drought, there is a ban on watering gardens.
axiom A2 : Drought → WateringBan
-- Either Mark plants a garden, or there is a drought (or both).
axiom A3 : PlantsGarden Mark ∨ Drought
-- If there is a watering ban, the plants will not get enough water (for anyone's garden).
axiom A4 : WateringBan → ∀ x : obj, NotEnoughWater x
-- If the plants don't get watered enough, the garden will fail to thrive.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, NotEnoughWater x → FailsToThrive x
-- Given: Mark did not need to care for garden plants.
axiom A6 : ¬ NeedsCare Mark

theorem mark_garden_fails : FailsToThrive Mark := by
  -- From A1 and A6, Mark did not plant a garden (modus tollens).
  have hNotPlant : ¬ PlantsGarden Mark := fun hp => A6 (A1 Mark hp)
  -- From the disjunction A3 and ¬PlantsGarden Mark, deduce Drought.
  have hDrought : Drought :=
    Or.elim A3
      (fun hplant => False.elim (hNotPlant hplant))
      (fun hd => hd)
  -- Drought implies a watering ban.
  have hBan : WateringBan := A2 hDrought
  -- Watering ban implies Mark's plants don't get enough water.
  have hNotEnough : NotEnoughWater Mark := (A4 hBan) Mark
  -- Therefore, Mark's garden fails to thrive.
