axiom Wet : Prop            -- The driveway is wet
axiom Rained : Prop         -- It rained recently
axiom Washed : Prop         -- Someone washed their car
axiom WaterUsed : Prop      -- Water was used (on car/driveway)
axiom HoseUncoiled : Prop   -- The hose is uncoiled
axiom SpongeSoapy : Prop    -- The sponge is soapy

-- If the driveway is wet, then it must have rained recently.
axiom A1 : Wet → Rained

-- If someone washed their car, then they used water.
axiom A2 : Washed → WaterUsed

-- Either the driveway is wet, or no water was used, or the driveway is wet even though no water was used.
axiom A3 : Wet ∨ ¬WaterUsed ∨ (Wet ∧ ¬WaterUsed)

-- If the hose is uncoiled, it means someone was washing their car.
axiom A4 : HoseUncoiled → Washed

-- Either the hose is uncoiled, or the sponge is soapy.
axiom A5 : HoseUncoiled ∨ SpongeSoapy

-- It didn't rain recently.
