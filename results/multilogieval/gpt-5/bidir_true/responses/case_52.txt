-- If the forecast predicts rain, then people will bring an umbrella when they go out.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, RainForecast → GoesOut x → BringUmbrella x

-- If there is a big game on TV, then friends will get together to watch it.
axiom R2 : BigGame → FriendsGetTogether

-- Either rain is forecasted, or friends did not get together to watch the game, 
-- or rain is forecasted and friends did not get together to watch.
axiom R3 : RainForecast ∨ ¬ FriendsGetTogether ∨ (RainForecast ∧ ¬ FriendsGetTogether)

-- If the TV viewership is high, then there is a big game on tv.
axiom R4 : HighViewership → BigGame

-- Either the TV viewership is high, or they all decide to go play out, or maybe both are true.
axiom R5 : HighViewership ∨ PlayOutside ∨ (HighViewership ∧ PlayOutside)

-- James did not bring an umbrella.
axiom H : ¬ BringUmbrella James

-- Goal to check: from H, can we entail PlayOutside?
-- This does not follow from the given axioms.
-- We cannot rule out the case HighViewership from R5, and that case does not imply PlayOutside.
