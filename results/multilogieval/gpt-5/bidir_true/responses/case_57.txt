-- If the store has a sale, then people will buy more items.
axiom R1 : ∀ p : Person, Sale → BuyMore p
-- If someone goes grocery shopping, then they will get everything on their list.
axiom R2 : ∀ p : Person, Grocery p → AllList p
-- Either the store has a sale, or they (John) did not get everything on their list,
-- or there was a sale and they still did not get all their groceries.
axiom R3 : Sale ∨ ¬ AllList John ∨ (Sale ∧ ¬ AllList John)
-- If it is the beginning of the month, then people go grocery shopping.
axiom R4 : ∀ p : Person, BeginMonth → Grocery p
-- Either it is the beginning of the month, or their (John's) favorite cereal is sold out, or both.
axiom R5 : BeginMonth ∨ SoldOut John ∨ (BeginMonth ∧ SoldOut John)
