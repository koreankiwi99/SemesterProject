axiom obj : Type
axiom Priya : obj

axiom Attend : obj → Prop
axiom Study : obj → Prop
axiom Excel : obj → Prop

-- Context: ∀ student, if they attend lectures regularly, then if they study diligently, they will excel.
axiom Rule : ∀ x : obj, Attend x → (Study x → Excel x)

-- Given statements about Priya
axiom PriyaStudied : Study Priya
axiom PriyaNotExcel : ¬ Excel Priya

-- From the rule and the given facts, we can derive that Priya did not attend lectures regularly.
theorem not_attend_Priya : ¬ Attend Priya := by
  intro hAttend
  have hStudyToExcel : Study Priya → Excel Priya := Rule Priya hAttend
  have hExcel : Excel Priya := hStudyToExcel PriyaStudied
  exact PriyaNotExcel hExcel

-- Cannot prove Attend Priya from given axioms
