axiom Attend : obj → Prop
axiom Revise : obj → Prop
axiom PerformWell : obj → Prop

-- If a student attends lectures regularly, then if they revise sufficiently, they will perform well.
axiom Rule : ∀ x : obj, Attend x → Revise x → PerformWell x

-- Facts about Priya
axiom RevisePriya : Revise Priya
axiom NotPerformPriya : ¬ PerformWell Priya

-- We cannot prove Attend Priya from these premises.
-- In fact, we can derive that Priya did not attend lectures regularly.
theorem not_attend_priya : ¬ Attend Priya :=
  fun hAttend => NotPerformPriya ((Rule Priya hAttend) RevisePriya)
