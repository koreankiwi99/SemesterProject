-- From the text: The gardener enriched the soil.
axiom T_enriched : EnrichedSoil

-- World knowledge/textual intent: enriching the soil makes it nutrient-rich.
axiom R_enriched_to_nutrient : EnrichedSoil → NutrientRichSoil

-- From the belief/rule in the text: if the soil has enough nutrients, the plants are healthy.
axiom R_nutrient_to_healthy : NutrientRichSoil → PlantsHealthy

-- From the text: if plants are healthy, they yield bigger/abundant harvests.
axiom R_healthy_to_abundant : PlantsHealthy → AbundantHarvest
