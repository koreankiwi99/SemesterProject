-- If someone is a student and it is Friday night, then they are going to the party.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Student x → (Friday → Party x)

-- If they finish all their homework, then they can watch the game.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, FinishHW x → WatchGame x

-- Either it is Friday night, or (students) are not watching the game.
axiom A3 : Friday ∨ (∀ x : obj, Student x → ¬ WatchGame x)

-- Students know that if they study everyday, they finish all their homework.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Student x → (StudyEveryday x → FinishHW x)

-- If someone plans their schedule well, then they can study everyday.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, PlanWell x → StudyEveryday x

-- Given: James is not going to the party.
axiom H1 : ¬ Party James

-- From these premises, there is no way to derive PlanWell James.
-- In particular, all implications flow from planning/studying/homework to watching,
-- and from Friday to going to the party for students; nothing yields PlanWell James.
