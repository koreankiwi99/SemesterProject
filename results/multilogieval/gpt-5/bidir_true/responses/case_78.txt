axiom person : Type
axiom Lauren : person
axiom CompellingCharacters : person → Prop
axiom IntriguingPlot : person → Prop
axiom ConnectsWithReaders : person → Prop

-- If a writer develops compelling characters, then if they craft an intriguing plot, their book will connect with readers.
axiom Rule : ∀ w : person, CompellingCharacters w → (IntriguingPlot w → ConnectsWithReaders w)

-- Given facts about Lauren
axiom LaurenPlot : IntriguingPlot Lauren
axiom LaurenNotConnect : ¬ ConnectsWithReaders Lauren

-- From the premises, we can derive that Lauren did not develop compelling characters
theorem not_compelling_for_Lauren : ¬ CompellingCharacters Lauren := by
  intro h
  have h1 : IntriguingPlot Lauren → ConnectsWithReaders Lauren := Rule Lauren h
  have h2 : ConnectsWithReaders Lauren := h1 LaurenPlot
  exact LaurenNotConnect h2

-- Cannot prove CompellingCharacters Lauren from the given axioms; in fact, we proved its negation.
