-- Cannot prove (¬ Celebrate James) → HomeyCozy from given axioms:
-- The disjunction A3 may hold via ∃ x, WonContest x, which (using A2) only yields
-- that someone celebrates, not that the house smells amazing or is homey/cozy.
-- There is no connection from ¬Celebrate James to Peaches or to HouseSmells.
