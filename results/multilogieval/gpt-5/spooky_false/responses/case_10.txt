axiom obj : Type
axiom Alex : obj
axiom Student : obj

axiom StudiedHard : obj → Prop
axiom GoodGrades : obj → Prop
axiom Extracurricular : obj → Prop
axiom NewFriends : obj → Prop
axiom Invited : obj → Prop

-- For the particular student in the town:
axiom H1 : StudiedHard Student → GoodGrades Student
axiom H2 : Extracurricular Student → NewFriends Student
axiom H3 : StudiedHard Student ∨ Extracurricular Student

-- General rule:
axiom H4 : ∀ x : obj, NewFriends x → Invited x

-- Given about Alex:
axiom H5 : ¬GoodGrades Alex

-- Note: From these premises, there is no way to derive ¬Invited Alex.
-- The premises relating study/extracurricular apply only to Student, not to Alex,
-- and we have no information linking Alex to NewFriends or Invited.
