axiom obj : Type
axiom Alex : obj

axiom AdvertisesCleverly : obj → Prop
axiom OffersDiscounts : obj → Prop
axiom AttractsMoreCustomers : obj → Prop
axiom IncreasesSales : obj → Prop
axiom ExpandsBusiness : obj → Prop

-- There exists someone for whom the local business rules apply and who either advertises cleverly or offers discounts
axiom Someone_conditions :
  ∃ x : obj,
    (AdvertisesCleverly x → AttractsMoreCustomers x) ∧
    (OffersDiscounts x → IncreasesSales x) ∧
    (AdvertisesCleverly x ∨ OffersDiscounts x)

-- General rule: if someone increases sales, they will expand their business
axiom Inc_implies_Expand : ∀ x : obj, IncreasesSales x → ExpandsBusiness x

-- Given fact about Alex
axiom Alex_not_attracts : ¬AttractsMoreCustomers Alex
