axiom obj : Type
axiom Sarah : obj

axiom PracticeScalesDaily : obj → Prop
axiom TechniqueImproved : obj → Prop
axiom LearnSongsFaster : obj → Prop
axiom PracticeRegularly : obj → Prop
axiom ListenAttentively : obj → Prop

-- Premises applied to Sarah
axiom A1 : PracticeScalesDaily Sarah → TechniqueImproved Sarah
axiom A2 : TechniqueImproved Sarah → LearnSongsFaster Sarah
axiom A3 : PracticeRegularly Sarah ∨ ListenAttentively Sarah

-- Given statement: Sarah is not able to learn songs faster
axiom Hnf : ¬LearnSongsFaster Sarah

-- Derivations from the premises
theorem not_technique_improved : ¬TechniqueImproved Sarah := by
  intro hti
  have hf : LearnSongsFaster Sarah := A2 hti
  exact Hnf hf

theorem not_practice_scales_daily : ¬PracticeScalesDaily Sarah := by
  intro hpsd
  have hti : TechniqueImproved Sarah := A1 hpsd
  exact not_technique_improved hti
