axiom GreatService : Prop

axiom A1 : GreatService → ReputationGrows
axiom A2 : HostEvents → CustomerTrafficIncreases
axiom A3 : GreatService ∨ HostEvents
axiom A4 : CustomerTrafficIncreases → RevenueImproves
axiom G : ServiceQualityDecreased

-- Note: "service quality decreased" is modeled independently and does not imply ¬GreatService.
-- If we did have ¬GreatService, then revenue would improve (via events) from the given disjunction.
