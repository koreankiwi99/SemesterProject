-- If an employee works hard, they get a promotion.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, WorkHard x → Promotion x
-- If an employee impresses their bosses, they gain influence.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Impress x → Influence x
-- Either some employee did not get a promotion, or some employee did not gain influence.
axiom R3 : (∃ x : obj, ¬Promotion x) ∨ (∃ x : obj, ¬Influence x)
-- There exists an ambitious employee who realizes that if they are motivated, they will work hard.
axiom R4 : ∃ x : obj, Ambitious x ∧ (Motivated x → WorkHard x)

-- Given: Mark impresses his bosses.
axiom Mark_impresses : Impress Mark

-- From the rules, we can derive that Mark has influence.
theorem mark_influence : Influence Mark := by
  apply R2 Mark
