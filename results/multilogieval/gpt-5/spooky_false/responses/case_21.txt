axiom person : Type
axiom Linda : person

axiom Cold : person → Prop
axiom Chill : person → Prop

-- Normative recommendations (should do) based on states
axiom ShouldAddLayers : person → Prop
axiom ShouldTurnUpHeat : person → Prop

-- Actual actions being performed
axiom AddingLayers : person → Prop
axiom AdjustingThermostat : person → Prop

-- Premises from the textual context
axiom P1 : ∀ x : person, Cold x → ShouldAddLayers x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : person, Chill x → ShouldTurnUpHeat x

-- Given statement about Linda's current behavior
axiom H : ¬AddingLayers Linda ∨ ¬AdjustingThermostat Linda

-- From these premises, we cannot derive ¬Cold Linda, because the "should" predicates
-- do not entail the corresponding actions (and thus their contrapositives do not apply).
