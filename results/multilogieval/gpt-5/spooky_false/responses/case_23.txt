-- Predicates
axiom Early : obj → Prop
axiom Energized : obj → Prop

-- Premises from the context
axiom H1 : ∀ x : obj, Early x → Energized x
axiom H2 : ∀ x : obj, Planned x → Productive x
axiom H3 : ∃ x : obj, ¬Energized x ∨ ¬Productive x
axiom H4 : ∀ x : obj, SelfDisciplined x → Early x

-- Fact from the statement to evaluate

-- Some consequences derivable from the premises
theorem mark_productive : Productive Mark := by
