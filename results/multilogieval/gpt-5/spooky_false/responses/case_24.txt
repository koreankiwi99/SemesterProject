-- Premises from the text
-- If the temperature dropped below freezing, then there would be snow on the ground.
axiom R1 : BelowFreezing → SnowOnGround
-- If someone builds a snowman, that means there is enough snow.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, BuildSnowman x → EnoughSnow
-- Either it is below freezing, or there is not enough snow (the third disjunct is redundant).
axiom R3 : BelowFreezing ∨ ¬EnoughSnow
-- If someone loves winter, then they build snowmen.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, LovesWinter x → BuildSnowman x

-- From loving winter, one can derive there is enough snow (via building a snowman).
