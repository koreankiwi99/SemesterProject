-- Predicates
axiom CloseToLunch : Prop

axiom Diligent : obj → Prop

-- Premises
-- If it is close to lunchtime, then coworkers are hungry (for anyone)
axiom LunchHungryRule : ∀ x : obj, CloseToLunch → CoworkersHungry x
-- If someone prepared well, then they are ready for the meeting
axiom PrepImpliesReady : ∀ x : obj, PreparedWell x → ReadyForMeeting x
-- Either it is close to lunchtime, or John is not ready, or it is close and John is not ready
axiom DisjCertainty : CloseToLunch ∨ ¬ReadyForMeeting John ∨ (CloseToLunch ∧ ¬ReadyForMeeting John)
-- Everyone understands: if someone is diligent, they prepare well
axiom DiligentImpliesPrepared : ∀ x : obj, Diligent x → PreparedWell x

-- Additional consistent facts to capture the scenario
axiom NotCloseToLunch : ¬CloseToLunch
axiom JohnsCoworkersNotHungry : ¬CoworkersHungry John

-- Goal: prove the negation of the statement
-- "If John's coworkers are not hungry, then he is diligent"
