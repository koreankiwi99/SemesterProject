-- If someone suspects infidelity, they have an open conversation.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, SuspectsCheating x → OpenConversation x
-- If someone suspects infidelity, they reassess the relationship.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, SuspectsCheating x → ReassessRelationship x

-- Given: Either Priya did not talk to her partner, or she did not reassess the relationship.
axiom H : ¬OpenConversation Priya ∨ ¬ReassessRelationship Priya
