axiom Nutrients : obj → Prop

-- From the context:
-- Using organic methods produces healthy crops.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, UseOrganic x → Healthy x
-- Rotating crops maintains soil nutrients.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Rotates x → Nutrients x
-- Crops were either unhealthy or lacked nutrients (for everyone in this context).
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, ¬Healthy x ∨ ¬Nutrients x
-- Being one with nature leads to using organic methods.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, OneWithNature x → UseOrganic x

-- Given statement: Bob rotates his crops well.
axiom Bob_rotates : Rotates Bob

-- Conclusion: Bob is not one with nature.
