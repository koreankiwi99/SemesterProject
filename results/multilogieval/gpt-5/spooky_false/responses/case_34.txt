axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Professor : obj → Prop
axiom Publishes : obj → Prop
axiom CollaboratesTop : obj → Prop
axiom Curious : obj → Prop
axiom Asks : obj → Prop

-- Contextual assumptions
axiom DrLee_is_prof : Professor DrLee
-- Either research was not published or collaborations did not happen (for each professor)
axiom disj_rule : ∀ x : obj, Professor x → (¬Publishes x ∨ ¬CollaboratesTop x)
-- Being curious and asking questions leads to publishing (for professors)
axiom curious_asks_leads_to_publish : ∀ x : obj, Professor x → (Curious x ∧ Asks x → Publishes x)

-- Statement to evaluate includes: Dr. Lee collaborates with top scholars
axiom DrLee_collabs : CollaboratesTop DrLee

-- We prove the negation of "Dr. Lee is curious and asks questions"
