-- If Jesse did sprint workouts several times a week, his running form and stamina would improve.
axiom T1 : Sprint Jesse → Improve Jesse
-- If Jesse's running improved, he could achieve his goal time.
axiom T2 : Improve Jesse → Goal Jesse
-- Either Jesse was sprinting frequently, or he was taking stretching classes, or both.
axiom T3 : Sprint Jesse ∨ Stretch Jesse
-- If someone takes stretching classes, they become more flexible and less prone to injury.
axiom T4 : ∀ x : obj, Stretch x → (Flexible x ∧ LessInjury x)
-- Improving running form and stamina did not happen for Jesse.
axiom H : ¬Improve Jesse

-- From the premises, Jesse did become more flexible and less prone to injury.
