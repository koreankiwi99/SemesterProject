-- If someone speaks daily with native speakers, then their fluency and vocabulary improve.
axiom H1 : ∀ x : Person, SpeaksDailyWithNatives x → (FluencyImproves x ∧ VocabularyImproves x)
-- If someone's fluency improves, they can have real conversations.
axiom H2 : ∀ x : Person, FluencyImproves x → RealConversations x
-- For any person, either they speak daily with natives or they listen to educational podcasts (or both).
axiom H3 : ∀ x : Person, SpeaksDailyWithNatives x ∨ ListensEducationalPodcasts x
-- If someone listens to educational podcasts, they gain valuable listening comprehension.
axiom H4 : ∀ x : Person, ListensEducationalPodcasts x → GainsListeningComp x

-- From the premises, we can prove the original statement holds for Emma.
