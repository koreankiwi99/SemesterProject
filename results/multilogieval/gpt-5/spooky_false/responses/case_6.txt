-- Given: There is heavy rainfall in Dallas.
axiom HR_Dallas : HeavyRain Dallas

-- Given realizations:
-- If there was excessive rain, reservoirs overflow.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, ExcessiveRain x → Overflow x
-- If reservoirs overflow, flooding occurs.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Overflow x → Flooding x

-- What we can derive from the given rules:
-- Excessive rain implies flooding (but we do not have ExcessiveRain Dallas).
