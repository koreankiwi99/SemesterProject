axiom obj : Type
axiom Lebron : obj

axiom TrainsHard : obj → Prop
axiom Focused : obj → Prop
axiom Best : obj → Prop

-- Coaches' rule: if a player trains hard, then if they are focused, they perform their best.
axiom CoachesRule : ∀ x : obj, TrainsHard x → (Focused x → Best x)

-- Facts from the statement
axiom Lebron_Focused : Focused Lebron
axiom Lebron_NotBest : ¬ Best Lebron

theorem Lebron_not_TrainsHard : ¬ TrainsHard Lebron := by
  intro hTrain
  have hFocusImpBest : Focused Lebron → Best Lebron := (CoachesRule Lebron) hTrain
  have hBest : Best Lebron := hFocusImpBest Lebron_Focused
  exact Lebron_NotBest hBest
