axiom obj : Type
axiom Lauren : obj
axiom Develops : obj → Prop
axiom Crafts : obj → Prop
axiom Connects : obj → Prop

-- Context: For any writer, if they develop compelling characters,
-- then if they craft an intriguing plot, their book will connect with readers.
axiom Ctx : ∀ x : obj, Develops x → (Crafts x → Connects x)

-- Given facts about Lauren
axiom LaurenCrafted : Crafts Lauren
axiom LaurenNotConnected : ¬Connects Lauren

-- Conclusion: Lauren did not develop compelling characters.
theorem lauren_not_develops : ¬Develops Lauren :=

  intro hDev
  have hImp : Crafts Lauren → Connects Lauren := Ctx Lauren hDev
  have hConn : Connects Lauren := hImp LaurenCrafted
