-- If someone finishes early, they can take a long lunch (permission, not actuality).
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, FinishedEarly x → CanTakeLongLunch x
-- If someone takes a long lunch, they'll be recharged.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, TookLongLunch x → Recharged x
-- If recharged, then very productive afternoon.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Recharged x → ProductiveAfternoon x
-- If it's a coworker's birthday, people (everyone) will bring in treats.
axiom R4 : Birthday → ∀ x : obj, BringTreats x
-- Either projects get done early (someone), or it's a birthday, or both.
