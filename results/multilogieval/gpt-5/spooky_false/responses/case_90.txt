axiom Winning : Prop
axiom Rivalry : Prop
axiom Loud : Prop
axiom Emotion : Prop
axiom Electric : Prop
axiom Unforgettable : Prop

axiom A1 : Winning → Loud
axiom A2 : Rivalry → Emotion
axiom A3 : Winning ∨ Rivalry
axiom A4 : Loud → Electric
axiom A5 : Electric → Unforgettable

-- From the premises, the implication (¬Emotion) → Electric actually holds.
theorem atmosphere_electric_if_not_emotion : (¬Emotion) → Electric :=

  intro hNotEmotion
  cases A3 with
  | inl hWin =>
      have hLoud : Loud := A1 hWin
      exact A4 hLoud
  | inr hRivalry =>
      have hEmo : Emotion := A2 hRivalry
      exact False.elim (hNotEmotion hEmo)

-- Therefore, its negation is refuted by the premises.
theorem not_not_atmosphere_electric_if_not_emotion : ¬(¬((¬Emotion) → Electric)) :=
