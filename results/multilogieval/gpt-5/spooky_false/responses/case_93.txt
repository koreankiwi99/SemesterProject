axiom Practice : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop
axiom Injured : Prop
axiom Play : Prop
axiom Win : Prop
axiom Celebrate : Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : Practice → Prepared
axiom P2 : Injured → ¬Play
axiom P3 : Practice ∨ ¬Injured
axiom P4 : Prepared → Win
axiom P5 : Win → Celebrate

-- From the premises we can prove: If the star player is injured, the team will celebrate.
theorem injured_implies_celebrate : Injured → Celebrate :=
fun hi =>
  -- From Practice ∨ ¬Injured and Injured, deduce Practice
  let hp : Practice := Or.elim P3 (fun hp => hp) (fun hni => False.elim (hni hi))
  let hprep : Prepared := P1 hp
  let hwin : Win := P4 hprep
