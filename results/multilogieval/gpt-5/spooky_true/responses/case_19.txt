axiom Service : Prop
axiom Events : Prop
axiom Reputation : Prop
axiom Traffic : Prop
axiom Revenue : Prop

axiom R1 : Service → Reputation
axiom R2 : Events → Traffic
axiom R3 : Service ∨ Events
axiom R4 : Traffic → Revenue

theorem revenue_improved (Hdec : ¬ Service) : Revenue := by
  have hE : Events := by
    cases R3 with
    | inl hS => exact False.elim (Hdec hS)
    | inr hE => exact hE
  exact R4 (R2 hE)
