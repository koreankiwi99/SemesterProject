axiom obj : Type
axiom Linda : obj

axiom Cold : obj → Prop
axiom Chill : obj → Prop
axiom Layers : obj → Prop
axiom Heat : obj → Prop

-- Premises:
-- If someone is cold, they put on more layers.
axiom cold_implies_layers : ∀ x : obj, Cold x → Layers x
-- If someone feels a chill, they turn up the heat.
axiom chill_implies_heat : ∀ x : obj, Chill x → Heat x

-- Given disjunction about Linda's actions:
axiom disj : ¬ Layers Linda ∨ ¬ Heat Linda

-- What we can derive from the premises and the given disjunction:
theorem not_cold_or_not_chill : ¬ Cold Linda ∨ ¬ Chill Linda := by
  cases disj with
  | inl hnl =>
      apply Or.inl
      intro hc
      exact hnl (cold_implies_layers Linda hc)
  | inr hnh =>
      apply Or.inr
      intro hch
      exact hnh (chill_implies_heat Linda hch)
