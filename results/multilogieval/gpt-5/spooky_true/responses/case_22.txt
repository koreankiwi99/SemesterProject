axiom obj : Type
axiom City : obj

axiom Drought : obj → Prop
axiom WaterRestrictions : obj → Prop
axiom Rationing : obj → Prop

-- From the context:
-- If a city experiences a drought, authorities implement water restrictions.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Drought x → WaterRestrictions x
-- Drought conditions require rationing water usage.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Drought x → Rationing x

-- Given statement: Either the city did not enforce water limits, or it did not ration water usage.
axiom Prem : ¬ WaterRestrictions City ∨ ¬ Rationing City

-- From the given disjunction and the implications from drought, we can derive that the city is not in a drought.
theorem not_drought_city : ¬ Drought City :=
