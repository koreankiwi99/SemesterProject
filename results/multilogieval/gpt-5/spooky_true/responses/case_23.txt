-- If someone wakes early, they feel energized
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, WakesEarly x → Energized x
-- If someone plans their day, they are productive
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, PlansWell x → Productive x
-- If someone has self-discipline, they wake early
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, SelfDisciplined x → WakesEarly x

-- Some people lack energy or productivity
axiom SomeLack : ∃ x : obj, ¬ Energized x ∨ ¬ Productive x

-- Given statement: Mark plans his day well
axiom MarkPlans : PlansWell Mark

-- What we can derive: Mark is productive
theorem mark_productive : Productive Mark := by
  apply (R2 Mark)
  exact MarkPlans
