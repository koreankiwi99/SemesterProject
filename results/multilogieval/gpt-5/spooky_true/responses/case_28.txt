axiom Hurt : obj → Prop
axiom SeeDoctor : obj → Prop
axiom Rest : obj → Prop

-- Premises from the textual context
axiom Hurt_implies_SeeDoctor : ∀ x : obj, Hurt x → SeeDoctor x
axiom Hurt_implies_Rest : ∀ x : obj, Hurt x → Rest x

-- Given statement to evaluate as a fact
axiom disj : ¬ SeeDoctor Jane ∨ ¬ Rest Jane

-- From the premises and the given disjunction, Jane could not have been hurt
theorem not_hurt_Jane : ¬ Hurt Jane := by
