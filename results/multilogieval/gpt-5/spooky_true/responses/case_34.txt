-- From context:
-- Publishing research makes them experts.
axiom C1 : ∀ x : obj, Publish x → Expert x
-- Collaborating with top scholars brings recognition as leaders.
axiom C2 : ∀ x : obj, CollaboratesTop x → RecognizedLeader x
-- Professors are neither experts nor recognized leaders.
axiom C3 : ∀ x : obj, Professor x → (¬ Expert x ∧ ¬ RecognizedLeader x)
-- Being curious and asking questions leads to publishing original research (hence publishing).
axiom C4 : ∀ x : obj, (Curious x ∧ Asks x) → Publish x

-- Dr. Lee is a professor at the university.
axiom Lee_prof : Professor DrLee

-- From the statement to evaluate (assumed true), prove Dr. Lee is curious and asks questions.
