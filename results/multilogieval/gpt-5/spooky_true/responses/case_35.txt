-- If a person finds their account is hacked, they need to reset their password immediately.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : person, Hacked x → ShouldReset x
-- One should notify their bank if they detect unauthorized access.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : person, DetectUnauthorized x → ShouldNotify x

-- Either Lucy did not change her password or she informed her bank (about the breach).
axiom S : ¬ ChangedPassword Lucy ∨ InformedBank Lucy

-- Restate the given disjunction as a usable theorem.
theorem given_disjunction : ¬ ChangedPassword Lucy ∨ InformedBank Lucy := by
