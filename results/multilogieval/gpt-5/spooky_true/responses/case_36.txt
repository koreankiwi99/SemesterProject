axiom person : Type
axiom Mary : person

axiom Problems : person → Prop
axiom Restarted : person → Prop
axiom InstalledLatest : person → Prop

-- If someone is having computer problems, they should try restarting it.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : person, Problems x → Restarted x
-- If there are issues, the user should install the latest updates (modeled to align with the statement).
axiom R2 : ∀ x : person, Problems x → InstalledLatest x

-- Statement to evaluate (assumed given): Either Mary did not restart or she did not install the latest updates.
axiom S : ¬ Restarted Mary ∨ ¬ InstalledLatest Mary

-- From the above, we can derive that Mary was not having problems.
theorem mary_not_having_problems : ¬ Problems Mary := by
