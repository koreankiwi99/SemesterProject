-- If someone plants a garden, they need to water and care for the plants.
axiom H1 : ∀ p : Person, PlantsGarden p → (NeedWater p ∧ NeedCare p)
-- If there is a drought, there is a watering ban.
axiom H2 : Drought → WateringBan
-- Either Mark plants a garden or there is a drought.
axiom H3 : PlantsGarden Mark ∨ Drought
-- If there is a watering ban, then for any person, their plants won't get enough water.
axiom H4 : WateringBan → ∀ p : Person, NotEnoughWater p
-- If the plants don't get watered enough, the garden will fail to thrive.
axiom H5 : ∀ p : Person, NotEnoughWater p → GardenFail p

-- Given: Mark did not need to care for garden plants.
