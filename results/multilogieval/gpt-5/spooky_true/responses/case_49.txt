-- If the driveway is wet, then it must have rained recently.
axiom A1 : WetDriveway → RainedRecently
-- If someone washed their car, then they used water on the driveway.
axiom A2 : WashedCar → UsedWaterOnDriveway
-- Either the driveway is wet, or no one washed their car, or the driveway is wet even though no one washed their car.
axiom A3 : WetDriveway ∨ ¬ WashedCar ∨ (WetDriveway ∧ ¬ WashedCar)
-- If the hose is uncoiled, it means someone was washing their car.
axiom A4 : HoseUncoiled → WashedCar
-- Either the hose is uncoiled, or the sponge is soapy, or both.
axiom A5 : HoseUncoiled ∨ SpongeSoapy ∨ (HoseUncoiled ∧ SpongeSoapy)
