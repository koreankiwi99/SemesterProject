axiom obj : Type
axiom Priya : obj

axiom Attend : obj → Prop
axiom Study : obj → Prop
axiom Excel : obj → Prop

-- Premise: If someone attends regularly, then if they study diligently, they will excel.
axiom Prem1 : ∀ x : obj, Attend x → (Study x → Excel x)

-- Facts about Priya
axiom Priya_studied : Study Priya
axiom Priya_not_excelled : ¬ Excel Priya

-- From the premise and facts, we can derive that Priya did not attend lectures regularly.
theorem priya_did_not_attend : ¬ Attend Priya := by
  intro hAttend
  have hImp : Study Priya → Excel Priya := Prem1 Priya hAttend
  have hExcel : Excel Priya := hImp Priya_studied
  exact Priya_not_excelled hExcel
