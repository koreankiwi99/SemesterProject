axiom person : Type
axiom Linda : person

axiom PlantsDiseaseResistant : person → Prop
axiom ProperCare : person → Prop
axiom BountifulHarvest : person → Prop

-- If someone plants disease-resistant varieties, then if they water and feed properly, they will have a bountiful harvest.
axiom rule : ∀ x : person, PlantsDiseaseResistant x → (ProperCare x → BountifulHarvest x)

-- Facts about Linda
axiom care_Linda : ProperCare Linda
axiom not_bountiful_Linda : ¬ BountifulHarvest Linda

-- From the rule, Linda's proper care, and the fact she did not have a bountiful harvest,
-- we can conclude that Linda did not plant disease-resistant varieties.
