axiom person : Type
axiom Priya : person
axiom Attends : person → Prop
axiom Revises : person → Prop
axiom PerformsWell : person → Prop

-- Context: If a student attends lectures regularly, then if they revise, they perform well.
axiom attends_implies_revise_implies_perform :
  ∀ x : person, Attends x → (Revises x → PerformsWell x)

-- Given: Priya revised sufficiently and did not perform well.
axiom PriyaRevised : Revises Priya
axiom PriyaNotPerform : ¬ PerformsWell Priya

-- From the context and givens, we can prove Priya did not attend lectures regularly.
theorem Priya_not_attend : ¬ Attends Priya :=
by
  intro hAttend
  have hImp : Revises Priya → PerformsWell Priya :=
    attends_implies_revise_implies_perform Priya hAttend
  have hPerf : PerformsWell Priya := hImp PriyaRevised
  exact PriyaNotPerform hPerf
