-- Context: If the wood is high quality, then if the joints are cut precisely, the finished product will be sturdy and long-lasting.
axiom carpentry_rule :
  ∀ x : obj, HighQualityWood x → (PreciseJoints x → (Sturdy x ∧ LongLasting x))

-- Facts from the statement:
axiom precise_bookshelf : PreciseJoints Bookshelf
axiom shaky_bookshelf : ¬ Sturdy Bookshelf
axiom fell_apart_quickly_bookshelf : ¬ LongLasting Bookshelf

-- From the context and facts, we can derive that the wood was not high quality.
