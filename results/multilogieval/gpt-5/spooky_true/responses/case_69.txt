axiom obj : Type
axiom Lebron : obj

axiom TrainHard : obj → Prop
axiom Focused : obj → Prop
axiom PerformBest : obj → Prop

-- Coaches' rule: if a player trains hard, then if they are focused, they perform their best.
axiom Rule : ∀ x : obj, TrainHard x → (Focused x → PerformBest x)

-- Facts about Lebron
axiom Lebron_focused : Focused Lebron
axiom Lebron_not_best : ¬ PerformBest Lebron

-- From the rule and facts, we can derive that Lebron did not train hard.
theorem Lebron_not_train : ¬ TrainHard Lebron :=
