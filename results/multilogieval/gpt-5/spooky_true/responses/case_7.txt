-- From the text: the gardener enriched the soil.
axiom fact_enriched : EnrichedSoil

-- From the text: they believed if soil has enough nutrients, plants are healthy.
axiom rule_belief : EnoughNutrients → PlantsHealthy

axiom fact_lots : LotsOfVegetables

-- Natural link: producing lots of vegetables means the harvest is abundant.
axiom rule_lots_abundant : LotsOfVegetables → AbundantHarvest

theorem soil_enriched : EnrichedSoil := fact_enriched
theorem harvest_abundant : AbundantHarvest := rule_lots_abundant fact_lots
