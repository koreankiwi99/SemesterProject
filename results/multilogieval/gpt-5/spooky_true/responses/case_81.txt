axiom obj : Type

-- Entities
axiom Amy : obj

-- Predicates
axiom Practice : obj → Prop            -- practicing basic chords daily
axiom MuscleMemory : obj → Prop        -- developed muscle memory
axiom PlaySimple : obj → Prop          -- able to play simple songs
axiom LearnedTheory : obj → Prop       -- learned music theory
axiom KnowStructure : obj → Prop       -- has knowledge about song structure

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Practice x → MuscleMemory x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, MuscleMemory x → PlaySimple x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, Practice x ∨ LearnedTheory x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, LearnedTheory x → KnowStructure x

-- Goal: If Amy cannot play any songs yet (in particular, not simple songs), then she has knowledge about song structure.
