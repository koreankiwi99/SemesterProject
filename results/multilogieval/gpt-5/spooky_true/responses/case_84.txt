axiom PracticedDailyNewMelodies : person → Prop
axiom ExpandedRepertoire : person → Prop

axiom InspiredFromCollab : person → Prop

axiom ReleasedAlbumThisYear : person → Prop

-- Premises from the text
-- If they practiced new melodies daily, they would expand their repertoire.
axiom P1 : ∀ x : person, PracticedDailyNewMelodies x → ExpandedRepertoire x
-- If they had more material, they could produce enough songs for an album (i.e., could compose an album).
axiom P2 : ∀ x : person, MoreMaterial x → CouldComposeAlbum x
-- We connect expanded repertoire to having more material (natural bridge).
axiom P3 : ∀ x : person, ExpandedRepertoire x → MoreMaterial x
-- So if they practiced new melodies daily, they could compose an album. (derivable; also taken as a premise in text)
theorem practiced_to_could_compose : ∀ x : person, PracticedDailyNewMelodies x → CouldComposeAlbum x :=
  fun x => fun h =>
    P2 x (P3 x (P1 x h))

-- Either the musician practiced new melodies, or they jammed with friends, or both.
-- We model this generically (for any person) to strengthen the premise; even so it will not suffice for the target conclusion.
axiom P4 : ∀ x : person, PracticedDailyNewMelodies x ∨ JammedWithFriends x

-- If someone jammed with friends, they gained inspiration from collaboration.
axiom P5 : ∀ x : person, JammedWithFriends x → InspiredFromCollab x
-- And if they felt inspired, their creativity flourished.
axiom P6 : ∀ x : person, InspiredFromCollab x → CreativityFlourished x

-- Useful derived lemma: jamming implies creativity flourished.
theorem jam_to_flourish : ∀ x : person, JammedWithFriends x → CreativityFlourished x :=
  fun x => fun hjam => P6 x (P5 x hjam)

-- Target statement to evaluate:
-- If Sarah did not release an album this year, did her creativity flourish?
-- This would be: (¬ ReleasedAlbumThisYear Sarah) → CreativityFlourished Sarah
-- With the given premises, we cannot derive this implication:
-- - We have no connection from "did not release an album this year" to jamming or inspiration.
-- - The disjunction (practiced ∨ jammed) does not force jamming; Sarah could have only practiced,
--   which (via practiced_to_could_compose) talks about being able to compose, not about inspiration/creativity.
-- - There is no premise linking "could compose" or "compose" to "released an album this year" either direction.
-- Therefore, the desired implication is not provable from the premises.

-- We can at most show:
theorem if_jammed_then_Sarah_flourished : JammedWithFriends Sarah → CreativityFlourished Sarah :=
  jam_to_flourish Sarah
