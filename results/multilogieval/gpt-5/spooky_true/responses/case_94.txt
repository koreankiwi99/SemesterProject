-- If someone did sprint workouts several times a week, their speed improved.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, SprintWorkoutsSeveral x → SpeedImproved x
-- If their speed improved, they could run races faster.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, SpeedImproved x → RunFaster x
-- "Trained hard weekly" corresponds to doing sprint workouts several times a week.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, TrainHardWeekly x → SprintWorkoutsSeveral x

-- Either they trained hard at sprinting, or they stretched regularly after runs, or both (for Lauren).
axiom D : TrainHardWeekly Lauren ∨ StretchedAfterRuns Lauren
-- If they stretched after runs, they took recovery seriously.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, StretchedAfterRuns x → RecoverySerious x
-- If they took recovery seriously, they focused on muscle flexibility to prevent injury.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, RecoverySerious x → FocusFlexibility x
