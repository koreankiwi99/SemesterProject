Premises: John orders food online whenever he is busy with work. John prefers to order from local restaurants to support small businesses.. If John is busy with work, he opts for delivery. When not busy with work, John enjoys hiking in the nearby hills.. John recently upgraded his computer to handle more complex projects.. Getting food delivered saves time when John has a heavy workload.
Conclusion: Either John did not order food online or he did not get delivery. Was John busy with work?

Lean Code:
-- We model the situation with propositional variables about John
axiom Busy : Prop
axiom OrdersOnline : Prop
axiom Delivery : Prop

-- Other contextual facts (unused in the logical derivations below)
axiom PrefersLocal : Prop
axiom EnjoysHiking : Prop
axiom UpgradedComputer : Prop
axiom HeavyWorkload : Prop
axiom SavesTimeWithDelivery : Prop

-- Premises:
-- 1) If John is busy with work, then he orders food online.
axiom p1 : Busy → OrdersOnline
-- 2) If John is busy with work, then he opts for delivery.
axiom p3 : Busy → Delivery
-- 3) When not busy with work, John enjoys hiking in the nearby hills.
axiom p4 : ¬ Busy → EnjoysHiking
-- 4) John recently upgraded his computer to handle more complex projects.
axiom p5 : UpgradedComputer
-- 5) Getting food delivered saves time when John has a heavy workload.
axiom p6 : HeavyWorkload → SavesTimeWithDelivery

-- Useful consequences of the premises
theorem orders_and_delivery_if_busy : Busy → (OrdersOnline ∧ Delivery) := by
  intro hB
  exact And.intro (p1 hB) (p3 hB)

  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hNo => exact hNo (p1 hB)
  | inr hNd => exact hNd (p3 hB)

-- From the analyzed "conclusion" (¬OrdersOnline ∨ ¬Delivery), we can infer John was not busy.

-- Claimed conclusion to analyze (this does NOT follow from the premises)
theorem conclusion : (¬ OrdersOnline ∨ ¬ Delivery) := by

-- We also cannot prove that John was busy (or not busy) from the premises alone;
-- we only have the tautological excluded middle.
