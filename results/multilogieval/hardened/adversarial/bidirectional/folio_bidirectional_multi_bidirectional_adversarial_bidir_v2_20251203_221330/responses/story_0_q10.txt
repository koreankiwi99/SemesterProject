Premises: He has a habit of reading gadget reviews online in his free time.. Mark often visits the electronics store on weekends.. Mark prefers to shop in the afternoons when the store is less crowded.. Whenever Mark notices a sale at the electronics store, he checks the prices. If there is a sale, Mark compares different models. Doing research during sales events helps get the best deals on new gadgets.
Conclusion: Either Mark did not check the prices, or he did not compare models. Was there a sale at the electronics store?
