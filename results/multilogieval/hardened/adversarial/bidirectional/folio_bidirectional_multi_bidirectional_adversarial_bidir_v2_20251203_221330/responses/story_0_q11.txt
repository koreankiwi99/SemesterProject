Premises: With everything stored digitally these days, computer security is so important. The antivirus software was updated to its latest version last week.. I often use my computer for graphic design and video editing projects.. My computer is a high-performance model with a sleek design.. If my computer has antivirus software, my files will be secure. Also, if there is a malware attack, my computer could crash. It seems either I have antivirus, there will be an attack, or possibly both.
Conclusion: If my computer did not crash, then were my files secure?

-- Premises
-- The antivirus software was updated to its latest version last week (so Antivirus holds).
axiom premise_antivirus_present : Antivirus
-- If my computer has antivirus software, my files will be secure.
axiom premise_antivirus_implies_secure : Antivirus → Secure
-- If there is a malware attack, my computer could crash (we formalize as: if attack then crash).
axiom premise_attack_implies_crash : Attack → Crash
-- Either I have antivirus, there will be an attack, or possibly both (inclusive or).
axiom premise_antivirus_or_attack : Antivirus ∨ Attack

-- From the premises, the original conclusion (¬Crash → Secure) is actually true:
theorem conclusion_true : (¬Crash → Secure) := by
  -- We already have Antivirus, hence Secure unconditionally.
  have hA : Antivirus := premise_antivirus_present
  have hS : Secure := premise_antivirus_implies_secure hA
  intro _
  exact hS

-- We are required to formalize the NEGATION of the conclusion and attempt a proof.
-- Negation of the conclusion: ¬(¬Crash → Secure)
theorem negation_of_conclusion : ¬(¬Crash → Secure) := by
  -- This is not derivable from the premises; in fact, the conclusion is provable (see conclusion_true).
  -- Hence this theorem cannot be proven from the given premises.
  sorry

-- For completeness, we can show that the negation is impossible (double negation of the conclusion holds).
