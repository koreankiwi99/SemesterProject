Premises: Michelle wants to take a drive to the mountains and go shopping downtown. If the car has enough gas, she can drive to the mountains. If Michelle got her paycheck this week, she'll also go shopping downtown. She has been planning to redecorate her living room with mountain-themed decor.. Either she won't drive to the mountains or she won't go shopping, or maybe she'll do neither. Michelle enjoys hiking in the mountains during the weekends.. Michelle recently read a book about the history of downtown architecture.. Michelle thinks about when she started her new job. She knows that if she started a new job recently, then she got her paycheck this week.
Conclusion: If the car has enough gas, did Michelle start a new job recently?

-- Premises formalized
-- If the car has enough gas, she can drive to the mountains.
axiom P_gas_implies_drive : Gas → DriveMountains
-- If Michelle got her paycheck this week, she'll go shopping downtown.
axiom P_paycheck_implies_shop : PaycheckThisWeek → ShopDowntown
-- Either she won't drive to the mountains or she won't go shopping (or both).
axiom P_not_drive_or_not_shop : ¬DriveMountains ∨ ¬ShopDowntown
-- If she started a new job recently, then she got her paycheck this week.
axiom P_started_implies_paycheck : StartedNewJobRecently → PaycheckThisWeek

-- Conclusion to analyze:
-- If the car has enough gas, did Michelle start a new job recently?
-- Formally: Gas → StartedNewJobRecently
theorem conclusion : Gas → StartedNewJobRecently := by
  -- This does not follow from the premises. In fact, we derived Gas → ¬StartedNewJobRecently above.
