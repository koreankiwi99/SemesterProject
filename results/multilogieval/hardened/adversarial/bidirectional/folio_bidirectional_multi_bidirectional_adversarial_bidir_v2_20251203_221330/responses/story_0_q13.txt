Premises: The coach knew that if it is raining heavily, then the soccer game gets canceled. The soccer field might also be muddy. The soccer field is located near a large park with lots of trees.. The coach always brings an umbrella to the games just in case.. The coach planned to discuss new strategies with the team after the match.. If the field is muddy, that means it is too wet to play on safely. Either it is raining heavily, or the field is not too wet, or it is raining but the field is still okay to play on. The coach also knows that if a big storm passed through last night, then the field would be muddy today.
Conclusion: If the game is not canceled, then did a big storm roll through last night?
