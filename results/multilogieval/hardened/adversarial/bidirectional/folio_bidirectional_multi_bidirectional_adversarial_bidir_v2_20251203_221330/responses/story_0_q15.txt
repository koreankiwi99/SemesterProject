Story ID: 0
Example ID: 15
Premises: James started a garden in his backyard. He learned that if he waters his plants daily, they will grow healthy and strong. James enjoys spending his weekends reading gardening books.. When the plants are robust, they end up producing more flowers and vegetables. The backyard where James started his garden is surrounded by a tall wooden fence.. James understood that if his plants produced more yields, his garden would become plentiful.. In addition to gardening, James also likes to paint landscapes in his free time.
Conclusion: If James waters his plants daily, does he have a plentiful garden?
