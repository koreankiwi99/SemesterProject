Story ID: 0
Example ID: 2
Premises: Jim prefers to drink iced tea while relaxing in the sun.. The swimming pool is located in Jim's backyard.. Jim knows that if he waters his lawn, the grass will stay green. He also knows that if it is hot and sunny outside, he will go swimming to cool off. Either Jim watered the lawn, or he did not go swimming, or he watered the lawn and did not go swimming.. Jim often mows his lawn on weekends.
Conclusion: If it was hot and sunny outside, then did Jim's lawn stay green?
