Premises: She has a passion for painting landscapes in her free time.. Emily wanted to maximize her productivity at work. Emily often brings homemade lunches to work.. She learned that if she got a good night's sleep consistently, she would feel well-rested and energized in the mornings. Feeling well-rested allowed Emily to stay focused during her workday. Whether it was prioritizing sleep, avoiding evening caffeine, or both, Emily took steps to optimize her sleep habits.. Emily is known for her friendly and approachable demeanor among her colleagues.
Conclusion: If Emily does not stay focused at work, then does she avoid caffeine in the evenings?
