Story ID: 0
Example ID: 4
Premises: Lucy had been feeling exhausted lately. She realized it may be because she wasn't getting enough sleep at night. She usually takes a walk in the park every weekend to relax.. Lucy knew that if she didn't get enough sleep, she would feel tired during the day. When she felt tired during the day, her productivity at work would decrease. Her favorite color is blue, and she likes to paint her nails in different shades of it.. She understood that if her productivity decreased, she would probably need to take a nap after work.. Lucy often enjoys reading mystery novels in her free time.
Conclusion: If Lucy doesn't get enough sleep, does she take a nap after work?

-- Premises from the story
-- Lucy had been feeling exhausted lately (we model as being tired during the day)
axiom premise_exhausted : TiredDuringDay Lucy

-- If she didn't get enough sleep, she would feel tired during the day.
axiom premise1 : ∀ x : Person, NotEnoughSleep x → TiredDuringDay x

-- When she felt tired during the day, her productivity at work would decrease.
axiom premise2 : ∀ x : Person, TiredDuringDay x → ProductivityDecreased x

-- If her productivity decreased, she would probably need to take a nap after work.
-- We model "probably need" as a separate predicate that does not entail actually napping.
axiom premise3 : ∀ x : Person, ProductivityDecreased x → ProbablyNeedsNap x

-- Other facts (not used in the inference toward the conclusion)

-- We attempt to prove the negation of the conclusion:
-- Negation target: ¬(NotEnoughSleep Lucy → NapAfterWork Lucy)
theorem negate_conclusion : ¬(NotEnoughSleep Lucy → NapAfterWork Lucy) := by
  intro h
  -- From premises we can derive only a "probable need" to nap, not an actual nap,
  -- and we are not given ¬NapAfterWork Lucy nor NotEnoughSleep Lucy.
  -- Therefore, no contradiction can be derived from assuming the implication.
  -- The proof cannot be completed from the given premises.
