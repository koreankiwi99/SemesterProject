Example ID: 5
Premises: Mark often drinks coffee while working on his computer.. Whenever Mark's computer runs slowly, he restarts it. Mark's computer has a sleek silver design and a large monitor.. Additionally, if Mark's computer is sluggish, he checks for any software updates. He recently bought a new ergonomic chair for his home office.. Keeping the computer updated improves performance over time.
Conclusion: Mark either did not restart his computer or he did not check for updates. Is Mark's computer running slowly?
