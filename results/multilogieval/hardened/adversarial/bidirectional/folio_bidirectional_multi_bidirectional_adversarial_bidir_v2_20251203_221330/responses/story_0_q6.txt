Premises: I often send my packages to a nearby pickup location for convenience.. The store recently renovated its interior to attract more customers.. I'm not sure what I'll end up doing today. My friend has a knack for picking out the best birthday gifts.. If my package arrives, I can finally wrap my friend's gift for her birthday. But if the store has a sale, I may shop for some new clothes. It seems either my package will come, there will be a sale, or perhaps both will happen.
Conclusion: If I did not shop for new clothes, then did I wrap my friend's gift?
