Premises: Mark decided he wanted to get in better shape. Mark has always been fond of hiking in the mountains during the weekends.. He knew that if he started eating a healthy diet, he would have more energy throughout the day. He often reads books on nutrition and wellness in his free time.. With this extra energy, he would feel motivated to exercise regularly. If Mark felt motivated to exercise regularly, he could lose weight over time.. Mark's favorite hobby is painting landscapes in his backyard studio.
Conclusion: If Mark eats a healthy diet, does he lose weight?
