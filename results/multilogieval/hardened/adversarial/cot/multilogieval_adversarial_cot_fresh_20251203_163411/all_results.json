Also, if the stove is on, there is a burning smell in the house. The house has a cozy living room adjacent to the kitchen.. This indicates the stove should be turned off when not in use.\nQuestion: Either the kitchen is not warm or there is no burning smell. Was the stove left on?\nReasoning steps:\n1.

I'm not sure what I'll end up doing today. My friend has a knack for picking out the best birthday gifts.. If my package arrives, I can finally wrap my friend's gift for her birthday. But if the store has a sale, I may shop for some new clothes. It seems either my package will come, there will be a sale, or perhaps both will happen.\nQuestion: If I did not shop for new clothes, then did I wrap my friend's gift?\nReasoning steps: \n- Let P = package arrives, W = I wrap the gift, S = there is a sale, C = I shop for clothes.\n- Premises: P -> W; S -> C; P \u2228 S.\n- Assume \u00acC. From S -> C, contrapose to get \u00acC -> \u00acS, so \u00acS.\n- From P \u2228 S and \u00acS, infer P. From P -> W, infer W.\nAnswer: Yes"

Mark prefers to shop in the afternoons when the store is less crowded.. Whenever Mark notices a sale at the electronics store, he checks the prices. If there is a sale, Mark compares different models. Doing research during sales events helps get the best deals on new gadgets.\nQuestion: Either Mark did not check the prices, or he did not compare models. Was there a sale at the electronics store?\nReasoning steps: \n- Let S = there is a sale; P = Mark checks prices; M = Mark compares models.\n- From the context: If S then P; If S then M, so S -> (P \u2227 M).\n- The statement \u201cEither not P or not M\u201d is \u00acP \u2228 \u00acM, equivalent to \u00ac(P \u2227 M).\n- By contrapositive of S -> (P \u2227 M), \u00ac(P \u2227 M) -> \u00acS.\n- Therefore, no sale occurred.\nAnswer: No"

After seeing how well Lily did, the shelter staff would ask her to foster dogs temporarily. From fostering, Lily would realize that she could provide a forever home for one of the dogs by adopting it herself.. Lily's favorite breed of dog is the Labrador Retriever, and she has a soft spot for them.\nQuestion: If Lily volunteers at the animal shelter, does she adopt one of her foster dogs?\nReasoning steps:\n- Volunteering leads to gaining experience; doing well leads to being asked to foster, and the narrative implies she fosters.\n- From fostering, she realizes she could adopt one of the dogs.\n- Realizing she could adopt does not entail that she actually adopts.\n- Therefore, adoption is not logically guaranteed from volunteering.\nAnswer: no"

If Justin misses the spelling bee, he cannot win.\nQuestion: If Jessica did not win the spelling bee, did Justin fail to win the spelling bee?\nReasoning steps:\n- From \"If Jessica trains, she will win\" (Jt -> Jw) and \"Jessica did not win\" (\u00acJw), infer \"Jessica did not train\" (\u00acJt) by contrapositive.\n- From \"Jessica trains or Justin gets sick\" (Jt \u2228 Js) and \"Jessica did not train\" (\u00acJt), infer \"Justin gets sick\" (Js) by disjunctive syllogism.\n- From \"If Justin gets sick, he will miss\" (Js -> Jm) and Js, infer \"Justin misses\" (Jm).\n- From \"If Justin misses, he cannot win\" (Jm -> \u00acWj), infer \"Justin does not win\" (\u00acWj).\nAnswer: Yes"

She realized that if the workout became easy, it would not be challenging enough anymore. She often reads books about nutrition in her free time.. Nina understood that if the workout was not challenging, she would have to increase the intensity to see continued progress.. Nina enjoys listening to music while working out.\nQuestion: If Nina starts a new workout routine, does she increase the intensity?\nReasoning steps: \n- From starting a new routine, it follows that over time she becomes stronger.\n- If the workout becomes easy, then it is not challenging; if it is not challenging, she must increase intensity.\n- There is no rule that becoming stronger implies the workout becomes easy or not challenging.\n- Therefore, starting a new routine does not entail that she increases the intensity.\nAnswer: no"

And if he had to take a taxi, his transportation costs for the month would go up. Jeff realized that if his transportation costs rose, it would put a strain on his monthly budget.. Jeff bought a new pair of shoes last weekend that he really likes.\nQuestion: If Jeff misses the bus to work, does his monthly budget feel strained?\nReasoning steps: Missing the bus implies taking a taxi, which raises monthly transportation costs, which in turn strains his monthly budget.\nAnswer: Yes"

    "model_response": "Context: James's bike is painted bright red, which is his favorite color.. James was preparing for an important cycling race. James enjoys reading books about cycling strategies.. He decided to train hard so he could increase his biking speed. James knew if he cycled faster, he would be able to finish the race quickly. In addition to training, James strived to either diligently fix up his bike, or train for the race, or make time for both activities. He realized that if he fixed his bike regularly, it would operate smoothly. Logically, if his bike operated smoothly, James would have a good chance of winning the race.. In his free time, James likes to paint landscapes.\nQuestion: If James does not finish the race quickly, then does he win the race?\nReasoning steps:\n- From the context: Faster -> Finish quickly; Fix -> Smooth; Smooth -> Good chance of winning (not guaranteed win).\n- Assuming he does not finish quickly, by contrapositive he did not cycle faster. This does not imply winning.\n- There is no rule that Not finish quickly (or Not faster) implies winning; the only path given leads to a \u201cgood chance,\u201d not certainty, and we do not know he fixed the bike.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude he wins.\nAnswer: No"

If invited, then Ashley takes a break and goes to the concert.\n2. Either Ashley studied 4 hours daily or she did not take a break and go.\n3. Given invited, she did take a break and go; thus the \u201cdid not take a break and go\u201d disjunct is false.\n4. Therefore, from the disjunction, Ashley studied 4 hours daily.\n5. If she studied 4 hours daily, then she aces the exam.\n6. If she aces the exam, her stress decreases.\n7. When her stress decreases, she feels recharged.\n8. Hence, if invited, Ashley feels recharged.\nAnswer: Yes"
