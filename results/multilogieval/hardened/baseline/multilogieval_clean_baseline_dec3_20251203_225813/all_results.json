John not bringing treats does not imply it wasn\u2019t a birthday (others could bring treats).\n- Without knowing it wasn\u2019t a birthday, the disjunction (projects early or birthday) doesn\u2019t force that projects were done early.\n- Even if projects were done early, \u201ccan take a long lunch\u201d does not guarantee that he took one; only taking a long lunch leads to a productive afternoon via recharged.\n- Thus, a very productive afternoon does not logically follow.\nAnswer: No"

And if they could be heard clearly, then they could captivate people's attention.\nQuestion: If Emma cannot engage people better during speeches, then can she captivate people's attention?\nReasoning steps: [1) From practice -> comfort and comfort -> engage, we have practice -> engage. 2) From voice-projection -> heard clearly and heard clearly -> captivate, we have voice-projection -> captivate. 3) Given practice or voice-projection. 4) Assume Emma cannot engage (\u00acengage). 5) By contrapositive of practice -> engage, \u00acengage -> \u00acpractice; thus Emma did not practice. 6) From (practice or voice-projection) and \u00acpractice, conclude voice-projection. 7) From voice-projection -> captivate, conclude Emma can captivate.]\nAnswer: Yes"

Either they practiced speaking Spanish daily, or they watched Spanish TV shows, or both. If they watched Spanish TV shows, their listening comprehension would get better. This is important because if their listening comprehension improved, they could understand rapid conversational Spanish.\nQuestion: If Mark cannot converse with native speakers, can he understand rapid conversational Spanish?\nReasoning steps: From \u201cif practiced then converse,\u201d contraposition gives: not converse \u2192 not practiced. Given \u201cpracticed or watched,\u201d not practiced \u2192 watched. Watching TV shows \u2192 better listening \u2192 understand rapid conversational Spanish. Hence, not converse implies understand rapid conversational Spanish.\nAnswer: Yes"

If a big cat has stripes and hunts at night, visitors are intrigued. Visitors find either an animal with a mane majestic or a big cat that hunts at night intriguing, or both. If the lion is majestic, then the tiger is intriguing. If the tiger is fed raw meat, then the lion is majestic.\nQuestion: Can we conclude if the lion is not majestic then the tiger is not fed raw meat?\nReasoning steps:\n- From the context: If the tiger is fed raw meat, then the lion is majestic (TRM -> LM).\n- By contraposition in classical logic, TRM -> LM entails \u00acLM -> \u00acTRM.\n- Therefore, if the lion is not majestic, the tiger is not fed raw meat.\n- Other premises (about carnivores normally being fed raw meat, mane/roar, stripes/hunting, intriguing) are not needed for this inference.\nAnswer: Yes"

    "model_response": "Context: James was preparing for an important cycling race. He decided to train hard so he could increase his biking speed. James knew if he cycled faster, he would be able to finish the race quickly. In addition to training, James strived to either diligently fix up his bike, or train for the race, or make time for both activities. He realized that if he fixed his bike regularly, it would operate smoothly. Logically, if his bike operated smoothly, James would have a good chance of winning the race.\nQuestion: If James does not finish the race quickly, then does he win the race?\nReasoning steps: [1. Let Fq = finishes quickly, Fa = cycles faster, Fx = fixes bike, Sm = bike operates smoothly, Win = wins.\n2. Premises: Fa -> Fq; Fx -> Sm; Sm -> Win. The disjunction (Fx or Tr) does not entail Fx specifically.\n3. From not Fq, by contrapositive of Fa -> Fq, infer not Fa. No rule links not Fq (or not Fa) to Fx, Sm, or Win.\n4. Win would follow from Fx via Sm, but Fx cannot be inferred. Hence not Fq does not imply Win.]\nAnswer: No"

If Oliver declutters, he naturally becomes more organized overall. And if he becomes more organized, his life feels simpler.\nQuestion: If Oliver does not feel peaceful in his living space, then does his life feel simpler?\nReasoning steps: \n- From C -> T and T -> P, we have C -> P. By contraposition, \u00acP -> \u00acT and \u00acT -> \u00acC, so \u00acP -> \u00acC.\n- Given C \u2228 D and \u00acC, infer D.\n- From D -> O and O -> S, infer D -> S, hence S.\n- Therefore \u00acP implies S.\nAnswer: Yes"
