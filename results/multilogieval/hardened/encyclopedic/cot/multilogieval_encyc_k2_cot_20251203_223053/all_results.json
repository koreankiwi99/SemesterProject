Also, if someone won a baking contest, they'll celebrate with friends and family. Either peaches are in season, or someone won a contest, or perhaps both. If someone bakes a pie, the house will smell amazing. And if the house smells amazing, it feels like a homey, cozy place to relax.\nQuestion: If James did not celebrate with friends and family, then did the house feel homey and cozy?\nReasoning steps:\n- Rules: P -> \u2203B; \u2200x B(x) -> S; S -> H; \u2200x W(x) -> C(x); P \u2228 \u2203W.\n- From \u00acC(James), by contraposition we get \u00acW(James), but this does not rule out that someone else won (\u2203W).\n- If the disjunction is satisfied by \u2203W and not P, there is no chain to S or H. Thus H is not guaranteed from \u00acC(James).\n- Countermodel: No peaches (\u00acP); someone else won and celebrated; James did not celebrate; then H need not hold.\nAnswer: No"

If a runner participates in marathons, and they have strong legs, they can complete long distances. If a swimmer practices breathing techniques and has strong arm muscles, they can excel in competitions. A runner can complete long distances in marathons, or a swimmer can excel in competitions, or both. If Sarah completes long distances in marathons, then Alex excels in competitions. If Alex has good endurance, then Sarah completes long distances in marathons.\nQuestion: Can we conclude if Sarah does not excel in competitions then Alex does not have good endurance?\nReasoning steps: [generate step-by-step reasoning]\nAnswer: Yes/No",

Kalo Chorio village has a population of around 900, nestled in the midst of a verdant hilly landscape, where olive groves, abundant and colorful mediterranean shrubs and plants reach all the way down to the sea. Alex and Sarah are athletes who train regularly. Typically, athletes who train regularly have good endurance. If a runner participates in marathons, and they have strong legs, they can complete long distances. If a swimmer practices breathing techniques and has strong arm muscles, they can excel in competitions.

If Alex has good endurance, then Sarah completes long distances in marathons.\nQuestion: Can we conclude if Sarah does not excel in competitions then Alex does not have good endurance?\nReasoning steps:\n- From Alex trains regularly and the typical rule, we may default to Alex has good endurance.\n- If Alex has good endurance, then Sarah completes long distances in marathons.\n- If Sarah completes long distances in marathons, then Alex excels in competitions.\n- Therefore, Alex having good endurance implies Alex excels in competitions; contrapositively, if Alex does not excel, then Alex does not have good endurance.\n- There is no premise linking Sarah\u2019s excelling (or not) to Alex\u2019s endurance. The available contrapositive involves Alex\u2019s excelling, not Sarah\u2019s.\n- Hence, \u00ac(Sarah excels) -> \u00ac(Alex has good endurance) does not follow from the premises.\nAnswer: No"

It sits on the northern side of Piccadilly at number 94, in the fashionable district of Mayfair. In a zoo, lions and tigers are carnivores. Normally, carnivores in the zoo are fed raw meat. If an animal has a mane and roars loudly, visitors find it majestic. If a big cat has stripes and hunts at night, visitors are intrigued. Visitors find either an animal with a mane majestic or a big cat that hunts at night intriguing, or both. If the lion is majestic, then the tiger is intriguing. If the tiger is fed raw meat, then the lion is majestic.\nQuestion: Can we conclude if the lion is not majestic then the tiger is fed raw meat?\nReasoning steps:\n- Premise (strict): If the tiger is fed raw meat, then the lion is majestic (R_tiger -> M_lion).\n- By contraposition (classical logic), this implies: If the lion is not majestic, then the tiger is not fed raw meat (~M_lion -> ~R_tiger).\n- The \u201cnormally carnivores are fed raw meat\u201d rule is defeasible and cannot override the strict implication when assuming the lion is not majestic; instead, it would be defeated to maintain consistency.\n- Therefore, the proposed conditional (~M_lion -> R_tiger) does not follow; in fact, the opposite (~M_lion -> ~R_tiger) is entailed.\nAnswer: No"

There is no rule connecting Aromatic(HotChocolate) to CanSweeten(HotChocolate) or to Tea.\n- The disjunction Brewed(Coffee) OR CanSweeten(Tea) permits CanSweeten(Tea) to be true independently of Hot Chocolate\u2019s properties.\n- Hence there exists a model where Hot Chocolate is not aromatic and Tea can be sweetened, so the implication does not follow.\nAnswer: No"

If customer demand was decreasing, it meant customers were becoming more price-sensitive. The executives understood that if customers were highly price-sensitive, the company would need to cut costs to maintain profitability.\nQuestion: If the company does not increase its market share, then does the company need to cut costs?\nReasoning steps: [If market share did not increase, then they did not lower prices (via the competitiveness implication). Given either prices were lowered or demand was decreasing, not lowering prices implies demand was decreasing, which implies high price sensitivity, which implies the need to cut costs.]\nAnswer: Yes"

Whenever Jim makes homemade chili sauce, his family really enjoys pouring the spicy sauce on dinner.\nQuestion: If it is chili season, then does Jim's family enjoy homemade chili sauce on dinner?\nReasoning steps: [1) From chili season, Jim picks fresh chilis. 2) Given either Jim waters or he did not pick, and he did pick, infer he waters. 3) If he waters, then the vegetables grow big and healthy. 4) If the vegetables grow big and healthy (and fresh chilis are available), he makes homemade chili sauce. 5) Whenever he makes homemade chili sauce, his family enjoys it on dinner. 6) Therefore, if it is chili season, his family enjoys homemade chili sauce on dinner.]\nAnswer: Yes"
