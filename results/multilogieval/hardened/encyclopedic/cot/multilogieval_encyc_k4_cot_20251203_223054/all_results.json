If they watched Spanish TV shows, their listening comprehension would get better. This is important because if their listening comprehension improved, they could understand rapid conversational Spanish.\nQuestion: If Mark cannot converse with native speakers, can he understand rapid conversational Spanish?\nReasoning steps:\n- Let P = practiced daily, T = watched TV shows, C = can converse, L = listening improved, U = understands rapid conversational Spanish.\n- Premises: P -> C; T -> L; L -> U; P \u2228 T. Given \u00acC.\n- From P -> C and \u00acC, infer \u00acP (modus tollens).\n- From P \u2228 T and \u00acP, infer T (disjunctive syllogism).\n- From T -> L, infer L; from L -> U, infer U.\n- Therefore, despite \u00acC, U follows.\nAnswer: Yes"

If the pool opens, all the kids will swim daily. Sam did not swim daily, so not all kids swam daily; by contrapositive, the pool did not open.\n2. Either parents plan a trip or the pool opens. Since the pool did not open, the parents planned a trip.\n3. If parents plan a trip, the family travels somewhere fun; thus they traveled.\n4. Traveling somewhere fun implies making great summer memories, which implies having amazing stories when school reopens.\n5.

The population is expected to continue dropping. Married Edna Mattern. Someone wanted to become a faster runner.

Therefore, if someone did strength training, they could run farther. Either they did strength training, or they improved running form, or both. If someone improved their running form, then they experienced less fatigue. And if they experienced less fatigue, then they could run faster speeds.\nQuestion: If James cannot run farther, then can he run faster speeds?\nReasoning steps: \n- Let ST = did strength training, RF = can run farther, IRF = improved running form, LF = less fatigue, FS = can run faster speeds.\n- From the context: ST -> RF; IRF -> LF; LF -> FS; and ST v IRF.\n- Assume James cannot run farther: \u00acRF.\n- If ST were true, then RF would be true, contradicting \u00acRF; hence \u00acST.\n- From ST v IRF and \u00acST, infer IRF; then LF; then FS.\n- Therefore, if James cannot run farther, he can run faster speeds.\nAnswer: Yes"

The team achieves success under a team leader who communicates clearly and sets goals, or an employee stands out who takes initiative, or both. If Alex stands out in the organization, then Sarah achieves success in the team. If Sarah handles team dynamics effectively, then Alex stands out in the organization.\nQuestion: Can we conclude if Sarah does not achieve success in the team then Alex has leadership skills?\nReasoning steps: From the premises we can infer that if Sarah does not achieve success, then Alex does not stand out, and thus Sarah does not handle team dynamics effectively. However, no rule links Sarah\u2019s lack of success (or Alex not standing out) to Alex having leadership skills. The only leadership-related rules either apply generically (to managers/employees) or imply handling dynamics for the same individual, neither of which establishes that Alex has leadership skills.\nAnswer: No"

There is no rule connecting Pear\u2019s color to Banana\u2019s potassium.\n- The only rule involving Pear is: if a Pear is ripe, then a Banana is yellow. This says nothing about Pear being yellow, nor does it connect Pear\u2019s not being yellow to Banana\u2019s properties.\n- The disjunction \u201cEither an Apple is red or a Banana is rich in potassium\u201d allows a model where Banana is rich in potassium regardless of anything about a Pear.\n- Counterexample: Let a Pear be not yellow; let a Banana be rich in potassium (satisfying the disjunction), and not yellow (so the \u201cif Banana is yellow then rich\u201d rule is still satisfied). All premises hold, yet \u201cif Pear is not yellow then Banana is not rich\u201d is false.\n- Therefore, the proposed implication does not follow from the premises.\nAnswer: No"

If she was injured, the athlete could not train fully. She understood that limited training would negatively impact her Olympic performance.\nQuestion: If the athlete does not have a competitive edge, is her Olympic performance impacted?\nReasoning steps: \n- If she trained intensely (T), then she\u2019d be in peak condition (P). Peak/excellent conditioning gives a competitive edge (CE). So T -> CE. Thus not CE implies not T (\u00acCE -> \u00acT).\n- Given (T \u2228 Injury I), and \u00acT, we deduce I.\n- Injury implies cannot train fully (limited training L), and limited training negatively impacts performance. So I -> L -> performance impacted.\n- Therefore, if she lacks a competitive edge, her Olympic performance is impacted.\nAnswer: Yes"

Jenny is hoping for an easy week. If there is a big storm coming, her school will cancel classes. Also, if Jenny finishes her project early, she'll get some extra free time. It seems either there will be a storm or she'll finish early, maybe both. If classes get cancelled, Jenny will have a relaxing day at home. And if she has a relaxing day at home, she'll feel mentally recharged.\nQuestion: If Jenny did not get extra free time, then did she feel recharged?\nReasoning steps: Not extra free time implies not finishing early (contrapositive of finish-early \u2192 extra time). Given storm or finish-early, not finishing early implies storm. Storm implies classes canceled, which implies a relaxing day, which implies feeling recharged.\nAnswer: Yes"

The chef at a popular restaurant decided that if he added more salt to the soup, it would enhance the flavor. However, he soon realized that if the soup tasted too salty, customers would send it back to the kitchen. The chef was either adding more salt to the soup as an experiment, or he was experimenting with entirely new recipes, or perhaps both. If the chef was experimenting with new recipes, he ended up using some unusual ingredient combinations. The chef knew that if he used unusual combinations, the restaurant menu would start to have more eclectic offerings.\nQuestion: If customers do not send the soup back to the kitchen, then does the restaurant menu have eclectic offerings?\nReasoning steps: \n1. Let S = customers send back; T = soup too salty; A = adding more salt; R = experimenting with new recipes; U = unusual combinations; E = eclectic offerings.\n2. Premises: T -> S; A \u2228 R; R -> U; U -> E.\n3. From not S, by contrapositive of T -> S, infer not T. This gives no information about R, U, or E.\n4. From A \u2228 R, not S does not force R. We can have A true and R false, making U false and E not entailed.\n5. Countermodel: not S, not T, A true, R false, U false, E false satisfies all premises. Thus not S does not imply E.\nAnswer: no"

If her friend calls, Jessica will likely talk with her for an hour or more. Either Jessica finished her homework, or she didn't talk with her friend for an hour. Jessica realizes that if she relaxes before bed, she'll feel tired when it's time to sleep. And if she feels tired, she'll fall asleep quickly once she's in bed.\nQuestion: If Jessica's friend calls her on the phone, then does Jessica fall asleep quickly when she goes to bed?\nReasoning steps:\n1) If her friend calls, she talks for an hour or more (Call -> Talk\u22651hr).\n2) Either she finished her homework or she didn\u2019t talk for an hour (Finished \u2228 \u00acTalk\u22651hr).\n3) From 1 and 2: if she talks for \u22651hr, then \u00acTalk\u22651hr is false, so Finished must be true (Call -> Finished).\n4) If she finished her homework, she has time to relax before bed; given her routine of relaxing at night, she relaxes before bed (Finished -> Relax).\n5) If she relaxes before bed, she\u2019ll feel tired (Relax -> Tired).\n6) If she feels tired, she\u2019ll fall asleep quickly (Tired -> SleepQuickly).\n7) Therefore, if her friend calls, she falls asleep quickly (Call -> SleepQuickly).\nAnswer: Yes"

The factory manager understood that if more workers were hired, wages would increase. If wages increased, applications to work at the factory would rise.\nQuestion: If the company released a new model phone, then did applications to work at the factory rise?\nReasoning steps:\n1. Assume the company released a new model phone.\n2. Then demand is high (if new model released -> demand high).\n3. High demand rules out low demand; thus \u201cdemand low\u201d is false.\n4. From \u201ceither production increased or demand was low\u201d and not-low-demand, infer production increased (disjunctive syllogism).\n5. Given the chain: production increases -> more workers hired -> wages increase -> applications rise, conclude applications rose.\nAnswer: Yes"
