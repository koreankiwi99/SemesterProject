Either the oven was preheated correctly, or John's family did not bake a cake. Mary knows that if the cake bakes evenly throughout, it will taste delicious. If the cake tastes great, then John will be absolutely thrilled with it.\nQuestion: If it is John's graduation ceremony today, then is John thrilled with the cake?\nReasoning steps: From G (graduation) we get F (family bakes). From (P or not F), F implies P (preheated). Then P -> E -> D -> T, so John is thrilled. Hence G -> T.\nAnswer: Yes"

Therefore, if the company does not increase its market share, it needs to cut costs.\nAnswer: Yes"

If Bob ate a large meal beforehand, he would likely get a stomach ache during the race. Either Alice won the race, or Bob did not get a stomach ache. Alice's coach understood that if she was awarded a trophy, she would want to celebrate her win. Whenever Alice celebrated a victory, she went out for ice cream after.\nQuestion: If Bob ate a big meal before the race, then did Alice go out for ice cream?\nReasoning steps:\n- Let M = Bob ate a big meal; S = Bob got a stomach ache; A = Alice won; T = Alice got a trophy; C = Alice celebrated; I = Alice went for ice cream.\n- Given: A -> T; M -> likely S (not a strict implication to S); A \u2228 \u00acS; T -> wants-to-celebrate; C -> I.\n- The \u201clikely\u201d weakens M -> S; we cannot deduce S from M with certainty.\n- Even if we assume S and thus infer A from A \u2228 \u00acS (by disjunctive syllogism), we get A -> T and then only T -> wants-to-celebrate, not T -> C. Without C, we cannot conclude I.\n- Countermodel: M true, S false, A false, T false, C false, I false. All premises hold (since \u201clikely\u201d allows S to be false; A \u2228 \u00acS is true), but M does not lead to I. Hence the conditional does not logically follow.\nAnswer: No"
