If someone learned voice projection techniques, then they could be heard clearly. And if they could be heard clearly, then they could captivate people's attention.\nQuestion: If Emma cannot engage people better during speeches, then can she captivate people's attention?\nReasoning steps: From \u201cif practiced frequently then engage better,\u201d not engaging implies not practiced. Given \u201ceither practiced or learned voice projection,\u201d not practiced forces \u201clearned voice projection.\u201d Learning voice projection implies being heard clearly, which implies being able to captivate attention. Therefore, yes.\nAnswer: Yes"

So if I have to find an alternate route, my commute will take longer than normal. And if my commute takes longer, I'll arrive late at the office.\nQuestion: If I did not leave home late, did I arrive late at the office?\nReasoning steps: [1) From \u201cIf I sleep through my alarm, I\u2019ll be late leaving home\u201d and \u201cI did not leave home late,\u201d by contraposition, I did not sleep through my alarm. 2) Given \u201cEither there could be construction, or I could sleep through my alarm, or both,\u201d and not sleeping through my alarm, it follows there is construction. 3) Construction implies I must take an alternate route. 4) An alternate route implies a longer commute. 5) A longer commute implies I arrive late at the office. Therefore, I arrive late.]\nAnswer: Yes"

It seems either the movie will release, or the gallery will be open, or maybe both. If someone watches the new action movie, they will have an entertaining time with all the stunts and effects. And if they have an entertaining time, then surely they will be satisfied after watching it.\nQuestion: If James did not go to the art gallery, was he satisfied after watching the movie?\nReasoning steps: The premises guarantee that if someone watches the movie, they will be satisfied, but they do not establish that James watched the movie. James not going to the art gallery does not imply the gallery wasn\u2019t open nor that James watched the movie. Therefore, we cannot conclude he was satisfied.\nAnswer: No"

And if the soil quality improves, the plants grow healthier.\nQuestion: If John's garden does not attract more bees and butterflies, is his soil high quality?\nReasoning steps:\n1) From W -> B and B -> A, infer W -> A.\n2) Given \u00acA, by contrapositive of W -> A, infer \u00acW.\n3) From (W \u2228 F) and \u00acW, infer F.\n4) From F -> S, infer S (soil quality improves/high quality).\nAnswer: Yes"

A company wanted to increase its market share in a competitive industry. The executives realized that if they lowered prices, the company would become more competitive. They knew that if they were more competitive, their market share would likely increase. Either the company was lowering prices as a strategy, or customer demand was decreasing, or both were happening simultaneously. If customer demand was decreasing, it meant customers were becoming more price-sensitive. The executives understood that if customers were highly price-sensitive, the company would need to cut costs to maintain profitability.\nQuestion: If the company does not increase its market share, then does the company need to cut costs?\nReasoning steps: [generate step-by-step reasoning]\nAnswer: Yes/No",

Assume not hearing about jobs: \u00acJ. By contrapositive of N -> J, infer \u00acN.\n3. Given N \u2228 S (she either networks or works on skills) and \u00acN, infer S (she works on skills).\n4. From S -> Q (skills -> qualified) and Q -> A (qualified -> advance), deduce A (advance).\nAnswer: Yes"

He knows if he does this, he'll have a huge harvest this season. If Susan takes a day off, she goes hiking in the mountains to unwind. Either Jim is watering his garden daily, or Susan did not go hiking today. Jim realizes that if he has a bountiful harvest, he can share his fresh organic vegetables. When Jim shares his produce, it brings the community together for a potluck dinner.\nQuestion: If Susan took the day off work, then did the neighborhood have a community potluck?\nReasoning steps: \n- Jim waters daily (given), so he has a huge harvest (modus ponens).\n- From huge harvest, it follows only that he can share, not that he does share.\n- Potluck occurs only if Jim shares; \u201ccan share\u201d does not imply \u201cdoes share.\u201d\n- If Susan takes a day off, she goes hiking; this does not affect whether Jim shares.\n- The disjunction (Jim waters daily or Susan didn\u2019t hike) is satisfied by Jim watering and gives no further implication toward a potluck.\n- Therefore, from \u201cSusan took the day off\u201d we cannot conclude a potluck occurred.\nAnswer: No"
