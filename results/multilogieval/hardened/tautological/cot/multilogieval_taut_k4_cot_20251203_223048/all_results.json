If someone waters the garden regularly, the flowers will bloom brightly. If it rains a lot, then the soil becomes saturated. Either the garden is watered routinely, or the soil did not saturated. If the flowers bloom, they will release fragrance. If there is fragrance, it will attract butterflies.\nQuestion: If there was heavy rain, did the garden attract butterflies?\nReasoning steps: [1. Heavy rain \u21d2 it rains a lot (R).\n2. From R -> S, soil becomes saturated (S).\n3. Given (W or not S) and S, infer W (garden is watered routinely).\n4. From W -> B, flowers bloom (B).\n5. From B -> F, fragrance is released (F).\n6. From F -> A, butterflies are attracted (A).\n7. Therefore, heavy rain implies butterflies are attracted.]\nAnswer: Yes"

Also, if Sam's friend asks him to meet up, Sam gets coffee with him instead. It seems either Sam will have free time or his friend will want to meet up, maybe both. When Sam works out after work, it helps relieve stress from his job. And when Sam relieves stress from work, he gets good endorphins after his gym session.\nQuestion: If Sam did not get coffee with his friend, then did he get good endorphins after a workout?\nReasoning steps:\n- friend_asks -> coffee, so by contrapositive not coffee -> not friend_asks.\n- Given free_time OR friend_asks and not friend_asks, infer free_time.\n- free_time -> workout -> relieves_stress -> good_endorphins.\n- Thus, not coffee implies he worked out and got good endorphins after the workout.\nAnswer: Yes"

Either it's sunny out, or the lifeguards didn't come in today. James knows that if the pool opens, kids will start playing in it right away. And if kids are playing, the lifeguards on duty have to stay alert to watch them carefully.\nQuestion: If the lifeguards are scheduled to work, then do the lifeguards stay alert watching the kids?\nReasoning steps:\n1) It's a beautiful sunny day, and if sunny then the pool opens, so the pool opens.\n2) If the pool opens then kids start playing, so kids are playing.\n3) If kids are playing, lifeguards on duty must stay alert.\n4) If lifeguards are scheduled, they show up for their shift, i.e., they are on duty.\n5) Therefore, if lifeguards are scheduled, they are on duty while kids are playing, so they stay alert.\nAnswer: Yes"
