Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: MT

Context:
When someone practices good hygiene, they are less likely to get sick. Sarah is not less likely to get sick.

Question:
Does Sarah practice good hygiene?

Iterations:
================================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Sarah : Person
axiom GoodHygiene : Person → Prop
axiom LessLikelySick : Person → Prop

-- Premise: When someone practices good hygiene, they are less likely to get sick.
axiom hygiene_implies_less_sick : ∀ x : Person, GoodHygiene x → LessLikelySick x

-- Premise: Sarah is not less likely to get sick.
axiom Sarah_not_less_sick : ¬ LessLikelySick Sarah

-- Conclusion: Sarah does not practice good hygiene (by modus tollens).
theorem Sarah_not_practices_good_hygiene : ¬ GoodHygiene Sarah := by
  intro h
  have hs : LessLikelySick Sarah := hygiene_implies_less_sick Sarah h
  exact Sarah_not_less_sick hs
</lean>

ANSWER: No
