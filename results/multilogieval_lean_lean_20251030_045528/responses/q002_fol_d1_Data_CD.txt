LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Sara : Person

axiom GoesCamping : Person → Prop
axiom GoesToMovies : Person → Prop
axiom AbleToHikeThroughNature : Person → Prop
axiom IsEntertained : Person → Prop

-- If Sara goes camping, she'll be able to hike through nature.
axiom camping_implies_hiking : GoesCamping Sara → AbleToHikeThroughNature Sara
-- If Sara goes to the movies, she'll be entertained.
axiom movies_implies_entertained : GoesToMovies Sara → IsEntertained Sara
-- Sara is choosing between going camping or going to the movies.
axiom choice : GoesCamping Sara ∨ GoesToMovies Sara

theorem entailment : AbleToHikeThroughNature Sara ∨ IsEntertained Sara := by
  cases choice with
  | inl hc => exact Or.inl (camping_implies_hiking hc)
  | inr hm => exact Or.inr (movies_implies_entertained hm)
