Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: DMT

Context:
At a prestigious university, every professor was highly educated and an excellent teacher. Students vied for the opportunity to learn from these paragons of intellect and instruction. Nonetheless, some professors fell short of this lofty reputation.

Question:
Does it entail that there is at least one professor for whom either being highly educated is not true or being an excellent teacher is not true or both?

axiom Professor : Type
axiom HighlyEducated : Professor → Prop
axiom ExcellentTeacher : Professor → Prop

-- From the text:
-- "every professor was highly educated and an excellent teacher."
axiom all_professors_highly_educated_and_excellent :
  ∀ p : Professor, HighlyEducated p ∧ ExcellentTeacher p

-- "Nonetheless, some professors fell short of this lofty reputation."
-- Interpreted as: there exists a professor who is not both highly educated and an excellent teacher.
axiom some_professors_fell_short :
  ∃ p : Professor, ¬ (HighlyEducated p ∧ ExcellentTeacher p)

-- Target: there exists a professor who lacks at least one of the properties.
theorem exists_professor_lacking_one_quality :
  ∃ p : Professor, (¬ HighlyEducated p ∨ ¬ ExcellentTeacher p) := by
  cases some_professors_fell_short with
  | intro p hnot =>
      classical
      by_cases hH : HighlyEducated p
      ·
        have hnotE : ¬ ExcellentTeacher p := by
          intro hE
          exact hnot ⟨hH, hE⟩
        exact ⟨p, Or.inr hnotE⟩
