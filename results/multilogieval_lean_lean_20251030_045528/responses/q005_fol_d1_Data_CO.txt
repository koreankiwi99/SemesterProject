Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: CO

Context:
In a farm, every animal that stays healthy reproduces. Every animal that stays healthy also lives longer.

Question:
Does it entail that if an animal stays healthy on the farm, then it reproduces and lives longer?
