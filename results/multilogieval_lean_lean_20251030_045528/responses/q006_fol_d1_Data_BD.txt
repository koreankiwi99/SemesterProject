Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: BD

Context:
In a community, citizens who volunteer help those in need. Those who donate to charity organizations support important causes. However, citizens have limited time and money to allocate. They can either volunteer or they do not support important causes through donations.

Question:
Does this mean that Luis, a busy working father, either helps those in need by volunteering or does not donate money to charity organizations?

axiom Person : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Citizen : Person → Prop
axiom Volunteer : Person → Prop
axiom Helps : Person → Prop
axiom Donate : Person → Prop
axiom SupportsViaDonations : Person → Prop

-- Domain principles from the text
axiom volunteer_helps : ∀ x : Person, Citizen x → Volunteer x → Helps x
axiom donate_supports : ∀ x : Person, Donate x → SupportsViaDonations x
axiom citizen_choice : ∀ x : Person, Citizen x → (Volunteer x ∨ ¬SupportsViaDonations x)

-- Luis is a member of the community (citizen)
axiom Luis : Person
axiom Luis_citizen : Citizen Luis

-- Conclusion: Luis either helps those in need by volunteering, or he does not donate money
