Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: MT

Context:
If someone has good time management skills, they can often accomplish more in less time. Amy does not accomplish more in less time.

Question:
Does Amy have good time management skills?

Iterations:
================================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Amy : Person
axiom GoodTM : Person → Prop
axiom MoreInLessTime : Person → Prop

-- Premise: If someone has good time management skills, they accomplish more in less time.
axiom premise_imp : ∀ x : Person, GoodTM x → MoreInLessTime x
-- Premise: Amy does not accomplish more in less time.
axiom premise_not_more : ¬ MoreInLessTime Amy

def Theorem : Prop := GoodTM Amy

theorem not_Theorem : ¬ Theorem := by
  unfold Theorem
  intro hgood
  have hmore : MoreInLessTime Amy := premise_imp Amy hgood
  exact premise_not_more hmore
</lean>
ANSWER: No
