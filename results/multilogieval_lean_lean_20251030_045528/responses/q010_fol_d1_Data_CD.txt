Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: CD

Context:
In academics, studying a topic in depth leads to expertise and authority on that subject. On the other hand, learning broadly exposes someone to diverse ideas and perspectives. However, students may opt to either study a single topic in depth or learn broadly across disciplines.

Question:
Does this entail that for Sarah, a dedicated student, either she gains expertise on a single topic or is exposed to diverse perspectives?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Sarah : Person

axiom Student : Person → Prop
axiom Dedicated : Person → Prop

axiom StudyInDepth : Person → Prop
axiom LearnBroad : Person → Prop

axiom Expertise : Person → Prop
axiom DiverseExposure : Person → Prop

-- Studying a topic in depth leads to expertise.
axiom leads_to_expertise : ∀ s : Person, StudyInDepth s → Expertise s
-- Learning broadly exposes someone to diverse ideas and perspectives.
axiom leads_to_diverse : ∀ s : Person, LearnBroad s → DiverseExposure s

-- "May opt" (permission/possibility), not actual choice.
axiom MayStudyInDepth : Person → Prop
axiom MayLearnBroad : Person → Prop
axiom may_opt_either : ∀ s : Person, Student s → (MayStudyInDepth s ∨ MayLearnBroad s)

-- Sarah is a dedicated student.
axiom Sarah_dedicated_student : Student Sarah ∧ Dedicated Sarah

-- What would suffice to entail the desired conclusion (but is NOT given by the text):
theorem entails_if_actual_choice
  (h : StudyInDepth Sarah ∨ LearnBroad Sarah) :
  Expertise Sarah ∨ DiverseExposure Sarah := by
  cases h with
  | inl hID =>
    exact Or.inl (leads_to_expertise Sarah hID)
  | inr hLB =>
    exact Or.inr (leads_to_diverse Sarah hLB)
