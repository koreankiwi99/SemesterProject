Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DD_DS

Context:
If someone takes their car for an oil change, it runs smoothly. Also, if someone washes their car, it looks shiny and clean. However, this month someone either had a car that was not running smoothly or did not look clean, or both.

Question:
Tyler took his car for an oil change. Is it true that he washed his car?
