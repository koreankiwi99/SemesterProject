Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DD_DS

Context:
When people drive safely, they avoid accidents. Also, if people follow directions, they don't get lost. But either someone did not avoid an accident or someone got lost, or both.

Question:
Jane drove safely. Is it true that she followed directions?

Lean Verification:
  Success: False
  Errors:
    - Tactic `cases` failed: major premise type is not an inductive type
  match p with
  | Jane => False
  | Bob => False

Explanation: the `cases` tactic is for constructor-based reasoning as well as for applying custom cases principles with a 'using' clause or a registered '@[cases_eliminator]' theorem. The above type neither is an inductive type nor has a registered theorem.
