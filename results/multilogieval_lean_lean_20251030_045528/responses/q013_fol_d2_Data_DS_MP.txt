Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DS_MP

Context:
In a community garden, if someone plants vegetables early in the season, they harvest a large crop. However, it is not certain if the soil is fertile. People are sure that either the vegetables are planted early, or the soil is fertile, or both.

Question:
Mia's soil was not fertile. Does this mean Mia harvested a large crop?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Mia : Person

axiom Early : Person → Prop
axiom Fertile : Person → Prop
axiom LargeCrop : Person → Prop

-- If someone plants early, they harvest a large crop.
axiom early_implies_large : ∀ p : Person, Early p → LargeCrop p

-- People are sure that either the vegetables are planted early, or the soil is fertile, or both (for Mia).
axiom early_or_fertile_Mia : Early Mia ∨ Fertile Mia

-- Mia's soil was not fertile.
axiom mia_not_fertile : ¬ Fertile Mia

theorem Mia_harvested_large_crop : LargeCrop Mia := by
  have hEarly : Early Mia := by
    cases early_or_fertile_Mia with
    | inl he => exact he
    | inr hf => exact False.elim (mia_not_fertile hf)
  exact early_implies_large Mia hEarly
