Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DS_MP

Context:
In a sailing club, if someone maintains their boat well, they win races. However, it is not certain if the weather conditions are favorable. Either the boat is maintained well, or the weather conditions are favorable, or both.

Question:
Olivia's weather conditions were not favorable. Does this mean Olivia won her race?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Olivia : Person

axiom MaintainsWell : Person → Prop
axiom FavorableWeather : Person → Prop
axiom Wins : Person → Prop

-- If someone maintains their boat well, they win races.
axiom maintain_implies_win : ∀ x : Person, MaintainsWell x → Wins x

-- Either the boat is maintained well, or the weather conditions are favorable (or both).
axiom maintained_or_favorable : ∀ x : Person, MaintainsWell x ∨ FavorableWeather x

-- Olivia's weather conditions were not favorable.
axiom Olivia_not_favorable : ¬ FavorableWeather Olivia

theorem Olivia_won : Wins Olivia := by
  have hdisj : MaintainsWell Olivia ∨ FavorableWeather Olivia := maintained_or_favorable Olivia
  have hmaint : MaintainsWell Olivia := by
    cases hdisj with
    | inl hm => exact hm
    | inr fav => exact False.elim (Olivia_not_favorable fav)
