Context:
Someone wanted to renovate their kitchen. They realized that if they did a complete remodel, they would have a beautiful new kitchen; if they just replaced the countertops and backsplash, they would update the look. They could either do a complete remodel or just replace the countertops and backsplash.

Question:
Given that Ryan did not have a beautiful new kitchen, is it true that Ryan updated the look?
