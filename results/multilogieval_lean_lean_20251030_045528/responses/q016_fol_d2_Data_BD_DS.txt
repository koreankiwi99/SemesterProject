Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: BD_DS

Context:
A chef thought that if they used fresh ingredients, their dishes would taste delicious. And if they followed traditional recipes, diners would appreciate the authentic flavors. However, the chef could either use fresh ingredients or make inauthentic dishes.

Question:
The patron's meal lacked flavor. Did the chef follow traditional recipes?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Fresh : Prop
axiom Delicious : Prop
axiom Authentic : Prop
axiom FollowTraditional : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom fresh_implies_delicious : Fresh → Delicious
axiom follow_implies_authentic : FollowTraditional → Authentic
axiom fresh_or_inauthentic : Fresh ∨ ¬ Authentic
axiom not_delicious : ¬ Delicious  -- "The patron's meal lacked flavor."

-- Conclusion: The chef did not follow traditional recipes.
theorem not_follow_traditional : ¬ FollowTraditional := by
  -- From not_delicious and Fresh → Delicious, derive ¬Fresh
  have not_fresh : ¬ Fresh := by
    intro hf
    exact not_delicious (fresh_implies_delicious hf)
  -- From Fresh ∨ ¬Authentic and ¬Fresh, derive ¬Authentic
  have not_authentic : ¬ Authentic := by
    cases fresh_or_inauthentic with
    | inl hf => exact False.elim (not_fresh hf)
    | inr hna => exact hna
  -- From FollowTraditional → Authentic and ¬Authentic, derive ¬FollowTraditional
  intro hfollow
  exact not_authentic (follow_implies_authentic hfollow)
