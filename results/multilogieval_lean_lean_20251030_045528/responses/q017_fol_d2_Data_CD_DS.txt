Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: CD_DS

Context:
An aspiring musician decided to try writing their own songs. They realized that if they composed original music, their work would be unique; if they promoted their music online, they would gain a following. The musician could write original songs or promote their music online.

Question:
Given that Maria's music was not unique, is it true that she gained a following online?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Maria : Person

axiom Original : Person → Prop
axiom Unique : Person → Prop
axiom Promote : Person → Prop
axiom Following : Person → Prop

axiom original_implies_unique : Original Maria → Unique Maria
axiom promote_implies_following : Promote Maria → Following Maria
axiom original_or_promote : Original Maria ∨ Promote Maria
axiom not_unique : ¬ Unique Maria

theorem maria_gained_following : Following Maria := by
