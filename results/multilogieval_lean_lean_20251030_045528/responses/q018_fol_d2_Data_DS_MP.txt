Context:
In a photography club, if someone uses a professional camera, they take stunning photos. However, it's not certain if the lighting conditions are ideal. People are sure that either the camera is professional, or the lighting is ideal, or both.

Question:
Kiera's lighting conditions were not ideal. Does this mean Kiera took stunning photos?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Kiera : Person

axiom ProfessionalCamera : Person → Prop
axiom IdealLighting : Person → Prop
axiom Stunning : Person → Prop

-- If someone uses a professional camera, they take stunning photos.
axiom cam_implies_stunning : ∀ x : Person, ProfessionalCamera x → Stunning x

-- For every person, either the camera is professional or the lighting is ideal (or both).
axiom cam_or_lighting : ∀ x : Person, ProfessionalCamera x ∨ IdealLighting x

-- Kiera's lighting conditions were not ideal.
axiom kiera_not_ideal : ¬ IdealLighting Kiera

theorem kiera_stunning : Stunning Kiera := by
  have hp : ProfessionalCamera Kiera :=
    Or.elim (cam_or_lighting Kiera)
      (fun p => p)
      (fun l => False.elim (kiera_not_ideal l))
