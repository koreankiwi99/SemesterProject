Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: HS_MT

Context:
A band wanted to gain a larger fanbase. They knew that if they toured extensively, more people would be exposed to their music. Also, if more people heard their songs, ticket sales for their shows would increase.

Question:
If the band does not see an increase in ticket sales, do they tour extensively?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom TourExtensively : Prop
axiom MoreExposure : Prop
axiom TicketSalesIncrease : Prop

axiom tour_to_exposure : TourExtensively → MoreExposure
axiom exposure_to_sales : MoreExposure → TicketSalesIncrease

theorem no_sales_increase_implies_no_tour : ¬TicketSalesIncrease → ¬TourExtensively := by
  intro hNoInc
  intro hTour
  have hExp : MoreExposure := tour_to_exposure hTour
  have hInc : TicketSalesIncrease := exposure_to_sales hExp
  exact hNoInc hInc
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes

Extracted Lean Code:
----------------------------------------
axiom TourExtensively : Prop
axiom MoreExposure : Prop
axiom TicketSalesIncrease : Prop

axiom tour_to_exposure : TourExtensively → MoreExposure
axiom exposure_to_sales : MoreExposure → TicketSalesIncrease

theorem no_sales_increase_implies_no_tour : ¬TicketSalesIncrease → ¬TourExtensively := by
  intro hNoInc
  intro hTour
  have hExp : MoreExposure := tour_to_exposure hTour
  have hInc : TicketSalesIncrease := exposure_to_sales hExp
  exact hNoInc hInc
