Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: BD_DS

Context:
A student hoped to excel in class. They believed that if they took good notes, they would understand the material well, and if they did all the homework, they would get high marks. However, the student can either take good notes or not get high marks.

Question:
James didn't understand the material well. Is it true that James took good notes?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person

axiom GoodNotes : Person → Prop
axiom Understands : Person → Prop
axiom DidHomework : Person → Prop
axiom HighMarks : Person → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom notes_implies_understands : ∀ x : Person, GoodNotes x → Understands x
axiom homework_implies_highmarks : ∀ x : Person, DidHomework x → HighMarks x
axiom notes_or_not_highmarks : ∀ x : Person, GoodNotes x ∨ ¬ HighMarks x
axiom james_not_understands : ¬ Understands James

-- From "if good notes then understand" and "James didn't understand", we get "James did not take good notes"
theorem james_not_goodnotes : ¬ GoodNotes James := by
  exact mt (notes_implies_understands James) james_not_understands
