Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS

Context:
If the sun is out, the pool gets crowded. If the pool gets crowded, there's a long wait for the waterslides. If it's payday, people go shopping. Today, either the sun was out, or it was payday, or both happened.

Question:
There was no long wait for the waterslides today. Did people go shopping?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom SunOut : Prop
axiom PoolCrowded : Prop
axiom LongWait : Prop
axiom Payday : Prop
axiom Shopping : Prop

axiom sun_imp_crowded : SunOut → PoolCrowded
axiom crowded_imp_wait : PoolCrowded → LongWait
axiom payday_imp_shopping : Payday → Shopping
axiom sun_or_payday : SunOut ∨ Payday
axiom no_long_wait : ¬ LongWait

theorem shopping_today : Shopping := by
  have not_crowded : ¬ PoolCrowded := by
    intro c
    exact no_long_wait (crowded_imp_wait c)
  have not_sun : ¬ SunOut := by
    intro s
    exact not_crowded (sun_imp_crowded s)
  have p : Payday := Or.resolve_left sun_or_payday not_sun
  exact payday_imp_shopping p
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes

Extracted Lean Code:
----------------------------------------
axiom SunOut : Prop
axiom PoolCrowded : Prop
axiom LongWait : Prop
axiom Payday : Prop
axiom Shopping : Prop

axiom sun_imp_crowded : SunOut → PoolCrowded
axiom crowded_imp_wait : PoolCrowded → LongWait
axiom payday_imp_shopping : Payday → Shopping
axiom sun_or_payday : SunOut ∨ Payday
axiom no_long_wait : ¬ LongWait

theorem shopping_today : Shopping := by
  have not_crowded : ¬ PoolCrowded := by
    intro c
    exact no_long_wait (crowded_imp_wait c)
  have not_sun : ¬ SunOut := by
    intro s
