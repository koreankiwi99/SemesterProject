Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS

Context:
In a city, residents know that if it rains, the grass gets wet. If there is a festival, then the streets get crowded. Either it rained today, or the streets were not crowded.

Question:
There was a festival in town today. Is the grass wet?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Rain : Prop
axiom WetGrass : Prop
axiom Festival : Prop
axiom Crowded : Prop

axiom premise1 : Rain → WetGrass
axiom premise2 : Festival → Crowded
axiom premise3 : Rain ∨ ¬ Crowded
axiom premise4 : Festival

theorem grass_is_wet : WetGrass := by
  have hc : Crowded := premise2 premise4
  cases premise3 with
  | inl r =>
      exact premise1 r
  | inr notC =>
      have f : False := notC hc
      exact False.elim f
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes

Extracted Lean Code:
----------------------------------------
axiom Rain : Prop
axiom WetGrass : Prop
axiom Festival : Prop
axiom Crowded : Prop

axiom premise1 : Rain → WetGrass
axiom premise2 : Festival → Crowded
axiom premise3 : Rain ∨ ¬ Crowded
axiom premise4 : Festival

theorem grass_is_wet : WetGrass := by
  have hc : Crowded := premise2 premise4
  cases premise3 with
  | inl r =>
      exact premise1 r
  | inr notC =>
      have f : False := notC hc
