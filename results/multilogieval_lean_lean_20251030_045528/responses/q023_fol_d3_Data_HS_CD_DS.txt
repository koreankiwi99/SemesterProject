Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS

Context:
If it is cloudy, then it might rain later. If it rains, the grass gets wet. If the grass is wet, kids can jump in puddles. Either it was cloudy today, or kids were jumping in puddles, or both things happened.

Question:
There was no wet grass today. Were kids jumping in puddles?
