Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: DD_DS_MT

Context:
In a small town, the mayor wanted citizens to live healthy and active lifestyles. They knew that if people exercised regularly, they would be fit, and if they ate nutritious foods, they would have energy. But not everyone in town was active or energetic. The mayor concluded that some citizens must not exercise or must not eat well. The mayor understood that if someone valued wellness, they would exercise regularly.

Question:
Jane eats very nutritious foods. From the context, is it true that Jane values wellness?
