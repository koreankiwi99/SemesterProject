Context:
A young man was looking to adopt a pet. He learned that if you adopt an animal, you have to commit to taking care of it. He knew that if you properly care for a pet, it will be happy and healthy.

axiom Kevin : Person

axiom Adopts : Person → Animal → Prop

axiom Happy : Animal → Prop
axiom Healthy : Animal → Prop

-- If you adopt an animal, you take proper care of it.
axiom adopt_implies_care : ∀ (p : Person) (a : Animal), Adopts p a → CaresProperly p a
-- If you properly care for a pet, it will be happy and healthy.
axiom care_implies_happy_healthy : ∀ (p : Person) (a : Animal), CaresProperly p a → Happy a ∧ Healthy a

-- Kevin adopts a pet.
axiom kevin_adopts_some_pet : ∃ a : Animal, Adopts Kevin a

-- Therefore, Kevin's pet will be happy and healthy.
theorem kevin_pet_happy_and_healthy : ∃ a : Animal, Happy a ∧ Healthy a := by
  match kevin_adopts_some_pet with
  | ⟨a, hAdopt⟩ =>
    have hCare : CaresProperly Kevin a := adopt_implies_care Kevin a hAdopt
    have hHH : Happy a ∧ Healthy a := care_implies_happy_healthy Kevin a hCare
