Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS

Context:
If the electricity goes out, the house becomes very dark. If it is dark inside, people will turn on flashlights to see. If the internet also goes down, electronics will not work. Either there was a power outage today, or the internet went down, or both things occurred.

Question:
The house did not become dark. Were the electronics not working?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom PowerOutage : Prop
axiom Dark : Prop
axiom InternetDown : Prop
axiom ElectronicsNotWorking : Prop
axiom FlashlightsOn : Prop

axiom h1 : PowerOutage → Dark
axiom h2 : Dark → FlashlightsOn
axiom h3 : InternetDown → ElectronicsNotWorking
axiom h4 : PowerOutage ∨ InternetDown
axiom h5 : ¬ Dark

theorem electronics_not_working : ElectronicsNotWorking := by
  have hNotE : ¬ PowerOutage := by
    intro hE
    have hD : Dark := h1 hE
    exact h5 hD
  have hI : InternetDown := by
    cases h4 with
    | inl hE => exact False.elim (hNotE hE)
    | inr hI => exact hI
  exact h3 hI
</lean>
