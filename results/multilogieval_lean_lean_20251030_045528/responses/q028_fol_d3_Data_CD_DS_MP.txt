Logic Type: fol
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: CD_DS_MP

Context:
In a small village, someone was deciding what to plant in their garden. They knew that if they plant vegetables, they will have a bountiful harvest. Also, if they plant flowers, their garden will look beautiful. But someone will either plant vegetables or flowers this season. If a garden looks beautiful, it will be featured in a magazine.

Question:
Given that the garden did not have a bountiful harvest, will it be featured in a magazine?
