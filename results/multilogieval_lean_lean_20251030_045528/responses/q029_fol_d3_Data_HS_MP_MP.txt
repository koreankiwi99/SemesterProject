Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_MP_MP

Context:
One day, someone decided to start exercising regularly. They believed that if someone exercises regularly, they will gain more energy. If someone gains energy, they have improved moods.

Question:
Did James become much happier after he started exercising regularly?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person

axiom ExercisesRegularly : Person → Prop
axiom GainsEnergy : Person → Prop
axiom ImprovedMoods : Person → Prop

-- Premises from the text (treating the belief as a rule)
axiom james_exercises : ExercisesRegularly James
axiom exercise_implies_energy : ∀ x : Person, ExercisesRegularly x → GainsEnergy x
axiom energy_implies_improved_moods : ∀ x : Person, GainsEnergy x → ImprovedMoods x

-- Conclusion: James became (much) happier (modeled as having improved moods)
theorem james_much_happier : ImprovedMoods James := by
  have hEnergy : GainsEnergy James := exercise_implies_energy James james_exercises
  exact energy_implies_improved_moods James hEnergy
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
