--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Fresh : Prop
axiom Delicious : Prop
axiom Complicated : Prop
axiom MoreTime : Prop

-- If the chef uses fresh ingredients, the food will taste delicious.
axiom hFreshImpDelicious : Fresh → Delicious

-- If the chef cooked a complicated recipe, it takes more time to prepare.
axiom hComplicatedImpMoreTime : Complicated → MoreTime

-- Either the chef used fresh ingredients. Interpreted as: the chef did use fresh ingredients.
axiom hFresh : Fresh

-- If the chef cooked a complicated recipe, did the food taste delicious?
theorem goal : Complicated → Delicious := by
  intro _hc
  exact hFreshImpDelicious hFresh
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
