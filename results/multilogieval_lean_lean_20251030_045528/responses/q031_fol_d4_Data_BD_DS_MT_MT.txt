Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_DS_MT_MT

Context:
Someone was making dinner plans. They knew that if it was close to dinnertime, then they should start cooking. They also needed to go grocery shopping. If they go shopping, then they can make dinner. Either it is close to dinnertime, or they won't make dinner. If the fridge is empty, then they must go shopping. If there are no ingredients in the pantry, then the fridge is empty.

Question:
If Sam does start cooking, is the pantry empty?

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Sam : Person

-- Propositions and predicates
axiom Close : Prop
axiom StartCooking : Person → Prop
axiom GoShopping : Person → Prop
axiom MakeDinner : Person → Prop
axiom FridgeEmpty : Prop
axiom PantryEmpty : Prop

-- Premises translated from the text
axiom p1 : Close → StartCooking Sam
axiom p2 : GoShopping Sam → MakeDinner Sam
axiom p3 : Close ∨ ¬ MakeDinner Sam
axiom p4 : FridgeEmpty → GoShopping Sam
axiom p5 : PantryEmpty → FridgeEmpty

-- We consider the scenario "Sam does start cooking"
axiom a_start : StartCooking Sam
-- We show that the pantry need not be empty by assuming it is not empty
axiom a_notPantry : ¬ PantryEmpty

-- Therefore, the implication "If Sam starts cooking, then the pantry is empty" is not valid in general
theorem not_implies_pantry_empty : ¬ (StartCooking Sam → PantryEmpty) := by
  intro h
  have hPantry : PantryEmpty := h a_start
  exact a_notPantry hPantry
