Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: I_MT_DMT_DS

Context:
For students, teachers often say that if someone studies consistently throughout the semester, then if they are well-prepared before the exam, they will get good grades.

Question:
Emma was well-prepared before the exam. Emma did not get good grades. Did Emma study consistently throughout the semester?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Emma : Person

axiom StudiesConsistently : Person → Prop
axiom WellPrepared : Person → Prop
axiom GoodGrades : Person → Prop

-- Teachers' statement: if someone studies consistently, then if they are well-prepared, they get good grades.
axiom teachers_say : ∀ x : Person, StudiesConsistently x → (WellPrepared x → GoodGrades x)

-- Facts about Emma
axiom emma_well_prepared : WellPrepared Emma
axiom emma_not_good_grades : ¬ GoodGrades Emma

-- From the premises, Emma did not study consistently.
theorem emma_not_studies_consistently : ¬ StudiesConsistently Emma := by
  intro h_sc
  have h_wp_imp_gg : WellPrepared Emma → GoodGrades Emma := teachers_say Emma h_sc
  have h_gg : GoodGrades Emma := h_wp_imp_gg emma_well_prepared
  exact emma_not_good_grades h_gg
