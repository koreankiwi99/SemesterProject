Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP

Context:
If the pilot checks the plane thoroughly, it will fly safely. If there is heavy fog, all flights get delayed. Either she inspected the plane well, or there were no delays, or the plane was checked but flights left on time. If the flight is safe, the passengers will be grateful.

Question:
There was heavy fog today, does it entail that the passengers were grateful?
