Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP

Context:
If a student studies hard, they will earn high marks on the test. If the teacher makes the test very difficult, many students will fail. Either the student studies hard, or the test will not be too hard, or the student studies hard and the test will not be too difficult. It's expected that if someone earns high marks, they will be satisfied with their performance.

Question:
The teacher made the test very difficult, will the student be satisfied with their performance?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom SH : Prop        -- The student studies hard
axiom HM : Prop        -- The student earns high marks
axiom D  : Prop        -- The test is very difficult
axiom Sat : Prop       -- The student is satisfied
axiom MF : Prop        -- Many students fail

-- If a student studies hard, they will earn high marks.
axiom h1 : SH → HM

-- If the teacher makes the test very difficult, many students will fail.
axiom h2 : D → MF

-- Either the student studies hard, or the test is not too hard, or the student studies hard and the test is not too difficult.
-- We model "not too hard/difficult" as ¬D.
axiom h3 : SH ∨ ¬D ∨ (SH ∧ ¬D)

-- If someone earns high marks, they will be satisfied.
axiom h4 : HM → Sat

-- The teacher made the test very difficult.
axiom d_given : D

theorem student_satisfied : Sat := by
  -- From h3 and D, we can conclude the student studies hard.
  have hSH : SH := by
    cases h3 with
    | inl hSH => exact hSH
    | inr h =>
      cases h with
      | inl hNotD =>
          exact False.elim (hNotD d_given)
      | inr hPair =>
          exact False.elim (hPair.right d_given)
  -- Then high marks and thus satisfaction follow.
  exact h4 (h1 hSH)
