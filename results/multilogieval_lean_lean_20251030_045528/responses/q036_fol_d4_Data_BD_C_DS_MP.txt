Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP

Context:
If someone learns a new language, they will open up new cultural experiences. If someone travels to a country where that language is spoken, then they will communicate more effectively with locals. Either someone learns a new language, or they do not communicate more effectively with locals, or someone learned a new language, and they did not communicate more effectively with locals. If someone opens up new cultural experiences, then they become more culturally aware.

Question:
Taylor travels to a country where the new language is spoken, can we say that she becomes more culturally aware?

Lean Verification:
  Success: False
  Errors:
    - Tactic `cases` failed: major premise type is not an inductive type
  Learn Taylor

Explanation: the `cases` tactic is for constructor-based reasoning as well as for applying custom cases principles with a 'using' clause or a registered '@[cases_eliminator]' theorem. The above type neither is an inductive type nor has a registered theorem.
