Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: I_MT_DMT_DS

Context:
For athletes, coaches often say that if someone trains with dedication, then if they get adequate rest, they will perform at their peak on game day.

Question:
Simone got plenty of rest before the big match. She did not play her best during the game. Did Simone train with dedication?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Simone : Person

axiom TrainsWithDedication : Person → Prop
axiom Rested : Person → Prop
axiom PeakOnGameDay : Person → Prop

axiom coaches_claim : ∀ x : Person, TrainsWithDedication x → (Rested x → PeakOnGameDay x)
axiom rest_Simone : Rested Simone
axiom not_peak_Simone : ¬ PeakOnGameDay Simone

theorem not_trained_Simone : ¬ TrainsWithDedication Simone := by
  intro htrain
  have hImp : Rested Simone → PeakOnGameDay Simone := coaches_claim Simone htrain
  have hPeak : PeakOnGameDay Simone := hImp rest_Simone
  exact not_peak_Simone hPeak
</lean>
ANSWER: No

Extracted Lean Code:
