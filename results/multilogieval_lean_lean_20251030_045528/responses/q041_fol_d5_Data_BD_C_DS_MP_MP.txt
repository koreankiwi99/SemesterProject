Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the team practices hard, they will be prepared for the big game. If the star player is injured, he cannot play in the game. Either the team practiced hard, or the star player is not injured. When the team is well-prepared, the team wins the important game. If the team wins the important game, they will celebrate with a team dinner afterwards.

Question:
If the star player is injured, will the team celebrate with a team dinner after the big game?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom PracticedHard : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop
axiom Injured : Prop
axiom Plays : Prop
axiom Wins : Prop
axiom Dinner : Prop

axiom h1 : PracticedHard → Prepared
axiom h2 : Injured → ¬ Plays
axiom h3 : PracticedHard ∨ ¬ Injured
axiom h4 : Prepared → Wins
axiom h5 : Wins → Dinner

theorem goal : Injured → Dinner := by
  intro i
  cases h3 with
  | inl hp =>
      have prep : Prepared := h1 hp
      have win : Wins := h4 prep
      exact h5 win
  | inr notI =>
      have f : False := notI i
      exact False.elim f
</lean>
