Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
A musician wanted to compose an album. They realized that if they practiced new melodies daily, they would expand their repertoire. If they had more material, they could produce enough songs for an album. So if they practiced new melodies daily, they could compose an album. Either the musician practiced new melodies, or they jammed with friends, or they did both. If someone jammed with friends, they gained inspiration from collaboration. And if they felt inspired, their creativity flourished.

Question:
If Sarah did not release an album this year, did her creativity flourish?

axiom Person : Type
axiom Sarah : Person

axiom Practiced : Person → Prop
axiom Jammed : Person → Prop
axiom Inspired : Person → Prop
axiom Flourished : Person → Prop
axiom ReleasedAlbumThisYear : Person → Prop

-- From the text: "So if they practiced new melodies daily, they could compose an album."
-- We align "compose/release an album this year" as ReleasedAlbumThisYear.
axiom practice_implies_release : ∀ x : Person, Practiced x → ReleasedAlbumThisYear x

-- "If someone jammed with friends, they gained inspiration from collaboration."
axiom jam_implies_inspired : ∀ x : Person, Jammed x → Inspired x

-- "And if they felt inspired, their creativity flourished."
axiom inspired_implies_flourish : ∀ x : Person, Inspired x → Flourished x

-- "Either the musician practiced new melodies, or they jammed with friends, or they did both."
-- We specialize this to Sarah.
axiom sarah_practice_or_jam : Practiced Sarah ∨ Jammed Sarah

-- Goal: If Sarah did not release an album this year, did her creativity flourish?
