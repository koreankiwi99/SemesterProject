Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Someone wanted to become fluent in French. They realized that if they practiced speaking regularly, their vocabulary would improve. With more vocabulary, they found reading became easier over time. Therefore, if they practiced speaking, reading French became easier. Either they practiced speaking, or they watched French films, or they did both. If someone watches French films, it means they enjoy hearing the language. And if they enjoy hearing French, they listen to French music and podcasts too.

Question:
If Amy does not find reading French easier, does she listen to French music and podcasts?
