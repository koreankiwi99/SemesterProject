Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the crops get enough sunlight, they will grow strong. If it is windy, trees might fall over. Either the plants got good sunlight, or no trees fell. If the crops grow strong, the harvest will be plentiful. When there is a big harvest, the farmer makes a good profit.

Question:
If it was very windy this season, did the farmer make a good profit from the harvest?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Sunlight : Prop
axiom Windy : Prop
axiom TreesFell : Prop
axiom CropsStrong : Prop
axiom PlentifulHarvest : Prop
axiom GoodProfit : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom p1 : Sunlight → CropsStrong
axiom p2 : Windy → TreesFell
axiom p3 : Sunlight ∨ ¬ TreesFell
axiom p4 : CropsStrong → PlentifulHarvest
axiom p5 : PlentifulHarvest → GoodProfit

-- Goal: If it was very windy, the farmer made a good profit.
theorem windy_implies_profit : Windy → GoodProfit := by
  intro w
  have tf : TreesFell := p2 w
  have nn : ¬¬ TreesFell := by
    intro ntf
    exact ntf tf
  have s : Sunlight := by
    cases p3 with
    | inl s => exact s
    | inr nntf => exact False.elim (nn nntf)
  have cs : CropsStrong := p1 s
  have ph : PlentifulHarvest := p4 cs
  exact p5 ph
