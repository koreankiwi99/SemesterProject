Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
In the neighborhood, if someone hosts a party, their house gets very noisy. Also, if someone is practicing drums, the noise levels go up. Either there is a party, or someone is playing drums, or maybe both. So, if the house gets noisy from a party, neighbors start complaining. And if neighbors complain, the police are called to intervene.

Question:
If there was no noise level up, were the police called to intervene?

-- If someone hosts a party, the house gets very noisy.
axiom party_implies_noisy : Party → Noisy
-- If someone is practicing drums, the noise levels go up.
axiom drums_implies_noisy : Drums → Noisy
-- Either there is a party, or someone is playing drums, or both.
axiom party_or_drums : Party ∨ Drums
-- If the house gets noisy from a party, neighbors start complaining.
axiom party_implies_complain : Party → Complain
-- If neighbors complain, the police are called to intervene.
axiom complain_implies_police : Complain → Police

-- If there was no noise level up, were the police called to intervene?
theorem police_called_if_no_noise : ¬ Noisy → Police := by
  intro hNoisy
  -- From Party ∨ Drums and each implying Noisy, ¬Noisy leads to a contradiction.
  have hFalse : False :=
    Or.elim party_or_drums
      (fun hp => hNoisy (party_implies_noisy hp))
      (fun hd => hNoisy (drums_implies_noisy hd))
