Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If someone studies hard for an exam, they will feel confident going into the test. If there is severe weather in the forecast, schools may cancel class that day. Either Alex studied diligently for his biology exam, or class was not canceled due to the weather. If a student feels confident about the material, they will likely do well on the exam. If a student performs well on an exam, they will be satisfied with their hard work.

Question:
If there was severe weather in the forecast, did Alex feel satisfied with his performance on the history exam?
