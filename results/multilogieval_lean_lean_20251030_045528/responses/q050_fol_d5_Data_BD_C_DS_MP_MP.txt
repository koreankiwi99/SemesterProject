Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
If the oven temperature is set to 350 degrees, the cake will bake properly. If the cake batter contains eggs, it will be fluffy when baked. Either Sam set the oven temperature correctly, or the cake batter did not contain eggs. If a cake bakes properly, it will taste delicious. If a cake tastes delicious, guests at the party will be happy.

Question:
If the cake batter contained eggs, will the guests at the party be happy?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Oven350 : Prop
axiom BakeProperly : Prop
axiom BatterEggs : Prop
axiom Fluffy : Prop
axiom Delicious : Prop
axiom GuestsHappy : Prop

axiom p1 : Oven350 → BakeProperly
axiom p2 : BatterEggs → Fluffy
axiom p3 : Oven350 ∨ ¬ BatterEggs
axiom p4 : BakeProperly → Delicious
axiom p5 : Delicious → GuestsHappy

theorem goal : BatterEggs → GuestsHappy := by
  intro hEggs
  have hOven : Oven350 := by
    cases p3 with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr hnotEggs => exact False.elim (hnotEggs hEggs)
  have hProper : BakeProperly := p1 hOven
  have hDel : Delicious := p4 hProper
  exact p5 hDel
</lean>
