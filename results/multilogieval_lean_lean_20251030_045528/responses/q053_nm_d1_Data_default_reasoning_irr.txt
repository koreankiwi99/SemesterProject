Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: default_reasoning_irr

Context:
John and Sarah both entered the bake-off contest. Bake-off contestants normally make pies. John did not make a pie. Sarah made cookies.

Question:
Can we conclude Sarah made a pie?
