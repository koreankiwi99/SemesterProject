Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: default_reasoning_irr

Context:
Atlanta and Boston are cities. Typically, large cities have an international airport. Atlanta does not have an international airport. Boston has a population over 500,000 people.

Question:
Can we conclude Boston has an international airport?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom City : Type
axiom Atlanta : City
axiom Boston : City

axiom Large : City → Prop
axiom IntlAirport : City → Prop
axiom PopOver500k : City → Prop

-- Premises:
-- 1) Typically, large cities have an international airport
--    We formalize "typically" as a universal implication here.
axiom large_has_airport : ∀ c : City, Large c → IntlAirport c
-- 2) Atlanta does not have an international airport
axiom atl_no_airport : ¬ IntlAirport Atlanta
-- 3) Boston has a population over 500,000
axiom boston_over500k : PopOver500k Boston
-- 4) Population over 500,000 implies the city is large
axiom over500k_implies_large : ∀ c : City, PopOver500k c → Large c

theorem Boston_has_international_airport : IntlAirport Boston := by
  have hLarge : Large Boston := over500k_implies_large Boston boston_over500k
  exact large_has_airport Boston hLarge
