Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: reasoning_about_exceptions_1

Context:
Julia, Emma, and Lucas are graduate students in the biology department and have published research papers. Generally, students who have published are considered for scholarships. At least one of Julia or Emma has not been considered for a scholarship.

Question:
Can we conclude Lucas has been considered for a scholarship and exactly one of Julia or Emma has not been considered?

-- Premise: At least one of Julia or Emma has not been considered
