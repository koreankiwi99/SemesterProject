Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: reasoning_about_priority

Context:
Astronomer Alice asserts that the planet Zorotar orbits its star every 20 years. Cosmologist Bob asserts that the planet Zorotar does not orbit its star every 20 years. Normally, when scientists assert something about planetary orbits, they are right.

Question:
Can we conclude that if Cosmologist Bob's evidence is more reliable than Astronomer Alice's, then the planet Zorotar does not orbit its star every 20 years?
