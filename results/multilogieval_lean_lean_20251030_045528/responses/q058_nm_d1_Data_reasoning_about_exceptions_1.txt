Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: reasoning_about_exceptions_1

Context:
The Blue Galaxy, Red Nebula, and Green Comet are celestial objects discovered last year and exhibit unusual electromagnetic signals. Typically, celestial objects with such signals are studied further by the space agency. At least one of Blue Galaxy or Red Nebula is not being studied further.

Question:
Can we conclude Green Comet is being studied further and exactly one of Blue Galaxy or Red Nebula is not being studied?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Celestial : Type
axiom BlueGalaxy : Celestial
axiom RedNebula : Celestial
axiom GreenComet : Celestial

axiom UnusualSignal : Celestial → Prop
axiom Studied : Celestial → Prop

-- All three exhibit unusual electromagnetic signals
axiom unusual_BG : UnusualSignal BlueGalaxy
axiom unusual_RN : UnusualSignal RedNebula
axiom unusual_GC : UnusualSignal GreenComet

-- Typically: objects with such signals are studied (formalized as an implication)
axiom typical : ∀ x : Celestial, UnusualSignal x → Studied x

-- At least one of Blue Galaxy or Red Nebula is not being studied further
axiom at_least_one_not : ¬ Studied BlueGalaxy ∨ ¬ Studied RedNebula

-- Conclusion: Green Comet is being studied and exactly one of Blue Galaxy or Red Nebula is not being studied
theorem goal :
  Studied GreenComet ∧
    ((¬ Studied BlueGalaxy ∧ Studied RedNebula) ∨ (Studied BlueGalaxy ∧ ¬ Studied RedNebula)) := by
  have sB : Studied BlueGalaxy := typical BlueGalaxy unusual_BG
  have sR : Studied RedNebula := typical RedNebula unusual_RN
  have hfalse : False := by
    cases at_least_one_not with
    | inl hnb => exact hnb sB
    | inr hnr => exact hnr sR
