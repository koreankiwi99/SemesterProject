Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: default_reasoning_default

Context:
John and Mary are students in the same class. Typically, students in that class submit assignments online. However, John prefers to submit assignments on paper.

Question:
Can we conclude that Mary submits assignments online?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom John : Person
axiom Mary : Person

axiom Student : Person → Prop
axiom InClassC : Person → Prop
axiom SubmitsOnline : Person → Prop
axiom PrefersPaper : Person → Prop

-- Premises: John and Mary are students in the same class
axiom studentJohn : Student John
axiom studentMary : Student Mary
axiom inClassJohn : InClassC John
axiom inClassMary : InClassC Mary

-- Typically: all students in that class submit online, except John
axiom typical_online_except_john :
  ∀ x : Person, Student x → InClassC x → x ≠ John → SubmitsOnline x

-- John prefers to submit on paper
axiom john_prefers_paper : PrefersPaper John

-- Distinctness
axiom mary_ne_john : Mary ≠ John

theorem Mary_submits_online : SubmitsOnline Mary := by
  apply typical_online_except_john Mary
  · exact studentMary
  · exact inClassMary
  · exact mary_ne_john
</lean>
