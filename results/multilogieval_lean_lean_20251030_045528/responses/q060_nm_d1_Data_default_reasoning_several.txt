Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: default_reasoning_several

Context:
In software development, programmers who are skilled in algorithm design usually can solve complex problems. They also often contribute to open source projects. Dev1 cannot solve complex problems, while Dev2 does not contribute to open source.

Question:
Can we conclude that Dev2 can solve complex problems and Dev1 contributes to open source?
