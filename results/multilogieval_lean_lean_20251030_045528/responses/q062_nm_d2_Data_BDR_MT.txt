Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: BDR_MT

Context:
Emma and Jacob are students in the same class. Usually students in that class submit homework assignments. Emma did not submit the last homework. If Jacob missed over 3 classes, that means he likely did not submit the homework.

Question:
Can we conclude Jacob missed over 3 classes?

LLM Response:
<lean>
inductive Person where
  | Emma
  | Jacob

open Person

-- Predicates
def InSameClass : Person → Prop := fun _ => True
def Submitted : Person → Prop
  | Emma => False   -- Emma did not submit the last homework
  | Jacob => True   -- Jacob did submit (a consistent scenario)
def MissedOver3Classes : Person → Prop
  | Emma => False
  | Jacob => False  -- Jacob did not miss over 3 classes in this consistent scenario

-- Premises formalized
theorem emma_not_submitted : ¬ Submitted Emma := by
  intro h
  exact h

-- If Jacob missed over 3 classes, he likely did not submit (modeled as an implication)
theorem jacob_missed_implies_not_submitted : MissedOver3Classes Jacob → ¬ Submitted Jacob := by
  intro hMissed
  intro hSub
  exact False.elim hMissed

-- We show the negation of the target claim holds in this consistent model,
-- hence it cannot be concluded from the premises.
