Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: PBD_MT

Context:
The teacher said Alex got 90% on the test. The principal said Alex did not get 90% on the test. Normally people tell the truth about grades. The teacher has better information than the principal. If there was a grading error, Alex could not have actually gotten 90%.

Question:
Can we conclude there was a grading error?

Iterations:

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom G : Prop            -- Alex actually got 90%
axiom E : Prop            -- There was a grading error

-- Reports
axiom teacher_reports_G : Prop               -- Teacher said Alex got 90%
axiom principal_reports_notG : Prop          -- Principal said Alex did not get 90%
axiom better_info : Prop                     -- Teacher has better information

-- Facts from the story
axiom fact_teacher_reports : teacher_reports_G
axiom fact_principal_reports : principal_reports_notG
axiom fact_better_info : better_info

-- Conflict resolution: when they conflict and the teacher has better info, trust the teacher
axiom conflict_resolution : better_info → teacher_reports_G → principal_reports_notG → G

-- If there was a grading error, Alex could not have actually gotten 90%
axiom grading_error_implies_notG : E → ¬ G

-- Conclusion: there was no grading error
theorem no_grading_error : ¬ E := by
  intro hE
  have hnotG : ¬ G := grading_error_implies_notG hE
  have hG : G := conflict_resolution fact_better_info fact_teacher_reports fact_principal_reports
  exact hnotG hG
</lean>
ANSWER: No
