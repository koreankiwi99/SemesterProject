Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: REII_MP

Context:
Jane rented a Toyota Camry. Most Toyota Camrys have alloy wheels. However, some Toyota Camrys have hubcaps instead of alloy wheels. If a Toyota Camry has alloy wheels, then it also has power windows.

Question:
Can we conclude Jane's Camry has power windows?
