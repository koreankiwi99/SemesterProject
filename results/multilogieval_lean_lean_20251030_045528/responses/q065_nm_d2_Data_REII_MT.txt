Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: REII_MT

Context:
Mike adopted a dog from an animal shelter. Usually, dogs from shelters have been vaccinated. However, some owner-surrendered dogs may not have complete vaccination records. If a dog is too young, it will not have all its vaccinations yet.

Question:
Can we conclude Mike's dog is too young to be fully vaccinated?

LLM Response:

axiom Dog : Type
axiom mike_dog : Dog

-- Predicates
axiom FromShelter : Dog → Prop
axiom FullyVaccinated : Dog → Prop
axiom TooYoung : Dog → Prop

-- Premises from the text (formalized)
-- Mike adopted a dog from a shelter.
axiom mike_from_shelter : FromShelter mike_dog
-- Usually, dogs from shelters have been vaccinated (we model this as fully vaccinated).
axiom shelter_dogs_fully_vaccinated : ∀ d : Dog, FromShelter d → FullyVaccinated d
-- If a dog is too young, it will not have all its vaccinations yet.
axiom too_young_implies_not_fully : ∀ d : Dog, TooYoung d → ¬ FullyVaccinated d

-- Question: Can we conclude Mike's dog is too young to be fully vaccinated?
-- We prove the negation: Mike's dog is not too young (under these premises).
