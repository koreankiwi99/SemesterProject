Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: PBD_MP

Context:
The coach said the player scored 30 points in the game. The referee said the player did not score 30 points. Officials are normally correct. The coach has better information than the referee. If the player scored 30 points, he likely had an exceptional game.

Question:
Can we conclude the player had an exceptional game?

axiom Player : Type
axiom player : Player

axiom Scored30 : Player → Prop
axiom ExceptionalGame : Player → Prop

-- Statements reported
axiom CoachSaid_Scored30 : Prop
axiom RefereeSaid_NotScored30 : Prop

-- Background, non-deductive information
axiom OfficialsNormallyCorrect : Prop
axiom CoachHasBetterInfoThanReferee : Prop

-- Causal/implicational premise
axiom exceptional_if_scored30 : Scored30 player → ExceptionalGame player

-- Target: Can we conclude the player had an exceptional game?
-- From the given premises, we cannot derive Scored30 player,
-- so we cannot derive ExceptionalGame player.
theorem conclude_exceptional : ExceptionalGame player := by
