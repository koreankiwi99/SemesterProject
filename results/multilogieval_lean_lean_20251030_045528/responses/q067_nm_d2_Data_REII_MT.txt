Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: REII_MT

Context:
Emily rented a house near the beach. Typically, beach rentals come with access to the ocean. However, some more affordable places are a few blocks from the water and don't include beach access. If a rental is considered luxury, it does not have public beach access.

Question:
Can we conclude Emily's rental is considered a luxury property?
