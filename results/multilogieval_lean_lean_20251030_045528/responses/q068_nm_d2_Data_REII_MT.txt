Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Rule: REII_MT

Context:
Mary bought a new car. Typically, new cars come with a warranty. However, some dealers sell used cars that were former rentals, and those do not have a warranty. If a car was in a major accident, it will not have a warranty.

Question:
Can we conclude Mary's car was in a major accident?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Car : Type
axiom maryCar : Car

axiom New : Car → Prop
axiom Warranty : Car → Prop
axiom MajorAccident : Car → Prop

-- Typically, new cars come with a warranty (modeled here as a strict rule).
axiom new_implies_warranty : ∀ c : Car, New c → Warranty c

-- If a car was in a major accident, it will not have a warranty.
axiom majorAccident_implies_noWarranty : ∀ c : Car, MajorAccident c → ¬ Warranty c

-- Mary bought a new car.
axiom mary_new : New maryCar

-- From the above, we can conclude Mary's car was not in a major accident.
theorem not_major_accident_mary : ¬ MajorAccident maryCar := by
  intro hMA
  have hW : Warranty maryCar := new_implies_warranty maryCar mary_new
  have hNotW : ¬ Warranty maryCar := majorAccident_implies_noWarranty maryCar hMA
  exact hNotW hW
