Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: PBD_MT

Context:
Jenny said the dress was blue. Mary said the dress was not blue. People are normally right when they make claims about colors. Jenny seems more reliable.

Question:
Can we conclude the dress is actually another color?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Jenny : Person
axiom Mary : Person

axiom Blue : Prop  -- the dress is blue

axiom Says : Person → Prop → Prop
axiom MoreReliable : Person → Person → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom jenny_says_blue : Says Jenny Blue
axiom mary_says_not_blue : Says Mary (¬ Blue)
axiom jenny_more_reliable : MoreReliable Jenny Mary

-- Conflict resolution: if two people make directly opposing claims about A,
-- and one is more reliable, side with the more reliable one.
axiom resolve_by_reliability :
  ∀ {p q : Person} {A : Prop}, Says p A → Says q (¬ A) → MoreReliable p q → A

-- From the premises and resolution principle, the dress is blue.
theorem dress_is_blue : Blue :=
  resolve_by_reliability jenny_says_blue mary_says_not_blue jenny_more_reliable

-- Therefore, it is not the case that the dress is another color (i.e., not blue).
theorem cannot_conclude_another_color : ¬ (¬ Blue) :=
  fun h => h dress_is_blue
