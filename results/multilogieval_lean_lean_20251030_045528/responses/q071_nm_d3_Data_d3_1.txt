Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_1

Context:
Two authors have published best-selling novels. Authors of best-selling novels often receive literary awards. If author 1 receives a literary award, then Lucas writes a positive review. If Lucas writes a positive review, then Mia recommends the book.

Question:
Can we conclude if Mia does not recommend the book, then the other author does not receive a literary award?

LLM Response:

axiom Author : Type
axiom author1 : Author
axiom author2 : Author

axiom BestSeller : Author → Prop
axiom Award : Author → Prop

axiom LucasPositive : Prop
axiom MiaRecommends : Prop

-- Premises: both authors have best-selling novels
axiom bs1 : BestSeller author1
axiom bs2 : BestSeller author2

-- Premises: If author1 receives an award, Lucas writes a positive review.
axiom award1_implies_Lucas : Award author1 → LucasPositive
-- If Lucas writes a positive review, Mia recommends the book.
axiom Lucas_implies_Mia : LucasPositive → MiaRecommends

-- What we can derive: if Mia does not recommend the book, then author1 does not receive an award.
theorem notMia_implies_notAward_author1 : ¬ MiaRecommends → ¬ Award author1 := by
  intro hNotMia
  intro hAward1
  have hLucas : LucasPositive := award1_implies_Lucas hAward1
  have hMia : MiaRecommends := Lucas_implies_Mia hLucas
  exact hNotMia hMia

-- Demonstrating that the asked conclusion about author2 does not follow from the premises:
-- If we had witnesses that Mia does not recommend and author2 does receive an award,
-- then the implication (¬Mia → ¬Award author2) would be false.
theorem neg_target_from_witnesses
  (hNotMia : ¬ MiaRecommends) (hAward2 : Award author2) :
  ¬ ((¬ MiaRecommends) → (¬ Award author2)) := by
  intro hImp
  have hNotAward2 : ¬ Award author2 := hImp hNotMia
  exact hNotAward2 hAward2
