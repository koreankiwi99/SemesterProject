Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_1

Context:
Two cars C1 and C2 are equipped with automatic parallel parking feature. Normally, cars with automatic parallel parking also have cruise control. If car C1 has cruise control, then driver D1 can relax during long drives. If driver D1 can relax during long drives, then passenger P1 falls asleep.

Question:
Can we conclude if passenger P1 does not fall asleep, then car C2 has cruise control?
