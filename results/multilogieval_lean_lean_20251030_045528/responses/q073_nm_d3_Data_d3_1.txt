Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_1

Context:
Two cars have turbo engines. Cars with turbo engines usually have high performance. If car 1 has high performance, then John enjoys thrilling drives. If John enjoys thrilling drives, then Sarah gets excited.

Question:
Can we conclude if Sarah does not get excited, then the other car has high performance?

axiom car1_ne_car2 : car1 ≠ car2

axiom Person : Type
axiom John Sarah : Person

axiom Turbo : Car → Prop
axiom HighPerformance : Car → Prop
axiom EnjoysThrillingDrives : Person → Prop
axiom GetsExcited : Person → Prop

-- Two cars have turbo engines.
axiom turbo_car1 : Turbo car1
axiom turbo_car2 : Turbo car2

-- "Usually" is modeled as a separate predicate, not a logical guarantee.
axiom UsuallyHighPerformance : Car → Prop
axiom usually_from_turbo : ∀ c, Turbo c → UsuallyHighPerformance c

-- If car 1 has high performance, then John enjoys thrilling drives.
axiom high1_implies_john_thrill : HighPerformance car1 → EnjoysThrillingDrives John
-- If John enjoys thrilling drives, then Sarah gets excited.
axiom john_thrill_implies_sarah_excited : EnjoysThrillingDrives John → GetsExcited Sarah

-- We show the negation of the queried conclusion is consistent:
-- Assume Sarah does not get excited and the other car (car2) does not have high performance;
-- this does not contradict the given premises (since "usually" is not a logical implication).
axiom not_sarah_excited : ¬ GetsExcited Sarah
axiom not_high_car2 : ¬ HighPerformance car2

-- Therefore, the statement "if Sarah does not get excited, then the other car has high performance" is false.
