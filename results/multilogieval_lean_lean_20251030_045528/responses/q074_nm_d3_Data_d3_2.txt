Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_2

Context:
Trees and flowers are plants. Normally, plants with leaves undergo photosynthesis. If a plant receives sunlight, then it grows. If trees undergo photosynthesis, then forests are essential. Either plants have leaves or forests are not essential, or both.

Question:
If a plant does not grow, can we conclude that flowers undergo photosynthesis?
