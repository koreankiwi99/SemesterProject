Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_2

Context:
Athletes and coaches are part of a team. Typically, team members show teamwork. If a player is selfless, then the team succeeds. If athletes show teamwork, then coaches provide guidance. Either players are selfless or coaches do not provide guidance, or both.

Question:
If a team does not succeed, can we conclude that athletes do not show teamwork?

/-
Mapping to propositions:
A: Athletes show teamwork
C: Coaches provide guidance
S: The team succeeds
P: Players are selfless

Premises from the text:
1) If athletes show teamwork, then coaches provide guidance: A → C
2) If a player is selfless, then the team succeeds: P → S
3) Either players are selfless or coaches do not provide guidance (or both): P ∨ ¬C

Goal:
From ¬S, conclude ¬A.
