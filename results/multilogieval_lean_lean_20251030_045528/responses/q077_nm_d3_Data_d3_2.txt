Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_2

Context:
Math and Science are subjects with concepts. Typically, subjects with concepts require problem-solving skills. If a student excels in math, then they might enjoy computer programming. Either math requires problem-solving skills or a student does not enjoy computer programming, or both.

Question:
Can we conclude if a student does not enjoy computer programming, then Science does not require problem-solving skills?

-- Premises from the text
axiom math_hasConcepts : HasConcepts Math
axiom science_hasConcepts : HasConcepts Science

-- "Typically, subjects with concepts require problem-solving skills."
axiom concepts_require_ps : ∀ s : Subject, HasConcepts s → RequiresPS s

-- "If a student excels in math, then they might enjoy computer programming."
-- We model "might enjoy" as "enjoy" for a monotone reading.
axiom excel_implies_enjoy : ∀ x : Student, ExcelsInMath x → EnjoyCP x

-- "Either math requires problem-solving skills or a student does not enjoy computer programming, or both."
axiom disj : RequiresPS Math ∨ ∃ x : Student, ¬ EnjoyCP x

-- To show the questioned conclusion does not follow, we consider a consistent scenario:
-- assume there exists a particular student who does not enjoy computer programming.
axiom someStudent : Student
axiom someStudent_not_enjoys : ¬ EnjoyCP someStudent

-- Target questioned conclusion (universal reading):
-- ∀ x, (¬ EnjoyCP x → ¬ RequiresPS Science)
-- We show its negation holds in this consistent scenario.
theorem cannot_conclude :
  ¬ (∀ x : Student, (¬ EnjoyCP x → ¬ RequiresPS Science)) := by
  intro h
  -- From the "subjects with concepts require PS" and Science has concepts, Science requires PS.
  have reqSci : RequiresPS Science :=
    concepts_require_ps Science science_hasConcepts
  -- Apply the supposed universal implication to the student who does not enjoy CP.
  have not_reqSci : ¬ RequiresPS Science := h someStudent someStudent_not_enjoys
  -- Contradiction.
