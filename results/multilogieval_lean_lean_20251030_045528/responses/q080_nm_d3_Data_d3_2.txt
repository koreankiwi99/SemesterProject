Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: d3_2

Context:
Students and teachers like learning. Usually, individuals who like learning are curious. If a book is interesting, then it is engaging. If students are curious, then education is valuable. Either books are interesting or education is not valuable, or both.

Question:
If a book is not engaging, can we conclude that teachers are not curious?
