Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: d4_1

Context:
Bananas and Apples are fruits with peels. Normally, fruits with peels contain seeds. If a Banana is ripe, then the Banana is sweet. If an Apple is red, then the Apple is ripe. Either a Banana is ripe or an Apple is red. If a Banana contains seeds, then the Banana is ready to be planted.

Question:
Can we conclude if an Apple is not ripe, then a Banana does not contain seeds?
