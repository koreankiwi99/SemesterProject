Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: d4_2

Context:
Assume apples and oranges are fruits of type R and they both are round. Typically, fruits of type R that are round are juicy. If a drink is cold, then it is refreshing. If a person Z exercises regularly, then Z is healthy. Either the drink that is cold is not refreshing or the person who exercises regularly is not healthy. If apple is juicy, then the drink is cold.

Question:
Can we conclude if the drink is refreshing then the orange is round?

-- Apples and oranges are fruits of type R and both are round
axiom apple_fruitR : FruitR Apple
axiom orange_fruitR : FruitR Orange
axiom apple_round : Round Apple
axiom orange_round : Round Orange

-- Typically: fruits of type R that are round are juicy
axiom typical_rule : ∀ x : Thing, FruitR x → Round x → Juicy x

-- If a drink is cold, then it is refreshing
axiom drink_cold_imp_refreshing : ∀ d : Thing, Cold d → Refreshing d

-- If a person exercises regularly, then they are healthy
axiom exercise_imp_healthy : ∀ z : Person, Exercises z → Healthy z

-- Either the cold drink is not refreshing, or the person who exercises is not healthy
axiom disj : (Cold Drink → ¬ Refreshing Drink) ∨ (∃ z : Person, Exercises z ∧ ¬ Healthy z)

-- If apple is juicy, then the drink is cold
