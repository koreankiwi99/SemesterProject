Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: d4_1

Context:
Diamonds and Rubies are precious stones. Normally, precious stones are valuable. If a Diamond sparkles, then the Diamond is cut well. If a Ruby is deep red, then the Ruby is considered high-quality. Either a Diamond sparkles or a Ruby is deep red. If a Diamond is valuable, then the Diamond is worth a lot.

Question:
Can we conclude if a Ruby is not high-quality, then a Diamond is valuable?
