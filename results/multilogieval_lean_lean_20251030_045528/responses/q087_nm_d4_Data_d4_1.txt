Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: d4_1

Context:
Students and Teachers are individuals in a school. Typically, individuals in a school have books. If a Student studies hard, then the Student gets good grades. If a Teacher is knowledgeable, then the Teacher imparts useful information. Either a Student studies hard or a Teacher is knowledgeable. If a Student has books, then the Student is well-prepared.

Question:
Can we conclude if a Teacher does not impart useful information, then a Student does not have books?

-- Individuals in a school have books (formalizing "typically" as universally for the logic exercise)

-- Either a (this) Student studies hard or a (this) Teacher is knowledgeable
axiom disj : StudiesHard s ∨ Knowledgeable t

-- If a Student has books, then the Student is well-prepared
axiom books_well_prepared : ∀ x, Student x → HasBooks x → WellPrepared x

-- From the premises we can derive that this Student has books (independent of the Teacher).
theorem student_has_books : HasBooks s := by
  have hin : InSchool s := student_in_school s hs
  exact in_school_have_books s hin

-- Consequently, under the antecedent "the Teacher does not impart useful information",
-- we still conclude the Student has books (so the asked implication does not follow).
