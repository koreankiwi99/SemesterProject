Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: d4_1

Context:
Alice and Bob are students with laptops. Normally, students with laptops have access to online resources. If a library is quiet, it is conducive to studying. If a coffee shop offers free Wi-Fi, it attracts customers. Either a library is conducive to studying or a coffee shop with free Wi-Fi attracts customers or both. If Alice has access to online resources, then a coffee shop offers free Wi-Fi.

Question:
Can we conclude if a library is not conducive to studying then Bob does not have a laptop?

-- From the given premises, Target is not derivable, nor is its negation derivable.
-- We only derived that Alice has access, hence the coffee shop has free Wi-Fi and attracts customers.
-- No relation ties LibraryConducive to Bob's having a laptop.
