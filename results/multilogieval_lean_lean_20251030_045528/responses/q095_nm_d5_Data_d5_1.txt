Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
Students and Teachers are individuals in a school. Typically, individuals in a school are educated. If a Student is in class, then they study. If a Teacher is in the staff room, then they grade papers. Either a Student is in class or a Teacher grades papers, or both. If a Principal grades papers, then a Teacher is in the staff room. If a Librarian is educated, then a Student is in class.

Question:
Can we conclude if a Principal does not grade papers then a Student does not study?

axiom Librarian : Person

-- Predicates
axiom InSchool : Person → Prop
axiom Educated : Person → Prop
axiom InClass : Person → Prop
axiom Studies : Person → Prop
axiom InStaffRoom : Person → Prop
axiom Grades : Person → Prop

-- Premises translated from the text
axiom student_in_school : InSchool Student
axiom teacher_in_school : InSchool Teacher
axiom inSchool_implies_educated : ∀ x : Person, InSchool x → Educated x
axiom inClass_student_implies_studies : InClass Student → Studies Student
axiom staffRoom_teacher_implies_grades : InStaffRoom Teacher → Grades Teacher
axiom student_inClass_or_teacher_grades : InClass Student ∨ Grades Teacher
axiom principal_grades_implies_staffRoom_teacher : Grades Principal → InStaffRoom Teacher
axiom librarian_educated_implies_student_inClass : Educated Librarian → InClass Student

-- The questioned conclusion would be:
-- goal : (¬ Grades Principal) → (¬ Studies Student)

-- We show the negation of the conclusion is consistent with the premises
-- by assuming a scenario compatible with the premises where Student is in class
-- and Principal does not grade, which makes the implication false.

axiom not_grades_principal : ¬ Grades Principal        -- assume Principal does not grade (antecedent holds)
axiom student_is_in_class : InClass Student            -- assume Student is in class (consistent with the disjunction)

theorem negate_conclusion : ¬ ((¬ Grades Principal) → (¬ Studies Student)) := by
  intro h
  -- From Student in class, Student studies
  have hs : Studies Student := inClass_student_implies_studies student_is_in_class
  -- From the implication and ¬Grades Principal, we get ¬Studies Student
  have hns : ¬ Studies Student := h not_grades_principal
