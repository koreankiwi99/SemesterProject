Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
Books and Pens are items in a bookstore. Normally, items in a bookstore are available for purchase. If a Book is a bestseller, then it is displayed prominently. If a Pen is a fountain pen, then it has a refillable ink cartridge. Either a Book is a bestseller or a Pen has a refillable ink cartridge, or both. If a Notebook is available for purchase, then a Pen is a fountain pen. If a Planner is displayed prominently, then a Book is a bestseller.

Question:
Can we conclude if a Notebook is not a fountain pen then a Book is a bestseller?
