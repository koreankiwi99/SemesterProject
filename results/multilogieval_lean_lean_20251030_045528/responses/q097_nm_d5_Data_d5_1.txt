Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
Books and Pens are items in a bookstore. Normally, items in a bookstore are available for purchase. If a Book is a bestseller, then it is displayed prominently. If a Pen is a fountain pen, then it has a refillable ink cartridge. Either a Book is a bestseller or a Pen has a refillable ink cartridge, or both. If a Notebook is available for purchase, then a Pen is a fountain pen. If a Planner is displayed prominently, then a Book is a bestseller.

Question:
Can we conclude if a Notebook is not a fountain pen then a Book is not a bestseller?

axiom Item : Type u
axiom Book : Item
axiom Pen : Item
axiom Notebook : Item
axiom Planner : Item

-- Predicates
axiom Available : Item → Prop
axiom Bestseller : Item → Prop
axiom Displayed : Item → Prop
axiom Fountain : Item → Prop
axiom Refillable : Item → Prop

-- Premises from the text
-- If a Book is a bestseller, then it is displayed prominently.
axiom bestseller_implies_displayed : Bestseller Book → Displayed Book

-- If a Pen is a fountain pen, then it has a refillable ink cartridge.
axiom fountain_implies_refillable : Fountain Pen → Refillable Pen

-- Either a Book is a bestseller or a Pen has a refillable ink cartridge (or both).
axiom book_bestseller_or_pen_refillable : Bestseller Book ∨ Refillable Pen

-- If a Notebook is available for purchase, then a Pen is a fountain pen.
axiom notebook_available_implies_pen_fountain : Available Notebook → Fountain Pen

-- If a Planner is displayed prominently, then a Book is a bestseller.
axiom planner_displayed_implies_book_bestseller : Displayed Planner → Bestseller Book

-- To refute the queried implication, we provide a consistent counter-scenario:
-- Assume the Notebook is not a fountain pen, and the Book is a bestseller.
axiom notebook_not_fountain : ¬ Fountain Notebook
axiom book_is_bestseller : Bestseller Book

-- Target question: Can we conclude (¬ Fountain Notebook) → (¬ Bestseller Book)?
-- We show the negation of that implication holds under the (consistent) premises above.
