Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: d5_1

Context:
Alex and Sarah are athletes who train regularly. Typically, athletes who train regularly have good endurance. If a runner participates in marathons, and they have strong legs, they can complete long distances. If a swimmer practices breathing techniques and has strong arm muscles, they can excel in competitions. A runner can complete long distances in marathons, or a swimmer can excel in competitions, or both. If Sarah completes long distances in marathons, then Alex excels in competitions. If Alex has good endurance, then Sarah completes long distances in marathons.

Question:
Can we conclude if Sarah does not excel in competitions then Alex has good endurance?
