Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: HS

Context:
In football, if the offense gains 10 yards on a play, it results in a first down. Additionally, if the offense gets a first down, they get 4 more chances to advance the ball.

Question:
The offense in today's match gained 10 yards on a play, does this entail that they get 4 more chances to advance the ball?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Offense : Type
axiom todaysOffense : Offense

axiom Gains10Yards : Offense → Prop
axiom FirstDown : Offense → Prop
axiom FourMoreChances : Offense → Prop

-- Rules from the context
axiom gain10_implies_firstdown : ∀ o : Offense, Gains10Yards o → FirstDown o
axiom firstdown_implies_four_more : ∀ o : Offense, FirstDown o → FourMoreChances o

-- Fact from today's match
axiom gained10_today : Gains10Yards todaysOffense

theorem gets_four_more_chances_today : FourMoreChances todaysOffense := by
  have hfd : FirstDown todaysOffense := (gain10_implies_firstdown todaysOffense) gained10_today
  exact (firstdown_implies_four_more todaysOffense) hfd
