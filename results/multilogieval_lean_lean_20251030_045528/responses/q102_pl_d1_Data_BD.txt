Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: BD

Context:
In a farm, cows that eat nutritious feed produce more milk. Also, cows that are vaccinated remain healthy. However, due to limited resources, the farmer must choose between feed and vaccines for the cows. The cows cannot have both nutritious feed and vaccines regularly. The cows can either eat nutritious feed or not remain healthy.

Question:
Does this mean that the cows on the farm either produce more milk or are not vaccinated?

axiom Cow : Type
axiom Feed : Cow → Prop
axiom MoreMilk : Cow → Prop
axiom Vaccinated : Cow → Prop
axiom Healthy : Cow → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom feed_implies_moreMilk : ∀ x : Cow, Feed x → MoreMilk x
axiom vaccinated_implies_healthy : ∀ x : Cow, Vaccinated x → Healthy x
axiom not_both_feed_and_vaccinated : ∀ x : Cow, ¬ (Feed x ∧ Vaccinated x)
axiom feed_or_not_healthy : ∀ x : Cow, Feed x ∨ ¬ Healthy x

-- Conclusion: Every cow either produces more milk or is not vaccinated
theorem produce_more_or_not_vaccinated : ∀ x : Cow, MoreMilk x ∨ ¬ Vaccinated x := by
  intro x
  have h := feed_or_not_healthy x
  cases h with
  | inl hf =>
    exact Or.inl (feed_implies_moreMilk x hf)
  | inr nh =>
    apply Or.inr
    intro hv
    exact nh (vaccinated_implies_healthy x hv)
