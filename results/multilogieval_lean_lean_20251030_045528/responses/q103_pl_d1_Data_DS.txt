LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom WatchingComedy : Prop
axiom WatchingDrama : Prop
axiom watch_or : WatchingComedy ∨ WatchingDrama
axiom not_comedy : ¬ WatchingComedy

theorem viewing_drama : WatchingDrama := by
  apply Or.elim watch_or
  · intro hc
    exact False.elim (not_comedy hc)
  · intro hd
    exact hd
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes

Extracted Lean Code:
----------------------------------------
axiom WatchingComedy : Prop
