Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: DD

Context:
At a tech startup, the engineering team knows that if they add exciting new features, they will attract more users. Also, if they fix bugs quickly, they will improve user satisfaction. However, with limited resources, the team struggles. They often release updates that either don't attract new users or they have no user satisfaction.

Question:
Does this imply the engineering team either does not add exciting new features or does not fix bugs quickly?

LLM Response:
<lean>
theorem engineering_conclusion
  {AddFeatures FixBugs AttractUsers UserSatisfied : Prop}
  (h1 : AddFeatures → AttractUsers)
  (h2 : FixBugs → UserSatisfied)
  (h3 : ¬AttractUsers ∨ ¬UserSatisfied) :
  ¬AddFeatures ∨ ¬FixBugs := by
  cases h3 with
  | inl hNotAttract =>
    left
    exact mt h1 hNotAttract
  | inr hNotSatisfy =>
    right
    exact mt h2 hNotSatisfy
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
