Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: BD

Context:
The student knows if he studies more, he will get high marks on the test. And if he gets enough sleep, his mind will be sharp. But he has so much material to review that he must sacrifice sleep. He can either study thoroughly or not keep his mind sharp.

Question:
Does this lead to the conclusion that the student will either get high marks or does not get enough sleep?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom S : Prop            -- the student studies more/thoroughly
axiom H : Prop            -- the student gets high marks
axiom E : Prop            -- the student gets enough sleep
axiom M : Prop            -- the student's mind is sharp

-- Premises from the text
axiom study_implies_high : S → H
axiom sleep_implies_sharp : E → M
axiom no_sleep : ¬ E                      -- must sacrifice sleep ⇒ not enough sleep
axiom study_or_not_sharp : S ∨ ¬ M        -- either study thoroughly or not keep mind sharp

-- Conclusion: the student will either get high marks or does not get enough sleep
theorem conclusion : H ∨ ¬ E := by
  exact Or.inr no_sleep
