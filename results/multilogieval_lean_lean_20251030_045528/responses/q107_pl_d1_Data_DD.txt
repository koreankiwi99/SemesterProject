Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: DD

Context:
At a busy hospital, Dr. Jones knows that if she thoroughly reviews patient charts, she will provide accurate diagnoses. Also, if she orders the right lab tests, she will recommend effective treatment plans. However, with many patients to see each day, Dr. Jones struggles to find time. She often finds herself providing either inaccurate diagnoses or ineffective treatments.

Question:
Does this imply that Dr. Jones either does not thoroughly review patient charts or does not order the right lab tests?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom ThoroughReview : Prop
axiom AccurateDiagnosis : Prop
axiom OrderRightLabs : Prop
axiom EffectiveTreatment : Prop

axiom premise1 : ThoroughReview → AccurateDiagnosis
axiom premise2 : OrderRightLabs → EffectiveTreatment
axiom premise3 : ¬AccurateDiagnosis ∨ ¬EffectiveTreatment

theorem conclusion : ¬ThoroughReview ∨ ¬OrderRightLabs := by
  cases premise3 with
  | inl hNotAcc =>
      left
      intro hT
      apply hNotAcc
      exact premise1 hT
  | inr hNotEff =>
      right
      intro hL
      apply hNotEff
      exact premise2 hL
</lean>
