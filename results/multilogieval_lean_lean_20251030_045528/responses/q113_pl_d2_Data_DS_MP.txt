Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DS_MP

Context:
Mark was driving down a steep hill when he had to stop suddenly. He knew if his tires had good tread, his car would stop safely. But he was also relying on his brakes to work properly. Mark's passenger thought either the tires had good tread, or the brakes worked fine, or both.

Question:
If the brakes were not working, does this mean the car stopped safely?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom TiresGoodTread : Prop
axiom BrakesWork : Prop
axiom StopsSafely : Prop

-- If the tires have good tread, the car stops safely.
axiom tread_implies_safe : TiresGoodTread → StopsSafely
-- Passenger thought either the tires had good tread or the brakes worked (or both).
axiom passenger_belief : TiresGoodTread ∨ BrakesWork

-- If the brakes were not working, the car stopped safely.
theorem safe_if_brakes_not_working : ¬ BrakesWork → StopsSafely := by
  intro hNotB
  cases passenger_belief with
  | inl hT => exact tread_implies_safe hT
  | inr hB => exact False.elim (hNotB hB)
</lean>
