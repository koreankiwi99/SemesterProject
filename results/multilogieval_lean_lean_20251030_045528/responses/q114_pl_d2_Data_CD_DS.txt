Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: CD_DS

Context:
If my friend can give me a ride, I won't have to take the bus. Also, if I have enough for a taxi, I'll get to work on time. It seems either my friend will drive me, or I'll take a taxi, or maybe both will happen.

Question:
If I had to take the bus, then did I get to work on time?

Iterations:

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Ride : Prop           -- My friend can give me a ride
axiom Bus : Prop            -- I have to take the bus
axiom Taxi : Prop           -- I have enough for a taxi
axiom OnTime : Prop         -- I get to work on time

axiom ride_implies_not_bus : Ride → ¬ Bus
axiom taxi_implies_on_time : Taxi → OnTime
axiom ride_or_taxi : Ride ∨ Taxi

theorem bus_implies_on_time : Bus → OnTime := by
  intro hb
  have ht : Taxi :=
    Or.elim ride_or_taxi
      (fun r => False.elim ((ride_implies_not_bus r) hb))
      (fun t => t)
  exact taxi_implies_on_time ht
</lean>
