Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: CD_DS

Context:
If I study hard, I'll likely get an A on the test. If my teacher cancels the exam, I'll get to relax instead. It seems either I'll study a lot, the test will be canceled, or maybe both.

Question:
If I did not get an A on the exam, did I get to relax instead?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom StudyHard : Prop
axiom Cancelled : Prop
axiom GotA : Prop
axiom Relax : Prop

axiom h1 : StudyHard → GotA        -- If I study hard, I get an A.
axiom h2 : Cancelled → Relax       -- If the exam is canceled, I relax.
axiom h3 : StudyHard ∨ Cancelled   -- Either I study hard or the exam is canceled (or both).

theorem relax_if_not_A : (¬ GotA) → Relax := by
  intro notA
  cases h3 with
  | inl s =>
      have a : GotA := h1 s
      exact False.elim (notA a)
  | inr c =>
      exact h2 c
