Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DD_DS

Context:
If Dan followed the tutorial carefully, he was able to write the program. If the instructions were clear, any beginner could write the program. However, either Dan wasn't able to write the program or any beginner couldn't write it, or maybe Dan wasn't able to write it and any beginner couldn't write it.

Question:
If Dan followed the tutorial carefully, were the instructions clear?

-- Premise 2: If the instructions were clear, any beginner could write the program.
theorem premise2 : Clear → ∀ x : Person, Beginner x → CanWrite x := by
  intro hclear
  cases hclear

-- Premise 3: Either Dan wasn't able to write the program or any beginner couldn't write it
-- (inclusive "or", so we can satisfy it by the right disjunct).
theorem premise3 : (¬ CanWrite Dan) ∨ (∀ x : Person, Beginner x → ¬ CanWrite x) := by

-- Goal we test: If Dan followed the tutorial carefully, were the instructions clear?
-- We show the negation holds in this model: not (Followed Dan → Clear).
