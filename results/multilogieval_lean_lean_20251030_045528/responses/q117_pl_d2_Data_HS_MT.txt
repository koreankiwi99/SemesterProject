Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: HS_MT

Context:
Jeff wanted to gain more strength so he could lift heavier weights. He learned that if he followed a consistent workout routine, he would steadily gain strength over time. And if he gained enough strength, Jeff knew he could lift heavier weights in his workouts.

Question:
If Jeff cannot lift heavier weights, then does he follow a workout routine?

Iterations:

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom WorkoutRoutine : Prop
axiom SteadilyGainsStrength : Prop
axiom EnoughStrength : Prop
axiom LiftHeavierWeights : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom consistent_workout_implies_gain : WorkoutRoutine → SteadilyGainsStrength
axiom enough_strength_implies_lift : EnoughStrength → LiftHeavierWeights

-- Assume the scenario in the question: Jeff cannot lift heavier weights
axiom cannot_lift : ¬ LiftHeavierWeights

-- To refute that this would force him to follow a workout routine,
-- assume he does not follow a workout routine (this is consistent with the premises)
axiom not_workout : ¬ WorkoutRoutine

-- The claim in question would be: (¬ LiftHeavierWeights) → WorkoutRoutine.
-- We can prove the negation of that claim under the above assumptions.
theorem neg_claim : ¬ ((¬ LiftHeavierWeights) → WorkoutRoutine) := by
  intro h
  have hw : WorkoutRoutine := h cannot_lift
  exact not_workout hw
</lean>
