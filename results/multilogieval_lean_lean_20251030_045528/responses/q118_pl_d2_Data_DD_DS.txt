Context:
If Amy practiced piano daily, she will excel at her recital. If Amy is very talented, she will play beautifully. However, either Amy won't excel at her recital or she won't play beautifully, or maybe Amy won't excel at her recital and won't play beautifully.

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Practiced : Prop        -- Amy practiced piano daily
axiom Excel : Prop            -- Amy will excel at her recital
axiom Talented : Prop         -- Amy is very talented
axiom Beautiful : Prop        -- Amy will play beautifully

axiom hPE : Practiced → Excel
axiom hTB : Talented → Beautiful
axiom hNotEB : ¬Excel ∨ ¬Beautiful

-- From the premises, if Amy practiced daily, then she is not very talented.
theorem not_talented_if_practiced : Practiced → ¬Talented := by
  intro p
  have e : Excel := hPE p
  -- From e and (¬Excel ∨ ¬Beautiful), we can deduce ¬Beautiful.
  have nb : ¬Beautiful := by
    cases hNotEB with
    | inl ne =>
        exact False.elim (ne e)
    | inr nb =>
        exact nb
  -- From Talented → Beautiful and ¬Beautiful, conclude ¬Talented.
  intro t
  exact nb (hTB t)
