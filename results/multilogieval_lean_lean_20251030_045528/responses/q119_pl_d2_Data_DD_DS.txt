Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DD_DS

Context:
If it's Friday, my friends and I will go out to dinner. If I finished all my work this week, I'll relax this weekend. However, either my friends and I won't go out to dinner or I won't relax this weekend, or maybe we won't go out and I won't relax.

Question:
If it's Friday, did I finish all my work this week?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Friday : Prop
axiom Dinner : Prop
axiom Finished : Prop
axiom Relax : Prop

axiom friday_implies_dinner : Friday → Dinner
axiom finished_implies_relax : Finished → Relax
axiom not_dinner_or_not_relax : ¬Dinner ∨ ¬Relax

-- From the premises we can show: If it's Friday, then I did not finish all my work.
theorem friday_implies_not_finished : Friday → ¬Finished := by
  intro f
  have d : Dinner := friday_implies_dinner f
  have nr : ¬Relax := by
    cases not_dinner_or_not_relax with
    | inl nd =>
        exact False.elim (nd d)
    | inr nr =>
        exact nr
  exact fun w => nr (finished_implies_relax w)
