Logic Type: pl
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: DS_MP

Context:
Jenny was struggling in math class, so her parents enrolled her in tutoring sessions. They knew if Jenny attended the tutoring, her grades would likely improve. However, the effectiveness of the tutoring itself was also a factor. Jenny's teacher thought that either the tutoring was high quality, or Jenny attended regularly, or both were true.

Question:
If the tutoring was not high quality, does this mean Jenny's grades improved?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Attended : Prop
axiom HighQuality : Prop
axiom GradesImproved : Prop

-- If Jenny attended tutoring, her grades would improve.
axiom attend_improves : Attended → GradesImproved

-- The teacher thought: either the tutoring was high quality or Jenny attended (or both).
axiom hq_or_att : HighQuality ∨ Attended

-- If the tutoring was not high quality, then Jenny's grades improved.
theorem grades_improved_if_not_hq : ¬ HighQuality → GradesImproved := by
  intro not_hq
  cases hq_or_att with
  | inl hq => exact False.elim (not_hq hq)
  | inr ha => exact attend_improves ha
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
