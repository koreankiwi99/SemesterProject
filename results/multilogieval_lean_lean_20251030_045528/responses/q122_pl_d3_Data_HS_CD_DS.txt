Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS

Context:
Last night we experienced some unusual weather. If the electricity goes out, the room becomes dark. If the room is dark, we light candles to see. If it starts raining, the streets get wet from the rain. Last night, either the electricity went out, it started raining, or both things happened.

Question:
If we did not light any candles, did the streets get wet?

axiom E : Prop        -- electricity went out
axiom D : Prop        -- room is dark
axiom C : Prop        -- we light candles
axiom R : Prop        -- it starts raining
axiom W : Prop        -- streets get wet

axiom hED : E → D     -- if electricity goes out, the room becomes dark
axiom hDC : D → C     -- if the room is dark, we light candles
axiom hRW : R → W     -- if it starts raining, the streets get wet
axiom hDisj : E ∨ R   -- either electricity went out or it started raining (or both)
