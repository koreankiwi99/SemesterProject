Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: DMT_CO_MT

Context:
Whenever Kate feels stressed, she meditates. Kate also exercises when feeling anxious. Relaxation techniques and physical activity help manage stress.

Question:
Either Kate did not meditate or she did not exercise. Was Kate feeling stressed?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Kate : Person

axiom Stressed : Person → Prop
axiom Anxious : Person → Prop
axiom Meditates : Person → Prop
axiom Exercises : Person → Prop
axiom HelpsManageStress : Person → Prop

-- Premises from the text
-- 1) Whenever Kate feels stressed, she meditates.
axiom stressed_implies_meditates : Stressed Kate → Meditates Kate
-- 2) Kate also exercises when feeling anxious.
axiom anxious_implies_exercises : Anxious Kate → Exercises Kate
-- 3) Relaxation techniques and physical activity help manage stress.
axiom help_manage : (Meditates Kate ∨ Exercises Kate) → HelpsManageStress Kate
-- 4) Either Kate did not meditate or she did not exercise.
axiom not_m_or_not_e : ¬ Meditates Kate ∨ ¬ Exercises Kate

-- From (1) and (4), we can conclude: either Kate was not stressed or she did not exercise.
theorem not_stressed_or_not_exercised : ¬ Stressed Kate ∨ ¬ Exercises Kate := by
  -- contraposition of (1): if Kate did not meditate, then she was not stressed
  have contr : ¬ Meditates Kate → ¬ Stressed Kate := by
    intro hnm
    intro hs
    exact hnm (stressed_implies_meditates hs)
  -- case split on (4)
  cases not_m_or_not_e with
  | inl hnm =>
      exact Or.inl (contr hnm)
  | inr hne =>
