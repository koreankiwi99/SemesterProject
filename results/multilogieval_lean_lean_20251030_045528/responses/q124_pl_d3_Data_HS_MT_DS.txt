Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS

Context:
Laura has dreamed of attending a prestigious music school. She learned that if she practices piano daily, her skills will steadily improve. Laura knows that gaining proficiency in piano could help her get accepted into the music program. While Laura spends hours each day on the piano, she also enjoys taking voice lessons during her free time. It's clear that Laura either devotes time to honing her piano skills, or focuses on developing her vocal talents, if not both.

Question:
If Laura does not get accepted into music school, does she take voice lessons?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom VoiceLessons : Prop        -- Laura takes voice lessons
axiom Accepted : Prop            -- Laura gets accepted into music school
axiom voice_lessons_fact : VoiceLessons  -- From the text: she enjoys taking voice lessons (so she does)

theorem voice_lessons_if_not_accepted : ¬Accepted → VoiceLessons := by
  intro hNotAccepted
  exact voice_lessons_fact
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes

Extracted Lean Code:
