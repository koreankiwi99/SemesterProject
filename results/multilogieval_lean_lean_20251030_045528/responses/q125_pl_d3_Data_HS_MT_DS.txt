Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS

Context:
Chris decided to learn to code by practicing every day. He found that daily coding helped him build programming skills. Chris knew if he built up these skills, he could create complex web apps. Whether Chris codes daily, solves coding challenges to practice, or does both, his skills will grow.

Question:
If Chris does not create web apps, does he solve coding challenges?

axiom CodesDaily : Prop
axiom SolvesChallenges : Prop
axiom Skills : Prop
axiom CreatesWebApps : Prop

-- From the text:
-- Chris decided to practice every day.
axiom premise_daily : CodesDaily
-- Daily coding helps build programming skills.
axiom premise_daily_imp_skills : CodesDaily → Skills
-- If he builds these skills, he can(create/does create) web apps.
axiom premise_skills_imp_create : Skills → CreatesWebApps
-- Whether he codes daily, solves challenges, or both, his skills will grow.
axiom premise_or_imp_skills : (CodesDaily ∨ SolvesChallenges) → Skills

-- Goal: If Chris does not create web apps, then he solves coding challenges.
theorem goal : (¬ CreatesWebApps) → SolvesChallenges := by
  -- From daily coding, he gets skills
  have hs : Skills := premise_daily_imp_skills premise_daily
  -- From skills, he creates web apps
  have hc : CreatesWebApps := premise_skills_imp_create hs
  -- Now the implication holds vacuously: assuming not create yields contradiction
  intro hnc
  have : False := hnc hc
  exact False.elim this
