Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS

Context:
It was an eventful Saturday in town. If it is the weekend, the mall gets very crowded as people have free time to shop. If the mall is crowded, there tend to be long lines at the registers. Also, yesterday was payday at many jobs. If it's payday, people have some extra money to spend. Today, either it was the weekend, or it was payday yesterday, or both things occurred.

Question:
If there were no long lines, did people have money to spend?
