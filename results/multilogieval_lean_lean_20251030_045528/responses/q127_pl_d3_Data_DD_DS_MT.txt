Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: DD_DS_MT

Context:
Alex needs gas in his car to drive to work and a clear schedule to meet friends for dinner. If the car has gas, Alex can drive to work. If Alex's schedule is clear after work, he'll meet friends for dinner. Either he won't drive to work or he won't meet for dinner, or maybe neither. Alex checks his calendar to see what day it is. He knows that if it's Friday, his schedule is clear after work.

Question:
If the car has gas in the tank, is it Friday?

LLM Response:
<lean>
-- Propositions representing facts about Alex
axiom Gas : Prop          -- The car has gas
axiom Drive : Prop        -- Alex drives to work
axiom Meet : Prop         -- Alex meets friends for dinner
axiom Clear : Prop        -- Alex's schedule is clear after work
axiom Friday : Prop       -- Today is Friday

-- Premises from the text
axiom needs_gas : Drive → Gas          -- To drive, Alex needs gas
axiom needs_clear : Meet → Clear       -- To meet, Alex needs a clear schedule
axiom gas_impl_drive : Gas → Drive     -- If the car has gas, Alex can drive
axiom clear_impl_meet : Clear → Meet   -- If the schedule is clear, Alex meets friends
axiom not_drive_or_not_meet : ¬Drive ∨ ¬Meet  -- Either he won't drive or he won't meet (or both)
axiom fri_impl_clear : Friday → Clear  -- If it's Friday, the schedule is clear

-- What can be proved: If the car has gas, then it is not Friday.
