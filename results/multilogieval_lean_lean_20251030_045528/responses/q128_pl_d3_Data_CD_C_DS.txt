Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS

Context:
I have some plans for my day off today. If the package with my new bookshelf arrives today, I'll start building it. But if my friend asks me to help them move, I'll spend the day helping them instead. It seems either my package will arrive, or my friend will need help, or perhaps both will happen.

Question:
If I didn't spend the day helping my friend, then did I start building my new bookshelf?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom PackageArrives : Prop
axiom FriendNeedsHelp : Prop
axiom BuildBookshelf : Prop
axiom HelpFriend : Prop

axiom h1 : PackageArrives → BuildBookshelf
axiom h2 : FriendNeedsHelp → HelpFriend
axiom h3 : PackageArrives ∨ FriendNeedsHelp

theorem goal : (¬ HelpFriend) → BuildBookshelf := by
  intro notHelp
  cases h3 with
  | inl p =>
      exact h1 p
  | inr f =>
      exact False.elim (notHelp (h2 f))
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
