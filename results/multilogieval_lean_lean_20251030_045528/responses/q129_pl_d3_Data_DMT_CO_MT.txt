Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d3 (d3_Data)
Rule: DMT_CO_MT

Context:
Whenever Mark gets a flat tire, he changes it himself. Also, if Mark gets a flat, he calls roadside assistance. Being self-reliant and seeking help when needed are useful skills when dealing with car troubles.

Question:
Either Mark did not change the tire himself, or he did not call for assistance. Did Mark get a flat tire?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Flat : Prop          -- Mark got a flat tire
axiom Changed : Prop       -- Mark changed the tire himself
axiom Called : Prop        -- Mark called roadside assistance

-- Whenever Mark gets a flat, he changes it himself.
axiom h1 : Flat → Changed
-- If Mark gets a flat, he calls roadside assistance.
axiom h2 : Flat → Called
-- Either Mark did not change the tire himself, or he did not call for assistance.
axiom h3 : ¬Changed ∨ ¬Called

-- Conclusion: Mark did not get a flat tire.
theorem not_flat : ¬Flat := by
  intro f
  have c : Changed := h1 f
  have a : Called := h2 f
  cases h3 with
  | inl nc => exact nc c
  | inr na => exact na a
</lean>
ANSWER: No
