Rule: DD_DS_MT

Context:
Miriam wants to make dinner and dessert but needs to check if she has the ingredients. If the recipe only requires pantry staples, Miriam can make dinner tonight. If she went grocery shopping this week, she'll also bake cookies for dessert. Either she won't make dinner or she won't bake cookies, or she'll do neither. She checks the fridge to see if she has dairy products. She knows that if milk and eggs are there, then she went grocery shopping this week.

Question:
If the recipe only requires pantry staples, are milk and eggs in the refrigerator?

axiom PantryStaples : Prop

axiom BakeCookies : Prop
axiom Milk : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom pantry_implies_dinner : PantryStaples → MakeDinner

axiom not_dinner_or_not_cookies : (¬ MakeDinner) ∨ (¬ BakeCookies)
axiom milk_and_eggs_implies_grocery : (Milk ∧ Eggs) → Grocery

-- From the premises we can derive: If the recipe only requires pantry staples,
-- then it is not the case that both milk and eggs are in the refrigerator.
