Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_DS_MT_MT

Context:
It was Saturday afternoon. Jane knew if it is the weekend, then the cafe she likes is busy. Jane also wanted to go shopping today. If Jane goes shopping, the mall will be crowded. Either it is the weekend, or the mall is not crowded, or it is the weekend and the mall is not crowded. She also knows if she has free time, then she goes shopping. If Jane finished her work early, then she has free time.

Question:
If the cafe is not busy, then did Jane finish her work early?
