Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP

Context:
Emily adopted a high-energy puppy that needed a lot of activity. She learned that if she walked her dog every day, he would get more exercise and burn off excess energy. And if the dog got enough exercise, he would behave better instead of being restless. Emily made sure to either walk her dog daily or play fetch in the yard, or both, to meet her pup's needs. If Emily played fetch, then the dog really enjoyed this fun game.

Question:
The dog does not behave better. Then does he enjoy playing fetch?
