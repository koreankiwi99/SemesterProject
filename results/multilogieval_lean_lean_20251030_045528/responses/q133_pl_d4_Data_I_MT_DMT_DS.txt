Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: I_MT_DMT_DS

Context:
The teacher mentioned that if students complete all the homework assignments, then if they study hard before the test, they will score high marks.

Question:
The students studied hard before the test. The students did not score high marks. Did the students complete all the homework assignments?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom CompleteAllHomework : Prop
axiom StudyHard : Prop
axiom HighMarks : Prop

axiom premise1 : CompleteAllHomework → (StudyHard → HighMarks)
axiom premise2 : StudyHard
axiom premise3 : ¬ HighMarks

theorem not_complete_all_homework : ¬ CompleteAllHomework := by
  intro hCH
  have sh_to_hm : StudyHard → HighMarks := premise1 hCH
  have hm : HighMarks := sh_to_hm premise2
  exact premise3 hm
</lean>
ANSWER: No

Extracted Lean Code:
----------------------------------------
