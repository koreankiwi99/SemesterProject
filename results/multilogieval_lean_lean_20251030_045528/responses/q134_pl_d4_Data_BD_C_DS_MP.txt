Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP

Context:
Layla reads for 30 minutes each night before bed. She finds this helps her sleep peacefully. Meanwhile, her brother Noah often stays up late playing video games. Noah knows that staying up late makes him tired and irritable the next day. Either Layla read before bed last night, or Noah didn't feel tired and irritable next day. Layla realizes that a good night's rest leaves her feeling refreshed and cheerful in the morning.

Question:
Noah stayed up late playing video games. Then did Layla feel well rested and cheerful in the morning?
