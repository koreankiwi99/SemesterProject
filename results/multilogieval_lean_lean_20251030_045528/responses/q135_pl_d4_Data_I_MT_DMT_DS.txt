Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: I_MT_DMT_DS

Context:
The gardener is aware that if she plants her seeds at the correct depth, then if she waters them sufficiently, the vegetable plants will thrive.

Question:
The gardener watered the plants sufficiently, but the vegetable plants did not thrive. Did the gardener plant the seeds at the correct depth?

Iterations:
================================================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom CorrectDepth : Prop
axiom Watered : Prop
axiom Thrive : Prop

axiom plant_rule : CorrectDepth → Watered → Thrive
axiom watered : Watered
axiom not_thrive : ¬ Thrive

theorem not_correct_depth : ¬ CorrectDepth := by
  intro cd
  have t : Thrive := plant_rule cd watered
  exact not_thrive t
</lean>
ANSWER: No

Extracted Lean Code:
----------------------------------------
axiom CorrectDepth : Prop
axiom Watered : Prop
axiom Thrive : Prop

axiom plant_rule : CorrectDepth → Watered → Thrive
axiom watered : Watered
axiom not_thrive : ¬ Thrive

theorem not_correct_depth : ¬ CorrectDepth := by
  intro cd
  have t : Thrive := plant_rule cd watered
  exact not_thrive t
----------------------------------------

Lean Verification:
  Success: True

Ground Truth: No
Prediction: No
Correct: ✓ Yes
Total Iterations: 1
Final Lean: ✓ Success
