Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: HS_CD_DS_MP

Context:
It was a beautiful sunny day in the neighborhood. When the weather is nice, the local park gets very busy. When the park is busy, long lines form at all the food trucks there. School also ended for the summer today. If it's the first day of summer vacation, the children are very excited. Today, either the weather was nice or it was the start of summer break, or both things occurred. Parents know that if the children are very excited, bedtime is always difficult that night.

Question:
If there were no long food truck lines, was bedtime difficult?

axiom Nice : Prop
axiom Busy : Prop
axiom LongLines : Prop
axiom StartOfSummer : Prop
axiom Excited : Prop
axiom DifficultBedtime : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom nice_implies_busy : Nice → Busy
axiom busy_implies_longlines : Busy → LongLines
axiom start_implies_excited : StartOfSummer → Excited
axiom nice_or_start : Nice ∨ StartOfSummer
axiom excited_implies_difficult : Excited → DifficultBedtime

-- If there were no long food truck lines, was bedtime difficult?

  -- From no long lines, deduce not Nice (since Nice → Busy → LongLines)
