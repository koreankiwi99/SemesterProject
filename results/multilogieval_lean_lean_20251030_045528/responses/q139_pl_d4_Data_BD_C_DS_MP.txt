Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP

Context:
The ACME Factory knew that if they increased production, they would need to hire more workers. Meanwhile, the parent company was preparing to release a new product. The CEO knew that if they released a new product, then their stock price would likely increase. Either the factory increased production, or the stock price did not increase. The CFO was sure that if more workers were hired, the work will be done quickly for the next cycle.

Question:
The company released a new product. Will the work be quick for next cycle?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom IncreasedProduction : Prop
axiom HireMoreWorkers : Prop
axiom ReleasedNewProduct : Prop
axiom StockPriceIncrease : Prop
axiom WorkQuickNextCycle : Prop

axiom h_inc_implies_hire : IncreasedProduction → HireMoreWorkers
axiom h_release_implies_stock : ReleasedNewProduct → StockPriceIncrease
axiom h_inc_or_not_stock : IncreasedProduction ∨ ¬ StockPriceIncrease
axiom h_hire_implies_quick : HireMoreWorkers → WorkQuickNextCycle
axiom h_released : ReleasedNewProduct

theorem work_quick_next_cycle : WorkQuickNextCycle := by
  have sp : StockPriceIncrease := h_release_implies_stock h_released
  have ip : IncreasedProduction := by
    cases h_inc_or_not_stock with
    | inl hip => exact hip
    | inr nsp => exact False.elim (nsp sp)
  have hmw : HireMoreWorkers := h_inc_implies_hire ip
  exact h_hire_implies_quick hmw
