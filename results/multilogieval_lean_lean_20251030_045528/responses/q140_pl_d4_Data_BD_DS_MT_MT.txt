Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d4 (d4_Data)
Rule: BD_DS_MT_MT

Context:
The team was training intensely this week. They knew that if they are training hard, they will be prepared for the upcoming game. The coach also scheduled extra practices recently. If the coach scheduled extra practices, the players are putting in more hours. Either the team is training hard, or the players are not putting in more hours, or the team is training hard but the players are not putting in more hours. We know that if it is a very important match this weekend, then the coach scheduled extra practices. It's true that if the team lost their last game, then this weekend's match is very important.

Question:
If the team will not be prepared for the game, then did the team lose their last game?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom TrainingHard : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop
axiom Scheduled : Prop
axiom MoreHours : Prop
axiom Important : Prop
axiom LostLast : Prop

-- Premises
axiom h1 : TrainingHard → Prepared
axiom h2 : Scheduled
axiom h3 : Scheduled → MoreHours
axiom h4 : TrainingHard ∨ (¬ MoreHours ∨ (TrainingHard ∧ ¬ MoreHours))
axiom h5 : Important → Scheduled
axiom h6 : LostLast → Important

theorem query : ¬ Prepared → LostLast := by
  intro notPrepared
  have m : MoreHours := h3 h2
  have th : TrainingHard := by
    cases h4 with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr r =>
      cases r with
      | inl notM =>
        exact False.elim (notM m)
      | inr hAndNotM =>
        exact hAndNotM.left
  have p : Prepared := h1 th
  have f : False := notPrepared p
