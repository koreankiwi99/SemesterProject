Context:
Jim makes sure to water his vegetable garden every day. He knows if he waters the plants daily, they will grow big and healthy. It is now chili pepper season. Jim decided that if it was chili season, he would pick fresh chili peppers from his garden. Either Jim waters his garden daily or he did not pick fresh chilis this season. Jim knows if his vegetables grow big and healthy, he can use the fresh chilis to make homemade chili sauce. Whenever Jim makes homemade chili sauce, his family really enjoys pouring the spicy sauce on dinner.

Question:
If it is chili season, then does Jim's family enjoy homemade chili sauce on dinner?
