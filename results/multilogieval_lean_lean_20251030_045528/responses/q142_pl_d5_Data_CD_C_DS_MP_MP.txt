Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
John always tries his best in school. If he studies hard for a class, he gets good grades on the assignments. Also, if the professor cancels a class, John uses the free time to relax and watch TV. It seems either John will study hard or get a free period, perhaps both. If John gets good grades on the assignments, then he will be well prepared for the exams. And if John is well prepared for the exams, he will perform well in the course overall.

Question:
If John did not relax and watch TV, then did he perform well in the course?

axiom PerformWell : Prop

-- If John studies hard, he gets good grades on the assignments.
axiom h1 : StudyHard → GoodGrades
-- If John gets a free period (class canceled), he relaxes and watches TV.
axiom h2 : FreePeriod → RelaxTV
-- Either John will study hard or get a free period.
axiom h3 : StudyHard ∨ FreePeriod
-- If John gets good grades on the assignments, he will be well prepared for the exams.
axiom h4 : GoodGrades → WellPrepared
-- If John is well prepared for the exams, he will perform well in the course overall.
axiom h5 : WellPrepared → PerformWell

theorem goal : (¬ RelaxTV) → PerformWell := by
  intro hnot
  -- From not RelaxTV and (FreePeriod → RelaxTV), deduce not FreePeriod.
  have hnotF : ¬ FreePeriod := by
    intro hf
    exact hnot (h2 hf)
  -- From StudyHard ∨ FreePeriod and ¬ FreePeriod, deduce StudyHard.
  have hs : StudyHard := by
    cases h3 with
    | inl hs => exact hs
    | inr hf => exact False.elim (hnotF hf)
  -- Chain implications to conclude PerformWell.
  exact h5 (h4 (h1 hs))
