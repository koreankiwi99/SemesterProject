Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Carol decided to adopt a puppy, hoping for a loving companion in her life. She realized that having a devoted pet would make her feel less lonely. Whether Carol adopted the puppy, or joined a local hiking group, or did both, she hoped these steps would enrich her life. If Carol joined a hiking group, it would allow her to meet and make new friends. And making new connections would lead to an improved social life for Carol.

Question:
If Carol does not feel less lonely, then has her social life improved?
