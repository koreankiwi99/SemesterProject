Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Dan wanted to get in better shape. He decided to start a new workout routine to become more active. Dan knew being active regularly would help him gain strength and energy. Whether Dan started a workout routine or made healthy meal plans, he was taking steps to improve his health. If Dan planned healthy meals, he would start eating a more nutritious diet. Eating well combined with exercise meant Dan could achieve his fitness goals.

Question:
If Dan does not gain strength and energy, then does he achieve his fitness goals?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom StartWorkout : Prop
axiom ActiveRegularly : Prop
axiom GainStrengthEnergy : Prop
axiom PlanHealthyMeals : Prop
axiom EatWell : Prop
axiom Exercise : Prop
axiom AchieveFitnessGoals : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom decided_start : StartWorkout
axiom start_implies_active : StartWorkout → ActiveRegularly
axiom active_implies_gain : ActiveRegularly → GainStrengthEnergy
axiom plan_meals_implies_eatwell : PlanHealthyMeals → EatWell
axiom eatwell_and_exercise_implies_achieve : EatWell ∧ Exercise → AchieveFitnessGoals

-- If Dan does not gain strength and energy, then he achieves his fitness goals.
theorem query : (¬ GainStrengthEnergy) → AchieveFitnessGoals := by
  intro hnot
  have hActive : ActiveRegularly := start_implies_active decided_start
  have hGain : GainStrengthEnergy := active_implies_gain hActive
  have contra : False := hnot hGain
  exact False.elim contra
</lean>
