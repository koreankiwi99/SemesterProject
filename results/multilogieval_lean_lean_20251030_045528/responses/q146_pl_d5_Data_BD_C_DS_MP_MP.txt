Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
It's a beautiful sunny day. James notes that if it's sunny out, the community pool will open for the season today. If the lifeguards are scheduled, that means they'll show up for their shift. Either it's sunny out, or the lifeguards didn't come in today. James knows that if the pool opens, kids will start playing in it right away. And if kids are playing, the lifeguards on duty have to stay alert to watch them carefully.

Question:
If the lifeguards are scheduled to work, then do the lifeguards stay alert watching the kids?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Sunny : Prop
axiom PoolOpens : Prop
axiom Scheduled : Prop
axiom CameIn : Prop
axiom KidsPlaying : Prop
axiom Alert : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom hSunny : Sunny
axiom hSunny_implies_Open : Sunny → PoolOpens
axiom hScheduled_implies_CameIn : Scheduled → CameIn
axiom hSunny_or_not_CameIn : Sunny ∨ ¬ CameIn
axiom hOpen_implies_KidsPlaying : PoolOpens → KidsPlaying
axiom hKids_implies_Alert : KidsPlaying → Alert

-- Conclusion: If the lifeguards are scheduled, then they stay alert
theorem lifeguards_stay_alert : Scheduled → Alert := by
  intro _hScheduled
  have o : PoolOpens := hSunny_implies_Open hSunny
  have k : KidsPlaying := hOpen_implies_KidsPlaying o
  exact hKids_implies_Alert k
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
