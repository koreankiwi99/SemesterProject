Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: CD_C_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Amy woke up eager to make plans for the beautiful day. If the weather is nice, she will go on a hike. Also, if Amy has no pressing work deadlines, she will take the day off. It seems either the weather will be nice or Amy will have no deadlines, maybe both. If Amy goes on a hike, she will get to explore nature and get some exercise. And if she explores nature and exercises, Amy will have a relaxing day.

Question:
If Amy did not take the day off, then did she have a relaxing day?
