Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: pl
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: HS_MT_DS_MP_MP

Context:
Oliver decided he wanted to simplify his life starting with his living space. He realized if he cleaned his room regularly, it would stay tidy. And if his room stayed tidy, he would feel peaceful and relaxed there. Oliver either cleans regularly or declutters his belongings, or does both to get organized. If Oliver declutters, he naturally becomes more organized overall. And if he becomes more organized, his life feels simpler.

Question:
If Oliver does not feel peaceful in his living space, then does his life feel simpler?
