LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Sara : Person
axiom GoesCamping : Person → Prop
axiom GoesMovies : Person → Prop
axiom AbleToHike : Person → Prop
axiom Entertained : Person → Prop

theorem entailment
  (h1 : GoesCamping Sara → AbleToHike Sara)
  (h2 : GoesMovies Sara → Entertained Sara)
  (h3 : GoesCamping Sara ∨ GoesMovies Sara)
  : AbleToHike Sara ∨ Entertained Sara := by
  cases h3 with
  | inl hc => exact Or.inl (h1 hc)
  | inr hm => exact Or.inr (h2 hm)
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
