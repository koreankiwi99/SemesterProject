Context:
At a prestigious university, every professor was highly educated and an excellent teacher. Students vied for the opportunity to learn from these paragons of intellect and instruction. Nonetheless, some professors fell short of this lofty reputation.

Question:
Does it entail that there is at least one professor for whom either being highly educated is not true or being an excellent teacher is not true or both?

axiom Professor : Type
axiom HighlyEducated : Professor → Prop
axiom ExcellentTeacher : Professor → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom all_high_and_excellent : ∀ p : Professor, HighlyEducated p ∧ ExcellentTeacher p
axiom some_fell_short : ∃ p : Professor, ¬ (HighlyEducated p ∧ ExcellentTeacher p)

-- Conclusion: there exists a professor who is not highly educated or not an excellent teacher (or both)
