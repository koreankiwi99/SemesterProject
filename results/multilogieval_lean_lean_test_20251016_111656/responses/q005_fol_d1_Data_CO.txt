Context:
In a farm, every animal that stays healthy reproduces. Every animal that stays healthy also lives longer.

Question:
Does it entail that if an animal stays healthy on the farm, then it reproduces and lives longer?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom OnFarm : Animal → Prop
axiom StaysHealthy : Animal → Prop
axiom Reproduces : Animal → Prop
axiom LivesLonger : Animal → Prop

-- Premises:
-- 1) In the farm, every animal that stays healthy reproduces.
-- 2) In the farm, every animal that stays healthy lives longer.
axiom premise1 : ∀ a : Animal, OnFarm a → StaysHealthy a → Reproduces a
axiom premise2 : ∀ a : Animal, OnFarm a → StaysHealthy a → LivesLonger a

-- Conclusion: If an animal stays healthy on the farm, then it reproduces and lives longer.
theorem entailment :
  ∀ a : Animal, OnFarm a → StaysHealthy a → (Reproduces a ∧ LivesLonger a) := by
  intro a hFarm hHealthy
  apply And.intro
  · exact premise1 a hFarm hHealthy
  · exact premise2 a hFarm hHealthy
</lean>
ANSWER: Yes
