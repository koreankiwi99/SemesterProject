Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: BD
Source: data/multi_logi_original/data/d1_Data/fol/BD.json

Context:
In a community, citizens who volunteer help those in need. Those who donate to charity organizations support important causes. However, citizens have limited time and money to allocate. They can either volunteer or they do not support important causes through donations.

Question:
Does this mean that Luis, a busy working father, either helps those in need by volunteering or does not donate money to charity organizations?

axiom Person : Type

axiom Luis : Person

axiom Citizen : Person → Prop
axiom Volunteer : Person → Prop
axiom Helps : Person → Prop
axiom Donate : Person → Prop
axiom Supports : Person → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom volunteers_help :
  ∀ x : Person, Citizen x → Volunteer x → Helps x

axiom donations_support :
  ∀ x : Person, Donate x → Supports x

-- Limited time/money: a citizen either volunteers or they do not support important causes through donations
axiom limited_resources :
  ∀ x : Person, Citizen x → (Volunteer x ∨ ¬ Supports x)

-- Luis is a citizen of the community
axiom luis_citizen : Citizen Luis

-- Target: Luis either helps those in need by volunteering or does not donate to charity organizations
theorem luis_either_helps_by_volunteering_or_not_donate :
  (Volunteer Luis ∧ Helps Luis) ∨ ¬ Donate Luis := by
  have h := limited_resources Luis luis_citizen
  cases h with
