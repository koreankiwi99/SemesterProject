Context:
When attending a formal event, some dress in formal attire while others opt for casual wear. However, one person finds that their formal wear is not ready in time.

Question:
Does it entail that for Mary, who had the option to dress formally or casually, she wears casual attire to the event?

LLM Response:

axiom Person : Type
axiom Mary : Person
axiom John : Person

-- Predicates
axiom WearsFormal : Person → Prop
axiom WearsCasual : Person → Prop
axiom FormalReady : Person → Prop
axiom CanDressFormal : Person → Prop
axiom CanDressCasual : Person → Prop

-- Natural reading: at the event, wearing formal excludes wearing casual (and vice versa, but one direction suffices here)
axiom exclusive : ∀ p : Person, WearsFormal p → ¬ WearsCasual p

-- Contextual facts instantiating "some dress in formal attire" and "others opt for casual wear",
-- and "one person finds that their formal wear is not ready in time"
axiom mary_formal : WearsFormal Mary
axiom john_casual : WearsCasual John
axiom john_not_ready : ¬ FormalReady John

-- Mary had the option to dress formally or casually
axiom mary_options : CanDressFormal Mary ∧ CanDressCasual Mary

-- Derived from the instantiated facts (mirroring the textual "some ... others ..." and "one person ... not ready")
theorem some_wear_formal : ∃ p : Person, WearsFormal p := by
  exact ⟨Mary, mary_formal⟩

theorem some_wear_casual : ∃ p : Person, WearsCasual p := by
  exact ⟨John, john_casual⟩

theorem someone_not_ready : ∃ p : Person, ¬ FormalReady p := by
  exact ⟨John, john_not_ready⟩

-- Target question (negation): it is not entailed that Mary wears casual
theorem not_mary_casual : ¬ WearsCasual Mary := by
  exact exclusive Mary mary_formal
