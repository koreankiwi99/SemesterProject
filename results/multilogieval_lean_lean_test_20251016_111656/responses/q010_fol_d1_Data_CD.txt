Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: CD
Source: data/multi_logi_original/data/d1_Data/fol/CD.json

Context:
In academics, studying a topic in depth leads to expertise and authority on that subject. On the other hand, learning broadly exposes someone to diverse ideas and perspectives. However, students may opt to either study a single topic in depth or learn broadly across disciplines.

Question:
Does this entail that for Sarah, a dedicated student, either she gains expertise on a single topic or is exposed to diverse perspectives?
