Context:
If someone takes their car for an oil change, it runs smoothly. Also, if someone washes their car, it looks shiny and clean. However, this month someone either had a car that was not running smoothly or did not look clean, or both.

Question:
Tyler took his car for an oil change. Is it true that he washed his car?

def OilChange : Person → Prop := fun x => x = Tyler
def Washed : Person → Prop := fun _ => False

-- Premise 1: If someone takes their car for an oil change, it runs smoothly.

-- Premise 2: If someone washes their car, it looks shiny and clean.

-- Premise 4: Tyler took his car for an oil change.
theorem premise4 : OilChange Tyler := rfl

-- From premises 1 and 4, Tyler's car runs smoothly.

-- Conclusion in this model: Tyler did not wash his car.
