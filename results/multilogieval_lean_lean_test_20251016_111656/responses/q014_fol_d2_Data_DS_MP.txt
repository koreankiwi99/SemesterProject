Context:
In a sailing club, if someone maintains their boat well, they win races. However, it is not certain if the weather conditions are favorable. Either the boat is maintained well, or the weather conditions are favorable, or both.

Question:
Olivia's weather conditions were not favorable. Does this mean Olivia won her race?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Olivia : Person

axiom MaintainsWell : Person → Prop
axiom FavorableWeather : Person → Prop
axiom WinsRace : Person → Prop

-- If someone maintains their boat well, they win races.
axiom maintains_implies_wins : ∀ x : Person, MaintainsWell x → WinsRace x

-- Either the boat is maintained well, or the weather conditions are favorable (for Olivia).
axiom disjunct_Olivia : MaintainsWell Olivia ∨ FavorableWeather Olivia

-- Olivia's weather conditions were not favorable.
axiom not_favorable_Olivia : ¬ FavorableWeather Olivia

-- Therefore, Olivia won her race.
theorem Olivia_won : WinsRace Olivia := by
  have hMaint : MaintainsWell Olivia := by
    cases disjunct_Olivia with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr hFav =>
        exact False.elim (not_favorable_Olivia hFav)
