Context:
A chef thought that if they used fresh ingredients, their dishes would taste delicious. And if they followed traditional recipes, diners would appreciate the authentic flavors. However, the chef could either use fresh ingredients or make inauthentic dishes.

LLM Response:

axiom Fresh : Prop
axiom Delicious : Prop
axiom Traditional : Prop
axiom AppreciatedAuthenticFlavors : Prop

-- If they used fresh ingredients, their dishes would taste delicious.
axiom hFresh_imp_Delicious : Fresh → Delicious
-- If they followed traditional recipes, diners would appreciate authentic flavors.
axiom hTraditional_imp_Appreciated : Traditional → AppreciatedAuthenticFlavors
-- The chef could either use fresh ingredients or make inauthentic (i.e., not traditional) dishes.
axiom hFresh_or_NotTraditional : Fresh ∨ ¬Traditional
-- The patron's meal lacked flavor (i.e., the dishes were not delicious).
axiom hNotDelicious : ¬Delicious

theorem chef_did_not_follow_traditional : ¬Traditional := by
  have hNotFresh : ¬Fresh := by
    intro hf
    have hd : Delicious := hFresh_imp_Delicious hf
