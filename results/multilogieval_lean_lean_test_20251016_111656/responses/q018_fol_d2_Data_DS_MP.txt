Context:
In a photography club, if someone uses a professional camera, they take stunning photos. However, it's not certain if the lighting conditions are ideal. People are sure that either the camera is professional, or the lighting is ideal, or both.

Question:
Kiera's lighting conditions were not ideal. Does this mean Kiera took stunning photos?
