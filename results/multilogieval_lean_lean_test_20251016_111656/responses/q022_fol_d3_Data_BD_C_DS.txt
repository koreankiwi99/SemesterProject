Context:
In a city, residents know that if it rains, the grass gets wet. If there is a festival, then the streets get crowded. Either it rained today, or the streets were not crowded.

Question:
There was a festival in town today. Is the grass wet?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Rain : Prop
axiom GrassWet : Prop
axiom Festival : Prop
axiom StreetsCrowded : Prop

-- If it rains, the grass gets wet.
axiom rain_implies_wet : Rain → GrassWet
-- If there is a festival, the streets get crowded.
axiom festival_implies_crowded : Festival → StreetsCrowded
-- Either it rained today, or the streets were not crowded.
axiom either_rain_or_not_crowded : Rain ∨ ¬StreetsCrowded
-- There was a festival in town today.
axiom festival_today : Festival

theorem grass_is_wet_today : GrassWet := by
  have crowded : StreetsCrowded := festival_implies_crowded festival_today
  have rained : Rain :=
    Or.elim either_rain_or_not_crowded
      (fun r => r)
      (fun not_crowded => False.elim (not_crowded crowded))
  exact rain_implies_wet rained
