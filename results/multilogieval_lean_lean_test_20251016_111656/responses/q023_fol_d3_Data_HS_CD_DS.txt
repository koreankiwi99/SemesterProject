Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Context:
If it is cloudy, then it might rain later. If it rains, the grass gets wet. If the grass is wet, kids can jump in puddles. Either it was cloudy today, or kids were jumping in puddles, or both things happened.

Question:
There was no wet grass today. Were kids jumping in puddles?

axiom h_rain_implies_wet : Rains → WetGrass
axiom h_wet_implies_jump : WetGrass → KidsJump
axiom h_cloudy_or_jump : Cloudy ∨ KidsJump
axiom h_not_wet : ¬ WetGrass
