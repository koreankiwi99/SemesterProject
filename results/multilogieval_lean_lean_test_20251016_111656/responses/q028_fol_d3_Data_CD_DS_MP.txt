Context:
In a small village, someone was deciding what to plant in their garden. They knew that if they plant vegetables, they will have a bountiful harvest. Also, if they plant flowers, their garden will look beautiful. But someone will either plant vegetables or flowers this season. If a garden looks beautiful, it will be featured in a magazine.

Question:
Given that the garden did not have a bountiful harvest, will it be featured in a magazine?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Vegetables : Prop
axiom Flowers : Prop
axiom Bountiful : Prop
axiom Beautiful : Prop
axiom Magazine : Prop

axiom veg_implies_bountiful : Vegetables → Bountiful
axiom flowers_implies_beautiful : Flowers → Beautiful
axiom veg_or_flowers : Vegetables ∨ Flowers
axiom beautiful_implies_magazine : Beautiful → Magazine

axiom not_bountiful : ¬ Bountiful

theorem featured_in_magazine : Magazine := by
  have notV : ¬ Vegetables := by
    intro v
    exact not_bountiful (veg_implies_bountiful v)
  have f : Flowers := by
    cases veg_or_flowers with
    | inl v => exact False.elim (notV v)
    | inr f => exact f
  have beaut : Beautiful := flowers_implies_beautiful f
  exact beautiful_implies_magazine beaut
