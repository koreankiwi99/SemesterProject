Context:
One day, someone decided to start exercising regularly. They believed that if someone exercises regularly, they will gain more energy. If someone gains energy, they have improved moods.

Question:
Did James become much happier after he started exercising regularly?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person

axiom ExercisesRegularly : Person → Prop
axiom GainsEnergy : Person → Prop
axiom ImprovedMoods : Person → Prop

axiom exercise_implies_energy : ∀ x : Person, ExercisesRegularly x → GainsEnergy x
axiom energy_implies_improved_moods : ∀ x : Person, GainsEnergy x → ImprovedMoods x

axiom James_started_exercising : ExercisesRegularly James

theorem James_became_much_happier : ImprovedMoods James := by
  have hEnergy : GainsEnergy James := exercise_implies_energy James James_started_exercising
  have hMood : ImprovedMoods James := energy_implies_improved_moods James hEnergy
  exact hMood
