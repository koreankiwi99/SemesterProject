Context:
Someone was making dinner plans. They knew that if it was close to dinnertime, then they should start cooking. They also needed to go grocery shopping. If they go shopping, then they can make dinner. Either it is close to dinnertime, or they won't make dinner. If the fridge is empty, then they must go shopping. If there are no ingredients in the pantry, then the fridge is empty.

Question:
If Sam does start cooking, is the pantry empty?
