Context:
For students, teachers often say that if someone studies consistently throughout the semester, then if they are well-prepared before the exam, they will get good grades.

Question:
Emma was well-prepared before the exam. Emma did not get good grades. Did Emma study consistently throughout the semester?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Emma : Person

axiom Student : Person → Prop
axiom StudiedConsistently : Person → Prop
axiom WellPrepared : Person → Prop
axiom GoodGrades : Person → Prop

-- Teachers' rule for students:
axiom rule : ∀ x : Person, Student x → (StudiedConsistently x → (WellPrepared x → GoodGrades x))

-- Facts about Emma:
axiom emma_student : Student Emma
axiom emma_prepared : WellPrepared Emma
axiom emma_not_good : ¬ GoodGrades Emma

-- Conclusion: Emma did not study consistently.
theorem emma_not_studied : ¬ StudiedConsistently Emma := by
  intro hS
  have hImp : WellPrepared Emma → GoodGrades Emma := (rule Emma emma_student) hS
  have hG : GoodGrades Emma := hImp emma_prepared
  exact emma_not_good hG
