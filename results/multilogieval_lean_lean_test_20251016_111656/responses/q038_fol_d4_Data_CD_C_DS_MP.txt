Context:
At the park on weekends, if it is sunny, then children will play on the playground. Also, if there is a traveling carnival in town, families will go ride the rides together. Either it is sunny today, or the carnival is in town, or both are happening. But if kids get to play on the playground, they will have fun and get exercise.

Question:
The families did not go ride carnival rides, did the kids have fun and get exercise?
