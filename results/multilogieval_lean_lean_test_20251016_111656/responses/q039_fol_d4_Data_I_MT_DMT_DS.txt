Context:
For athletes, coaches often say that if someone trains with dedication, then if they get adequate rest, they will perform at their peak on game day.

Question:
Simone got plenty of rest before the big match. She did not play her best during the game. Did Simone train with dedication?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Simone : Person
axiom TrainsWithDedication : Person → Prop
axiom AdequateRest : Person → Prop
axiom PeakPerformance : Person → Prop

-- Coaches' rule: if someone trains with dedication, then if they get adequate rest, they will perform at their peak.
axiom coaches_rule : ∀ x : Person, TrainsWithDedication x → AdequateRest x → PeakPerformance x

-- Facts about Simone:
axiom rest_Simone : AdequateRest Simone
axiom not_peak_Simone : ¬ PeakPerformance Simone

-- Conclusion: Simone did not train with dedication.
theorem not_trained_Simone : ¬ TrainsWithDedication Simone := by
  intro hT
  have hP : PeakPerformance Simone := (coaches_rule Simone) hT rest_Simone
  exact not_peak_Simone hP
</lean>
