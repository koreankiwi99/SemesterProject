Context:
If the team practices hard, they will be prepared for the big game. If the star player is injured, he cannot play in the game. Either the team practiced hard, or the star player is not injured. When the team is well-prepared, the team wins the important game. If the team wins the important game, they will celebrate with a team dinner afterwards.

Question:
If the star player is injured, will the team celebrate with a team dinner after the big game?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom PracticeHard : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop
axiom Injured : Prop
axiom CanPlay : Prop
axiom Win : Prop
axiom Celebrate : Prop

axiom h1 : PracticeHard → Prepared
axiom h2 : Injured → ¬ CanPlay
axiom h3 : PracticeHard ∨ ¬ Injured
axiom h4 : Prepared → Win
axiom h5 : Win → Celebrate

theorem goal : Injured → Celebrate := by
  intro hi
  have hp : PracticeHard := by
    cases h3 with
    | inl p => exact p
    | inr notI =>
        exact False.elim (notI hi)
  exact h5 (h4 (h1 hp))
</lean>
