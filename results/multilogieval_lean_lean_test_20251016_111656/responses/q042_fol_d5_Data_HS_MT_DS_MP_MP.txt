Context:
A musician wanted to compose an album. They realized that if they practiced new melodies daily, they would expand their repertoire. If they had more material, they could produce enough songs for an album. So if they practiced new melodies daily, they could compose an album. Either the musician practiced new melodies, or they jammed with friends, or they did both. If someone jammed with friends, they gained inspiration from collaboration. And if they felt inspired, their creativity flourished.

Question:
If Sarah did not release an album this year, did her creativity flourish?
