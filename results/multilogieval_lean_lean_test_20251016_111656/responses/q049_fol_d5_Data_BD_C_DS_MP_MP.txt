Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d5 (d5_Data)
Rule: BD_C_DS_MP_MP
Source: data/multi_logi_original/data/d5_Data/fol/BD_C_DS_MP_MP.json

Context:
If someone studies hard for an exam, they will feel confident going into the test. If there is severe weather in the forecast, schools may cancel class that day. Either Alex studied diligently for his biology exam, or class was not canceled due to the weather. If a student feels confident about the material, they will likely do well on the exam. If a student performs well on an exam, they will be satisfied with their hard work.

Question:
If there was severe weather in the forecast, did Alex feel satisfied with his performance on the history exam?

axiom Person : Type
axiom Exam : Type

axiom Alex : Person
axiom Biology : Exam
axiom History : Exam

axiom Studied : Person → Exam → Prop
axiom Confident : Person → Exam → Prop
axiom DidWell : Person → Exam → Prop
axiom Satisfied : Person → Exam → Prop

axiom SevereWeather : Prop
axiom ClassCanceled : Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom P1 : ∀ p e, Studied p e → Confident p e
axiom P2 : SevereWeather → ClassCanceled
axiom P3 : Studied Alex Biology ∨ ¬ ClassCanceled
axiom P4 : ∀ p e, Confident p e → DidWell p e
axiom P5 : ∀ p e, DidWell p e → Satisfied p e

-- From the premises we can derive that under severe weather,
-- Alex is satisfied with his Biology exam (but this gives no info about History).
