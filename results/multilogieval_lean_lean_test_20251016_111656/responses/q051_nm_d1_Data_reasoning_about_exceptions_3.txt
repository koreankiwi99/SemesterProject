Context:
Cows are known for their distinctive black and white patchwork coats. As herd animals, cows often live together in large groups called herds. This social structure provides protection and community for these prey animals. However, not all black and white animals are highly social. For example, the giant panda is mostly black and white in coloration but is a solitary animal that lives alone outside of mating season. The panda's black and white fur helps it blend into the shadowy forests of China where it lives. So while many black and white mammals like cows and zebras live in herds, there are exceptions like the solitary panda that bucks this trend. The panda's individual lifestyle shows that not all black and white animals necessarily live in big groups.

Question:
does this imply that cows usually live in groups?

-- 2) The giant panda is mostly black and white and is solitary.
