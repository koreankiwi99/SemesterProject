Context:
Mary was out shopping for fruit at the local market. She wanted to buy some apples, oranges and bananas since she knew those were all tasty fruits. As she was picking out some fresh apples and oranges from the produce bins, she noticed one of the oranges seemed to have fallen on the ground. It must have rolled off the table it was displayed on. Even though most fruits grow on trees, this particular orange was sitting on the floor and not on its tree. Mary decided not to get that orange since it was dirty. She collected the rest of her apples, oranges and bananas that were still fresh on their displays. After paying for her fruit, Mary left the market satisfied with her fruity purchases.

Question:
does this mean that bananas are growing on a tree and exactly one of the apples or oranges is not growing on a tree?
