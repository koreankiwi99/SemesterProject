Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: reasoning_about_exceptions_1
Source: data/multi_logi_original/data/d1_Data/nm/reasoning_about_exceptions_1.json

Context:
Julia, Emma, and Lucas are graduate students in the biology department and have published research papers. Generally, students who have published are considered for scholarships. At least one of Julia or Emma has not been considered for a scholarship.

Question:
Can we conclude Lucas has been considered for a scholarship and exactly one of Julia or Emma has not been considered?

axiom Student : Type

axiom Julia : Student
axiom Emma : Student
axiom Lucas : Student

axiom Published : Student → Prop
axiom Considered : Student → Prop

axiom Julia_published : Published Julia
axiom Emma_published : Published Emma
axiom Lucas_published : Published Lucas

axiom published_implies_considered : ∀ s : Student, Published s → Considered s

axiom at_least_one_not_considered : ¬Considered Julia ∨ ¬Considered Emma

theorem conclusion :
  Considered Lucas ∧
  ((¬Considered Julia ∧ Considered Emma) ∨ (Considered Julia ∧ ¬Considered Emma)) := by
  -- From publication to consideration
  have CJ : Considered Julia := published_implies_considered Julia Julia_published
  have CE : Considered Emma := published_implies_considered Emma Emma_published
  have CL : Considered Lucas := published_implies_considered Lucas Lucas_published
  -- Contradiction with "at least one not considered"
  have contra : False := by
    cases at_least_one_not_considered with
    | inl hNotCJ => exact hNotCJ CJ
    | inr hNotCE => exact hNotCE CE
