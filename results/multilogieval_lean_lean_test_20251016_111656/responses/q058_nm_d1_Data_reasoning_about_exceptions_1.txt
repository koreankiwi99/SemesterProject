Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Context:
The Blue Galaxy, Red Nebula, and Green Comet are celestial objects discovered last year and exhibit unusual electromagnetic signals. Typically, celestial objects with such signals are studied further by the space agency. At least one of Blue Galaxy or Red Nebula is not being studied further.

Question:
Can we conclude Green Comet is being studied further and exactly one of Blue Galaxy or Red Nebula is not being studied?
