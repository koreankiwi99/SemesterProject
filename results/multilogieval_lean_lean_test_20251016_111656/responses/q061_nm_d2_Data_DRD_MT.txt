Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Context:
The Sedan and the SUV are cars with anti-lock brakes. Cars with anti-lock brakes usually have electronic stability control. The Sedan may lack electronic stability control even with anti-lock brakes. If the SUV has all-wheel drive, then it probably does not have electronic stability control.

Question:
Can we conclude the SUV has all-wheel drive?

/- We formalize the scenario. -/
axiom Car : Type
axiom Sedan : Car
axiom SUV : Car

axiom HasABS : Car → Prop
axiom HasESC : Car → Prop
axiom AWD : Car → Prop

/- Qualifiers for defeasible information (not hard logical implications). -/
axiom UsuallyHasESC : Car → Prop
axiom ProbablyNoESC : Car → Prop

/- Premises from the text. -/
axiom sedan_abs : HasABS Sedan
axiom suv_abs : HasABS SUV
axiom abs_usually_esc : ∀ c : Car, HasABS c → UsuallyHasESC c
/- “The Sedan may lack ESC even with ABS.” We model this by not asserting any hard rule from ABS to ESC. -/
axiom suv_awd_prob_noesc : AWD SUV → ProbablyNoESC SUV

/- Some harmless consequences we can derive. -/
theorem suv_usually_ESC : UsuallyHasESC SUV := by
  exact abs_usually_esc SUV suv_abs

theorem suv_AWD_implies_prob_no_ESC : AWD SUV → ProbablyNoESC SUV := by
  exact suv_awd_prob_noesc

/- There is no information that allows us to deduce AWD SUV. In particular,
   the only statement mentioning AWD is conditional (if AWD SUV then ...),
   which provides no way to conclude AWD SUV. Hence we cannot prove AWD SUV
   (nor its negation) from these premises without adding extra assumptions. -/
