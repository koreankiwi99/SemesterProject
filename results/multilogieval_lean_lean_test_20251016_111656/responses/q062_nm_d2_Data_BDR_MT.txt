Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: nm
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: BDR_MT
Source: data/multi_logi_original/data/d2_Data/nm/BDR_MT.json

Context:
Emma and Jacob are students in the same class. Usually students in that class submit homework assignments. Emma did not submit the last homework. If Jacob missed over 3 classes, that means he likely did not submit the homework.

Question:
Can we conclude Jacob missed over 3 classes?

axiom Person : Type
axiom Emma : Person
axiom Jacob : Person

-- Predicates
axiom StudentInClass : Person → Prop
axiom SubmitLastHW : Person → Prop
axiom MissedOver3 : Person → Prop
axiom Likely : Prop → Prop

-- Premises from the text
axiom student_Emma : StudentInClass Emma
axiom student_Jacob : StudentInClass Jacob
-- "Usually students in that class submit homework assignments." → model as: students are likely to submit
axiom usually_students_likely_submit : ∀ x : Person, StudentInClass x → Likely (SubmitLastHW x)
-- "Emma did not submit the last homework."
axiom emma_did_not_submit : ¬ SubmitLastHW Emma
-- "If Jacob missed over 3 classes, that means he likely did not submit the homework."
axiom jacob_missed_imp_likely_nosubmit : MissedOver3 Jacob → Likely (¬ SubmitLastHW Jacob)

-- Coherence of "likely": it can't be likely both that p and that not p
axiom likely_coherent : ∀ p : Prop, ¬ (Likely p ∧ Likely (¬ p))

-- Conclusion: We cannot conclude Jacob missed over 3 classes; in fact, we can derive its negation
