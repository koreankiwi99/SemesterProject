Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Context:
The teacher said Alex got 90% on the test. The principal said Alex did not get 90% on the test. Normally people tell the truth about grades. The teacher has better information than the principal. If there was a grading error, Alex could not have actually gotten 90%.

Question:
Can we conclude there was a grading error?

LLM Response:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom teacher principal : Person

-- Propositions about Alex's grade and the possibility of a grading error
axiom Got90 : Prop
axiom GradingError : Prop

-- Speech and reliability
axiom Says : Person → Prop → Prop
axiom Reliable : Person → Prop

-- Information quality
axiom BetterInformed : Person → Person → Prop
axiom teacherBetter : BetterInformed teacher principal
axiom betterImpliesReliable : ∀ a b : Person, BetterInformed a b → Reliable a

-- What each person said
axiom teacherSaid : Says teacher Got90
axiom principalSaid : Says principal (¬ Got90)

-- Normally: if someone is reliable and says φ about grades, then φ is true
axiom truthful : ∀ p : Person, ∀ φ : Prop, Reliable p → Says p φ → φ

-- If there was a grading error, Alex could not have actually gotten 90%
axiom gradingErrorImpliesNot90 : GradingError → ¬ Got90

-- Conclusion: there was no grading error
