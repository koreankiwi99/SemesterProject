Clearly explain which rules you're applying and how you reach your conclusion.\n\nSTAGE 2: Then translate your reasoning into Lean 4 code. During the translation, please pay close attention to the predicates and entities. There is an additional requirement: I also want you to try to prove the theorem you translated to Lean. If you can prove the theorem, give me Yes at the end of the answer. If you can prove the negation of the theorem, write No at the end of the answer.\n\nCRITICAL: Use only Lean 4 syntax.\n\nFORMATTING REQUIREMENT:\nYou must wrap ALL your Lean code in <lean></lean> tags like this:\n<lean>\naxiom Person : Type\naxiom Alice : Person\naxiom Happy : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom premise : Happy Alice\ntheorem goal : Happy Alice := by\n  exact premise\n</lean>\n\nDo not include any Lean code outside these tags.\n\nIMPORTANT: After your Lean analysis, provide your final answer in exactly this format:\nANSWER: Yes/No"
