Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: MT

Context:
When someone practices good hygiene, they are less likely to get sick. Sarah is not less likely to get sick.

Question:
Does Sarah practice good hygiene?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Let P(x) mean “x practices good hygiene” and L(x) mean “x is less likely to get sick.”
- Premise 1: For all x, if P(x) then L(x). Symbolically, ∀x (P(x) → L(x)).
- Premise 2: Sarah is not less likely to get sick. Symbolically, ¬L(Sarah).
- To determine whether Sarah practices good hygiene, apply modus tollens (or use the contrapositive of Premise 1: ¬L(x) → ¬P(x)). Since ¬L(Sarah) and (P(Sarah) → L(Sarah)), we conclude ¬P(Sarah).
- Therefore, Sarah does not practice good hygiene.

STAGE 2: Lean 4 translation and proof

axiom Person : Type
axiom Sarah : Person

axiom GoodHygiene : Person → Prop
axiom LessLikelySick : Person → Prop

axiom hygiene_implies_less : ∀ x : Person, GoodHygiene x → LessLikelySick x
axiom not_less_Sarah : ¬ LessLikelySick Sarah

theorem not_good_hygiene_Sarah : ¬ GoodHygiene Sarah := by
