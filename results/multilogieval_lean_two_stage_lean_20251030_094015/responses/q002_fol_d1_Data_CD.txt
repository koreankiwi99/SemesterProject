Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: CD

Context:
Sara is deciding what to do this weekend. If Sara goes camping, she'll be able to hike through nature. However, if Sara goes to the movies, she'll be entertained. Sara is choosing between going camping or going to the movies.

Question:
Does this entail that for Sara, either she'll be able to hike through nature or be entertained?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Logical reasoning in natural language

- Let C be “Sara goes camping,” M be “Sara goes to the movies,” H be “Sara will be able to hike through nature,” and E be “Sara will be entertained.”
- Premises:
  1) C → H (If Sara goes camping, she’ll be able to hike through nature.)
  2) M → E (If Sara goes to the movies, she’ll be entertained.)
  3) C ∨ M (Sara is choosing between going camping or going to the movies; at least one will occur.)
- By disjunction elimination on (3):
  - Case C: from C and (1) by modus ponens, infer H, hence H ∨ E.
  - Case M: from M and (2) by modus ponens, infer E, hence H ∨ E.
- Therefore, H ∨ E follows. So yes, it entails that either she’ll be able to hike through nature or be entertained.

STAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and proof

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Sara : Person

axiom GoesCamping : Person → Prop
axiom GoesMovies : Person → Prop
axiom WillHikeNature : Person → Prop
axiom WillBeEntertained : Person → Prop

axiom camp_implies_hike : GoesCamping Sara → WillHikeNature Sara
axiom movie_implies_entertain : GoesMovies Sara → WillBeEntertained Sara
axiom choice : GoesCamping Sara ∨ GoesMovies Sara

theorem entailment :
  WillHikeNature Sara ∨ WillBeEntertained Sara := by
  exact Or.elim choice
    (fun hc => Or.inl (camp_implies_hike hc))
    (fun hm => Or.inr (movie_implies_entertain hm))
