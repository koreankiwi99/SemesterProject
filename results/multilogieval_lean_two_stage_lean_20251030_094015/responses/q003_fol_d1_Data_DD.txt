Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: DD

Context:
If a person learns to play the guitar, then they can entertain themselves. Moreover, if they take singing lessons, then they can improve their vocal skills. However, they find themselves in a situation where they either do not entertain themselves or do not improve their vocal skills.

Question:
Does it entail that for Alex, who is learning music, either they do not learn to play the guitar or they do not take singing lessons?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

Let:
- G(x): x learns to play the guitar.
- E(x): x can entertain themselves.
- S(x): x takes singing lessons.
- V(x): x can improve their vocal skills.

Premises:
1) For any person x, if G(x) then E(x).
2) For any person x, if S(x) then V(x).
3) For Alex, either ¬E(Alex) or ¬V(Alex).

Goal: Show that for Alex, either ¬G(Alex) or ¬S(Alex).

Reasoning:
- From (1), by contraposition (modus tollens), ¬E(x) implies ¬G(x) for any x. In particular, ¬E(Alex) → ¬G(Alex).
- From (2), by contraposition, ¬V(x) implies ¬S(x) for any x. In particular, ¬V(Alex) → ¬S(Alex).
- From (3), we have a disjunction: either ¬E(Alex) or ¬V(Alex).
  - If ¬E(Alex), then by the first contrapositive, ¬G(Alex).
  - If ¬V(Alex), then by the second contrapositive, ¬S(Alex).
- Therefore, either ¬G(Alex) or ¬S(Alex).

Thus, yes, it entails the desired conclusion for Alex.
