Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: DMT

Context:
At a prestigious university, every professor was highly educated and an excellent teacher. Students vied for the opportunity to learn from these paragons of intellect and instruction. Nonetheless, some professors fell short of this lofty reputation.

Question:
Does it entail that there is at least one professor for whom either being highly educated is not true or being an excellent teacher is not true or both?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1 (Reasoning in natural language):
- Let the domain be the set of professors. Let H(x) mean “x is highly educated” and E(x) mean “x is an excellent teacher.”
- The text contains two key claims:
  1) Every professor was highly educated and an excellent teacher: ∀x (H(x) ∧ E(x)).
  2) Nonetheless, some professors fell short of this lofty reputation. The natural formalization is: ∃x ¬(H(x) ∧ E(x)).
- The question asks whether it follows that there exists a professor for whom either being highly educated is not true or being an excellent teacher is not true (or both), i.e., ∃x (¬H(x) ∨ ¬E(x)).
- From the second claim (∃x ¬(H(x) ∧ E(x))) pick a witness p such that ¬(H(p) ∧ E(p)) (existential instantiation).
- By a classical De Morgan-like principle, from ¬(A ∧ B) we can infer ¬A ∨ ¬B. Applying this to A = H(p), B = E(p) yields ¬H(p) ∨ ¬E(p).
- Then by existential introduction, we conclude ∃x (¬H(x) ∨ ¬E(x)).
- Note: The first universal claim contradicts the “fell short” claim, but we do not need it to derive the conclusion. The “fell short” sentence alone suffices to entail the required existential.
