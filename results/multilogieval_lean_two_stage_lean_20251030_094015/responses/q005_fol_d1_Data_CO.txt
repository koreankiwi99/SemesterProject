Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: CO

Context:
In a farm, every animal that stays healthy reproduces. Every animal that stays healthy also lives longer.

Question:
Does it entail that if an animal stays healthy on the farm, then it reproduces and lives longer?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

- Formalization:
  - Premise 1: For every animal x, if x stays healthy, then x reproduces. Symbolically: ∀x (Healthy(x) → Reproduces(x)).
  - Premise 2: For every animal x, if x stays healthy, then x lives longer. Symbolically: ∀x (Healthy(x) → LivesLonger(x)).
  - Goal: For every animal x, if x stays healthy, then x reproduces and lives longer. Symbolically: ∀x (Healthy(x) → (Reproduces(x) ∧ LivesLonger(x))).

- Proof strategy:
  - Fix an arbitrary animal a.
  - Assume Healthy(a).
  - By Modus Ponens using Premise 1, deduce Reproduces(a).
  - By Modus Ponens using Premise 2, deduce LivesLonger(a).
  - By conjunction introduction, conclude Reproduces(a) ∧ LivesLonger(a).
  - Since a was arbitrary, universally generalize to all animals.

Therefore, the conclusion is entailed by the premises.

STAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and proof

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom Healthy : Animal → Prop
axiom Reproduces : Animal → Prop
axiom LivesLonger : Animal → Prop

axiom premise1 : ∀ a : Animal, Healthy a → Reproduces a
axiom premise2 : ∀ a : Animal, Healthy a → LivesLonger a

theorem entailment :
  ∀ a : Animal, Healthy a → (Reproduces a ∧ LivesLonger a) := by
  intro a
  intro hHealthy
  have hRepro : Reproduces a := premise1 a hHealthy
  have hLonger : LivesLonger a := premise2 a hHealthy
  exact And.intro hRepro hLonger
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes

Extracted Lean Code:
----------------------------------------
axiom Animal : Type
axiom Healthy : Animal → Prop
axiom Reproduces : Animal → Prop
axiom LivesLonger : Animal → Prop

axiom premise1 : ∀ a : Animal, Healthy a → Reproduces a
axiom premise2 : ∀ a : Animal, Healthy a → LivesLonger a

theorem entailment :
  ∀ a : Animal, Healthy a → (Reproduces a ∧ LivesLonger a) := by
