Context:
In a community, citizens who volunteer help those in need. Those who donate to charity organizations support important causes. However, citizens have limited time and money to allocate. They can either volunteer or they do not support important causes through donations.

Question:
Does this mean that Luis, a busy working father, either helps those in need by volunteering or does not donate money to charity organizations?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Step-by-step reasoning

- Let V(x) mean “x volunteers,” H(x) mean “x helps those in need,” D(x) mean “x donates to charity organizations,” and S(x) mean “x supports important causes through donations.” Let C(x) mean “x is a citizen.”
- Premise 1: Citizens who volunteer help those in need. Formally: ∀x, C(x) ∧ V(x) → H(x). We will use the simpler curried form C(x) → V(x) → H(x).
- Premise 2: Those who donate support important causes. Formally: ∀x, D(x) → S(x).
- Premise 3 (resource constraint): Citizens can either volunteer or they do not support important causes through donations. Formally: ∀x, C(x) → (V(x) ∨ ¬S(x)).
- Assume Luis is a citizen: C(Luis).
- From Premise 3 and C(Luis), we get V(Luis) ∨ ¬S(Luis).
  - Case 1: V(Luis). Then by Premise 1 and C(Luis), we get H(Luis). So V(Luis) ∧ H(Luis) holds, which satisfies the desired disjunction.
  - Case 2: ¬S(Luis). By Premise 2, D(Luis) → S(Luis). Using modus tollens, from ¬S(Luis) we infer ¬D(Luis). So the right disjunct holds.
- Therefore, (V(Luis) ∧ H(Luis)) ∨ ¬D(Luis) holds. In words: Luis either helps those in need by volunteering or does not donate to charity organizations.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Citizen : Person → Prop
axiom Volunteer : Person → Prop
axiom Helps : Person → Prop
axiom Donates : Person → Prop
axiom SupportsImportantCausesViaDonations : Person → Prop

-- Citizens who volunteer help those in need
axiom volunteer_help :

-- Those who donate support important causes (through donations)
axiom donate_support :
  ∀ x : Person, Donates x → SupportsImportantCausesViaDonations x

-- Resource constraint: a citizen either volunteers or does not support important causes through donations

-- Luis is a particular citizen

-- Conclusion: Luis either helps those in need by volunteering or does not donate
