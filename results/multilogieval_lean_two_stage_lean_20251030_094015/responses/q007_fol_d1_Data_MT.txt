Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: MT

Context:
If someone has good time management skills, they can often accomplish more in less time. Amy does not accomplish more in less time.

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Let G(x) mean “x has good time management skills.”
- Let M(x) mean “x accomplishes more in less time.”

Premise 1 (universal implication): For all persons x, if G(x) then M(x). This is from “If someone has good time management skills, they can often accomplish more in less time.”
Premise 2: ¬M(Amy). This is from “Amy does not accomplish more in less time.”

To determine whether G(Amy) holds:
- Assume for contradiction that G(Amy).
- By universal instantiation on Premise 1 with x = Amy, we get G(Amy) → M(Amy).
- By modus ponens from G(Amy), we obtain M(Amy).
- This contradicts Premise 2 (¬M(Amy)).
Therefore, by modus tollens (or proof by contradiction), ¬G(Amy).

Conclusion: Amy does not have good time management skills.

STAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and proof
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Amy : Person

axiom GoodTM : Person → Prop          -- has good time management skills
axiom MoreInLess : Person → Prop      -- accomplishes more in less time

-- If someone has good time management skills, they accomplish more in less time
axiom premise1 : ∀ x : Person, GoodTM x → MoreInLess x

-- Amy does not accomplish more in less time
axiom premise2 : ¬ MoreInLess Amy

-- Therefore, Amy does not have good time management skills (modus tollens)
theorem not_GoodTM_Amy : ¬ GoodTM Amy := by
  intro hGood
  have hMore : MoreInLess Amy := premise1 Amy hGood
  exact premise2 hMore
</lean>

ANSWER: No
