Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: MT

Context:
If someone practices a musical instrument regularly, they will likely become skilled at playing it. Emily has not become skilled at playing the piano.

Question:
Does Emily practice the piano regularly?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

- Let Practice(x, i) mean “x practices instrument i regularly.”
- Let Skilled(x, i) mean “x has become skilled at instrument i.”
- Let LikelySkilled(x, i) mean “x will likely become skilled at instrument i.”

Premise: For any person and instrument, if the person practices the instrument regularly, then they will likely become skilled at it. Formally: Practice(x, i) → LikelySkilled(x, i).

Fact: Emily has not become skilled at playing the piano. Formally: ¬Skilled(Emily, Piano).

The conditional uses “likely,” which does not entail certainty. Therefore, Practice(x, i) → LikelySkilled(x, i) does not allow us to take the contrapositive to conclude ¬Practice from ¬Skilled, because LikelySkilled is weaker than Skilled. Consequently, ¬Skilled(Emily, Piano) does not imply ¬Practice(Emily, Piano).

Moreover, assuming Practice(Emily, Piano) only yields LikelySkilled(Emily, Piano), which can be consistent with ¬Skilled(Emily, Piano) since “likely” does not guarantee “is.” Thus, the information is insufficient to determine whether Emily practices the piano regularly.

Conclusion: It cannot be determined from the premises whether Emily practices the piano regularly.

STAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and proof

axiom Person : Type
axiom Instrument : Type

axiom Emily : Person
axiom Piano : Instrument

-- Predicates
axiom PracticesRegularly : Person → Instrument → Prop
axiom SkilledAt : Person → Instrument → Prop
axiom LikelySkilledAt : Person → Instrument → Prop

-- Premises:
-- 1) If someone practices an instrument regularly, they will likely become skilled at it.
axiom practice_implies_likely_skilled :

-- 2) Emily has not become skilled at playing the piano.
axiom emily_not_skilled_piano : ¬ SkilledAt Emily Piano

-- A theorem capturing the logical point: assuming Emily practices regularly
-- is consistent with the premises (it yields "likely skilled" together with "not skilled").
