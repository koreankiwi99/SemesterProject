Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: DS

Context:
When attending a formal event, some dress in formal attire while others opt for casual wear. However, one person finds that their formal wear is not ready in time.

Question:
Does it entail that for Mary, who had the option to dress formally or casually, she wears casual attire to the event?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

- The sentence “some dress in formal attire while others opt for casual wear” only guarantees that at least one person dresses formally and at least one person dresses casually. It does not specify who does which.
- The sentence “one person finds that their formal wear is not ready in time” introduces an existential claim about at least one individual, but it does not identify that individual as Mary.
- Even if Mary had the option to dress formally or casually, that does not determine which option she actually chose.
- Therefore, it does not logically follow (is not entailed) that Mary wears casual. A counterexample: Mary dresses formally, Alex dresses casually, and Alex is the one whose formal wear isn’t ready. All premises are satisfied, but Mary is not wearing casual.

STAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and proof

We encode a concrete model witnessing the premises and falsifying the conclusion that Mary wears casual.
