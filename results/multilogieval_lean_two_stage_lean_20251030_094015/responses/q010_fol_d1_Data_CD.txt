Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d1 (d1_Data)
Rule: CD

Context:
In academics, studying a topic in depth leads to expertise and authority on that subject. On the other hand, learning broadly exposes someone to diverse ideas and perspectives. However, students may opt to either study a single topic in depth or learn broadly across disciplines.

Question:
Does this entail that for Sarah, a dedicated student, either she gains expertise on a single topic or is exposed to diverse perspectives?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

- Let Sd(x) mean “x studies a single topic in depth” and E(x) mean “x gains expertise and authority.”
  Premise: ∀x, Sd(x) → E(x).

- Let Br(x) mean “x learns broadly” and D(x) mean “x is exposed to diverse ideas and perspectives.”
  Premise: ∀x, Br(x) → D(x).

- The third statement says students may opt to either Sd or Br. “May opt” expresses permission/possibility, not that they actually do one. So we cannot infer Sd(Sarah) ∨ Br(Sarah) for Sarah from this; it only says those options are available.

- From the first two premises, E(Sarah) follows only if Sd(Sarah), and D(Sarah) follows only if Br(Sarah). Since we have no premise that Sarah actually does Sd or Br, we cannot conclude E(Sarah) ∨ D(Sarah).

- To see non-entailment, consider a counter-scenario consistent with the premises: Sarah has the option to study in depth or broadly (permission holds), but she hasn’t done either yet; moreover, she currently has neither expertise nor diverse exposure. This does not violate the implications (which are one-way) and respects the “may opt” premise. In this scenario, the conclusion E(Sarah) ∨ D(Sarah) is false. Hence the conclusion is not entailed.

STAGE 2: Lean 4 translation and proof attempt

We encode the premises as implications and the “may opt” as availability of both options. To witness non-entailment, we add facts that Sarah has neither expertise nor diverse exposure; these are consistent with the premises and allow us to prove the negation of the queried conclusion.
