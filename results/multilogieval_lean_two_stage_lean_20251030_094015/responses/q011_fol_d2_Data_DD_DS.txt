Context:
If someone takes their car for an oil change, it runs smoothly. Also, if someone washes their car, it looks shiny and clean. However, this month someone either had a car that was not running smoothly or did not look clean, or both.

Question:
Tyler took his car for an oil change. Is it true that he washed his car?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

- Let the domain be people and let:
  - OilChange(x): x took their car for an oil change.
  - RunsSmoothly(x): x’s car runs smoothly.
  - Washed(x): x washed their car.
  - Clean(x): x’s car looks clean.
  - Shiny(x): x’s car looks shiny.

- Premises:
  1) For all x, if OilChange(x), then RunsSmoothly(x).
  2) For all x, if Washed(x), then Shiny(x) and Clean(x). In particular, Washed(x) → Clean(x).
  3) This month, Tyler either did not have a car running smoothly or did not look clean: ¬RunsSmoothly(Tyler) ∨ ¬Clean(Tyler).
  4) Tyler took his car for an oil change: OilChange(Tyler).

- From (4) and (1), we get RunsSmoothly(Tyler).
- Using (3) and RunsSmoothly(Tyler), the disjunction forces the other disjunct: ¬Clean(Tyler).
- From (2), Washed(Tyler) → Clean(Tyler). Taking the contrapositive, ¬Clean(Tyler) → ¬Washed(Tyler).
- Therefore, ¬Washed(Tyler). Hence it is not true that he washed his car.
