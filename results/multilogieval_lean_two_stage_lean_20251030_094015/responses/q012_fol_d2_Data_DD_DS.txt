Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Rule: DD_DS

Context:
When people drive safely, they avoid accidents. Also, if people follow directions, they don't get lost. But either someone did not avoid an accident or someone got lost, or both.

Question:
Jane drove safely. Is it true that she followed directions?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

- Let Persons be the domain, with predicates:
  - DrivesSafely(x): x drives safely
  - AvoidsAccident(x): x avoids accidents
  - FollowsDirections(x): x follows directions
  - GetsLost(x): x gets lost

- Premises:
  1) ∀x, DrivesSafely(x) → AvoidsAccident(x).
  2) ∀x, FollowsDirections(x) → ¬GetsLost(x).
  3) (∃x, ¬AvoidsAccident(x)) ∨ (∃x, GetsLost(x)).
  4) DrivesSafely(Jane).

- Deductions:
  - From (1) and (4), Jane avoids accidents: AvoidsAccident(Jane).
  - From (2), by a simple reasoning step (no classical axioms needed), if someone gets lost then they did not follow directions: GetsLost(x) → ¬FollowsDirections(x). Proof idea: if FollowsDirections(x) held while GetsLost(x) holds, (2) would yield ¬GetsLost(x), a contradiction.
  - Premise (3) only says something bad happened to someone (either a non-avoided accident or getting lost). It does not specify Jane. Therefore, (3) gives no information about whether Jane followed directions.
  - In particular, there is a scenario consistent with all premises in which the right disjunct of (3) holds with witness Jane (i.e., GetsLost(Jane)). In that scenario, by the previous point, ¬FollowsDirections(Jane). Hence, it is not logically entailed that Jane followed directions.

Conclusion: We cannot conclude that Jane followed directions; it is not necessarily true. So the answer to the question “Is it true that she followed directions?” is No.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Jane : Person

axiom DrivesSafely : Person → Prop
axiom AvoidsAccident : Person → Prop
axiom FollowsDirections : Person → Prop
axiom GetsLost : Person → Prop

-- Premises
axiom safe_implies_avoid : ∀ x : Person, DrivesSafely x → AvoidsAccident x
axiom follow_implies_not_lost : ∀ x : Person, FollowsDirections x → ¬ GetsLost x
axiom either_bad : (∃ x : Person, ¬ AvoidsAccident x) ∨ (∃ x : Person, GetsLost x)
axiom jane_safe : DrivesSafely Jane

-- What we can derive: Jane avoided an accident.
theorem jane_avoids : AvoidsAccident Jane := by
  exact safe_implies_avoid Jane jane_safe

-- From "following directions implies not lost", we can deduce that
-- if someone is lost, then they did not follow directions.
theorem lost_implies_not_follow (x : Person) : GetsLost x → ¬ FollowsDirections x := by
