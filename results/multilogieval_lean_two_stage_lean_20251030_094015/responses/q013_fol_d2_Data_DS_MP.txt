Context:
In a community garden, if someone plants vegetables early in the season, they harvest a large crop. However, it is not certain if the soil is fertile. People are sure that either the vegetables are planted early, or the soil is fertile, or both.

Question:
Mia's soil was not fertile. Does this mean Mia harvested a large crop?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Reasoning

Let E be “Mia planted vegetables early,” F be “Mia’s soil is fertile,” and L be “Mia harvested a large crop.”

Premises:
- If E then L. (Conditional: E → L)
- E or F. (Disjunction: E ∨ F)
- Not F. (Negation: ¬F, since Mia’s soil was not fertile)

From E ∨ F and ¬F, by disjunctive syllogism, we infer E.
From E and E → L, by modus ponens, we infer L.

Therefore, Mia harvested a large crop.

STAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and proof
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Mia : Person

axiom Early : Person → Prop
axiom Fertile : Person → Prop
axiom LargeCrop : Person → Prop

axiom early_implies_large : ∀ p : Person, Early p → LargeCrop p
axiom early_or_fertile_Mia : Early Mia ∨ Fertile Mia
axiom not_fertile_Mia : ¬ Fertile Mia

theorem Mia_harvested_large : LargeCrop Mia := by
  cases early_or_fertile_Mia with
  | inl hE =>
      exact early_implies_large Mia hE
  | inr hF =>
      exact False.elim (not_fertile_Mia hF)
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes
