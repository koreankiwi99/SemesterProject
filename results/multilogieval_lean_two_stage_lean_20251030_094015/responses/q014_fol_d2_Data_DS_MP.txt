Context:
In a sailing club, if someone maintains their boat well, they win races. However, it is not certain if the weather conditions are favorable. Either the boat is maintained well, or the weather conditions are favorable, or both.

Question:
Olivia's weather conditions were not favorable. Does this mean Olivia won her race?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

- Let M(x) mean “x maintains their boat well,” W(x) mean “x’s weather conditions are favorable,” and R(x) mean “x wins their race.”
- Premise 1: For any person x, if M(x) then R(x). (Universal instantiation and Modus Ponens will apply.)
- Premise 2 (inclusive or): For Olivia, M(Olivia) ∨ W(Olivia).
- Premise 3: Not W(Olivia) (Olivia’s weather conditions were not favorable).

From Premise 2 and Premise 3:
- By case analysis on M(Olivia) ∨ W(Olivia):
  - If M(Olivia), then by Premise 1, R(Olivia) (Modus Ponens).
  - If W(Olivia), this contradicts ¬W(Olivia); from a contradiction we can derive anything, in particular R(Olivia) (ex falso).
Hence, in all cases, R(Olivia). Therefore, yes, Olivia won her race.

STAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and proof

<lean>
axiom Person : Type

axiom Maintains : Person → Prop
axiom Favorable : Person → Prop
axiom Wins : Person → Prop

axiom Maintains_implies_Wins : ∀ x : Person, Maintains x → Wins x

axiom Olivia : Person

-- Either Olivia maintains her boat well or her weather is favorable (inclusive or)
axiom disj : Maintains Olivia ∨ Favorable Olivia

-- Olivia's weather conditions were not favorable
axiom not_fav : ¬ Favorable Olivia

theorem Olivia_wins : Wins Olivia := by
  -- First deduce that Olivia maintains her boat well
  have hM : Maintains Olivia := by
    cases disj with
    | inl m => exact m
    | inr fav =>
        exact False.elim (not_fav fav)
  -- Then conclude she wins by Modus Ponens
  exact Maintains_implies_Wins Olivia hM
