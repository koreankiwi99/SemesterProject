Context:
Someone wanted to renovate their kitchen. They realized that if they did a complete remodel, they would have a beautiful new kitchen; if they just replaced the countertops and backsplash, they would update the look. They could either do a complete remodel or just replace the countertops and backsplash.

Question:
Given that Ryan did not have a beautiful new kitchen, is it true that Ryan updated the look?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

Let:
- R = Ryan did a complete remodel.
- C = Ryan replaced the countertops and backsplash.
- B = Ryan has a beautiful new kitchen.
- U = Ryan updated the look.

Premises:
1) R → B (If complete remodel, then beautiful new kitchen.)
2) C → U (If replaced countertops/backsplash, then updated look.)
3) R ∨ C (He did either a complete remodel or just replaced countertops/backsplash.)
4) ¬B (Ryan did not have a beautiful new kitchen.)

Steps:
- From (1) and (4), by modus tollens, ¬R.
- From (3) and ¬R, by disjunctive syllogism, C.
- From (2) and C, by modus ponens, U.

Conclusion: Yes, Ryan updated the look.
