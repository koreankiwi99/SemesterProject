Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification
================================================================================

Logic Type: fol
Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: BD_DS

Context:
A chef thought that if they used fresh ingredients, their dishes would taste delicious. And if they followed traditional recipes, diners would appreciate the authentic flavors. However, the chef could either use fresh ingredients or make inauthentic dishes.

Question:
The patron's meal lacked flavor. Did the chef follow traditional recipes?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

Let:
- F = the chef used fresh ingredients
- D = the dishes tasted delicious
- T = the chef followed traditional recipes
- A = the dishes were authentic

Premises:
1) F → D (If fresh ingredients are used, dishes are delicious.)
2) T → A (If traditional recipes are followed, the dishes are authentic.)
3) F ∨ ¬A (Either fresh ingredients were used or the dishes were inauthentic.)
Observation: ¬D (The patron's meal lacked flavor, i.e., not delicious.)

Steps:
- From F → D and ¬D, by modus tollens, infer ¬F.
- From F ∨ ¬A and ¬F, by disjunctive syllogism, infer ¬A.
- From T → A and ¬A, by modus tollens, infer ¬T.

Conclusion: The chef did not follow traditional recipes.
