Context:
An aspiring musician decided to try writing their own songs. They realized that if they composed original music, their work would be unique; if they promoted their music online, they would gain a following. The musician could write original songs or promote their music online.

Question:
Given that Maria's music was not unique, is it true that she gained a following online?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Reasoning in natural language

Let:
- O = Maria composed original music.
- U = Maria’s work was unique.
- P = Maria promoted her music online.
- F = Maria gained a following.

Premises:
1) O → U (If she composed original music, then her work would be unique.)
2) P → F (If she promoted her music online, then she would gain a following.)
3) O ∨ P (She could write original songs or promote her music online.)
Given: ¬U (Maria’s music was not unique.)

Steps:
- From O → U and ¬U, by modus tollens we get ¬O (if O held, U would hold, contradicting ¬U).
- From O ∨ P and ¬O, by disjunctive syllogism we get P.
- From P and P → F, by modus ponens we get F.

Therefore, yes, she gained a following.
