Rule: DS_MP

Context:
In a photography club, if someone uses a professional camera, they take stunning photos. However, it's not certain if the lighting conditions are ideal. People are sure that either the camera is professional, or the lighting is ideal, or both.

Question:
Kiera's lighting conditions were not ideal. Does this mean Kiera took stunning photos?

--- Iteration 1 ---

LLM Response:
STAGE 1 (Reasoning in natural language):
- Let P mean “Kiera uses a professional camera,” L mean “Kiera’s lighting is ideal,” and S mean “Kiera takes stunning photos.”
- Premises:
  1) If someone uses a professional camera, they take stunning photos: P → S (instantiated for Kiera).
  2) Either the camera is professional or the lighting is ideal: P ∨ L (for Kiera).
  3) Kiera’s lighting was not ideal: ¬L.
- From P ∨ L and ¬L, by disjunctive syllogism, infer P.
- From P and P → S, by modus ponens, infer S.
Conclusion: Yes, Kiera took stunning photos.

STAGE 2 (Lean 4 translation and proof):
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Kiera : Person

axiom UsesProCam : Person → Prop
axiom IdealLight : Person → Prop
axiom Stunning : Person → Prop

-- Premise 1: Anyone who uses a professional camera takes stunning photos.
axiom pro_implies_stunning : ∀ x : Person, UsesProCam x → Stunning x

-- Premise 2 (for Kiera): Either Kiera used a professional camera or her lighting was ideal.
axiom disj_Kiera : UsesProCam Kiera ∨ IdealLight Kiera

-- Premise 3: Kiera's lighting was not ideal.
axiom not_ideal_Kiera : ¬ IdealLight Kiera

theorem Kiera_took_stunning_photos : Stunning Kiera := by
  -- From P ∨ L and ¬L, deduce P (disjunctive syllogism)
