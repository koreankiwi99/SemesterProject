Multi-LogiEval Question with Lean Verification

Depth: d2 (d2_Data)
Rule: HS_MT

Context:
A band wanted to gain a larger fanbase. They knew that if they toured extensively, more people would be exposed to their music. Also, if more people heard their songs, ticket sales for their shows would increase.

Question:
If the band does not see an increase in ticket sales, do they tour extensively?

LLM Response:
STAGE 1: Natural language reasoning

- Let T be "the band toured extensively", E be "more people were exposed to/heard their music", and S be "ticket sales increased."
- Premises:
  1) T → E (if they toured extensively, more people were exposed to their music).
  2) E → S (if more people heard their songs, ticket sales would increase).
- By hypothetical syllogism from (1) and (2), we get T → S.
- Given not S (no increase in ticket sales), apply modus tollens to T → S to conclude not T.
- Therefore, if the band does not see an increase in ticket sales, they did not tour extensively.

STAGE 2: Lean 4 formalization and proof

<lean>
axiom Tour : Prop
axiom MoreExposure : Prop
axiom TicketSalesIncrease : Prop

axiom tour_implies_exposure : Tour → MoreExposure
axiom exposure_implies_sales : MoreExposure → TicketSalesIncrease

theorem no_sales_implies_no_tour : ¬ TicketSalesIncrease → ¬ Tour := by
  intro ns
  intro t
  have e : MoreExposure := tour_implies_exposure t
  have s : TicketSalesIncrease := exposure_implies_sales e
  exact ns s

theorem tour_implies_sales : Tour → TicketSalesIncrease := by
  intro t
  exact exposure_implies_sales (tour_implies_exposure t)
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes

Extracted Lean Code:
----------------------------------------
