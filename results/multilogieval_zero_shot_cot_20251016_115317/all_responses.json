From the context: practicing (P) implies being able to compose an album (A). Jamming (J) implies inspiration (I), which implies creativity flourished (F); thus J -> F.\n2. We know P or J (or both) occurred.\n3. Not releasing an album does not negate P or J; \u201ccould compose\u201d does not imply \u201cdid release,\u201d and \u201crelease\u201d is not linked to J or F.\n4. If J occurred, then F.

Also set Tea not steeped (so as not to force sweetening) and Hot Chocolate not sweetenable (so the implication to Tea steeped is vacuously true). All rules hold, yet Tea is not sweetenable.\n- Therefore, the implication \u201cif Hot Chocolate is not aromatic then Tea can be sweetened\u201d is not entailed.\nAnswer: No",

He knows that if it's Friday, his schedule is clear after work.\nQuestion: If the car has gas in the tank, is it Friday?\nReasoning steps:\n1) If it's Friday, then schedule is clear; if schedule is clear, he meets friends. So Friday implies meeting.\n2) Either he won\u2019t drive or he won\u2019t meet; thus if he meets, he does not drive.\n3) If the car has gas, he drives to work.\n4) Suppose the car has gas and it is Friday. Then he meets (step 1), so he does not drive (step 2), but having gas means he drives (step 3). Contradiction. Therefore, if the car has gas, it is not Friday.\nAnswer: No",

Jim knows if his vegetables grow big and healthy, he can use the fresh chilis to make homemade chili sauce. Whenever Jim makes homemade chili sauce, his family really enjoys pouring the spicy sauce on dinner.\nQuestion: If it is chili season, then does Jim's family enjoy homemade chili sauce on dinner?\nReasoning steps:\n1) If chili season (S), then Jim picks fresh chilis (P): S -> P.\n2) Either Jim waters daily (W) or not pick chilis (\u00acP): W \u2228 \u00acP. Given S -> P, under S we have P, so \u00acP is false; hence W must be true under S: S -> W.\n3) If W, then vegetables grow big and healthy (G): W -> G, thus S -> G.\n4) If G, then Jim makes homemade chili sauce (M) from fresh chilis: G -> M.\n5) Whenever M, Jim\u2019s family enjoys the sauce on dinner (E): M -> E.\n6) Therefore, S -> E. So if it is chili season, Jim\u2019s family enjoys homemade chili sauce on dinner.\nAnswer: yes",
