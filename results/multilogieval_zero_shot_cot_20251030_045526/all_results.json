If someone travels to a country where that language is spoken, then they will communicate more effectively with locals. Either someone learns a new language, or they do not communicate more effectively with locals, or someone learned a new language, and they did not communicate more effectively with locals. If someone opens up new cultural experiences, then they become more culturally aware.\nQuestion: Taylor travels to a country where the new language is spoken, can we say that she becomes more culturally aware?\nReasoning steps: [1. From traveling where the language is spoken, Taylor communicates more effectively with locals. 2. The disjunction simplifies to C -> L; since Taylor communicates more effectively, she learned the new language. 3. If someone learns a new language, they open up new cultural experiences; thus Taylor opens up new cultural experiences. 4. If someone opens up new cultural experiences, they become more culturally aware; thus Taylor becomes more culturally aware.]\nAnswer: yes",

Also, if the professor cancels a class, John uses the free time to relax and watch TV. It seems either John will study hard or get a free period, perhaps both. If John gets good grades on the assignments, then he will be well prepared for the exams. And if John is well prepared for the exams, he will perform well in the course overall.\nQuestion: If John did not relax and watch TV, then did he perform well in the course?\nReasoning steps:\n1. Let S = studies hard, G = good grades, P = well prepared, W = performs well, C = class canceled/free period, R = relax and watch TV.\n2. Premises: S -> G; G -> P; P -> W; therefore S -> W. Also C -> R and S \u2228 C.\n3. Assume \u00acR. From C -> R, contrapositive gives \u00acR -> \u00acC, so \u00acC.\n4. From S \u2228 C and \u00acC, infer S (disjunctive syllogism).\n5. From S -> W and S, infer W.\n6. Therefore \u00acR -> W.\nAnswer: Yes",
