John did not bring treats, so we cannot conclude it was a birthday; plausibly not a birthday.\n- From \u201ceither projects get done early or it\u2019s a birthday,\u201d not-birthday implies projects got done early (by someone).\n- \u201cIf someone finishes early, they can take a long lunch\u201d grants permission, not necessity; it does not entail that John took a long lunch.\n- Only taking a long lunch leads to being recharged, which then leads to a very productive afternoon. We lack grounds that John took a long lunch or was recharged.\n- Therefore, we cannot deduce that John had a very productive afternoon.\nAnswer: No",

    "full_response": "Context: Jessica aims to finish all her homework before she relaxes at night. She knows that if she finishes her homework, she'll have time to relax before bed. If her friend calls, Jessica will likely talk with her for an hour or more. Either Jessica finished her homework, or she didn't talk with her friend for an hour. Jessica realizes that if she relaxes before bed, she'll feel tired when it's time to sleep. And if she feels tired, she'll fall asleep quickly once she's in bed.\nQuestion: If Jessica's friend calls her on the phone, then does Jessica fall asleep quickly when she goes to bed?\nReasoning steps: [Assume a call occurs \u21d2 she talks \u22651 hour. Given (finished homework) \u2228 (didn\u2019t talk \u22651 hour), talking implies she must have finished homework. Finished homework \u21d2 relaxes; relaxes \u21d2 tired; tired \u21d2 falls asleep quickly. Therefore, call \u21d2 falls asleep quickly.]\nAnswer: Yes",
