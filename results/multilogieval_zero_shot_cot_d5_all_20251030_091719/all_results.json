John did not bring treats, so we cannot conclude it was a birthday; plausibly not a birthday.\n- From \u201ceither projects get done early or it\u2019s a birthday,\u201d not-birthday implies projects got done early (by someone).\n- \u201cIf someone finishes early, they can take a long lunch\u201d grants permission, not necessity; it does not entail that John took a long lunch.\n- Only taking a long lunch leads to being recharged, which then leads to a very productive afternoon. We lack grounds that John took a long lunch or was recharged.\n- Therefore, we cannot deduce that John had a very productive afternoon.\nAnswer: No",
