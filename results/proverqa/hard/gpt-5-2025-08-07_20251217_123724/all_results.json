As a successful chef who does not focus on presentation, he values quality ingredients, which implies he is passionate about cooking (since he does not pay attention to details). He has creativity and cannot make delicious desserts; using the rule (enjoys experimenting AND creativity) -> can make desserts and its contrapositive, he does not enjoy experimenting, so he creates unique recipes. Regarding acclaim and titles: Cullen wins cooking awards, which would imply he is highly acclaimed, but we are also told he is not highly acclaimed, creating a contradiction. Using the contrapositive of (win awards OR earn title) -> highly acclaimed, not highly acclaimed implies he did not win awards and did not earn a reputable title, adding to the inconsistency. Crucially, nothing links being a skilled baker to owning a successful bakery, and we have no basis to conclude he earns a reputable title. Given no rule connects \u2018skilled baker\u2019 to either disjunct, we cannot determine that the exclusive-or consequent would follow from the antecedent. Nor can we show the conditional is false. Therefore, the statement is not determinable from the given information.\",\n  \"answer\": \"C\"\n}"
