{
  "reasoning": "Legend is well-trained, and since he is either well-trained or has a racing background but not both, he does not have a racing background. He has a good temperament and, given he is either fast or has a good temperament but not both, he is not fast. Since he is either a champion or fast, and not fast, he must be a champion. If he is a champion, then he has either a unique color or a distinctive marking. Legend is not competitive. From 'If strong muscles or athletic build, then competitive' and not competitive, it follows he has neither strong muscles nor an athletic build. If he had a unique color, then (by the rule tied to unique color) he would be either a large breed or have a racing background, but not both. Racing background is false, so unique color would force large breed, which implies strong muscles—contradicting the earlier conclusion that he does not have strong muscles. Therefore, he cannot have a unique color. Hence, as a champion, he must have a distinctive marking.",
