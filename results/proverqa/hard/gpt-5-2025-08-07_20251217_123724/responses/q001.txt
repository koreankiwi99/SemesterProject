Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "From 'If Jace appreciates nature then he tries new things and loves learning' and the facts that Jace does not try new things and does not love learning, Jace does not appreciate nature. From 'If appreciates nature XOR finds inner peace then enjoys moments' and not appreciating nature, if he found inner peace he would enjoy moments. But 'If enjoys moments or values experiences then live in the present' and 'Jace does not live in the present' imply Jace does not enjoy moments; hence he does not find inner peace. Given 'Jace pursues happiness or finds inner peace,' he pursues happiness. From 'If Jace pursues his passion then he either grows personally or lives a fulfilling life, but not both' and the facts that he pursues his passion and grows personally, it follows that Jace does not live a fulfilling life. Therefore, the queried statement reduces to: If Jace enjoys life, then he inspires others. We have no information that determines whether Jace enjoys life or whether he inspires others. Hence the statement cannot be determined as true or false.",
  "answer": "C"
