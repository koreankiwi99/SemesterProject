Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Izabella does not pursue excellence, and she must either pursue excellence or stay humble, so she stays humble. Because she either earns recognition or stays humble, but not both, staying humble implies she does not earn recognition. If she committed to quality, she would earn recognition; since she does not earn recognition, she does not commit to quality. Anyone who creates acclaimed wines must either commit to quality or respect tradition; Izabella does neither (she does not commit to quality and does not respect tradition), so she does not create acclaimed wines. If she studied winemaking or had viticulture experience, she would create acclaimed wines; since she does not, she must have neither. Therefore, Izabella does not study winemaking.",
