If Oaklyn either gallops freely or shows elegance (but not both), then she inspires others. All horses with refined movement have elegance. Oaklyn is not agile. If Oaklyn has discipline, then she is either agile or well-trained, but not both. Oaklyn does not have refined features. Oaklyn grows strong or matures slowly. Every horse that possesses a calm temperament either has elegance or displays grace (or both). If Oaklyn either grows tall or builds muscle (but not both), then she matures slowly.

{
  "reasoning": "Oaklyn has a gray coat, and from that she must have either refined features or a calm temperament, but not both. She does not have refined features, so she has a calm temperament. A calm temperament implies elegance or displays grace; since she does not display grace, she must have elegance. Elegance implies she inspires others. She has discipline, which implies either agility or being well-trained, but not both; since she is not agile, she is well-trained. All well-trained horses are athletic, so Oaklyn is athletic. If she is athletic, then she either wins competitions or inspires others, but not both. Since she inspires others (from elegance), she cannot also win competitions. Therefore, Oaklyn does not win competitions.",
  "answer": "A"
