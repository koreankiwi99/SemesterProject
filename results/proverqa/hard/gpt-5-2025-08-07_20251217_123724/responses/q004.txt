Question ID: 4
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Dayana has a PhD in biology. If Landen has a passion for reptiles, then he will study caimans. Landen protects endangered species. Barrett either works with local communities or ventures into remote locations, but not both. Landen does not work with local communities. Vihaan either ventures into remote locations or earns global recognition, but not both. Landen either works with local communities or ventures into remote locations, but not both. Landen has experience with wildlife rescue. If Dayana has a PhD in biology, then he either documents animal behavior or has experience with wildlife rescue, but not both. Landen either ventures into remote locations or earns global recognition, but not both. Landen has a PhD in biology. If Landen has a PhD in biology, then he either documents animal behavior or has experience with wildlife rescue, but not both. Barrett protects endangered species. Anyone who discovers new species and publishes research papers can earn global recognition. If Landen has field experience, then he either ventures into remote locations or specializes in reptile biology, but not both. If Landen studies caimans, then he can either gain the respect of the indigenous community or contribute to caiman conservation, but not both. Landen, as a wildlife explorer, either documents animal behavior or has a passion for reptiles, but not necessarily both. If Landen protects endangered species, then he can either gain the respect of the indigenous community or earn global recognition, but not both. If Landen loves animals, then he has a passion for reptiles.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Landen contributes to caiman conservation.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Landen does not work with local communities and must, by the XOR rule (works with local communities xor ventures into remote locations), venture into remote locations (VRL). From (VRL xor earns global recognition), he does not earn global recognition (¬EGR). Since he protects endangered species and (gains respect of indigenous community xor earns global recognition), with ¬EGR he must gain respect of the indigenous community (GRIC). Landen has a PhD and also has wildlife rescue experience; by the XOR (documents behavior xor wildlife rescue), he does not document behavior (¬DAB). From (documents behavior or passion for reptiles), ¬DAB implies passion for reptiles (PR), which implies he studies caimans (SC). From SC and the XOR (gain respect of indigenous community xor contribute to caiman conservation), and given GRIC is already true, he cannot contribute to caiman conservation (¬CCC). Therefore, the statement that Landen contributes to caiman conservation is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
