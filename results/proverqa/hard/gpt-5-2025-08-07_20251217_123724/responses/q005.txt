==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Lennon has feathers, so by the given rule he spreads seeds. Because Lennon either collects nectar or spreads seeds, but not both, he therefore does not collect nectar. There is no rule connecting spreading seeds or collecting nectar to pollinating flowers, nor any other premise that determines whether Lennon pollinates. Hence, whether Lennon pollinates flowers cannot be deduced from the information provided.",
  "answer": "C"
