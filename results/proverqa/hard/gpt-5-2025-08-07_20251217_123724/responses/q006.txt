Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Jimmy values integrity, so he leads his community. From 'if (conservative beliefs or values tradition) then respected' and the facts that Jimmy is not respected and does not value tradition, we infer he does not hold conservative beliefs. Given the exclusive-or 'either conservative beliefs or progressive views (but not both)', Jimmy must have progressive views. From 'supports human rights and organizes rallies -> inspire' plus 'Jimmy organizes rallies' and 'Jimmy does not inspire others', we infer he does not support human rights. From 'leads his community -> (champions environmental causes or supports human rights)', with 'not supports human rights', we deduce he champions environmental causes. Having progressive views implies he either fights for social justice or advocates for equality (or both). Nothing forces the equality branch; it is consistent that he instead fights for social justice. Therefore, whether he advocates for equality cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
