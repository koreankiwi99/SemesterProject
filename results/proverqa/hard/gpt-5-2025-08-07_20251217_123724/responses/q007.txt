==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Wyatt values accuracy or is a perfectionist' and 'Wyatt does not value accuracy', Wyatt is a perfectionist. From 'Wyatt strives for precision' he considers details; and anyone who considers details thinks carefully, so he thinks carefully. 'Wyatt does not follow rules' and 'Wyatt either follows rules or is spontaneous' implies he is spontaneous. If spontaneous, he is either impulsive or thinks carefully (but not both); since he thinks carefully, he is not impulsive. The only rule about being careless is 'If Wyatt acts on instinct, then he is careless', but we have no information that he acts on instinct. Therefore, whether Wyatt is careless is undetermined. The statement 'Wyatt is either a perfectionist or careless, but not both' depends on whether he is careless, which is unknown. Hence, the truth of the statement is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
