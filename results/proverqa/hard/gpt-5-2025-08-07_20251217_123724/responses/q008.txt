==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From keen insight, Vincent analyzes data. Since he investigates crime and the rule is an exclusive-or between examining evidence and analyzing data, he does not examine evidence. Given the disjunction that he either examines evidence or thinks critically, he must think critically. He did not find justice; with the rule that uncovering the truth implies finding justice, he did not uncover the truth. The rule that solving complex cases and thinking critically implies uncovering the truth then means he cannot both solve complex cases and think critically; since he does think critically, he does not solve complex cases. If he had expertise, he would solve complex cases, so he does not have expertise. There is no rule linking ‘skilled’ to expertise, solving complex cases, or any other stated property. Therefore, whether Vincent is not skilled cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
