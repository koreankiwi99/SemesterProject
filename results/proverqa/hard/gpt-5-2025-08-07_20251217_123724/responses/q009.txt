{
  "reasoning": "From reliability, David works well under pressure and has good judgment. Given the exclusive-or with thinking critically, David does not think critically. With experience, and since he doesn't think critically, he responds effectively in high-pressure situations. He works behind the scene, so he does not assist people; thus, by disjunction, he provides quality care. None of the given rules link working well under pressure, good judgment, or responding effectively to either remaining calm or acting quickly in emergencies. Also, while everyone either stays focused or handles emergencies, there is no rule connecting those properties to remaining calm or acting quickly for David. Therefore, we cannot determine whether David remains calm or acts quickly in emergencies.",
