Question ID: 11
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Dr. Marlon reads often. Dr. Marlon follows his experience or trusts his instinct. Dr. Marlon does not follow his experience. Dr. Marlon is not analytical. If Dr. Marlon either learns quickly or has good memory, then he is analytical. If Dr. Marlon has good memory, then he is either rational or intuitive, but not both. Dr. Marlon learns quickly if he reads often. If Dr. Marlon values insight, then he both listens carefully and trusts his instinct. Anyone who trusts their instinct is intuitive. Everyone is rational or emotional (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Marlon's patients are emotional.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From the premises: Dr. Marlon does not follow his experience but must trust his instinct, so he is intuitive. He reads often, so he learns quickly, which would make him analytical, contradicting the given 'not analytical'—but this inconsistency concerns only him, not his patients. There is no information about his patients specifically. The only relevant universal states everyone is rational or emotional (or both), which does not entail that his patients are emotional in particular. Thus, we cannot determine whether his patients are emotional.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
