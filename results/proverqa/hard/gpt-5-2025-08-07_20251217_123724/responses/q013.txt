Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "Aubree explores questions and seeks answers, so she has curiosity. With curiosity and a pragmatic approach, she is not a philosophical thinker. Given she is either a philosophical thinker or an astrophysicist (but not both), she must be an astrophysicist. As an astrophysicist, she is either a logical analyzer or an outside-the-box thinker (but not both); since she is a logical analyzer, she is not outside-the-box. From being either outside-the-box or a conventional thinker, and not outside-the-box, she is a conventional thinker. She follows established rules or is unconventional (but not both); since she follows rules, she is not unconventional. Thus she is conventional and not unconventional, satisfying the condition that she is either a conventional or an unconventional thinker (but not both), which implies she is innovative. Therefore, Aubree is innovative.",
