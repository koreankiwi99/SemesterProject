Question ID: 14
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Makai either collects data or conducts laboratory tests. Soldier can solve complex problems. If Makai can solve complex problems, then he will pursue innovative research and study brain function. Makai does not read scientific papers. If Makai either reads scientific papers or explores new theories (but not both), then he pursues innovative research. If someone works in a lab, then they conduct laboratory tests. If Matias analyzes molecules or conducts laboratory tests, then he is a biochemist. If Makai is a biochemist, then he either modulates adenosine receptors or studies brain function, but not both. Makai does not collect data. If Makai analyzes molecules or conducts laboratory tests, then he is a biochemist. Matias does not read scientific papers. Makai analyzes molecules. Makai can solve complex problems. If Soldier either reads scientific papers or explores new theories (but not both), then he pursues innovative research. Lilly analyzes molecules. Makai explores new theories. If Makai pursues medical breakthroughs, then he either modulates adenosine receptors or develops new treatments (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Makai can regulate sleep patterns.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Makai does not collect data, and he either collects data or conducts lab tests, so he conducts lab tests. Analyzing molecules or conducting lab tests makes him a biochemist; thus he is a biochemist. Since he can solve complex problems, he studies brain function. For a biochemist, he either modulates adenosine receptors or studies brain function, but not both; therefore, he does not modulate adenosine receptors. There is no given rule linking studying brain function or innovative research to regulating sleep patterns, nor any rule linking the absence of adenosine modulation to not being able to regulate sleep patterns. Hence, whether Makai can regulate sleep patterns cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
