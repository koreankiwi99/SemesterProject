Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Marlowe works hard, so he is ambitious. He thinks creatively and, by the XOR with disciplined, he is not disciplined. With momentum, he must be either disciplined or set high goals (but not both); since he is not disciplined, he sets high goals. From \"If Marlowe is ambitious and pursues alternate credentials, then he will earn recognition\" and the fact that Marlowe does not earn recognition, it follows that he does not pursue alternate credentials. Given \"If Marlowe does not have a PhD, then he will pursue alternate credentials,\" by contrapositive, not pursuing alternate credentials implies Marlowe has a PhD. Therefore, the statement \"Marlowe does not have a PhD\" is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
