==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Anne is an expert and does not lead a project, so from the expert rule (PhD xor lead), she must have a PhD. With a PhD and not teaching at a university, she must be an archaeologist. As an archaeologist, she either pursues historical research or explores lost civilizations (but not both). Exploring lost civilizations would imply contributing to her field, but she does not contribute, so she must pursue historical research. Pursuing historical research implies she studies ancient mythology, and everyone who studies ancient mythology gains a deeper understanding. Therefore, Anne gains a deeper understanding of the subject.",
  "answer": "A"
}
