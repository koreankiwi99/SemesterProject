Question ID: 17
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Selah has thecodont teeth, then she is a formidable predator. Selah has a serpent body. If Selah has wings and a serpent body, then she can rule the ocean. If Selah rules the ocean, then she either has sharp claws or thecodont teeth, but not both. For Selah, if she respects nature, then she does not necessarily possess ancient magic, and if she possesses ancient magic, then she does not necessarily respect nature. Selah has a powerful tail. Selah respects nature. Emelia respects nature. Kelly has a serpent body. Kali maintains ecological balance. Selah maintains ecological balance. Any mythical creature that protects the environment is a mythical guardian. If Emelia is a mythical guardian, then she either has sharp claws or a powerful tail, but not both. If Selah maintains ecological balance, then she either is a mythical guardian or possesses ancient magic (or both). Selah has wings. If Selah is a mythical guardian, then she either has sharp claws or a powerful tail, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Selah is not a formidable predator.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Selah has wings and a serpent body, so she rules the ocean. Ruling the ocean implies exactly one of: sharp claws or thecodont teeth. She also has a powerful tail. If Selah is a mythical guardian, then (sharp claws XOR powerful tail); since she has a powerful tail, that would force not sharp claws, hence thecodont teeth, which would make her a formidable predator. However, from maintaining ecological balance we only know she is either a mythical guardian or has ancient magic (or both); we cannot conclude she is a mythical guardian. If she is not a mythical guardian, she could have sharp claws (and not thecodont teeth), so we cannot conclude she is a formidable predator. Therefore, whether she is a formidable predator is undetermined, making the statement \"Selah is not a formidable predator\" uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
