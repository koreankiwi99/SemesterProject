Question ID: 18
Difficulty: hard

Context:
For all frogs, they either hunt at night or need high humidity, but not necessarily both. Every frog either survives in water or has adapted to its environment. If Cairo lives in a rainforest, then he either has adapted to his environment or thrives in his ecosystem, but not both. Cairo basks in sunlight. Any frog that needs high humidity or lives among plants can live in a rainforest. Cairo either basks in sunlight or survives in water, but not both. Cairo rests during the day. Every frog either rests during the day or hunts at night, but not necessarily both. Cairo does not live among plants. If Cairo either breathes moist air or has permeable skin (but not both), then he needs high humidity.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cairo thrives in his ecosystem.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Cairo basks in sunlight, and by the XOR with surviving in water, he does not survive in water. Since every frog either survives in water or has adapted, Cairo has adapted to his environment. If he lives in a rainforest, then (Adapted XOR Thrives) holds; with Adapted true, that would force Thrives false. But we cannot conclude he lives in a rainforest: he does not live among plants, and from the rule that every frog either hunts at night or needs high humidity, we cannot determine that he needs high humidity (he might instead hunt at night). Therefore, whether Cairo thrives cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
