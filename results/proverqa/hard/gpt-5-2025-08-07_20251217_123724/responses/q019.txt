Question ID: 19
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Anyone who explores the world either seeks wisdom or pursues knowledge (or both). Stone does not understand the world. If someone values serenity and finds inner peace, then they can live in harmony. If Stone pursues knowledge, then he understands the world. Stone is spiritual or adventurous (or both). Stone either conserves resources or advances technology, but not both. Stone does not appreciate beauty. If Stone practices mindfulness, then he either seeks balance or values serenity, but not both. Stone seeks balance or lives in harmony. Everyone who respects the environment either conserves resources or protects wildlife (or both). For Stone, valuing serenity and pursuing knowledge are mutually exclusive. Anyone who loves nature and is spiritual can find inner peace. Everyone who either lives in harmony or appreciates beauty is someone who respects their environment. Stone loves nature. Stone does not protect wildlife. Stone advances technology.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Stone is not adventurous.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Stone advances technology, and by the exclusive-or with conserving resources, he does not conserve resources. He also does not protect wildlife. If he respected the environment, rule 10 would require him to conserve resources or protect wildlife, which he does not; thus he does not respect the environment. By the contrapositive of rule 13, not respecting the environment implies he neither lives in harmony nor appreciates beauty; hence he does not live in harmony. From rule 9 (seeks balance or lives in harmony) and not living in harmony, Stone seeks balance. From rule 4 and his not understanding the world, he does not pursue knowledge. Rule 5 only tells us he is spiritual or adventurous (or both). Nothing forces or forbids adventurousness; being spiritual remains consistent and does not force living in harmony (since valuing serenity is not established). Therefore, whether Stone is adventurous is undetermined, so 'Stone is not adventurous' is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"

Correct: No
