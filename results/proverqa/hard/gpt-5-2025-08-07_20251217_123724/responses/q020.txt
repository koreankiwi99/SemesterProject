Question ID: 20
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Siena has wings. Siena stays nested. If Siena has wings, then she either flies freely or stays nested, but not both. If Siena has a loud song, then she either has bright plumage or attracts attention (but not both). Any bird that stands out either inspires artists or brings joy. Siena has camouflage plumage. Siena either flies freely or thrives in the forest. Siena has a distinct call. Siena either attracts attention or blends into her environment, but not both. If Siena has bright plumage, then she stands out and sings sweetly. Millie has wings. All basically wild birds fly freely and are adaptable. If Millie has wings, then she either flies freely or stays nested, but not both. If a bird has camouflage plumage, then it blends into its environment. If Angelo has either vibrant feathers or a beautiful song (but not both), then she inspires artists. Every bird that has a distinct call either attracts attention or stands out (or both). Siena does not bring joy.

Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "Siena has wings and stays nested; thus she does not fly freely. From the alternative (flies freely or thrives in the forest), she thrives in the forest. Camouflage plumage implies she blends into her environment; with the XOR (attracts attention or blends), she does not attract attention. Having a distinct call implies she either attracts attention or stands out; since she does not attract attention, she stands out. Standing out implies either inspires artists or brings joy; given she does not bring joy, she inspires artists. None of these facts, nor any given rule, determines whether Siena has a beautiful song. The only song-related implications are about a loud song and singing sweetly from bright plumage, and there is no link provided from these to ‘beautiful song’ for Siena. Therefore, whether she has a beautiful song is not determined.",
  "answer": "C"
