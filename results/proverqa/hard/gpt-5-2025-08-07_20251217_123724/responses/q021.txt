Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Adeline sets goals, so she works hard. From the chain Success -> Recognition -> Influence -> ShapesOpinions and the fact that she does not shape opinions, by contraposition she does not have influence, does not have recognition, and thus does not achieve success. Given Success or Expertise, this forces Expertise to be true. If she were dedicated, the XOR (Dedicated -> exactly one of Expertise and WorksHard) would be violated since both Expertise and WorksHard are true; therefore she is not dedicated. From Intelligent or Dedicated and not Dedicated, it follows that Adeline is intelligent.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Ground Truth: A
