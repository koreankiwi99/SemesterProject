Question ID: 22
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Micah either follows his instincts or thinks critically, but not both. Micah survives harsh conditions. Micah values independence. Micah either has formal education or experiences frontier life, but not both. If Micah survives harsh conditions, then he is either able to adapt quickly or think critically (but not both). Micah is resourceful. If Micah learns from experience or adapts quickly, then he is self-taught. Micah does not learn from experience. If Micah values independence, then he lives off the grid and is resourceful. Micah follows his instincts. If Micah lives off the grid, then he either has formal education or is self-taught, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Micah grew up in the wilderness or experienced frontier life (or both), then he developed survival skills.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From values independence, Micah lives off the grid. Surviving harsh conditions implies he adapts quickly; adapting quickly implies he is self-taught. Living off the grid implies either formal education or self-taught (but not both); since he is self-taught, he does not have formal education. Given the XOR between formal education and experiencing frontier life, Micah therefore experienced frontier life. Thus the antecedent (grew up in the wilderness or experienced frontier life) is satisfied via experienced frontier life. However, no premise links frontier life, living off the grid, adapting quickly, or surviving harsh conditions to the statement 'developed survival skills.' There is no rule asserting or denying that consequence. Therefore, whether he developed survival skills is not entailed by the given information, making the conditional uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
