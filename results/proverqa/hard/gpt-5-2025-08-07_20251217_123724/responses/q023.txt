{
  "reasoning": "¬TopTracks and (HitSingles XOR TopTracks) -> Mainstream imply that if HitSingles then Mainstream; given ¬Mainstream, we get ¬HitSingles. With ¬Experiment and (Experiment XOR Collaborates) -> PopularMusic, the antecedent reduces to Collaborates -> PopularMusic; given ¬PopularMusic, we get ¬Collaborates. From Following -> (HitSingles ∨ Collaborates) and both are false, we infer ¬Following. Given (VocalRange ∧ ProducesAlbums) -> Following and VocalRange is true, ¬Following implies ¬ProducesAlbums. From SoloArtist XOR ProducesAlbums and ¬ProducesAlbums, we get SoloArtist. From Band -> (WriteSongs ∨ PerformLive) and both ¬WriteSongs and ¬PerformLive, we get ¬Band. Thus XOR(Band, SoloArtist) holds, so by XOR(Band, SoloArtist) -> Creative, Hallie is Creative. Therefore, 'Hallie is not creative' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
