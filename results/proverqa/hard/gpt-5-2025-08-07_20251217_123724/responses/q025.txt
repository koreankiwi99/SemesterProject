Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Ramon thinks critically, so he has a strategic mind. With a strategic mind, exactly one of the following is true: he wins major tournaments or he becomes a legend in chess. Ramon sets high goals and does not dedicate time, so he must practice often. He would win major tournaments if he both studies opponents and practices often, but we only know he either analyzes games or studies opponents (not necessarily studies opponents). Thus, we cannot determine whether he wins major tournaments (which would rule out becoming a legend) or instead becomes a legend. Therefore, the claim that Ramon does not become a legend is uncertain.",
