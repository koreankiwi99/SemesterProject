Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Maliyah listens to others and trusts her own instincts. From the XOR rule, this means she does not create authentic art. Using contrapositive on (stays true to themselves or values self-expression) -> creates authentic art, she neither stays true to herself nor values self-expression. Given she must either pursue her own vision or value self-expression, she pursues her own vision. From that and the XOR rule, and the fact that she follows established rules (given), she is not creating unique art. Since she follows established rules, she is conforming; therefore, she does not refuse to conform.",
  "answer": "A"
}
