  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "¬TG and (PL XOR TG -> EC) with ¬EC imply PL is false. From (GIR OR PL), GIR is true. GIR -> (WI XOR CWA) and ¬WI give CWA true. LFO ∧ EEC -> POW, so POW is true. If CLC then (POW XOR CWA), but both POW and CWA are true, so CLC is false. From (GP XOR CLC), GP is true. INF and FGU with (INF -> PCA XOR FGU) force PCA to be false. With GP and (GP -> PCA XOR IH), and PCA false, IH must be true. Therefore, Sincere inspires humanity.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
