Question ID: 29
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Maxine collaborates with peers or publishes research (or both). Iris values learning or is passionate about research. Iris does not publish research. Iris collaborates with peers or publishes research (or both). Iris does not seek self-improvement. If Iris is passionate about research, then she shares knowledge with others and collaborates with peers. If Daisy is passionate about research, then she shares knowledge with others and collaborates with peers. Iris studies Earth's geological processes. If Iris studies Earth's geological processes, then she can either discover new minerals or contribute to scientific knowledge, but not both. If Iris either contributes to scientific knowledge or pursues academic degrees (but not both), then she advances human understanding. If Iris either solves complex problems or analyzes data (but not both), then she is passionate about research. Iris does not value personal growth. Iris either advances human understanding or shares knowledge with others, but not both. If Iris is curious, then she either advances human understanding or has practical skills (but not both). Iris pursues academic degrees. Flora does not seek self-improvement. If Iris either values learning or seeks self-improvement (but not both), then she values personal growth.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Iris discovers new minerals.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Iris does not seek self-improvement. If (values learning XOR seeks self-improvement) then values personal growth; since she does not value personal growth, the XOR antecedent must be false, so she does not value learning. From (values learning or passionate about research), she is passionate about research. Passionate about research implies she shares knowledge with others. Given (advances human understanding XOR shares knowledge), sharing knowledge true forces advances human understanding false. She pursues academic degrees. The rule (if XOR(contributes to scientific knowledge, pursues academic degrees) then advances human understanding) with advances false and pursues true means the XOR antecedent is false, so contributes to scientific knowledge is true. From studying Earth's geological processes, we have exactly one of {discovers new minerals, contributes to scientific knowledge} true; since contributing is true, discovering new minerals is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
