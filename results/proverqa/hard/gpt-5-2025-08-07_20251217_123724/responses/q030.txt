Question ID: 30
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Raelynn prioritizes stability. Raelynn does not take risks. Raelynn is curious. If someone either pushes boundaries or works with traditional techniques (but not both), then they are innovative. If Raelynn is innovative or takes risks, then she will achieve success. If Raelynn has a creative vision, then she will either achieve success or build a strong network, but not both. If Raelynn is curious, then she either thinks outside the box or pushes boundaries, but not both. If Major experiments with materials, then she creates innovative products. Raelynn does not think outside the box. Raelynn either experiments with materials or works with traditional techniques, but not both. Major does not take risks. Raelynn either prioritizes stability or can achieve success, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Raelynn creates innovative products.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From curiosity and not thinking outside the box, Raelynn pushes boundaries. She prioritizes stability, and by the given exclusive rule with achieving success, she cannot achieve success. Using the rule that if she is innovative or takes risks then she will achieve success, and given she does not take risks, not achieving success implies she is not innovative. There is no rule connecting Raelynn to creating innovative products (the only such rule concerns Major), and being not innovative does not by itself imply she does not create innovative products. Therefore, whether Raelynn creates innovative products cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
