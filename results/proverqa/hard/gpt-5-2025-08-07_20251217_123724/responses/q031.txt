Question ID: 31
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Frankie does not rest in his burrow. If an armadillo thrives in groups, then it is a social animal. Every armadillo that has unique friends either explores in groups or roams alone (or both). Any armadillo that lacks pack mates or wanders freely can roam alone. If Frankie lives in the desert, then he forms symbiotic relationships with other creatures and has protective instincts. If Frankie either travels with others or forages with family (but not both), then he tends to explore in groups. If Frankie lives in a colony, then he is either a social animal or forms symbiotic relationships with other creatures, but not both. If Frankie is searching for food, he does not necessarily have protective instincts, and vice versa. Armadillos that explore in groups value companionship. If Frankie prefers to spend nights alone and enjoys quiet spaces, then he sleeps soundly. Frankie either has unique friends or prefers to spend nights alone, but not both. Frankie does not value companionship. Any armadillo that coexists with insects or has an adaptive shell can form symbiotic relationships. All armadillos that find shaded areas stay hydrated and sleep soundly. Frankie lives in a colony. All curious armadillos dig complex burrows and have protective instincts. Frankie is searching for food. If Frankie rests in his burrow or sleeps soundly, then he will stay healthy. Frankie does not stay healthy. If Frankie roams alone, then he is not a social animal, and if Frankie is a social animal, then he does not necessarily roam alone. Frankie enjoys quiet spaces.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Frankie lives in the desert.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From not staying healthy and (rest in burrow or sleep soundly -> stay healthy), we get that Frankie neither rests in his burrow nor sleeps soundly. Given he enjoys quiet spaces and (prefer nights alone AND enjoy quiet spaces -> sleep soundly), not sleeping soundly implies he does not prefer nights alone. With XOR(unique friends, prefer alone), this gives unique friends. Unique friends imply (explore in groups or roam alone). Since (explore in groups -> value companionship) and Frankie does not value companionship, he does not explore in groups; hence he roams alone. Roaming alone implies not a social animal. From living in a colony and the XOR(social, symbiotic), Frankie must be symbiotic (and not social). If he lived in the desert, he would be symbiotic and have protective instincts. We established symbiotic, but have no information that forces or forbids protective instincts; thus we cannot conclude whether he lives in the desert. Therefore, the statement is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
