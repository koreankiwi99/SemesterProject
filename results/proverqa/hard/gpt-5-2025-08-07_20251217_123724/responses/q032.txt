==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Eliana is driven by data and, by the XOR with valuing community feedback, she does not value community feedback. Given the XOR between valuing community feedback and being a passionate advocate, she must be a passionate advocate. She leads by example, so she inspires others. From the passionate advocate rule (inspire XOR achieve lasting results), inspiring implies she does not achieve lasting results. She cares for nature and fights pollution, so she is a dedicated environmentalist. Dedicated environmentalists either work tirelessly or achieve lasting results (or both); since she does not achieve lasting results, she must work tirelessly. Therefore, Eliana works tirelessly.",
