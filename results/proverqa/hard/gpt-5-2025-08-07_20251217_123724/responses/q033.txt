{
  "reasoning": "Andy is an experienced gamer and a strategic thinker; thus, by the exclusive-or rule for experienced gamers, he is not a dedicated leader. From thinking critically, Andy can adapt to changes. Given he adapts to changes and does not master new skills, the exclusive-or condition for quick learner is satisfied, so Andy is a quick learner. However, no premises relate any of Andy’s properties (strategic thinker, team player, quick learner, etc.) to being respected or not respected. Therefore, whether Andy is not respected cannot be determined from the given information.",
