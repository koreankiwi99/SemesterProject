Question ID: 35
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Dean does not mentor students. Dean contributes to society. If Dean makes an impact and has expertise, then he receives awards. Dean is not an active volunteer. If Dean is either an expert ornithologist or a passionate conservationist (but not both), then he is a respected scientist. Dean either holds degrees or receives awards. If Dean either mentors students or inspires others (but not both), then he makes an impact. If Dean contributes to society, then he either receives awards or gains recognition (but not both). Dean either has expertise or works hard. Dean gains recognition. Dean does not publish research. Anyone who publishes research or is a respected scientist can inspire others. Dean does not work hard. If Dean is a passionate conservationist, then he is both an active volunteer and public speaker.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dean is not an expert ornithologist.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Dean contributes to society and gains recognition, so by the exclusive-or rule (contributes -> exactly one of awards or recognition), he does not receive awards. He does not work hard, so from (expertise or works hard) he has expertise. If he had both impact and expertise, he would receive awards; since he does not receive awards and he has expertise, he must not make an impact. From (mentor XOR inspire) -> impact and not impact, we get not (mentor XOR inspire). Given he does not mentor, he also does not inspire. From (publishes or respected scientist) -> inspires and not inspires, he is not a respected scientist (and not publishing is consistent). If (expert ornithologist XOR passionate conservationist) then respected scientist; since he is not respected, not XOR holds, so expert ornithologist and passionate conservationist have the same truth value. If passionate conservationist then active volunteer, but he is not an active volunteer, so he is not a passionate conservationist. Therefore, he is also not an expert ornithologist. Hence the statement is true.",
  "answer": "A"
