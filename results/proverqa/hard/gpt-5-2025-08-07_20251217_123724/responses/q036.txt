Question ID: 36
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Murphy either writes efficient code or designs intuitive interfaces (but not both), then he is a good software developer. Murphy reads technical books. If Murphy is passionate about coding, then he is a good software developer and enjoys problem solving. Anyone who reads technical books and participates in hackathons is dedicated to learning. If Murphy is dedicated to learning, then he will build innovative products. Murphy joins online forums. For Murphy, either networking with peers or attending tech conferences (but not both) are ways to advance in his career. Murphy networks with his peers. Murphy enjoys problem solving. If Murphy builds innovative products, then he either values user feedback or is passionate about coding (or both). If Murphy either attends tech conferences or joins online forums (but not both), then he participates in hackathons. Murphy either codes regularly or attends tech conferences. Murphy does not value user feedback. If Murphy engages in self-study, then he either participates in hackathons or contributes to open source projects (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Murphy creates fast software.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Murphy joins online forums and, by the XOR with attending tech conferences (given he networks with peers instead of attending conferences), he participates in hackathons. Reading technical books plus participating in hackathons implies he is dedicated to learning, which implies he builds innovative products. Since he does not value user feedback, building innovative products implies he is passionate about coding, which in turn implies he is a good software developer. None of the premises state or imply that he creates fast software, nor can we derive that he writes efficient code. Therefore, whether he creates fast software is not determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
