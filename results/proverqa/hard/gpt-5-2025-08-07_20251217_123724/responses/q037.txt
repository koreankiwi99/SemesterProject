Question ID: 37
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Buster does not respond to calls. All dogs that listen to commands and behave properly are well-trained. Buster is either obedient or playful, but not necessarily both. Buster follows routines. Buster is either playful or loving (or both). If Buster either responds to calls or follows routines (but not both), then he listens to commands. All well-trained dogs are obedient and have good manners. Buster behaves properly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Buster is loving.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Buster does not respond to calls and follows routines, so the XOR condition holds, implying he listens to commands. With listening to commands and behaving properly, he is well-trained, which implies he is obedient. We also know he is playful or loving (or both), but nothing forces loving. A consistent scenario is that he is playful and not loving, satisfying all premises. Hence, whether he is loving cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
