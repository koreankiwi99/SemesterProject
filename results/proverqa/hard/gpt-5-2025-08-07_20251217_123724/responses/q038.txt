Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From small size and not fitting in tight spaces, Schmoopy must live in a mansion. Living in a mansion (and not running quickly) implies she navigates mazes. Navigating mazes (and not jumping obstacles) implies she loves climbing. Loving climbing plus enjoying solving puzzles makes her adventurous. Being adventurous implies exactly one of: discover hidden passages or find hidden food. Since she does not find hidden food, she discovers hidden passages. However, there is no rule linking discovering hidden passages to exploring hidden rooms. Therefore, whether she explores hidden rooms cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C
