Question ID: 39
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If someone follows clues and reveals evidence, then they can solve cases. If Esther either studies witness statements or analyzes forensic data, then she will crack the case. Esther does not crack the case. Norah either examines crime scenes or gathers evidence (or both). Esther either examines crime scenes or gathers evidence (or both). Esther does not solve cases. If Esther searches for clues or looks for patterns, then she will examine crime scenes. If Dax investigates carefully, then she will reveal evidence. Esther does not study witness statements. If Norah investigates carefully, then she will uncover the truth. If Esther investigates carefully, then she will reveal evidence. Esther reads reports or analyzes forensic data. If Esther either examines crime scenes or analyzes forensic data (but not both), then she follows clues. Esther does not gather evidence.

Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "From (Study WS or Analyze Forensic) -> Crack Case and Esther did not crack the case, plus Esther did not study WS, we infer she did not analyze forensic data. From (Examine CS or Gather Evidence) and Esther does not gather evidence, we infer she examines crime scenes. With Examine CS true and not Analyze Forensic, the XOR condition holds, so she follows clues. However, we have no basis to conclude she reveals evidence (we lack that she investigated carefully), and the only rule about uncovering the truth pertains to Norah, not Esther. There is no rule linking Esther’s known facts to uncovering the truth. Thus, whether Esther uncovered the truth cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
