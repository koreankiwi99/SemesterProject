Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Alliebear works independently; with the XOR rule, she does not collaborate with experts. She does not publish her findings and does not advance knowledge. By contrapositive of “breakthroughs -> (publish findings or advance knowledge),” she does not make breakthroughs. From “(collaborates with experts or produces innovative research) -> breakthroughs,” contrapositive gives that without breakthroughs she neither collaborates nor produces innovative research. Thus she does not produce innovative research. If Alliebear were a dedicated scientist, then she would produce innovative research and earn recognition; since she does not produce innovative research, she is not a dedicated scientist.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
