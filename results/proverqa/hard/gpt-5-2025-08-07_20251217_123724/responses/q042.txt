  "reasoning": "Gabriel seeks power, so he expands the Roman territory. He inspires loyalty, hence unites the masses and leads a revolution. With a lasting legacy, he must either die in peace or lead a revolution (but not both); since he leads a revolution, he does not die in peace.

Since he expands, he does not improve the lives of his citizens.",
