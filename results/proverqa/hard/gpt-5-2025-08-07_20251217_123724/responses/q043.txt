Question ID: 43
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Spencer achieves success or takes risks, then he will gain recognition. If someone is dedicated to their work and develops skills, then they can be an excellent craftsman. Anyone who practices self-care or manages emotions can maintain focus. If Spencer craves recognition, then he strives for perfection and innovates recipes. Spencer does not value excellence. Anyone who handles stress prioritizes tasks or manages emotions (or both). Anyone who is self-aware or has good habits can manage their emotions. Spencer does not practice self-care. Spencer values excellence or is an excellent craftsman. If Spencer is an excellent craftsman, then he either sets high standards or strives for perfection, but not both. Spencer cannot maintain focus. Anyone who sets high standards or pays attention to details can achieve success. Spencer either handles stress or works under pressure. Spencer does not prioritize tasks. Spencer does not take risks. Spencer is either passionate about cooking or works under pressure, but these two traits do not necessarily coexist. Spencer does not gain recognition.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Spencer demands quality and strives for perfection.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Interpret 'demands quality' as 'sets high standards.' Spencer does not value excellence, and since he either values excellence or is an excellent craftsman, he must be an excellent craftsman. If an excellent craftsman, then exactly one of sets high standards or strives for perfection holds. Also, since (achieves success or takes risks) implies gains recognition and Spencer does not take risks but also does not gain recognition, he cannot have achieved success. From (sets high standards or pays attention to details) implies achieves success, and not achieving success, it follows he neither sets high standards nor pays attention to details. Therefore he does not set high standards but, being an excellent craftsman with exactly one of the two traits, he does strive for perfection. The conjunction 'demands quality and strives for perfection' is therefore false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: B
Correct: No
