  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From the premises we can derive several facts about Genevieve: she anticipates problems, thus has backup plans; since she does not make safe investments, the XOR condition (safe investments or backup plans, but not both) triggers and she avoids risks; given the XOR with resilience, she is not resilient. She faces setbacks and, because being able to find new solutions would imply overcoming challenges (which she cannot), she must act on impulse and thus does not think ahead. None of the given statements address or imply anything about being passionate about baking. Therefore, the truth of that statement cannot be determined from the information provided.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
