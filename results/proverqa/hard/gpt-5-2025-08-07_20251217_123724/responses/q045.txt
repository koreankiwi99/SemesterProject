==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From caring about his community, Harlan must either work for social change or fight against injustice, but not both (WSC xor FAI). Which one holds is not determined. If he were passionate about environmental causes (PE), then he would fight against injustice and inspire others (PE -> FAI and Inspires). While Inspires is given, FAI remains undetermined because WSC xor FAI does not specify which is true. To conclude not PE via contrapositive, we would need not FAI, but we cannot derive not FAI since WSC xor FAI allows FAI to be true. Additionally, from not making a positive impact and volunteering locally, we can infer he does not advocate for animal welfare ((AAW and VL) -> MPI; not MPI and VL -> not AAW), but this does not settle PE. Therefore, the truth of 'Harlan is not passionate about environmental causes' cannot be determined from the given information.",
