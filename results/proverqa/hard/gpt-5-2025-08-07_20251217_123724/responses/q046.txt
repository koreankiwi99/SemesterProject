{
  "reasoning": "Memphis values independence and embraces spontaneity. If Memphis has a free spirit, then he must have exactly one of these (XOR), but since he has both, he does not have a free spirit (modus tollens). Memphis does not take risks; from (adventurous or loves uncertainty) -> takes risks, contrapositive gives that he is not adventurous and does not love uncertainty. From (explores widely or has many homes) -> adventurous and not adventurous, we get that Memphis does not have many homes. From (XOR(many homes, travels frequently)) -> free spirit and not free spirit, we get not XOR; with not many homes this implies Memphis does not travel frequently. Given \"Memphis is either a settled artist or travels frequently,\" not traveling frequently implies he is a settled artist. With \"Either Memphis is a nomadic artist or a settled artist, but not both,\" it follows he is not a nomadic artist. Therefore, the statement is false.",
  "answer": "B"
