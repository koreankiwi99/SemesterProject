Context:
If Orlando either reads widely or pursues knowledge (but not both), then he makes new connections. Orlando pursues knowledge or conducts meaningful research. Orlando does not advance industries. Everyone learns from others or pursues knowledge. Orlando develops new technologies. If Orlando works in a team, then he is either collaborative or follows instructions (but not both). Orlando does not achieve success. Orlando does not have an open mind. If Orlando is collaborative or has an open mind, then he can achieve success. Anyone who makes breakthrough discoveries either gains recognition or advances industries (or both). If Orlando makes new connections, then he is collaborative and thinks creatively. Orlando does not read widely. Orlando does not gain recognition. Anyone who conducts meaningful research or develops new technologies can improve people's lives. If someone sets clear goals and works with focus, then they can conduct meaningful research.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Orlando is an innovative scientist.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "We know Orlando develops new technologies and either pursues knowledge or conducts meaningful research, but we cannot determine which of the two (pursues knowledge vs. conducts meaningful research) is true. No rule defines what makes someone an 'innovative scientist,' nor do any rules connect developing new technologies or pursuing knowledge to being an 'innovative scientist.' Additionally, from not gaining recognition and not advancing industries, we can infer he did not make breakthrough discoveries, but that does not settle whether he is an innovative scientist. Therefore, the statement cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
