Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Juliet either speaks directly or has empathy; she does not speak directly, so she has empathy. If someone has empathy and listens actively, they can build strong relationships; Juliet cannot build strong relationships, so she does not listen actively. With offers guidance true and not listening, the XOR condition holds, so she helps others heal. From spreading positivity, she must either inspire others or help others heal (but not both); since she helps others heal, she does not inspire others. If she felt more optimistic, she would inspire others; thus she does not feel more optimistic. Since (feels confident or practices mindfulness) implies feeling more optimistic, she neither feels confident nor practices mindfulness. Reading daily affirmations implies feeling confident; hence she does not read daily affirmations. Therefore, the statement is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
