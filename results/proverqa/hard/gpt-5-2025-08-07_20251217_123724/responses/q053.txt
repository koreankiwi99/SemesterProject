Question ID: 53

Context:
Ares is a champion. If Ares has noble bloodlines, then he either has an attractive appearance or excellent jumping skills (or both). If Ares is confident, then he either performs well in competitions or builds strong bonds with Rachel, but not both. If a horse has noble bloodlines, it is not necessarily confident, and if a horse is confident, it does not necessarily have noble bloodlines. Ares either has speed or agility, but not both. If Ares either has a shiny coat or a flowing mane (but not both), then he has an attractive appearance. Ares has a good temper. Ares does not have excellent jumping skills. If Ares is a champion, then he either has an attractive appearance or has speed (but not both). Ares responds to commands. If Ares builds strong bonds with Rachel, then he either has a good temper or responds to commands, but not both. Ares does not have agility.

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Ares is a champion. From the rule for champions (champion -> exactly one of attractive appearance or speed) and given Ares lacks agility but has XOR(speed, agility), we deduce Ares has speed and thus does not have an attractive appearance. He also does not have excellent jumping skills. Therefore, the condition for noble bloodlines (noble bloodlines -> attractive appearance or excellent jumping skills) cannot be satisfied, so Ares does not have noble bloodlines. Ares has both a good temper and responds to commands; the rule (if builds strong bonds -> exactly one of good temper or responds) then implies he does not build strong bonds with Rachel. The only rule involving performing well is: if confident, then exactly one of (performs well, builds strong bonds). Since he does not build strong bonds, if he were confident he would perform well—but there is no information establishing whether he is confident. Hence, whether Ares performs well in competitions cannot be determined.",
