==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From the premises we can derive that Wyatt values loneliness (therefore does not build lasting connections), is open-minded (not following a routine), and tries new things (and thus does not explore new places). However, there are no statements connecting any property to whether Wyatt’s relationship is spontaneous or not. Since 'relationship' and 'spontaneous' are never mentioned or implied by the given rules, the statement cannot be determined from the information provided.",
