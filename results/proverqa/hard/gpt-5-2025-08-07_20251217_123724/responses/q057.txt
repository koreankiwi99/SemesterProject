Question ID: 57
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Jaiden codes programs or uses machine learning. Zaiden builds databases. Zaiden studies statistics. Zaiden codes programs or uses machine learning. Zaiden either interprets market trends or understands econometrics, but not both. Valerie studies statistics. Valerie does not code programs. Hanna either builds databases or works with algorithms, but not both. Hanna builds databases. Zaiden either builds databases or works with algorithms, but not both. Anyone who processes data or creates software works with algorithms. If Zaiden has a PhD, then he either develops models or consults governments, but not both. If Zaiden either uses machine learning or works with algorithms (but not both), then he is able to develop models. Zaiden does not code programs. Anyone who studies statistics and develops models can interpret market trends.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Zaiden cannot analyze economic data.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Zaiden does not code programs, and he either codes programs or uses machine learning; therefore he uses machine learning. He builds databases, and since he either builds databases or works with algorithms (but not both), he does not work with algorithms. Because he uses machine learning and does not work with algorithms, the XOR condition holds, so he is able to develop models. He studies statistics; anyone who studies statistics and develops models can interpret market trends. Interpreting market trends is analyzing economic data. Hence, the statement that Zaiden cannot analyze economic data is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: B
Correct: No
