Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Marie pursues higher education, and since she either empowers the youth or pursues higher education (but not both), she does not empower the youth. She works independently, so by the XOR with fostering community, she does not foster community. She challenges the status quo and (not fostering community) satisfies the XOR condition, so she leads by example. Anyone who leads by example either inspires others or empowers the youth; since she does not empower the youth, she inspires others. She builds consensus, and sparking controversy is mutually exclusive with building consensus, so she does not spark controversy. She takes a risk, and by the XOR (spark controversy or promote peace), she must promote peace. If she promotes peace, then she either faces resistance or inspires others, but not both; since she inspires others, she does not face resistance. Therefore, the statement that Marie faces resistance is false.",
  "answer": "B"
