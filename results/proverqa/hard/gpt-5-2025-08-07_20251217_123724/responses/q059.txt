{
  "reasoning": "Paradise thinks before acting, so by the exclusive-or with acting on impulse, she does not act on impulse. She does not listen carefully; given (listens carefully or speaks without thought), she must speak without thought. Since (speaks without thought xor acts on impulse) holds, she hurts others. If she hurts others, then exactly one of apologizes sincerely or makes amends is true. Nothing else determines which one. Values honesty with the xor rule implies she takes responsibility and does not own up to mistakes, which does not settle apologizes versus makes amends. Therefore, whether she apologizes sincerely is undetermined.",
