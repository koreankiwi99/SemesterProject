Skylar will make progress. Cassian either remains anonymous or gains recognition, but not both. Skylar does not remain anonymous. Skylar faces challenges. Cassian is driven. Skylar does not succeed professionally. If Cassian either learns quickly or overcomes obstacles (but not both), then he succeeds professionally. Cassian pursues his dream.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cassian achieves success, or he is both dedicated and hardworking.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Cassian is driven and faces challenges, he does not push his limits (exclusive). From (learns quickly XOR overcomes obstacles) -> succeeds professionally, together with not succeeding professionally and not learning quickly, it follows Cassian does not overcome obstacles. Since he pursues his dream and thus has passion or overcomes obstacles, he must have passion. People with passion put in effort and stay disciplined; however, no rule links effort/discipline to being hardworking or dedicated for Cassian. Cassian does not remain anonymous, so he gains recognition, but there is no rule that this implies he achieves success. Also, \"either sets high standards or achieves success\" does not let us conclude he achieves success. Therefore, neither \"Cassian achieves success\" nor \"Cassian is both dedicated and hardworking\" can be established, and the disjunction cannot be determined from the information.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
