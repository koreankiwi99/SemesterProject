Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Goldie has good taste, so she is artistic. Being artistic plus not creating poetry implies she writes stories. Writing stories and not composing music gives her a good imagination. Goldie is passionate, so she is inspiring; inspiring only requires good imagination or creativity, and she already has good imagination, so creativity is not forced. As a charismatic performer, she has creativity or irrepressible energy (or both). Nothing rules out or necessitates irrepressible energy. Therefore, whether she lacks irrepressible energy cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
