  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Alice does not help others and does not exemplify integrity. From (Selflessness XOR Help) -> Integrity, this implies she does not show selflessness. Given (HighHonor -> Bravery and Selflessness), her lack of selflessness implies she does not receive high honor. From (Courage -> Respect and HighHonor), not having high honor implies she does not display courage. The only path to 'inspires others' is via being a war hero, using WarHero -> (HighHonor or Inspire). We cannot deduce that Alice is a war hero: 'serves her country or is a war hero' and enlisting/defending freedom do not entail war hero, and we have no evidence she risks her life or shows courage. Therefore, whether she inspires others remains undetermined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
