Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "Edith does not pursue her passions, so from 'Edith either is inspired or pursues her passions' she is inspired. Being inspired implies she either thinks outside the box or values creativity, but we cannot determine which. Edith expresses emotions and takes risks. If she both takes risks and thinks outside the box, then she can achieve success; however, from 'If Edith either performs well or achieves success (but not both), then she feels fulfilled' plus 'Edith does not perform well' and 'Edith does not feel fulfilled', we infer that she does not achieve success. This does not rule out thinking outside the box, because the rule gives only the capability to achieve success, not actual achievement. Therefore we cannot conclude she values creativity, which is required (with expressing emotions) to conclude she can be artistic. Nor do we have any rule that she is not artistic. Hence we cannot determine whether she can (or cannot) create meaningful art.",
  "answer": "C"
