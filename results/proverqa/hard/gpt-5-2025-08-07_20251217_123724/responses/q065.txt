  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From living a long life, exactly one of {leaves a lasting legacy, passes on his knowledge} must hold. If he leads by example, then he leaves a lasting legacy, which would rule out passing on his knowledge. However, whether he leads by example is not determined: we only know (i) he either leads by example or seeks personal gain (but not both), and (ii) he serves others. Without being able to establish that he holds power (which would force a choice between serving others and seeking personal gain), we cannot rule out or confirm that he seeks personal gain versus leads by example. Therefore, we cannot decide whether he leaves a lasting legacy or instead passes on his knowledge. Both scenarios are consistent with the given facts.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
