Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Amirah is a food blogger and does not host cooking shows, so by the XOR rule she develops new recipes. Since she does not teach and does develop, the XOR condition (teach or develop) holds, so she writes cookbooks. Given the XOR constraint that she either writes cookbooks or works as a chef (but not both), she does not work as a chef. Amirah enjoys experimenting with food, so she is a talented cook, which implies (by XOR) she either works as a chef or runs her own restaurant; since she does not work as a chef, she runs her own restaurant. If she runs a restaurant and is a successful chef, she would receive food awards, but she does not receive awards; therefore she is not a successful chef. The rule says XOR(passionate, skilled) implies successful chef. Amirah is not passionate, so if she were skilled, she would be successful—which she is not. Hence, she is not skilled at cooking.",
  "answer": "B"
