Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Ayan is embracing peace, and by the exclusive choice with seeking redemption, he is not seeking redemption. From the exclusive choice between seeking redemption and fighting oppression, Ayan fights oppression. Having influence and fighting oppression implies he upholds justice. Given he has power and must either be capable of taking lives or uphold justice (but not both), he is not capable of taking lives. By the exclusive choice between being capable of taking lives and having compassion, he has compassion. However, no rule links any of Ayan’s properties to being notorious or not; the only notoriety rule pertains to Rosalie. Therefore, whether Ayan is not notorious cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}
