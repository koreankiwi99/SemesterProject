Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Cristian does not stay active, and he either prioritizes relaxation or stays active, so he prioritizes relaxation. Given the XOR between working hard and prioritizing relaxation, he does not work hard. He trusts his instincts, which implies he either works hard or is driven; since he does not work hard, he is driven. Being driven implies he seeks opportunities, and anyone with passion or who seeks opportunities takes risks. Hence Cristian takes risks. If he takes risks, then he achieves success. Therefore, Cristian achieves success.",
