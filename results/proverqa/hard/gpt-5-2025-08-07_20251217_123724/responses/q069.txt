Question ID: 69
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Jamir faces health challenges, then he remains optimistic and takes personal responsibility. For Drew, either he needs external help or he is self-sufficient, but not both. Drew has healthcare coverage. If Drew faces health challenges, then he remains optimistic and takes personal responsibility. If Drew has healthcare coverage, then he is either self-sufficient or requires medication (but not both). Jamir has healthcare coverage. If Jamir has a chronic illness or has a supportive doctor, then he manages his condition effectively. Drew either monitors his health or requires medication. Drew needs external help. Alfredo needs external help. If Alfredo requires medication, then he either has a strong support system or a chronic illness (but not both). Joziah has a strong support system. Drew faces health challenges. If Drew either manages his finances or makes independent decisions (but not both), then he is self-sufficient. Joziah faces health challenges. For Joziah, either he needs external help or he is self-sufficient, but not both. Everyone either takes personal responsibility for their health or has a supportive doctor, but not both is not necessarily true. If Drew requires medication, then he either has a strong support system or a chronic illness (but not both). Drew has a strong support system.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Drew manages his condition effectively.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Drew has healthcare coverage, so by the rule (HC -> self-sufficient XOR requires medication) and given he needs external help (thus not self-sufficient via the XOR with external help), Drew must require medication. From requiring medication, we get (strong support system XOR chronic illness); since Drew has a strong support system, he does not have a chronic illness. Drew faces health challenges, so he takes personal responsibility and remains optimistic. However, there is no rule linking requiring medication, having a strong support system, taking personal responsibility, or facing health challenges to \"manages his condition effectively\" for Drew. The only such effectiveness rule given applies to Jamir. Therefore, whether Drew manages his condition effectively cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
