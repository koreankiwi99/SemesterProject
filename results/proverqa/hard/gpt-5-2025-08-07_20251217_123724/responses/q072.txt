Question ID: 72
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Bennett optimizes systems, then he either advances artificial intelligence or enhances computing capabilities, but not both. If someone improves software, then they enhance computing capabilities. Bennett studies multiprocessing. If Bennett studies multiprocessing, then he either develops efficient operating systems or pioneers breakthrough technologies, but not both. If Francesca studies multiprocessing, then he either develops efficient operating systems or pioneers breakthrough technologies, but not both. Bennett does not think critically. If Bennett collaborates with experts, then he either solves complex problems or creates novel solutions (but not both). Anyone who understands algorithms and designs system architecture can develop efficient operating systems. Bennett analyzes data. If Bennett either solves complex problems or analyzes data (but not both), then he thinks critically. If Bennett can solve complex problems, then he leads innovative projects and optimizes systems. Bennett either develops efficient operating systems or improves software. Bennett advances artificial intelligence. If Francesca can solve complex problems, then he leads innovative projects and optimizes systems.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Bennett pioneers breakthrough technologies.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Bennett analyzes data and does not think critically. Given (solves complex problems XOR analyzes data) -> thinks critically, to avoid a contradiction he must also solve complex problems. Thus he solves complex problems, which implies he optimizes systems. If he optimizes systems, then (advances AI XOR enhances computing capabilities); since he advances AI, he does not enhance computing capabilities. If someone improves software, they enhance computing capabilities, so Bennett does not improve software. Bennett either develops efficient operating systems or improves software; hence he develops efficient operating systems. From studying multiprocessing, he either develops efficient operating systems or pioneers breakthrough technologies, but not both. Since he develops efficient operating systems, he does not pioneer breakthrough technologies.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
