==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Lovie defends minorities and the rule (defends minorities XOR supports human rights) -> advocates freedom, together with 'Lovie does not advocate for freedom', we infer she also supports human rights (so the XOR antecedent is false). Lovie does not earn respect; since heals -> earn respect, she does not heal. Given 'If Lovie fosters peace, then she heals', she does not foster peace. From 'If someone values tolerance, then they foster peace', contrapositive gives that Lovie does not value tolerance. The rule (oppose extremism OR value tolerance) -> promote social justice cannot be used to infer that she opposes extremism, and we also cannot infer its negation because whether she promotes social justice remains unknown (the statement 'Lovie either supports human rights or promotes social justice' does not exclude having both or only one). Therefore, whether Lovie opposes extremism is not determined.",
  "answer": "C"

Result:

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
