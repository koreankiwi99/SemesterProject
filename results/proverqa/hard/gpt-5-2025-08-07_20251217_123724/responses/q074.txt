If Twinkle performs dressage, then she is either disciplined or has good posture (but not both). If Twinkle is strong, then she is either agile or trustworthy (but not both). Twinkle has strength. Twinkle remains calm. Twinkle does not achieve high jumps. Twinkle either obeys commands or is disciplined. All horses that have good manners either obey commands or follow rules. Twinkle has good manners. If Twinkle has good reflexes, then she is either agile or has endurance (but not both). If Twinkle is disciplined, then she either remains calm or stands still (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Twinkle is well-trained or trustworthy, then she is useful for dressage.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Twinkle is agile because she does not achieve high jumps and must satisfy the inclusive condition of being agile or achieving high jumps. With strength and the exclusive rule (agile xor trustworthy), being agile implies she is not trustworthy. There is no information about Twinkle being well-trained, and no rules connect being well-trained or trustworthy to being useful for dressage. \"Useful for dressage\" is not defined or entailed by any given predicates. Therefore, the truth of the conditional cannot be determined from the information provided.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
