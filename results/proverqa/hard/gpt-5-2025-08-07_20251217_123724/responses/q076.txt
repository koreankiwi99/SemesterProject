Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Angie likes small rooms. By the rule that anyone who enjoys caving or likes small rooms is comfortable in enclosed spaces, Angie is comfortable in enclosed spaces. There is no rule that lets us infer she is fearful of enclosed spaces (claustrophobic). Avoiding tunnels does not imply claustrophobia, and we have no statement equating fear with not being comfortable. Thus, while we know she is comfortable, we cannot determine whether she is fearful, so the exclusive-or claim cannot be confirmed or refuted.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
