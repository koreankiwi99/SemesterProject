==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From not planting seeds and 'either plants seeds or manages a farm', Niklaus manages a farm. He works outdoors and does not grow groundnuts; with 'works outdoors -> runs a ranch or grows groundnuts', he must run a ranch. Running a ranch implies owning animals, and managing a farm or owning animals implies he can raise livestock. None of these facts establish anything about growing 'nutritious crops.' We only know he does not grow groundnuts; we have no evidence he harvests grains or tends an orchard (and cannot infer the converse from running a ranch). There is no rule linking any known activity to 'nutritious crops.' Therefore, whether he grows nutritious crops is undetermined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
