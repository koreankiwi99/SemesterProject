If Aries seeks understanding, then he either avoids complexity or values clarity, but not both. Aries either avoids complexity or embraces paradoxes, but not both. Matthew influences public opinion. If Aries pursues knowledge, then he is either able to think discursively or develop critical thinking, but not both. Myla challenges conventional wisdom. If Aries challenges conventional wisdom, then he either influences public opinion or leaves a lasting impact, but not both. For any philosopher, if they evaluate evidence and consider different perspectives, then they can develop critical thinking.

  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Aries embraces paradoxes, so by the XOR rule (avoids complexity or embraces paradoxes), he does not avoid complexity. Hence, by the XOR rule (avoids complexity or pursues knowledge), Aries pursues knowledge. From that, Aries either is able to think discursively or develops critical thinking (but not both). Aries also challenges conventional wisdom, and given the XOR rule there, he either influences public opinion or leaves a lasting impact; we are explicitly told Aries influences public opinion, so he does not leave a lasting impact. However, there is no rule connecting either influencing public opinion or thinking discursively/developing critical thinking to ‘gaining influence’ for Aries. The only ‘gains influence’ rule applies specifically to Myla. Therefore, whether Aries gains influence cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"

Result:

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
