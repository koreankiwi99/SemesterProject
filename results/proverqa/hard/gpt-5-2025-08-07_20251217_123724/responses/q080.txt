Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Assume Ayden is reckless. Given Ayden does not attract attention and reckless implies exactly one of {attract attention, lose trust}, Ayden must lose trust. Losing trust implies damaging reputation, which implies facing consequences. From facing consequences, Ayden becomes isolated or loses influence. But if Ayden loses influence, he would experience shame; since Ayden does not experience shame, he does not lose influence, so he must become isolated. Ayden engages in controversy, and controversy plus isolation implies he struggles with guilt. However, Ayden has a strong support system, which (by the given equivalence) means he does not struggle with guilt. Contradiction. Therefore, Ayden is not reckless.",
