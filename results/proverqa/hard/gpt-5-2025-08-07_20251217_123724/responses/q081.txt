Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From drives regularly, Brandon is a defensive driver. If he is an experienced driver, then exactly one of defensive or cautious holds; since he is defensive, that would force not cautious. Also, exactly one of cautious or reckless holds. So if he is experienced, he must be reckless. However, Brandon is either experienced or teaches road safety (but not both), and we cannot determine which holds. Professional racer does not fix this unless he is a driving instructor, which is not established (he only can be one). If he teaches road safety (thus not experienced), nothing forces whether he is cautious or reckless beyond their XOR. Therefore, whether Brandon is reckless cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
