Question ID: 82
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Moshe either achieves success or faces major setbacks, but not both. Everyone either conquers challenges or learns from failure. Moshe does not reach new heights. Moshe either finds inner peace or builds resilience, but not necessarily both. If Moshe either sets high goals or pursues excellence (but not both), then he pushes past his limits. If Moshe pushes past his limits, then he either overcomes fears or builds resilience (but not both). Everyone who conquers challenges either reaches new heights or finds inner peace (or both). Moshe does not overcome his fears. If Moshe either connects with nature or practices mindfulness (but not both), then he finds inner peace. Moshe does not set high goals. Anyone who sets ambitious targets or believes in themselves aspires to greatness. If Moshe sets challenging targets, then he will push past his limits. Moshe does not face major setbacks. If Moshe either sets goals or embraces risks (but not both), then he conquers challenges. Moshe does not learn from failure.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From the premises: Moshe does not face major setbacks, and since he either achieves success or faces major setbacks (but not both), he achieves success. Moshe does not learn from failure; since everyone either conquers challenges or learns from failure, he conquers challenges. Everyone who conquers challenges either reaches new heights or finds inner peace; given Moshe does not reach new heights, he finds inner peace. However, the only rule about aspiring to greatness requires that he either sets ambitious targets or believes in himself, neither of which is given. There is no information about inspiring others. Thus, we cannot conclude the statement is true or false.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: C
