Question ID: 84
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Joziah does not prioritize practicality. If Emerson is experienced, then he has creativity and follows trends. Emerson does not prioritize practicality. If Leila either values aesthetics or pursues elegance (but not both), then he admires symmetry. If someone imitates others and avoids risks, then they will lack originality. Adele does not focus on details. Emerson copies others. If Adele appreciates functionality, then he either focuses on details or prioritizes practicality (but not both). If Emerson appreciates functionality, then he either focuses on details or prioritizes practicality (but not both). Emerson does not recognize beauty in things. Emerson does not focus on details. If Emerson either pursues elegance or appreciates proportion (but not both), then he recognizes beauty in things. If Emerson either values aesthetics or pursues elegance (but not both), then he admires symmetry. Emerson either follows trends or is a respected architect, but not both. Joziah does not appreciate proportion. Emerson does not appreciate proportion. Emerson avoids experiments. If Emerson has cultural sensitivity, then he values historical context and creates timeless designs. If Emerson either values aesthetics or creates timeless designs (but not both), then he appreciates functionality. If Leila either values aesthetics or creates timeless designs (but not both), then he appreciates functionality. For all humans, if someone is a respected architect, then they either create timeless designs or blend tradition with innovation (or both). Emerson does not admire symmetry. If Leila lacks originality, then he either copies others or avoids experiments (but not both). If Leila either pursues elegance or appreciates proportion (but not both), then he recognizes beauty in things. If Joziah follows trends, then he will lack originality. If Emerson lacks originality, then he either copies others or avoids experiments (but not both). If Emerson follows trends, then he will lack originality.

Question:

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From ¬AppreciatesProportion(Emerson) and (XOR(PursuesElegance, AppreciatesProportion) -> RecognizeBeauty), the antecedent reduces to PursuesElegance; with ¬RecognizeBeauty(Emerson), conclude ¬PursuesElegance(Emerson). Then (XOR(ValuesAesthetics, PursuesElegance) -> AdmiresSymmetry) reduces to ValuesAesthetics -> AdmiresSymmetry; with ¬AdmiresSymmetry(Emerson), conclude ¬ValuesAesthetics(Emerson). Given ¬FocusDetails(Emerson) and ¬PrioritizePracticality(Emerson), from (AppreciatesFunctionality -> XOR(FocusDetails, PrioritizePracticality)) infer ¬AppreciatesFunctionality(Emerson). With (XOR(ValuesAesthetics, CreatesTimelessDesigns) -> AppreciatesFunctionality) and ¬ValuesAesthetics, this becomes (CreatesTimelessDesigns -> AppreciatesFunctionality); hence ¬CreatesTimelessDesigns(Emerson). We also have Copies(Emerson) and AvoidsExperiments(Emerson), so XOR(Copies, AvoidsExperiments) is false; from (LacksOriginality -> XOR(Copies, AvoidsExperiments)) infer ¬LacksOriginality(Emerson). From (FollowsTrends -> LacksOriginality) and ¬LacksOriginality, infer ¬FollowsTrends(Emerson). Using XOR(FollowsTrends, RespectedArchitect), conclude RespectedArchitect(Emerson). From (RespectedArchitect -> (CreatesTimelessDesigns ∨ BlendTraditionWithInnovation)) and ¬CreatesTimelessDesigns, deduce BlendTraditionWithInnovation(Emerson). Therefore, the statement 'Emerson does not blend tradition with innovation' is false.",
