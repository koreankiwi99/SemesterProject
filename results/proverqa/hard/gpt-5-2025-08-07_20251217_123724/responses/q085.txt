{
  "reasoning": "Jase is accountable, so he either makes tough decisions or acts with empathy (but not both). Given he acts with empathy, he does not make tough decisions. Since he prioritizes others and does not make tough decisions, the XOR condition for respect holds, so Jase is respected. Jase meets challenges and mentors others, so he is experienced. Being experienced, he either fosters teamwork or inspires others (but not both). Given he fosters teamwork, he does not inspire others. Since he holds a high rank, he either leads by example or inspires others (but not both). Not inspiring implies he leads by example. If respected, he either trains elite units or leads by example (but not both). Because he leads by example, he does not train elite units. Therefore, the statement that Jase trains elite units is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}
