Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Forest lives in the rainforest and does not have venom, so by the rainforest rule (carnivorous XOR venomous) he is carnivorous. For a carnivorous snake, he must be either stealthy or camouflaged (but not both); since Forest is not camouflaged, he is stealthy. Any snake with stealth or agility is adaptable, so Forest is adaptable. If Forest is adaptable, then he can survive in harsh environments. Therefore, the statement is true.",
