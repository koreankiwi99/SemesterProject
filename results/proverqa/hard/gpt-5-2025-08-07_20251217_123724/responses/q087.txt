Question ID: 87
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Ariana hides in vegetation. All frogs that live in damp environments either hide in vegetation or burrow into soil. Cairo inhabits forests. If Cairo is a small-sized frog, then he lives on land and eats insects. Cairo does not jump a long distance. Ariana is agile. If Cairo is agile, then he either swims efficiently or jumps a long distance (but not both). Cairo burrows into soil or hibernates underground. Cairo hides in vegetation. If Cairo either breathes air or inhabits forests (but not both), then he lives on land. Cairo is agile. If Cairo has webbed feet, then he either hibernates underground or breathes air, but not both. All frogs that swim efficiently have webbed feet. If Cairo either has powerful legs or uses stream current (but not both), then he can swim efficiently. Cairo lives in a damp environment. If Ariana is agile, then he either swims efficiently or jumps a long distance (but not both). Either Cairo lives on land or lives in water, but not both. If Cairo is small, then he hibernates underground and eats insects. If Galilea has webbed feet, then he either hibernates underground or breathes air, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cairo lives in water.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Cairo is agile and does not jump a long distance, so he swims efficiently. Therefore he has webbed feet, which implies exactly one of: hibernates underground or breathes air. He also inhabits forests. If (breathes air XOR inhabits forests) then he lives on land. Case 1: If he hibernates underground (so breathes air is false), the XOR condition holds and he lives on land, thus not in water. Case 2: If he breathes air (so hibernates is false), the XOR condition fails and we cannot conclude land; with the land/water exclusivity, living in water remains possible. Since one consistent case yields not-water and another allows water, whether Cairo lives in water is not determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
