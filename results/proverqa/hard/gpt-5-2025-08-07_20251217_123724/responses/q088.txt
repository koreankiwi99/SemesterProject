Question ID: 88
Difficulty: hard

Context:
For all camels, if they have a dry mouth and feel weak, then they are thirsty. If Goobers carries a heavy load, then he either stumbles frequently or feels exhausted (or both). Goobers does not reach water. Goobers does not have strong legs. If a camel stumbles frequently, then it loses balance and gets injured. For every camel, it is either thirsty or well-hydrated, but not both. If Goobers feels exhausted, then he either rests in the shade or walks briskly, but not both. Every camel that crosses the desert is either thirsty or finds an oasis. Goobers does not lose balance. Goobers gets injured. Goobers carries a heavy load. Goobers either rests in the shade or traverses dunes, but not both at the same time. All camels that have owners are able to carry loads and traverse dunes. If Goobers traverses dunes, then he either crosses the desert or reaches water. Goobers walks briskly. All camels that find an oasis have strong legs and endurance. Blossom does not lose balance.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Goobers is well-hydrated.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Goobers carries a heavy load, so he either stumbles or feels exhausted. Since he does not lose balance, he cannot be stumbling; therefore he is exhausted. Exhaustion implies either resting in the shade or walking briskly (but not both); given he walks briskly, he is not resting. From the XOR of resting vs traversing dunes, he must be traversing dunes. Traversing dunes implies either crossing the desert or reaching water; since he does not reach water, he crosses the desert. Crossing the desert implies he is either thirsty or finds an oasis. He cannot have found an oasis because that would entail strong legs, which he does not have. Hence, he is thirsty. Because a camel is either thirsty or well-hydrated, but not both, he is not well-hydrated. Therefore, the statement 'Goobers is well-hydrated' is false.",
  "answer": "B"

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
