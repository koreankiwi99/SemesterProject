Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Wesson prioritizes family life, and since he either works tirelessly or prioritizes family life (but not both), he does not work tirelessly. Given 'well-respected or works tirelessly' and not working tirelessly, he must be well-respected. Being well-respected implies he performs selfless acts or helps others unconditionally (but not both). Since he does not help others unconditionally, he performs selfless acts. From having a noble character, he is either a hero or performs selfless acts (but not both), so he is not a hero. If someone is recognized by governments or respected by peers, then they are a hero. Since he is not a hero, he is neither recognized by governments nor respected by peers. Therefore, Wesson is not respected by peers.",
