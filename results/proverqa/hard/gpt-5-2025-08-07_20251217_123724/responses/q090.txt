Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Atharv sets goals, and since he does not make progress, from 'sets goals -> (make progress or work hard)' it follows he works hard. With 'works hard -> (achieves success xor becomes an expert)' and 'not expert', he achieves success. He takes risks and 'takes risks -> (gains recognition xor influential)' with 'not influential' gives gains recognition. Thus both success and recognition are true, making '(achieves success xor gains recognition)' false; hence from 'develop unique skills -> (achieves success xor gains recognition)', we get he does not develop unique skills. From 'not fulfilling life' and '(makes people smile xor brings joy to others) -> fulfilling life', we infer not(makes people smile xor brings joy). Also, from 'cares about community' and '(cares & makes people smile) -> feel content' with 'not feel content', we deduce not makes people smile. Together, not XOR and not makes people smile imply not brings joy to others. Since 'follows passion -> (develop unique skills and brings joy)', and both conjuncts are false (in particular brings joy is false), Atharv does not follow his passion.",
