Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From not pursuing a career and the XOR rule, Jenna has hobbies. With hobbies and volunteering, the XOR implies she does not join clubs. From not reading books and (reads books or attends parties), she attends parties. Given (attends parties XOR joins clubs) implies socially active, she is socially active; thus, by the XOR with private space, she does not have a private space. None of the premises mention art or the ability to focus on it, nor do any rules link social activity or private space to art focus. Therefore, the statement about her art cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
