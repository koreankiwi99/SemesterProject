  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Rio is passionate, so he makes groundbreaking discoveries. He holds patents, which implies exactly one of {builds prototypes, creates useful innovations}; since he builds prototypes, he does not create useful innovations. Thus (makes groundbreaking discoveries XOR creates useful innovations) holds, which implies he is applauded. Given applauded XOR ridiculed, he cannot be ridiculed.",
  "answer": "B"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
