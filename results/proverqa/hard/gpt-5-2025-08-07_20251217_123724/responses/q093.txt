{
  "reasoning": "Beckham stitches cloth and dyes fabrics. If he used leather, then he would have to do exactly one of those (exclusive-or), so he does not use leather. Since he restores furniture and must either use leather or work with wood, he works with wood. From the XOR rule, working with wood means he does not make modern furniture. Another XOR says he is either a skilled upholsterer or makes modern furniture; thus he is a skilled upholsterer. Skilled upholsterer implies he either restores antiques or creates works of art. If he restored antiques, then with his original techniques he would preserve heritage, which would make him value tradition. But he embraces innovation and must not both value tradition and embrace innovation (XOR), so he cannot be restoring antiques. Therefore he creates works of art. Hence, the statement that he does not create works of art is false.",
  "answer": "B"
