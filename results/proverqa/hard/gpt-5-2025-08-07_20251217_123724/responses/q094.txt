Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Rio does not take risks. From the XOR (practical thinker vs takes risks), Rio is a practical thinker. From the XOR (practical thinker vs visionary), Rio is not visionary. Since Rio is a fruit farmer and must be down-to-earth or visionary (but not both), she is down-to-earth. From the XOR (down-to-earth vs inspirational), she is not inspirational. Rio is a public figure and enjoys socializing, so by the XOR (enjoys socializing vs values privacy), she does not value her privacy; hence, by the XOR (values privacy vs passionate about cultivating rare fruits), she is passionate about cultivating rare fruits (which is distinct from being generally passionate). If Rio were passionate, then (successful XOR inspirational) would hold; with inspirational false, that would force successful. However, we are only given that Rio is determined or passionate (inclusive), so she might not be passionate. No rule independently establishes success or its negation. Therefore, whether Rio is successful cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
