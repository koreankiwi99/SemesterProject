Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From learning from others, Maci worked under a mentor, hence she has experience. Given she is not a perfectionist, if her experience is in fashion design, she would create quality work. From not producing beautiful designs and the rule that (paying attention to details or having good taste) implies producing beautiful designs, we infer she neither pays attention to details nor has good taste. However, there is no information about whether she values precision or cares about her appearance. Thus, the truth of the disjunction cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C
