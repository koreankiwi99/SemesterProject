Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Hope does not think critically. From 'If someone has innovative ideas, then they will make valuable contributions' and 'If Hope makes valuable contributions, then she thinks critically', we infer Hope does not make valuable contributions, hence she does not have innovative ideas. From 'If (excels academically XOR pursues alternative careers) then innovative ideas' and 'Hope does not excel academically', it follows she does not pursue alternative careers. Given 'Hope either pursues alternative careers or is a dedicated scientist, but not both', she must be a dedicated scientist. If she is a dedicated scientist, then she either makes a groundbreaking discovery or inspires others. Since she does not inspire others, she must make a groundbreaking discovery.",
  "answer": "A"
}
