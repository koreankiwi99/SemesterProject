{
  "reasoning": "Jaxton sets goals and works hard, so he has ambition; with ambition, he prioritizes self-care and exercises. He eats nutritious food, which implies he maintains good health. Given the XOR between maintaining good health and having anemia, he does not have anemia. There is no rule linking his status to 'requiring medical treatment,' so we cannot determine that from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}
