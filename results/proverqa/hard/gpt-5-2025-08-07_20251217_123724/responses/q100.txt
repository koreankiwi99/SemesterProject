Question ID: 100
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Josue knows phrases. All parrots either make noise or learn to speak. All parrots that can sing have vocal cords. Josue will understand the context of his speech if he responds intelligently. All parrots that either know phrases or understand the context of their speech are communicative. Every parrot that either whistles tunes or repeats words (but not both) can mimic sounds. If Josue either has a large vocabulary or entertains crowds (but not both), then he is charismatic. Josue does not make noise. If a parrot can make humans laugh, then it will entertain crowds. Every parrot has feathers or has vocal cords. Josue does not have feathers. Josue does not have a large vocabulary. Josue is not charismatic. Josue is either talkative or mute, but not both. A parrot can either mimic sounds or understand the context of its speech, but not necessarily both. If a parrot has vocal cords and is communicative, then it can make humans laugh. If Josue learns to speak, then he is either mute or can mimic sounds. All parrots that express emotions are communicative.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Josue is not talkative.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Assuming Josue is a parrot, we can derive several properties (e.g., communicative, has vocal cords) but these lead to a contradiction about charisma. Regardless, nothing in the rules links talkative to making noise or to any other derived property in a way that decides between talkative and mute. We only know Josue is either talkative or mute (but not both), and that he does not make noise and would learn to speak, which still doesn’t determine which side of the exclusive disjunction holds. Therefore, we cannot conclude that he is not talkative.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
