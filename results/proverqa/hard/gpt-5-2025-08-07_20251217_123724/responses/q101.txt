Question ID: 101
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Dr. Lilian focuses on novel approaches, then she will advance her field. Dr. Ignacio does not formulate hypotheses. Dr. Lilian does not mentor students. Lilian does not gain international recognition. Dr. Lilian engages in critical thinking. Dr. Ignacio engages in critical thinking. Every scientist either collaborates with colleagues or publishes research papers. Lilian has curiosity. Lilian explores new ideas. If Dr. Lilian has expertise, then she either makes breakthroughs or influences policy, but not both. Dr. Lilian does not formulate hypotheses. Dr. Lilian does not lead innovative projects. If Dr. Lilian either analyzes data or designs experiments (but not both), then she publishes research papers. Any scientist who develops new theories or conducts experiments can improve their understanding of their field. Dr. Lilian does not conduct experiments. If Dr. Lilian engages in critical thinking, then she either explores new ideas or enhances her knowledge, but not both. Anyone who either improves their understanding or formulates hypotheses is enhancing their knowledge. If a scientist is curious and advances their field, then they develop new theories. Dr. Lilian studies microorganisms. If Dr. Lilian studies microorganisms, then she either contributes to sustainable agriculture or wins prestigious awards (or both). Emery does not gain international recognition. If a scientist reads scientific literature and participates in discussions, then they enhance their knowledge. If Dr. Lilian publishes research papers, then she either makes breakthroughs or leads innovative projects, but not both. If a scientist makes breakthroughs and wins prestigious awards, then they gain international recognition. If Dr. Lilian either collaborates with colleagues or mentors students (but not both), then she advances her field.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Lilian contributes to sustainable agriculture.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "1) Dr. Lilian engages in critical thinking, and we are told she explores new ideas; by the XOR rule (critical thinking -> explores new ideas or enhances knowledge, but not both), she does not enhance her knowledge. 2) She studies microorganisms, so she either contributes to sustainable agriculture (CSA) or wins prestigious awards (WPA). 3) As a scientist, she must either collaborate or publish. If she collaborated, then (collaborate XOR mentor) would imply she advances her field; with curiosity, that (for a scientist) would force developing new theories -> improving understanding -> enhancing knowledge, contradicting step 1. Therefore she does not collaborate, so she must publish. 4) If she publishes and does not lead innovative projects, then she makes breakthroughs. 5) If she both made breakthroughs and won prestigious awards (and is a scientist), she would gain international recognition, but we are told she does not. Hence WPA must be false. 6) From studying microorganisms implying (CSA or WPA) and WPA being false, CSA must be true.",
  "answer": "A"
