Question ID: 103
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Kehlani thrives in change. If Kehlani has complex social bonds, then she is either resourceful or intelligent, but not both. A leech either prioritizes its own survival or respects the needs of others, but not necessarily both. Kehlani does not prioritize her own survival. If Kehlani is intelligent, then she either cares for her host or protects the ecosystem, but not both. Kehlani does not care for her host. If Kehlani maintains balance in her ecosystem, then she is either adaptable or resourceful, but not both. Kehlani does not adjust her behavior. If Kehlani lives with crayfish and respects their needs, then she has complex social bonds. All leeches that are sensitive to their environment are adaptable and have strong instincts. If Kehlani either adjusts her behavior or thrives in change (but not both), then she is adaptable. Kehlani is cooperative. Kehlani communicates effectively. Kehlani maintains balance in her ecosystem. If Kehlani forms long-term attachments or shows empathy towards others, then she can have complex social bonds. If Kehlani is cooperative, then she lives with crayfish and communicates effectively. Jamir does not adjust her behavior. If Princeton is intelligent, then she either cares for her host or protects the ecosystem, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kehlani does not protect the ecosystem.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Kehlani thrives in change and does not adjust her behavior, so by the XOR rule she is adaptable. Maintaining balance implies exactly one of adaptable or resourceful; since she is adaptable, she is not resourceful. As a leech, she must either prioritize survival or respect others; given she does not prioritize survival, she respects others. Being cooperative implies she lives with crayfish; combined with respecting their needs, she has complex social bonds. Complex social bonds imply exactly one of resourceful or intelligent; since not resourceful, she is intelligent. Intelligent and not caring for her host entails (by XOR) that she protects the ecosystem. Therefore, the statement that she does not protect the ecosystem is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
