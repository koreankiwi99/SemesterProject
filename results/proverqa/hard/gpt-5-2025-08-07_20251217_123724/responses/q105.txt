Question ID: 105
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If a farmer works hard, then they value quality and are dedicated to their work. Anders does not use crop rotation. Every dedicated farmer either improves their crops or is experienced (or both). For all farmers, either they diversify their farm or improve their crops, but not necessarily both. Ronan either manages pests or increases crop yields. Ronan does not use crop rotation. Any farmer who uses quality seeds or optimizes soil conditions can increase crop yields. Every farmer monitors soil or manages pests. Ronan rotates fields. If Ronan is experienced, then he can either increase crop yields or develop new techniques, but not both. If Alyssa is experienced, then he can either increase crop yields or develop new techniques, but not both. If Bo either rotates fields or uses crop rotation (but not both), then he is dedicated. Ronan either uses sustainable methods or manages pests, but not both. If Ronan either rotates fields or uses crop rotation (but not both), then he is dedicated. Ronan diversifies his farm. Ronan uses sustainable methods. Bo diversifies his farm.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ronan does not develop new techniques.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Ronan uses sustainable methods and, by the exclusive rule (uses sustainable methods or manages pests, but not both), he does not manage pests. Since Ronan must either manage pests or increase crop yields, he therefore increases crop yields. Ronan rotates fields and does not use crop rotation; by the exclusive rule this makes him dedicated. Every dedicated farmer either improves their crops or is experienced (or both). We cannot determine whether Ronan is experienced. If he is experienced, then (by the exclusive rule for experienced Ronan) since he increases crop yields, he does not develop new techniques. If he is not experienced, there is no rule preventing him from developing new techniques. Therefore, whether Ronan develops new techniques is not determined by the premises, making the statement 'Ronan does not develop new techniques' uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
