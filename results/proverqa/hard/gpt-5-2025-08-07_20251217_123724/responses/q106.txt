Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Kiddo works on a farm, so by the XOR rule she does not compete in shows. She does not enjoy outdoor activities, and since she either enjoys outdoor activities or has participated in parades, she must have participated in parades. From having a good temperament, Kiddo either wins competitions or is majestic (or both). If she is majestic, then (by the XOR rule) she either competes in shows or participates in wassailing; since she cannot compete in shows, majestic would force her to participate in wassailing. However, we cannot deduce that she is majestic, because her good temperament could instead be satisfied by winning competitions, and there is no rule linking winning competitions to shows or to (not) wassailing. Therefore, whether she participates in wassailing (and thus whether she does not participate) cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
