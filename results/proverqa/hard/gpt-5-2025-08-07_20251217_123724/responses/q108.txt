==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Iyla conducts experiments and the XOR rule (share findings or keep notes private), combined with Iyla discovers new properties and the rule that DNP + share => becomes an expert, and given Iyla does not become an expert, we infer she does not share and thus keeps her notes private. By the XOR (publish or keep private), keeping private implies she does not publish. From the disjunctions, she therefore gains recognition and makes new findings. None of the given rules mention or connect to developing innovative remedies, nor can such development be inferred from discovery, recognition, success, expertise, sharing, or publishing. Hence, the truth of “Iyla does not develop innovative remedies” cannot be determined from the premises.",
  "answer": "C"

Result:

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
