==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From reclusive and has friends, Wyatt does not have a family. Given he must have a family or live alone, he lives alone. Living alone implies values solitude or enjoys socializing (but not both). Since Wyatt avoids crowds and appreciates quiet, he likes being alone, so he does not enjoy socializing; thus he values solitude and therefore prefers privacy. None of the premises connect Wyatt (as opposed to Ryatt) to creativity, and there is no rule that would imply Wyatt is or is not creative. Therefore, whether Wyatt is not creative cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
