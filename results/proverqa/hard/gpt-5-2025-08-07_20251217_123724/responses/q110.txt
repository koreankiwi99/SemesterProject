Question ID: 110
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Queenie has flagella, then she either releases waste products or produces toxins, but not both. If Queenie has a cell wall, then she can evade the immune system. Queenie colonizes intestines. If Queenie invades tissues, then she will produce toxins. Any parasite that breaks down food and colonizes intestines will release waste products. Queenie has flagella. Queenie disrupts digestion. If Queenie either produces toxins or adapts to environments (but not both), then she can evade the immune system. If Cora either produces toxins or adapts to environments (but not both), then she can evade the immune system. If Queenie can evade the immune system, then she can either multiply rapidly or dominate the gut microbiome, but not both. A parasite may either cause chronic disease or multiply rapidly, but not necessarily both. Queenie adapts to environments. If Queenie either disrupts digestion or infests her host (but not both), then she causes chronic disease. Cora adapts to environments. Queenie breaks down food. Leo has flagella. Queenie does not infest her host. Cora disrupts digestion.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Queenie is able to dominate the gut microbiome.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Queenie breaks down food and colonizes intestines, so she releases waste products. With flagella, she must either release waste or produce toxins, but not both; thus she does not produce toxins. She adapts to environments, and since (toxins XOR adapts) holds, she can evade the immune system. From evasion, she must either multiply rapidly or dominate the gut microbiome, but not both. Nothing else determines which of the two holds; causing chronic disease (implied by disrupting digestion and not infesting) does not resolve this. Therefore, whether she dominates the gut microbiome is not determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
