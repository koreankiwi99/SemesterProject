Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Kaia either seeks material wealth or shows devotion, but not both' and 'Kaia does not seek material wealth', Kaia shows devotion. Thus, by 'If Kaia shows devotion, then she will get blessed', she is blessed. From 'If someone either learns ancestral songs or appreciates their heritage, then they feel connected to their roots' and 'Kaia does not feel connected to her roots', we infer that Kaia neither learns ancestral songs nor appreciates her heritage. From 'If someone either preserves history or values their culture, then they appreciate their heritage' and her not appreciating heritage, Kaia neither preserves history (already given) nor values her culture. None of these statements provide any information about Kaia praying for rain, and the only rule mentioning praying for rain concerns Carly, not Kaia. Therefore, whether Kaia prays for rain cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}
