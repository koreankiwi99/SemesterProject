Question ID: 112
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Any fish that is agile or curious can thrive in harmony with their surroundings. Matilda lives in cold water. If Matilda lives in cold water, then she has a slow metabolism and hibernates during winter. If Matilda lives in cold areas and has low activity, then she hibernates during winter. Matilda either hibernates during winter or gains energy, but not both. If Matilda eats plankton, then she gains energy and has shiny scales. Every fish with good vision either finds food or socializes with its school (or both). Any fish that swims quickly and finds food will gain energy. All fish that are agile can evade predators. If a fish stays safe and has spatial awareness, then it can navigate the reef. Matilda cannot navigate the reef. Matilda cannot thrive in harmony with her surroundings. Any fish that evades predators or dodges nets can stay safe. Matilda is active during the night. If Matilda is active during the night, then she follows currents and swims quickly. Matilda has spatial awareness. If Matilda has good vision or enjoys discovery, then she is curious.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Matilda does not explore her surroundings.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From (agile or curious) -> thrive and the fact that Matilda cannot thrive, we infer she is neither agile nor curious (contrapositive). From (good vision or enjoys discovery) -> curious and not curious, we infer she has neither good vision nor enjoys discovery (contrapositive). However, there is no rule linking 'explores her surroundings' to curiosity, enjoying discovery, navigation, or any other given predicate. Therefore, whether Matilda explores her surroundings cannot be determined from the provided information.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
