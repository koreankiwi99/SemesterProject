Question ID: 113
Difficulty: hard

Context:
All chemical engineers who solve complex problems both enhance water treatment processes and improve public health. Luv does not advance industrial processes. Luv does not conduct academic research. Luv solves complex problems. Veronica does not conduct academic research. Anyone who can purify contaminated water will enhance water treatment processes. A chemical engineer either designs ecofriendly products or conducts academic research, but not necessarily both. Any chemical engineer who creates demulsifying agents or improves environmental sustainability can reduce pollution. If Luv studies emulsions or experiments with chemicals, then she can create demulsifying agents. Koen either creates demulsifying agents or enhances water treatment processes. Veronica solves complex problems. Luv either designs ecofriendly products or reduces pollution, but not necessarily both. If Luv develops innovative techniques, then she can either improve environmental sustainability or advance industrial processes, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Luv does not develop innovative techniques.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "We know Luv does not advance industrial processes and solves complex problems, but there's no information stating whether she develops innovative techniques. If she did develop innovative techniques, then (given she does not advance industrial processes) she would be able to improve environmental sustainability, which is consistent with all given facts. No rule compels or forbids her developing innovative techniques, and we cannot infer she is a chemical engineer to derive further constraints. Therefore, the truth of 'Luv does not develop innovative techniques' cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
