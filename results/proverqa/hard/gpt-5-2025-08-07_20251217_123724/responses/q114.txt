Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Simba has a bold nature, so he explores dangerous paths. From that, either he learns valuable lessons or he gets into trouble, but not both. Simba also ventures into the unknown, so either he gets into trouble or he gains wisdom, but not both. These give: learns lessons XOR trouble, and trouble XOR gains wisdom, implying learns lessons equals gains wisdom. However, nothing determines whether trouble (and thus the negation of both) or wisdom/lessons actually occurs. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Simba does not learn valuable lessons.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
