==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Miracle values harmony or prioritizes others' and 'Miracle does not value harmony', it follows that she prioritizes others. Given 'either prioritizes others or thinks of herself, but not both', she does not think of herself. 'Either puts others first or community-oriented, but not both' (with 'puts others first' equivalent to 'prioritizes others') implies she is not community-oriented. From 'either community-oriented or self-centered, but not both', not being community-oriented implies she is self-centered. Therefore, the statement 'Miracle is not self-centered' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}
