==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From the premises: Stone faces challenges and does not find creative solutions, so he must be resourceful. Stone manages his time effectively, so he is productive. Stone values simplicity, so he has clarity and makes intentional decisions. Since stress-free and clarity imply living harmoniously, and Stone does not live harmoniously while having clarity, he is not stress-free. There is no rule connecting these facts to Stone being organized, and the only rule about being organized applies to Alexia, not Stone. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Stone is organized or not.",
  "answer": "C"
