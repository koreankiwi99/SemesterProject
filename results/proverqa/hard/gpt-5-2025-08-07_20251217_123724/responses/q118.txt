Question ID: 118
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Jade does not map terrain. Alyssa does not map terrain. If Faith loves the outdoors, then she examines fossils and classifies minerals. Alyssa enjoys hiking. Alyssa does not appreciate nature. Faith does not gain recognition. If Twinkle enjoys hiking, then she either appreciates nature or loves the outdoors (but not both). Anyone who analyzes rock formations either studies geology or uncovers the secrets of the Earth (or both). Alyssa does not gain recognition. If Alyssa values exploration, then she loves the outdoors. If Alyssa studies geology, then she can either make breakthroughs or gain recognition, but not both. If Alyssa enjoys hiking, then she either appreciates nature or loves the outdoors (but not both). If Faith studies geology, then she can either make breakthroughs or gain recognition, but not both. Jade does not uncover the secrets of the Earth. If Alyssa loves the outdoors, then she examines fossils and classifies minerals. If Alyssa either finds fault lines or reads seismic data (but not both), then she studies geology. If Jade either examines fossils or maps terrain (but not both), then she analyzes rock formations. Jade enjoys hiking. If Twinkle collects rocks, then she will classify minerals. Alyssa does not uncover the secrets of the Earth. Faith does not collect rocks. If Alyssa either examines fossils or maps terrain (but not both), then she analyzes rock formations.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Alyssa makes breakthroughs.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Alyssa enjoys hiking, and since she does not appreciate nature, the XOR rule (enjoys hiking -> appreciates nature or loves the outdoors) forces that she loves the outdoors. Loving the outdoors implies she examines fossils (and classifies minerals). With examines fossils true and map terrain false, the XOR rule (examines fossils or maps terrain -> analyzes rock formations) gives that she analyzes rock formations. From analyzing rock formations, she must either study geology or uncover the secrets of the Earth; since she does not uncover the secrets of the Earth, she studies geology. Studying geology implies an exclusive-or between making breakthroughs and gaining recognition; given she does not gain recognition, she must make breakthroughs. Therefore, the statement that Alyssa makes breakthroughs is true.",
  "answer": "A"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
