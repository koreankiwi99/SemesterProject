==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Edward wins big and does not invest wisely, so by the exclusive rule (wins big -> invests wisely or donates generously, but not both), he donates generously. Donating generously makes him a philanthropist. If Edward is philanthropic, then exactly one of {altruistic, puts others first} holds. Also, anyone who puts others first is altruistic. Therefore, Edward cannot be 'puts others first' (it would make both true), so he is altruistic and not 'puts others first'. Given 'Edward either puts others first or is selfish', with not 'puts others first', he must be selfish. Since either Edward is selfish or selfless, but not both, being selfish means he is not selfless. Thus, the statement 'Edward is selfless' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
