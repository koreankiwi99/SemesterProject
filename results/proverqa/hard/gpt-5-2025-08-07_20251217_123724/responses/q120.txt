Elsa has high status. If Brayan has high status, then she either looks down on others or acts with empathy, but not both. Cherry is not lonely. Everyone who lacks confidence either seeks comfort or hides their true self (or both). If Elsa has high status, then she either looks down on others or acts with empathy, but not both. Cherry either craves validation or acts with empathy, but not both. Dominick either builds real connections with others or fears rejection, but not both. Elsa either builds real connections with others or fears rejection, but not both. Elsa either craves validation or acts with empathy, but not both. For any person, if they feel inadequate and criticize others, then they fear rejection. Brayan needs approval. Cherry has high status. Cherry does not look down on others.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Elsa is insecure, then she is either manipulative or lonely, but not both.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Elsa's high status and not looking down on others, she acts with empathy. By the XOR rule with empathy/validation, she does not crave validation. Given she builds real connections (hence does not fear rejection) and needs approval, the XOR condition triggers that she hides her true self. Hiding her true self implies she either values authenticity or craves validation; since she does not crave validation, she values authenticity. Valuing authenticity is mutually exclusive with seeking attention, so she does not seek attention. However, no rule links Elsa's traits to being insecure (only Dominick has a rule tying seeking attention to insecurity), and there is no information connecting Elsa to being manipulative or lonely. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of the conditional about Elsa being insecure implying manipulative XOR lonely.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: C
