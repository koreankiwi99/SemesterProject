  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Callen does not meet deadlines' and (keeps track ∨ manages time) -> meet deadlines, we get that Callen neither keeps track nor manages time. From 'Callen is not diligent' and 'Callen is not detail-oriented' with (achieves goals -> diligent ∨ detail-oriented), we infer Callen does not achieve goals. From 'Callen is thorough' and not vigilant with (thorough -> vigilant XOR cautious), Callen is cautious. Then cautious -> exacting, and exacting -> values accuracy and strives for improvement, which conflicts with 'Callen does not strive for improvement', indicating inconsistency in the premises. No rule connects any of these properties to being efficient (or not efficient). Therefore, whether Callen is efficient cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
