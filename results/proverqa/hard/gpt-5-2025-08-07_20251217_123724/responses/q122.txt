Question ID: 122
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Taytum eats insects. If Taytum has either aquatic adaptation or terrestrial adaptation (but not both), then she thrives. If Maximo is resilient, then she explores her environments and regenerates quickly. All thriving frogs are resilient. If Duke explores her environment and eats insects, then she is balanced. Taytum either lives in ponds or hibernates seasonally. Inaya either has terrestrial adaptation or hibernates seasonally, but not both. If Taytum has webbed feet, then she either migrates long distances or hibernates seasonally, but not both. If Taytum has strong skin, then she jumps far and explores her environments. If Taytum is resilient, then she explores her environments and regenerates quickly. Taytum does not migrate long distances. Taytum has webbed feet. Taytum either has terrestrial adaptation or hibernates seasonally, but not both. If Taytum explores her environment and eats insects, then she is balanced. Taytum is not balanced. Taytum regenerates quickly. If Taytum has gills or has lungs, then she can thrive.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Taytum has an aquatic adaptation.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From webbed feet and not migrating long distances, Taytum must hibernate seasonally (exclusive-or). Given the exclusive-or between terrestrial adaptation and hibernating, Taytum does not have a terrestrial adaptation. If Taytum thrived, then (thriving -> resilient) and (resilient -> explores) together with eating insects would imply she is balanced, contradicting that she is not balanced. Hence, Taytum does not thrive. By contrapositive of (exactly one of aquatic or terrestrial adaptation -> thrives), not thriving implies not exactly one of them; since terrestrial is false, aquatic must also be false. Therefore, Taytum does not have an aquatic adaptation.",
  "answer": "B"

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
