==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "We know Loyal ⊕ Disloyal (exactly one). Also Obey ∨ Loyal, and Challenges ⊕ Obey. With ¬Respect and (Respect ⊕ Decisions) → Power, we get Decisions → Power, and Power → Challenges. From GainsInfluence ∨ Decisions there are two consistent cases: (1) If Decisions is true, then Power → Challenges, so Obey is false; then Obey ∨ Loyal forces Loyal true, hence Disloyal false. (2) If Decisions is false, then GainsInfluence is true; we can take Obey true and Challenges false, which satisfies all constraints while allowing Loyal to be false, hence Disloyal true. Since both Disloyal true and false are consistent with the premises, the statement cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
