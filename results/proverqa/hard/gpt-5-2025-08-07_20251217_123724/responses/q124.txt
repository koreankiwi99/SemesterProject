==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Aila meets new people, so she rediscovers her passion and explores new interests. Given the XOR rule (rediscovers passion or faces a personal crisis), she does not face a personal crisis. From undergoing significant change and the XOR rule (loses a loved one or faces a personal crisis), she must have lost a loved one. However, there is no explicit rule equating 'experiences tragedy' with losing a loved one or a personal crisis. Therefore, whether Aila 'experiences tragedy' cannot be determined from the given statements.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
