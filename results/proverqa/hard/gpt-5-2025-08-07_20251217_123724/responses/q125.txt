Question ID: 125
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Augustine works hard, then he is either making breakthroughs or publishing papers (but not both). If Augustine exemplifies excellence, then he will win awards. If Augustine either conducts research or collects data (but not both), then he seeks knowledge. Augustine is either a famous scientist or an unknown scientist, but not both. Augustine does not explore ideas. Augustine gains respect. If Augustine wins awards, then he either earns recognition or gains respect (but not both). If Augustine conducts research, then he is either an unknown scientist or makes a breakthrough (or both). If Augustine works alone and avoids media, then he is an unknown scientist. Augustine solves puzzles. Augustine does not inspire others. Augustine does not analyze results. If Augustine is curious, then he either seeks knowledge or solves puzzles (but not both). Augustine earns recognition. Everyone explores ideas or is curious. Anyone who makes a breakthrough or wins awards inspires others. If someone monitors experiments, then they collect data. Augustine either analyzes results or collects data, but not both.

Question:

  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Augustine does not explore ideas, and everyone either explores ideas or is curious, so he is curious. From curiosity, he must either seek knowledge or solve puzzles (but not both); given he solves puzzles, he does not seek knowledge. If (conducts research xor collects data) then seeks knowledge; since he does not seek knowledge, not (research xor data). He does not analyze results, and (analyze results xor collect data), so he collects data. With not (research xor data) and collecting data, he also conducts research. Anyone who makes a breakthrough or wins awards inspires others; since Augustine does not inspire others, he neither makes a breakthrough nor wins awards. Given he conducts research and (conducts research -> unknown or breakthrough), and he did not make a breakthrough, he is an unknown scientist. Since he is either famous or unknown (but not both), being unknown implies he is not famous. Therefore, the statement 'Augustine is a famous scientist' is false.",
  "answer": "B"

Correct: Yes
