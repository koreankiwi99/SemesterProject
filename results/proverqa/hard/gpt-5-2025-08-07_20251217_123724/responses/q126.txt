Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Andy does not oppose terraforming.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Andy cares about nature, so he pursues sustainable living. By the XOR (pursues sustainable living or values environmental engineering), he does not value environmental engineering. Andy does not have practical skills, and by the XOR (practical skills or innovative ideas), he has innovative ideas. Innovative ideas imply he believes in space exploration. Believing in space exploration implies he supports terraforming. Given the XOR (supports terraforming or opposes it), supporting means he does not oppose terraforming. Therefore, the statement is true.",
  "answer": "A"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
