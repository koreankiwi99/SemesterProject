Question ID: 127
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Sapphire is attuned to elements. If Sapphire masters elemental magic, then she is either a skilled crystalweaver or can forge powerful talismans, but not both. Sapphire either crafts innovative jewelry or weaves protection spells, but not both. Sapphire does not control water elements. Sapphire does not create legendary artifacts. If Sapphire wields earth energy or harnesses air magic, then she can master elemental magic. If Sapphire is attuned to elements, then she is either able to craft innovative jewelry or forge powerful talismans, but not both. Sapphire summons fire energy. Sapphire either summons fire energy or weaves protection spells, but not both. If Sapphire is a skilled crystalweaver, then she can either create legendary artifacts or revolutionize magical practices, but not both. Sapphire either controls water elements or harnesses air magic, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sapphire does not revolutionize magical practices.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Sapphire does not control water and must, by XOR, harness air. Harnessing air implies she masters elemental magic. Being attuned implies XOR(craft jewelry, forge talismans). She summons fire and, by XOR with weaving protection, does not weave protection; combined with XOR(craft jewelry, weave protection), she crafts innovative jewelry, so she does not forge talismans. From mastering magic and XOR(crystalweaver, forge talismans), she must be a skilled crystalweaver. As a crystalweaver, XOR(create legendary artifacts, revolutionize) holds; given she does not create legendary artifacts, she must revolutionize magical practices. Therefore, the statement that she does not revolutionize magical practices is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
