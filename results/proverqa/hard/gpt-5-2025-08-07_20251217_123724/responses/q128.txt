Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Nathalia goes hiking and does not camp, so by the XOR rule she has outdoor hobbies; hence she either loves nature or appreciates scenic views. Since she does not appreciate scenic views, she loves nature. She values humility, and for her achieving success and valuing humility are mutually exclusive, so she does not achieve success. From (pushes limits XOR develops skills) -> success and not success, we get not (XOR); with not pushing limits, this implies she does not develop skills. Given enjoys challenges and (enjoys challenges AND seeks thrills) -> develops skills, not developing skills implies she does not seek thrills. From (takes risks OR seeks thrills), she takes risks; thus, by (timid OR takes risks) -> adventurous, she is adventurous. However, she is stated to be either fearless or timid, but not both, and nothing determines which one holds. Both cases are consistent with the facts. Therefore, whether she is not fearless cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
