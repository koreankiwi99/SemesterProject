==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Gavin tells impactful stories and does not build trust, so he must be dedicated. From dedication, exactly one of passionate or strategic holds. Gavin sets goals and thinks critically; by the XOR rule, he is not result-oriented. If he were strategic, then (strategic -> result-oriented) would force result-oriented, contradicting the previous result; hence he is not strategic and thus is passionate. Passion implies Gavin is tenacious. Gavin does not investigate social issues and does expose injustice, so by the XOR rule he raises awareness; with not challenging the status quo, the XOR rule implies he sparks crucial conversations. Tenacity entails exactly one of breaks barriers or sparks crucial conversations; since he sparks crucial conversations, he does not break barriers.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
