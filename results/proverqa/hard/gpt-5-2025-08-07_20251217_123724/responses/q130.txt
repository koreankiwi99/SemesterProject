  "reasoning": "Waylen is open-minded and does not challenge the status quo, so by the exclusive rule he must reject stereotypes. He takes risks, and since seeking social approval or taking risks is exclusive, he does not seek social approval. Given the exclusive choice between seeking social approval and valuing uniqueness, he values uniqueness. Valuing uniqueness and rejecting stereotypes implies he embraces his individuality. Since conforming to social norms or embracing individuality is exclusive, he does not conform. Given that conforming and expressing authentically are exclusive, he must express himself authentically.
