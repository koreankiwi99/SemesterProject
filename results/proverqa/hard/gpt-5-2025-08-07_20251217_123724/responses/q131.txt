Question ID: 131
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Cupcake has golden eyes. If Cupcake is a solitary snake, then she lives in the rainforest. Cupcake is wild. Cupcake either has deadly precision or strikes quickly. Cupcake is not large. Cupcake is not carnivorous. If Cupcake is a wild snake and harmless, then she is not fierce. If Cupcake is aggressive, then she is venomous and dominates her territory. Cupcake has sharp fangs. If Cupcake has black scales, then she either has a coiled body or is large. If Cupcake lives in the rainforest, then she is either fierce or has deadly precision, but not both. For every snake, it is either venomous or non-venomous, but not both. Cupcake does not strike quickly. All snakes that have sharp teeth and attack preys are fierce. All snakes that have a coiled body and sharp fangs are carnivorous. If Cupcake has golden eyes, then she is either a snake that lives in the rainforest or a snake with black scales, but not both. Every snake is either harmless or venomous.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cupcake is non-venomous.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "From not striking quickly and the disjunction, Cupcake has deadly precision. Golden eyes imply exactly one of rainforest or black scales. Since she is not large and has sharp fangs but is not carnivorous, the contrapositive of (coiled body and sharp fangs -> carnivorous) gives not coiled; with not large, the rule (black scales -> coiled or large) would be violated if she had black scales, so she does not have black scales. Therefore, by the XOR, she lives in the rainforest. With rainforest and deadly precision, the XOR (fierce or deadly precision) yields not fierce. None of these facts link to being venomous or non-venomous. We only know snakes are either venomous or non-venomous (but not both) and either harmless or venomous, but we cannot derive venomous or its negation. Hence whether Cupcake is non-venomous cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
