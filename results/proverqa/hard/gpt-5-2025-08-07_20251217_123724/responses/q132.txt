{
  "reasoning": "Samantha works hard, so she learns through practice. Everyone who learns through practice either develops creative solutions or has vocational training; since she does not develop creative solutions, she has vocational training. She is not self-taught, so (self-taught XOR vocational training) holds, making her a mechanic. As a mechanic, she has exactly one of formal education or apprenticeship; given she has apprenticeship training, she does not have formal education. She fixes problems, so she has hands-on experience. Now (formal education XOR hands-on experience) holds (false XOR true), so she is skilled. Therefore, the statement 'Samantha is not skilled' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
