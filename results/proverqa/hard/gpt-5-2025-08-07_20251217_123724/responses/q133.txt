Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Rudy investigates human nature and does not examine sociology, so from the XOR rule he studies anthropology. From the XOR rule (studies anthropology or teaches philosophy), this makes teaching philosophy false. Rudy publishes research, so (teaches philosophy XOR explores metaphysics); since he does not teach philosophy, he explores metaphysics. With (not cosmology) and (explores metaphysics), the (cosmology XOR explores metaphysics) condition holds, so Rudy understands the mysteries of existence. If he understands the mysteries of existence, then (inspires others XOR writes influential books). Rudy ponders questions and seeks truth; as a philosopher this implies he delves into concepts, and every philosopher who delves into concepts either inspires others or shapes minds. Given Rudy does not shape minds, he inspires others. Therefore, by the XOR with understanding the mysteries of existence, he does not write influential books. Hence, 'Rudy does not write influential books' is true.",
  "answer": "A"
