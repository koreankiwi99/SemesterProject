Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Ensley is an entrepreneur, and entrepreneurs must be either environmentally conscious or support sustainability, but not both. Since Ensley does not support sustainability, she is environmentally conscious. As a local business owner, she must be either environmentally conscious or live in the suburbs, but not both; thus, since she is environmentally conscious, she does not live in the suburbs. If (urban dweller XOR suburbs) then community oriented; given she is not community oriented and not in the suburbs, she cannot be an urban dweller. From 'urban dweller or rural resident' and not urban, she must be a rural resident. Given 'city enthusiast XOR rural resident', being a rural resident means she is not a city enthusiast. From 'nature lover XOR city enthusiast', not being a city enthusiast implies she is a nature lover. Therefore, the statement 'Ensley is a nature lover' is true.",
  "answer": "A"
