Question ID: 137
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Coraline is a botanist, then she either focuses on flora or explores deserts, but not both. Coraline either publishes research papers or develops new technologies, but not both. If someone explores deserts, then they do not necessarily study cacti, and if someone studies cacti, then they do not necessarily explore deserts. Coraline either works independently or collaborates with colleagues, but not both. Coraline teaches students or publishes research papers. Coraline is a botanist. If Coraline studies cacti, then she can either develop new technologies or inspire new generations, but not both. Coraline either collaborates with colleagues or publishes research papers, but not both. Coraline does not work independently. Coraline focuses on flora.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Coraline does not inspire new generations.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Coraline is a botanist and focuses on flora; by the XOR with exploring deserts, she does not explore deserts. She does not work independently; by the XOR, she collaborates. By the XOR between collaborating and publishing, she does not publish. By the XOR between publishing and developing technologies, she develops new technologies. Since she must either teach or publish and she does not publish, she teaches. The only constraint on inspiring new generations is conditional: if she studies cacti, then (develops new technologies XOR inspires). Given she develops new technologies, if she studies cacti, she would not inspire. However, it is unknown whether she studies cacti, and if she does not, there is no rule preventing her from inspiring. Therefore, whether she does not inspire is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
