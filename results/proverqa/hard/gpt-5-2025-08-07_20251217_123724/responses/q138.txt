Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From studying abroad and the XOR rule about broadening perspective, Koa must also immerse himself in a foreign culture (otherwise he would broaden his perspective, which he does not). Immersing implies he either appreciates indigenous history or values native traditions; since he does not value native traditions, he appreciates indigenous history. Appreciating indigenous history implies he either respects local culture or supports local artisans; given he collects artifacts and patronizes local businesses (hence does not support local artisans), he must respect local culture. Respecting local culture implies he either masters traditional crafts or shares local knowledge (or both). However, nothing rules out mastering crafts: the only related rule is that mastering or learning the language implies he can become a community leader, and “does not become a community leader” does not negate “can become.” Therefore, we cannot determine whether he shares local knowledge; it could be true or false.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
