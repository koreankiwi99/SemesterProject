{
  "reasoning": "Aileen is globally influenced, and the statement says she is globally influenced or culturally appreciative, but not both. Therefore, culturally appreciative is false. The target statement is thus equivalent to (artistically talented AND community oriented). We only know Aileen either values tradition or is artistically talented (not which), and we have no information about community oriented at all. Hence we cannot determine whether (artistically talented AND community oriented) holds. Therefore, the statement is uncertain.",
