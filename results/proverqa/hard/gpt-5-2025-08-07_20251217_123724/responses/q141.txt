Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Violeta follows fertility treatment and sees a specialist, so she does receive some treatment. However, there is no explicit link that this treatment is \"Violeta's treatment\" (i.e., administered by Violeta herself). From the contrapositive of (medical knowledge or helps patients) -> can make accurate diagnoses, and given she cannot make accurate diagnoses and lacks medical knowledge, we infer she does not help patients. This suggests she does not treat patients, but it does not definitively rule out self-treatment, nor does any statement assert she receives her own treatment. Therefore, whether she receives \"Violeta's treatment\" cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
