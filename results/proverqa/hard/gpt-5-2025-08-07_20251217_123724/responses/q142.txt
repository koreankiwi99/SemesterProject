Question ID: 142
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Kyro explores cosmology. Kyro does not achieve breakthroughs. If Nash pursues interdimensional travel, then he will visit a parallel dimension. Amelia does not make history. If someone embraces curiosity and paves new paths, then they can achieve breakthroughs. Kyro either explores cosmology or studies physics, but not both. Kyro does not gain recognition. Kyro studies physics or pursues interdimensional travel. If Kyro pursues interdimensional travel, then he will visit a parallel dimension. If Kyro visits a parallel dimension, then he will either revolutionize our understanding of the universe or open up new possibilities, but not both. Anyone who thinks outside the box or dreams big can pave new paths. All people who read widely and ask questions will embrace curiosity. Anyone who opens up new possibilities either gains recognition or inspires innovation (or both). Kyro does not push boundaries. Kyro does not make history. Anyone who thinks outside the box will open up new possibilities. Anyone who thinks creatively or makes discoveries will push boundaries. Anyone who inspires innovation either makes history or paves new paths (or both). If Kyro either embraces curiosity or seeks answers (but not both), then he makes discoveries. If Kyro solves complex equations or conducts experiments, then he studies physics. Kyro seeks answers.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kyro revolutionizes our understanding of the universe.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Kyro explores cosmology, and since he either explores cosmology or studies physics (but not both), he does not study physics. Given he either studies physics or pursues interdimensional travel, he must pursue interdimensional travel, hence he visits a parallel dimension. From visiting a parallel dimension, he will either revolutionize our understanding of the universe or open up new possibilities, but not both. Using other facts: Kyro seeks answers and does not push boundaries. Since (embraces curiosity XOR seeks answers) implies making discoveries and making discoveries implies pushing boundaries, his not pushing boundaries forces that both holds, so he embraces curiosity but does not make discoveries. If he opens up new possibilities, then (given he does not gain recognition) he must inspire innovation, which (given he does not make history) implies he paves new paths. With embracing curiosity and paving new paths, he can achieve breakthroughs, which does not contradict that he does not achieve breakthroughs. Thus the ‘open up new possibilities’ branch is consistent; the ‘revolutionize’ branch is also not ruled out by any statement. Therefore, we cannot determine which outcome holds.",
