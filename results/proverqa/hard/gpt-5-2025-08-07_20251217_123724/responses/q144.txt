==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "The only rule that yields \"Selah builds a successful business\" is: if Selah is passionate about cooking, then she creates unique recipes and builds a successful business. We know she creates unique recipes, but that does not imply she is passionate (the implication is one-way). We also have a disjunction: Selah enjoys food or is passionate about cooking, but nothing rules out the \"enjoys food\" branch, so we cannot conclude she is passionate. Therefore, we cannot determine whether she builds a successful business.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
