Question ID: 145
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Margot is adaptable or has experience. If Margot either thinks critically or acts quickly (but not both), then she has resourcefulness. Margot faces challenges. If Margot travels alone, then she is either adaptable or follows plans, but not both. For all humans, if they are determined and have resourcefulness, then they can overcome challenges. Margot learns lessons. Margot does not have experience. For all humans, if someone seeks adventure, then they take risks and push their limits. For all humans, if they either overcome challenges or seek adventures, then they are resilient. Everyone who handles uncertainty either stays focused or thinks critically (or both). If Margot faces challenges, then she thinks critically and learns lessons. Anyone who tries new things and enjoys freedom seeks adventure. If Margot is adaptable, then she either stays calm or acts quickly (but not both). Margot avoids uncertainty. Margot stays calm. Margot does not take risks. Margot is either resilient or avoids uncertainty, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Margot is not determined.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Margot does not have experience, so from \"adaptable or has experience\" she is adaptable. Given adaptable and that she stays calm, the XOR rule (stays calm or acts quickly) makes acts quickly false. Facing challenges implies she thinks critically; with thinks critically true and acts quickly false, the XOR condition (thinks critically or acts quickly) is satisfied, so she has resourcefulness. If Margot were determined, then determined ∧ resourcefulness would imply she overcomes challenges, which (overcomes challenges or seeks adventure) would make her resilient. But Margot avoids uncertainty and is in an exclusive-or with being resilient, so she cannot be resilient. Therefore she cannot be determined. (Consistently, she also does not take risks, so she does not seek adventure, removing that alternate route to resilience.) Hence, Margot is not determined.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
