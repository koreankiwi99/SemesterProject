  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Madeleine cares for others, so she shows empathy. Given the XOR rule (understands others or shows empathy), she therefore does not understand others. From the universal statement that everyone either uses language to communicate or understands others, and since she does not understand others, it follows that Madeleine uses language to communicate. There is no information implying Madeleine is erudite (the only given route to possessing cognitive skills), nor any other rule linking her known traits to cognitive skills. Thus, whether she possesses cognitive skills is undetermined, while her using language is true. The conjunction is therefore not established as true or false, making it uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
