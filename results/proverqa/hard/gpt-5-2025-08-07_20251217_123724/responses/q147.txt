Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From attacks problems and good instincts, Ashton thinks creatively. Being resourceful implies he is either adaptable or experienced (but not both). If adaptable, then (works well under pressure xor thinks creatively); since he thinks creatively, that would make working well under pressure false, consistent with not staying calm and their mutual exclusivity. Also, (embraces challenges and experienced) implies overcoming obstacles, but Ashton cannot overcome obstacles, so he cannot have both embracing challenges and experience. None of the premises relate to enabling exploration, so we cannot determine whether Ashton enables exploration or not.",
  "answer": "C"
}
