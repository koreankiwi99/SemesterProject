{
  "reasoning": "Emmy is a discerning diner, so she is either a sommelier or has refined taste (but not both). Since anyone who is a sommelier or has wine knowledge appreciates fine wine and Emmy does not appreciate fine wine, she is not a sommelier; therefore she has refined taste. Emmy pioneers new recipes, so she is a culinary innovator; with refined taste implying either food critic or culinary innovator (but not both), she is not a food critic. From the rule \"if (experiments with ingredients or understands flavors, but not both) then creates masterpieces\" and given Emmy does not experiment and does not create masterpieces, it follows she does not understand flavors; by contrapositive of the rule linking (culinary expert or food critic, but not both) to understanding flavors, she is not a culinary expert either. No statements connect any of these traits to appreciating cultural heritage. Hence, whether Emmy appreciates cultural heritage cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
