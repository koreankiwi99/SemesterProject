==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Mckenzie has a scientific background, and since she either has a scientific background or is an ecologist (but not both), she is not an ecologist. Because she protects the environment and must be either a conservationist or an ecologist (but not both), she is a conservationist. As a conservationist, she is either a veterinarian or works with animals, but not both. Mckenzie understands animal behavior, so she can be (is taken to be) a zoologist; zoologists are either veterinarians or animal researchers, but not both, and Mckenzie is an animal researcher, so she is not a veterinarian. Therefore, as a conservationist she must be the other option: she works with animals. If Mckenzie works with animals, then she is an elephant handler. Hence, Mckenzie handles elephants.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
