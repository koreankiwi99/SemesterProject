Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Monroe listens actively, and since he does not find common ground, he must build strong relationships. From 'If Monroe builds trust then he thinks critically' and 'Monroe does not think critically,' we infer he does not build trust. He is either diplomatic or impulsive, but not both. The only link to diplomacy is that being diplomatic (or building trust) implies resolving conflicts; since he does not build trust, if he were diplomatic he would resolve conflicts, but the converse is not given. Nothing rules out him being impulsive, and remaining calm does not formally exclude impulsiveness. Given no rule determines whether he is diplomatic or impulsive, both remain consistent with the facts. Therefore, whether Monroe is not impulsive is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
