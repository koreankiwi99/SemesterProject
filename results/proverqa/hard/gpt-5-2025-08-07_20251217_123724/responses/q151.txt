Question ID: 151
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Mia is highly respected, then she is either an expert in her field or charismatic, but not both. Mia is not charismatic. Anyone who has expertise in their field either serves clients well or adeptly navigates complex markets (or both). If someone has high integrity, then they build trust and achieve success. Mia either manages risk or serves clients, but not necessarily both. If Mia is either of high integrity or highly skilled (but not both), then she is highly respected. Mia builds trust. Mia communicates effectively with her clients. Mia does not achieve success. Everyone either navigates complex financial markets or communicates effectively with their clients, but not both is not a requirement. Mia manages risk.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Mia is not highly skilled.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From high integrity -> (builds trust AND achieves success) and the facts that Mia builds trust but does not achieve success, we infer by contrapositive that Mia is not of high integrity. The only rule involving high skill is (high integrity XOR highly skilled) -> highly respected. Since Mia is not of high integrity, this reduces to: if she is highly skilled, then she is highly respected. This does not let us conclude whether she is highly skilled or not. Assuming she is highly skilled leads to no contradiction (it would imply she is highly respected and an expert, which is consistent with all facts). Assuming she is not highly skilled is also consistent. Therefore, whether Mia is highly skilled cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
