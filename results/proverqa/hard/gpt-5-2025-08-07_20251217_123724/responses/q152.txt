Question ID: 152
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Sylvia studies electromagnetic waves and conducts innovative experiments, then she will make groundbreaking discoveries. Sylvia understands wave theory. If Sylvia explores new ideas, then she either collaborates with others or advances her field. If someone collects data and understands wave theory, then they can analyze signal patterns. Sylvia does not advance her field. Sylvia explores new ideas or conducts innovative experiments. Sylvia builds on existing research. If Sylvia has a PhD, then she either analyzes signal patterns or specializes in acoustics, but not both. Sylvia collects data. If someone has curiosity, then they explore new ideas and solve complex problems. If Sylvia either analyzes signal patterns or studies electromagnetic waves (but not both), then she pioneers new technologies. For Sylvia, pioneering new technologies and building on existing research are mutually exclusive. Sylvia does not collaborate with others.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sylvia will make groundbreaking discoveries.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "Sylvia collects data and understands wave theory, so she can analyze signal patterns. Pioneering new technologies and building on existing research are mutually exclusive; since she builds on existing research, she does not pioneer new technologies. The rule (analyze signal patterns XOR study electromagnetic waves) implies pioneering; since she does not pioneer and she does analyze signal patterns, she must also study electromagnetic waves (making the XOR false). From 'explores new ideas -> collaborates or advances' and given she neither collaborates nor advances, she does not explore new ideas. Given 'explores new ideas or conducts innovative experiments', she must conduct innovative experiments. Now she both studies electromagnetic waves and conducts innovative experiments, so she will make groundbreaking discoveries.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
