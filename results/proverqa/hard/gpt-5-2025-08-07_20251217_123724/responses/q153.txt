{
  "reasoning": "Evelyn has a positive outlook, so she either appreciates beauty or enjoys life, but not both. Given she appreciates beauty, she does not enjoy life. Everyone enjoys life or pursues happiness; since she does not enjoy life, she pursues happiness. She either pursues happiness or finds inner peace, but not both; thus she does not find inner peace. She either finds inner peace or experiences hardship, but not both; hence she experiences hardship. Anyone who experiences hardship (or loves unconditionally) develops resilience; therefore Evelyn develops resilience. So the statement that she does not develop resilience is false.",
