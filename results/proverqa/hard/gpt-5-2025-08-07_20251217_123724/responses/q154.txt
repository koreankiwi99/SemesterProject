Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Presley works outdoors (and enjoys gardening), so he specializes in landscaping (L). From L xor D, D is false. From D xor B, B is true, hence he understands physics (P). Also, not engineering and (architect xor engineering) implies he is an architect (A). From A -> (P xor M) and P true, it follows M (appreciates mathematics) is false. Given (M or V) must hold, with M false, V (values artistic expression) must be true.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
