Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "Elina loves reading, and since she either enjoys the outdoors or loves reading but not both, she does not enjoy the outdoors. From 'enjoys the outdoors or is a professional athlete', she is a professional athlete. Elina learns from her failures, and given the XOR with tracking progress, she does not track her progress. If XOR(tracks progress, sets goals) then she achieves success; since she does not track progress, setting goals would imply success. But Elina does not perform well, and from 'if achieves success or stays motivated then perform well', contraposition gives that she does not achieve success; thus she does not set goals. From 'sets goals or stays disciplined', she must stay disciplined. As a professional athlete with XOR(overcomes fear, stays disciplined), she does not overcome fear. The only rule about mastering extreme sports is: if she masters extreme sports, then she can overcome fear. We have no information negating 'can overcome fear', and not overcoming fear does not imply not being able to overcome fear. Therefore, whether she masters extreme sports cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
