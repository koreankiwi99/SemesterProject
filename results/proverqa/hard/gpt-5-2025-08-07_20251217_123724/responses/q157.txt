Question ID: 157
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Anyone who reads widely and thinks critically can have innovative thoughts. Rosalia is creative. Anyone who keeps detailed notes or measures carefully can value precision. Rosalia is attentive. Rosalia does not rely on intuition. Rosalia conducts experiments. For Rosalia, she is either logical or relies on intuition, but not both. Rosalia does not publish research. If Rosalia can solve complex problems, then she is either creative or logical (but not both). If Rosalia is attentive, then she is either detail-oriented or can appreciate beauty, but not both. If Rosalia loves nature or has a calm mind, then she is likely to make groundbreaking discoveries. Rosalia does not have keen observation. Rosalia does not think outside the box. If Rosalia either makes groundbreaking discoveries or publishes research (but not both), then she has innovative thoughts. If someone conducts experiments, then they value precision. Anyone who has keen observation or loves nature can appreciate beauty. If Rosalia either thinks outside the box or has innovative thoughts (but not both), then she can solve complex problems.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rosalia has a calm mind.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Rosalia does not rely on intuition and must be logical (exclusive-or). Being both creative and logical makes the XOR in the rule 'if she can solve complex problems then (creative XOR logical)' false; by contrapositive, she cannot solve complex problems. From 'if (thinks outside the box XOR has innovative thoughts) then can solve complex problems' and given she does not think outside the box, it follows she does not have innovative thoughts. Using 'if (makes groundbreaking discoveries XOR publishes research) then innovative thoughts' with not innovative thoughts and not publishing research, we conclude she does not make groundbreaking discoveries. The only link to a calm mind is: if she loves nature or has a calm mind, then she is likely to make groundbreaking discoveries. This does not let us infer whether she has a calm mind (nor its negation), since we have no information about being 'likely to make' discoveries. Therefore, the statement about having a calm mind is not determined.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
