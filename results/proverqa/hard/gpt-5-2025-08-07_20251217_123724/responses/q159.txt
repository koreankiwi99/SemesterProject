Context:
Thomas either makes a social impact or pursues personal gain, but not both. If Thomas contributes to wildlife conservation, then he either has ecological knowledge or takes community action, but not both. If someone possesses expertise and shares knowledge, then they can educate others. If Thomas either lives in the savannah or works with animals (but not both), then he protects the environment. Thomas supports conservation or pursues academic research. Thomas pursues personal gain. Thomas either pursues academic research or educates others, but not both. Everyone who protects the environment loves nature. If Thomas either takes community action or educates others (but not both), then he makes a social impact. If Thomas studies the elands or lives in the savannah (or both), then he contributes to wildlife conservation. Thomas does not love nature. If Thomas either tracks wildlife or explores rural areas (but not both), then he lives in the savannah. Thomas does not understand animal behavior. Thomas values biodiversity or has ecological knowledge. If Thomas has ecological knowledge, then he understands animal behavior. Thomas does not work with animals. Thomas does not support conservation.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Thomas pursues personal gain, so by the XOR with social impact, he does not make a social impact. From not social impact and (community action XOR educates) implying social impact, we get neither community action nor educates; also from supports conservation or academic research plus not supports conservation, he pursues academic research, consistent with not educating. Not loving nature and (protects environment -> loves nature) implies he does not protect the environment. From (lives in savannah XOR works with animals) -> protects environment and not protects environment, we get not (lives in savannah XOR works with animals); given he does not work with animals, he also does not live in the savannah. From not understanding animal behavior and (ecological knowledge -> understands animal behavior), we get not ecological knowledge. If he contributed to wildlife conservation, then (ecological knowledge XOR community action) would hold, but both are false; hence he does not contribute to wildlife conservation. Since (studies elands or lives in the savannah) implies contributes to wildlife conservation and he does not contribute, we conclude neither studies elands nor lives in the savannah. Therefore, Thomas does not study the elands.",
