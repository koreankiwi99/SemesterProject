==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'If Theo values precision, then he achieves success' and 'Theo does not achieve success', Theo does not value precision. Given 'Theo is either (detail-oriented and values precision) or curious, but not both', he must be curious. From curiosity and 'either thinks outside the box or takes risks (but not both)', together with 'Theo takes risks', it follows Theo does not think outside the box. Since 'If someone pursues creativity, then they think outside the box', Theo does not pursue creativity. From 'Theo either pursues creativity or revolutionizes industries', he therefore revolutionizes industries. However, there is no rule connecting 'innovative' to thinking outside the box or revolutionizing industries. Thus, whether Theo is (not) innovative cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
