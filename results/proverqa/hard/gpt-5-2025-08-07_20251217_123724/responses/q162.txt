Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "Sweetie requires intensive care, so by the XOR with making a good companion, she is not a good companion. From (high-strung or good breeding) -> good companion and the contrapositive, she is neither high-strung nor of good breeding. By the XOR between calm-and-patient and high-strung, she is calm-and-patient. From trusting nature, she is naturally calm; combined with being well-trained, both well-trained and naturally calm are true. If she were an experienced mount, then (well-trained XOR naturally calm) would have to hold, which contradicts both being true; hence she is not an experienced mount. By the XOR between being ridden by a skilled rider and being an experienced mount, she is ridden by a skilled rider. There is no rule connecting being ridden by a skilled rider to not being ridden by a novice rider, so whether she is not ridden by a novice rider cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
