Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Enoch does not craft beautiful pieces. From the rule that if Enoch works with precision XOR creates intricate designs, then he crafts beautiful pieces, we infer that this XOR condition is false—so either both are true or both are false. We also know Enoch either makes artistic pieces or creates intricate designs, so creates intricate designs remains possible but not guaranteed. The only rule that yields 'pays attention to detail' is: if someone is a skilled plasterer, then they create intricate designs or pay attention to detail. Enoch would be a skilled plasterer only if he appreciates beauty (given) and has a patient nature (unknown). No premises establish that Enoch has a patient nature, and no other rule implies attention to detail. Therefore, whether Enoch pays attention to detail cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
