Question ID: 164
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Kennedi rejects inbreeding, then she either prioritizes inclusivity or embraces cultural exchange (but not both). If Caroline either respects all backgrounds or values social mixing (but not both), then she prioritizes inclusivity. Caroline seeks change. Caroline does not seek a global perspective. Caroline will marry outside her family if she rejects tradition. If Lakelyn values diversity and seeks global connections, then she is likely to marry outside her family. If Caroline seeks change, then she either values open-mindedness or prioritizes inclusivity (or both). If Reece either seeks a global perspective or fosters social connections (but not both), then she rejects inbreeding. If Caroline rejects inbreeding, then she either prioritizes inclusivity or embraces cultural exchange (but not both). If Caroline values diversity and seeks global connections, then she is likely to marry outside her family. Reece appreciates culture or values diversity. If Caroline either seeks a global perspective or fosters social connections (but not both), then she rejects inbreeding. Caroline appreciates culture or values diversity. If Caroline desires personal growth, then she seeks global connections and embraces new experiences. Lakelyn does not seek a global perspective. For all humans, if they marry outside their family, then they reduce genetic disorders and improve their health prospects. Caroline either embraces cultural exchange or seeks global connections. Caroline does not appreciate culture. Caroline improves her health prospects. Caroline fosters social connections. Caroline does not value open-mindedness.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Caroline reduces genetic disorders.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From seeks change and not valuing open-mindedness, Caroline prioritizes inclusivity. She fosters social connections and does not seek a global perspective; by the XOR rule this implies she rejects inbreeding. Rejecting inbreeding (with the XOR) and already prioritizing inclusivity implies she does not embrace cultural exchange. Given she either embraces cultural exchange or seeks global connections, she must seek global connections. Since she does not appreciate culture and must either appreciate culture or value diversity, she values diversity. Values diversity + seeks global connections implies she is likely to marry outside her family, but this does not guarantee that she actually marries outside her family. Only actual marriage outside the family entails reducing genetic disorders. The given fact that she improves her health prospects does not let us conclude she marries outside or reduces genetic disorders. Therefore, whether she reduces genetic disorders is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
