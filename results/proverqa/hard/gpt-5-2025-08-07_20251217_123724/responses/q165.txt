{
  "reasoning": "Jon experiences a health scare and does not seek medical attention, so he has a medical condition. If he has a medical condition, then he either changes his lifestyle or learns preventive methods, but not both. Since Jon changes his lifestyle, he does not learn methods to prevent future episodes. There is no information that he quits singing, nor any link from experiencing laryngospasm to quitting singing. We also do not know whether Jon actually experienced laryngospasm. Therefore, we cannot determine that the stated conditional holds.",
