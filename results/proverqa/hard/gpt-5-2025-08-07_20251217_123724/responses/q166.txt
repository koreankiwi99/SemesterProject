Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Rocco works with his local community, so he does not expose corruption (exclusive or). He does not raise awareness, and since he either raises awareness or speaks against discrimination, he must speak against discrimination. Given the XOR rule (speaks against discrimination or exposes corruption, but not both) implies challenges unfair systems, Rocco challenges unfair systems. Rocco is outspoken and does not support human rights, so by the outspoken XOR rule he stands up for others. Standing up for others and challenging unfair systems implies he fights for equality. However, there is no rule connecting Rocco fighting for equality to valuing social justice. Thus, whether Rocco values social justice cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}
