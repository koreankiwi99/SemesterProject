Question ID: 167
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Kevin protects marine life or studies the ocean. Vida either explores terrestrial ecosystems or studies the ocean, but not both. Kevin either investigates ecosystems or pursues space research. Kevin conducts research. If Kevin has a backpack or enjoys hiking, then he can explore terrestrial ecosystems. Kevin is a professor. If someone educates students, then they do not necessarily inspire others, and vice versa. If Kevin has passion, then he can either inspire others or develop innovative solutions, but not both. Kevin does not investigate ecosystems. Kevin either explores terrestrial ecosystems or studies the ocean, but not both. If Kevin studies the ocean, then he can either discover new species or inspire others, but not both. If Kevin is a professor, then he either conducts research or educates students, but not both. Kevin either pursues space research or explores terrestrial ecosystems, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kevin discovers new species.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Kevin does not investigate ecosystems, and since he either investigates ecosystems or pursues space research, he must pursue space research. Given the XOR between pursuing space research and exploring terrestrial ecosystems, he does not explore terrestrial ecosystems. From the XOR between exploring terrestrial ecosystems and studying the ocean, he therefore studies the ocean. As a professor, he either conducts research or educates students (but not both), and since he conducts research, he does not educate students. If he studies the ocean, then exactly one of the following is true: he discovers new species or he inspires others. There is no further information to choose between these two outcomes. Hence, whether Kevin discovers new species is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
