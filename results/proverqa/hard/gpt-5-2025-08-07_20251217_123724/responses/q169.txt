Question ID: 169
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Avah either advances her field or becomes a public figure, but not both. If Avah either reads academic papers or attends conferences (but not both), then she is a researcher. Avah has strong attention to detail. For all humans, if someone is a skilled forensic scientist, then they can solve complex cases and earn professional recognition. If Yareli makes key discoveries, then she will earn professional recognition. Avah has a PhD. If someone works diligently and makes key discoveries, then they will gain expertise. Avah thinks critically. Ariana pursues new fields. Yareli has strong attention to detail. Anyone who has sharp insight or develops new techniques can earn professional recognition. If Avah has a PhD, then she is either a researcher or a skilled forensic scientist, but not both. If Lily has a PhD, then she is either a researcher or a skilled forensic scientist, but not both. If someone conducts experiments and interprets results, then they can publish papers. Avah pursues new fields. If Avah analyzes evidence, then she is either a skilled forensic scientist or can crack codes. Avah works diligently. Avah either gains expertise in forensic chemistry or pursues new fields, but not both. Yareli becomes a public figure. Avah shares knowledge or publishes papers. Lily either gains expertise in forensic chemistry or pursues new fields, but not both. Avah becomes a public figure. Ariana either advances her field or becomes a public figure, but not both. Yareli thinks critically. For all humans, if someone is a researcher and publishes papers, then they advance their field. All individuals who have strong attention to detail think critically and interpret results. Avah conducts experiments. Ariana has a PhD.

Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "From Avah’s PhD, she is either a researcher or a skilled forensic scientist (but not both). She becomes a public figure, so she does not advance her field. If she were a researcher and published papers, she would advance her field; since she does not, we only know not (researcher and publishes), which does not tell us whether she is a researcher or a skilled forensic scientist. If she is a skilled forensic scientist, then she can solve complex cases; if she is a researcher (and not skilled forensic scientist), we have no rule implying she can solve complex cases. We cannot determine which role she has, nor whether she publishes. Therefore, whether Avah can solve complex cases remains undetermined.",
  "answer": "C"

Result:

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
