Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From disciplined and the given XOR rule, and the fact that Lucian leads teams, he does not win competitions. Given he does not set goals and the rule that he either sets goals or stays focused, he stays focused. The XOR rule linking wins to exactly one of (stays focused, makes strategic moves) being true, together with not winning and staying focused, implies he also makes strategic moves (both true, so the XOR antecedent is false). None of these facts address whether he works hard. The only relevant universal is that everyone either has natural talent or works hard (or both), which does not let us conclude he does not work hard (nor that he does). There is no rule eliminating ‘works hard’ for Lucian. Therefore, whether Lucian does not work hard cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
