Difficulty: hard

Context:
Either Amaris is environmentally conscious or environmentally negligent, but not both. Yehuda does not use renewable energy. If someone reduces waste, then they respect nature. Uriah creates eco-friendly spaces. Uriah designs innovative buildings. Amaris creates eco-friendly spaces. Uriah does not protect endangered species. Uriah does not support conservation. If Uriah designs innovative buildings, then he uses local materials and advocates for climate action. For everyone, if they either make green choices or conserve water, then they value sustainability. All who embrace global citizenship build resilient communities and advocate for climate action. If Yehuda cares about wildlife, then he either supports conservation or protects endangered species, but not both. If Uriah is an architect, then he either makes green choices or prioritizes human health, but not both. If Uriah conserves water, then he either creates eco-friendly spaces or advocates for climate action (but not both). Uriah does not respect nature. Either Uriah is environmentally conscious or environmentally negligent, but not both. Uriah does not use renewable energy. Amaris does not support conservation. If Uriah builds structures, then he either values sustainability or prioritizes public health, but not both. Meilani designs innovative buildings. If Uriah has good design skills, then he either builds lasting structures or conserves water. Uriah prioritizes public health or is environmentally negligent. If Uriah is either environmentally negligent or cares about wildlife (but not both), then he makes green choices. If Uriah cares about wildlife, then he either supports conservation or protects endangered species, but not both. If Uriah values sustainability, then he either uses renewable energy or reduces waste, but not both. If Meilani values sustainability, then he either uses renewable energy or reduces waste, but not both. If Amaris is either environmentally negligent or cares about wildlife (but not both), then he makes green choices.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Uriah is not environmentally conscious.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Uriah does not support conservation and does not protect endangered species. Since caring about wildlife would require (supports XOR protects), he does not care about wildlife. Uriah does not use renewable energy and (if values sustainability then uses RE XOR reduces waste). Thus if he valued sustainability, he would reduce waste, which implies respecting nature—but we are told he does not respect nature. Therefore, Uriah does not value sustainability, hence he neither makes green choices nor conserves water. The rule (environmentally negligent XOR cares about wildlife) -> makes green choices now cannot have a true antecedent because he does not make green choices and does not care about wildlife; hence he is not environmentally negligent. Given the exclusive dichotomy (environmentally conscious XOR environmentally negligent), Uriah must be environmentally conscious. Therefore, the statement 'Uriah is not environmentally conscious' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
