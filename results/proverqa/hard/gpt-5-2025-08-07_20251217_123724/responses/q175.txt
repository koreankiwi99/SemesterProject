==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Zachary speaking multiple languages, he works internationally and values diversity; thus he lives abroad. Everyone who lives abroad either adapts or embraces local customs. Since adapting would require respecting traditions or building new connections, and Zachary does neither, he does not adapt; therefore he embraces local customs. He faces a cultural barrier and relies on intuition, which rules out seeking local guidance; hence he feels lost. Feeling lost (and not exploring new places) implies he immigrated recently, consistent with valuing diversity. However, no given rule connects any of these facts (embracing local customs, valuing diversity, not respecting traditions, etc.) to whether he retains or does not retain his original identity. Therefore, the truth of the statement cannot be determined from the premises.",
  "answer": "C"
