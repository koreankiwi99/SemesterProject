Question ID: 177
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Queenie either controls her growth or limits her consumption (but not both), then she will regulate her feeding. Queenie multiplies quickly. Queenie does not control her growth. Darling monitors her environment. Queenie monitors her environment. Queenie either coexists with her raccoon host or is harmful to her raccoon host, but not both. Queenie thrives in the dark. If Queenie thrives in the dark, then she responds to changes and multiplies quickly. If Queenie senses her host's status and adapts her behavior, then she will limit her consumption. Queenie adapts her behavior. Sophie adapts her behavior. Bumpkin is either harmful to her raccoon host or beneficial to her raccoon host, but not both. Every parasite that lives in a host either evades the immune system or responds to changes in its environment (or both). If Queenie regulates her feeding, then she will coexist with her host. Darling thrives in the dark. Queenie is either harmful to her raccoon host or beneficial to her raccoon host, but not both. If Sophie regulates her feeding, then she will coexist with her host. All parasites that evade the immune system regulate their feeding and feed on nutrients. Bumpkin either coexists with her raccoon host or is harmful to her raccoon host, but not both. If a parasite monitors its environment and responds to changes, then it can sense its host's status. Darling multiplies quickly. If a parasite either destroys tissues or disrupts digestion (but not both), then it is harmful to its host.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Queenie is beneficial to her raccoon host.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Queenie thrives in the dark, so she responds to changes. She also monitors her environment, and as a parasite with a host, monitoring plus responding implies she senses her host’s status. Sensing status and adapting her behavior implies she limits her consumption. She does not control her growth; having exactly one of {controls growth, limits consumption} true triggers regulating her feeding. Regulating feeding implies she coexists with her host. By the XOR rule, coexisting means she is not harmful. Another XOR states she is either harmful or beneficial (but not both); since she is not harmful, she must be beneficial. Therefore, Queenie is beneficial to her raccoon host.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
