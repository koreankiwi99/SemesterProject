Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "For every human, exactly one of: having a Bartholin gland disorder or normal Bartholin gland function holds. Anyone with a healthy reproductive system has normal Bartholin gland function. Lachlan's research subjects either practice good hygiene or have a healthy reproductive system; this does not force them to have a healthy reproductive system (they might only practice good hygiene). The condition that would guarantee a healthy reproductive system (exclusive-or of regulating hormones or maintaining fertility) is not established for the subjects. Hence we cannot determine whether they have normal function or a disorder.",
  "answer": "C"
}
