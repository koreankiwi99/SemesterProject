Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "Wyatt does not demonstrate proficiency. From (earns recognition or gains acclaim) -> demonstrates proficiency, contraposition gives that he neither earns recognition nor gains acclaim. From (strong foundations or produces quality work) -> earns recognition and not earning recognition, contraposition yields that Wyatt does not produce quality work (and reaffirms he lacks strong foundations). Given he has experience and (experience and pays attention to details) -> produces quality work, his lack of quality work implies he does not pay attention to details; by the XOR with mistakes, he makes mistakes. Also, meeting deadlines and avoiding details implies he rushes; by the XOR with working precisely, he does not work precisely; thus from (lacks practice or works precisely), he lacks practice. Lacking practice and making mistakes implies he is an inexperienced stonemason. Since he is either skilled or inexperienced, but not both, being inexperienced means he is not skilled. Therefore, the statement 'Wyatt is a skilled stonemason' is false.",
