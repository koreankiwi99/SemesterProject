==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Joshua does not gain experience. Since entering the workforce implies gaining experience and developing skills, and Joshua does develop skills, the lack of experience implies he did not enter the workforce. By the exclusive choice between entering the workforce and pursuing an advanced degree, he must pursue an advanced degree, which implies he obtains a PhD and thus teaches at a university. Teaching at a university excludes publishing findings, so he does not publish; given he must either collaborate or publish, he collaborates. Because he collaborates and 'makes new discoveries or collaborates' is exclusive, he does not make new discoveries. From 'if he dedicates himself to research, then he makes new discoveries,' the contrapositive gives that he does not dedicate himself to research. Therefore, the statement is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
