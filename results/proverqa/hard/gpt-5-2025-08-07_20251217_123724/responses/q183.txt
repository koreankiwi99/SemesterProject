Caden suffers setbacks. Ainhoa suffers setbacks. If Clay has ambition, then he either creates plans or takes action, but not both. If Ainhoa either sets goals or tracks progress (but not both), then he stays motivated. If Clay suffers setbacks, then he either refuses to give up or stays motivated, but not both. Clay pursues his passion. Caden takes action. Caden pursues his passion. If Caden suffers setbacks, then he either refuses to give up or stays motivated, but not both. If Caden has ambition, then he either creates plans or takes action, but not both. Clay takes action. Anyone who has support or learns from failure can stay motivated. If someone believes in themselves, then they work hard and set goals. Caden does not track progress. If Caden either identifies problems or evaluates risks (but not both), then he creates plans. Everyone who pursues their passion either makes an impact or has a vision (or both). Ainhoa has ambition. Caden has ambition. Brinley does not face adversity.

  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Caden pursues his passion and does not make an impact, so by the rule about pursuing passion, he must have a vision. Having a vision implies he either sets goals or creates plans (but not both). Since he has ambition and takes action, he cannot create plans, so he must set goals. He does not track progress, so the XOR condition (sets goals or tracks progress, but not both) holds, implying he stays motivated. Given he suffers setbacks and the XOR rule (refuses to give up or stays motivated, but not both), his staying motivated means he does not refuse to give up. There is no rule that connects staying motivated or not refusing to give up to “can overcome challenges.” Therefore, whether Caden can overcome challenges cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
