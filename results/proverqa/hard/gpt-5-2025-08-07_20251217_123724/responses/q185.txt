Question ID: 185
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Anyone who sets targets has a goal. Kaison does not achieve his goals. Kaison overcomes obstacles. Julius overcomes obstacles. If Kaison has ambition, then he either works hard or is disciplined (but not both). If Kaison is either determined or talented (but not both), then he is successful. Kaison sets targets. If Kaison has a goal, then he either dedicates time or stays focused (but not both). Julius stays focused. If someone faces challenges and seeks improvement, then they have a goal. Eliza does not achieve his goals. If Mami is either determined or talented (but not both), then he is successful. If someone is successful and overcomes obstacles, then they achieve their goals. If Kaison practices regularly, then he is both talented and stays confident. Kaison does not improve his skills. Kaison stays focused. Kaison either works hard or is talented (or both). If Kaison either dedicates time or works hard (but not both), then he improves his skills.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kaison is not determined.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Kaison sets targets, so he has a goal. Having a goal implies exactly one of dedicates time or stays focused; since he stays focused, he does not dedicate time. If (dedicates time XOR works hard) then improves skills; given he does not improve skills and does not dedicate time, he cannot work hard. From (works hard or talented), he must be talented. He does not achieve his goals and he overcomes obstacles; since (successful and overcomes) implies achieving goals, he cannot be successful. From (determined XOR talented) implies successful, with talented true and successful false, the XOR must be false, so determined is true. Therefore, the statement “Kaison is not determined” is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
