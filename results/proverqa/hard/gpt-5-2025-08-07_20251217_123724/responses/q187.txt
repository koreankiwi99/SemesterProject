Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Kayleigh lacks both camouflage and a distinctive call. If she blended into the background, she would have either camouflage or a distinctive call; since both are false, she does not blend. Given (blend XOR iconic), she must be iconic. Iconic implies she brings good luck; she also brings smiles. From \"if she entertains crowds then (good luck XOR smiles)\", but both good luck and smiles are true, so the XOR is false; by contrapositive, she does not entertain crowds. From \"(considerate or likes attention) -> entertains crowds\" and not entertaining, we conclude she is neither considerate nor likes attention. With (considerate XOR mischievous), not considerate forces mischievous. Therefore, the statement \"Kayleigh is not mischievous\" is false.",
  "answer": "B"
