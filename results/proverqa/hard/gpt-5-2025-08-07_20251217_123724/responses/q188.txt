Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From not driving progress and the rule (takes risks or thinks outside the box) -> drives progress, Haisley neither takes risks nor thinks outside the box. Given she also lacks experience, the rule innovative -> (experience XOR takes risks) makes innovative impossible. Thus, if Haisley is passionate, then by passionate -> (creative or innovative) and not innovative, she must be creative; with creative XOR uninspired, she would not be uninspired. However, Haisley is either passionate or a diligent worker. If she is not passionate, then she must be a diligent worker, which implies producing quality work and (since she is not highly skilled) having exquisite taste; this does not determine creative vs. uninspired, and with creative XOR uninspired she could be uninspired. Since both scenarios (uninspired false if passionate; uninspired true if not passionate) are consistent, the truth of 'Haisley is uninspired' cannot be determined.",
