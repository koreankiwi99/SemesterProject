Question ID: 189
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Connor leads research teams. Connor collaborates with peers. If Connor collaborates with peers, then he teaches at a university and mentors students. Connor publishes academic papers or is recognized as a leading expert. If Connor has extensive experience, then he either teaches at a university or publishes academic papers, but not both. Connor does not study fossils. Connor will mentor students if he leads research teams. Connor specializes in theropod dinosaurs if he focuses on ancient species. Every paleontologist either has extensive experience or studies fossils.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Connor makes groundbreaking discoveries, or he specializes in theropod dinosaurs and is recognized as a leading expert.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "From collaborating with peers, Connor teaches at a university and mentors students. He also leads research teams, reinforcing that he mentors students. We know he either publishes academic papers or is recognized as a leading expert, but we cannot determine which. The rule that would force recognition (the XOR between teaching and publishing) only applies if he has extensive experience, which we cannot infer because we are not told he is a paleontologist. We have no information that he focuses on ancient species, so we cannot conclude he specializes in theropod dinosaurs. We also have no information about him making groundbreaking discoveries. Therefore, the disjunction “makes groundbreaking discoveries, or specializes in theropod dinosaurs and is recognized as a leading expert” cannot be confirmed or refuted.",
  "answer": "C"
