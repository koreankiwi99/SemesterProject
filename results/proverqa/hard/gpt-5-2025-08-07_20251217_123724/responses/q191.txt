Question ID: 191
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If a parasite adapts to change and finds optimal nutrients, then it can reproduce successfully. Queenie has flagella. Queenie either reproduces successfully or produces enzymes, but not both. Queenie competes for resources. If Queenie colonizes a host, then she either absorbs nutrients or regulates nutrient flow, but not both. Queenie dominates her environment. Queenie either forms symbiotic relationships with her host or evades the host's defenses, but not both. Queenie forms symbiotic relationships with her host. If Queenie has flagella and competes for resources, then she can regulate nutrient flow. Every parasite that inhabits an intestine either produces enzymes or feeds on nutrients. If a parasite dominates its environment, then it reproduces successfully.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Queenie will thrive in the host.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Queenie dominates her environment' and the rule, she reproduces successfully. By the XOR rule, she therefore does not produce enzymes. With flagella and competing for resources, she can regulate nutrient flow. She forms symbiotic relationships with her host, indicating a host relationship, but there is no rule that links reproducing successfully, symbiosis, or regulating nutrient flow to 'thriving in the host.' No premise defines or entails 'thriving,' nor its negation. Thus the statement cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
