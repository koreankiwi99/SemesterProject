Anne does not communicate telepathically. If Ashley, the dragon, has unique physical features or possesses special powers, then she plays a protective role. All mythical creatures with mystical significance possess special powers and are revered. Ashley either has ancient knowledge or unique physical features, but the two are not necessarily related. If Shorty, the dragon, has unique physical features or possesses special powers, then she plays a protective role. Ashley lives in harmony with other beings. If Ashley is legendary, then she either has telekinesis or reads minds (but not both). Ashley does not communicate telepathically. Anne either has ancient knowledge or unique physical features, but the two are not necessarily related. Ashley has the ability to transform. If Ashley lives in harmony with other beings, then she either communicates telepathically or reads minds (or both). If Ashley is a revered mythical creature, then she is either knowledgeable about ancient lore or has mystical abilities, but not both. Every mythical creature that holds spiritual significance either holds mystical powers or has unique physical features (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ashley does not play a protective role.

  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Ashley lives in harmony with other beings, which implies she either communicates telepathically or reads minds. Since she does not communicate telepathically, she must read minds. She also does not control elements (because she has the ability to transform, and it's an exclusive choice). Reading minds but not controlling elements satisfies the condition that yields special powers. If Ashley has special powers (or unique physical features), then she plays a protective role. Therefore, Ashley does play a protective role, making the statement 'Ashley does not play a protective role' false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
