==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Payton conducts experiments, so she has practical experience. We are told that Payton is knowledgeable about marine life or passionate about research (or both), with no exclusivity. Nothing in the premises allows us to conclude she is not passionate, nor that she is passionate. Other facts (e.g., sets goals → studies hard; thinks creatively → can make a new discovery; does not publish research) do not determine her passion status. Therefore, whether Payton is not passionate about research cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
