==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Jaxton does not build endurance. He either gains strength or increases speed, and he does not gain strength, so he increases speed. The XOR rule (builds endurance or increases speed, but not both) makes him train regularly. He also stays healthy, so by the given rule he can (therefore, does) compete successfully. There is no rule connecting Jaxton to providing therapy comfort; the only therapy-comfort rule applies specifically to Derek. Nothing else implies or denies that Jaxton provides therapy comfort. Hence it cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
