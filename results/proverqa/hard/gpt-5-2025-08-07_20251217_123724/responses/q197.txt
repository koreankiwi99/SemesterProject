Question ID: 197
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Frankie lives in a fantasy world, then he either has supernatural powers or can fly, but not both. If Frankie can navigate the nucleus, then he can either repair DNA or assist transcription, but not both. Frankie can manipulate molecules. Frankie either regulates protein or assists transcription. Frankie either has supernatural powers or has microscopic size, but not both. If Frankie lives in a cell, then he understands biochemistry and knows genetics. Frankie can navigate the nucleus. If Kendall can navigate the nucleus, then he can either repair DNA or assist transcription, but not both. Kendall lives in a fantasy world. If Ximena lives in a fantasy world, then he either has supernatural powers or can fly, but not both. Kendall can fly. Frankie lives in a fantasy world. If Frankie knows genetics, then he will assist in transcription. Frankie can fly. If Frankie has microscopic size, then he lives in a cell and can manipulate molecules.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Frankie can repair DNA.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Frankie lives in a fantasy world and can fly, so by the XOR rule (fantasy world → supernatural powers or fly, but not both), he does not have supernatural powers. Given the XOR fact (supernatural powers or microscopic size, but not both), he must have microscopic size. Microscopic size implies he lives in a cell, which implies he knows genetics. Knowing genetics implies he assists in transcription. Since Frankie can navigate the nucleus, the XOR rule (repair DNA or assist transcription, but not both) applies; with assisting transcription true, repairing DNA must be false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
