Question ID: 198
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Gary makes tactical decisions. Gary cannot handle critical situations. If Gary leads others effectively, then he either makes tactical decisions or communicates clearly, but not both. Anyone who thinks quickly and stays calm under pressure can handle critical situations. Gary gains experience or has training. If Gary takes risks, then he either acts impulsively or follows his instincts (but not both). Gary thinks quickly. Gary either performs heroic actions or takes risks. Anyone who prioritizes their own safety and has proper training can respond to emergencies effectively. Anyone who responds to emergencies either stays calm under pressure or leads others effectively (or both). Gary does not gain experience. Gary does not act impulsively. If Gary is brave, then he will perform heroic actions and earn accolades. Gary either prioritizes his own safety or is brave, but Gary may not necessarily do both. Gary does not follow his instincts. Gary communicates clearly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Gary does not earn accolades.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Gary makes tactical decisions and communicates clearly. If he led effectively, he would have exactly one of those; since he has both, he does not lead. He thinks quickly and cannot handle critical situations, so he does not stay calm under pressure (from: thinks quickly AND stays calm -> can handle). From respond -> (stays calm OR leads) and having neither, he does not respond to emergencies. He does not gain experience, so from (gains experience OR has training) he has training (proper). Then (prioritizes safety AND proper training -> respond) and not responding implies he does not prioritize his own safety. Given (prioritizes safety OR brave), not prioritizing safety forces that he is brave. If he is brave, then he earns accolades. Therefore, the statement 'Gary does not earn accolades' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
