Context:
If Stefan asks questions, then he explores opportunities and values experience. Stefan visits a foreign land. Stefan travels abroad. For all humans, if they either have curiosity or ask questions, then they seek knowledge. Stefan listens to podcasts. Anyone who reads widely or meets new people loves learning. If Stefan visits a foreign land, then he either becomes thoughtful or develops cultural appreciation, but not both. If Stefan either listens to podcasts or reads widely (but not both), then he has curiosity. If Stefan travels abroad, then he either immerses himself in the culture or becomes thoughtful (or both). Stefan does not value experience. Stefan does not seek knowledge. If Stefan loves learning, then he develops cultural appreciation and appreciates diversity. For all humans, if they immerse themselves in a culture, then they gain a new perspective.

  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'if curiosity or asks questions then seek knowledge' and 'Stefan does not seek knowledge', we get not(curiosity) and not(asks questions). Given 'listens to podcasts' and (LP xor RW) -> curiosity, with not(curiosity), the XOR must be false; since LP is true, RW must also be true. Then (reads widely or meets new people) -> loves learning gives loves learning, which implies develops cultural appreciation. From 'visits a foreign land' implies (thoughtful xor cultural appreciation), with cultural appreciation true, thoughtful is false. From 'travels abroad' implies (immerses in culture or thoughtful), and since thoughtful is false, he must immerse in culture. Immersing in culture implies gains a new perspective. Therefore, 'Stefan does not gain a new perspective' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
