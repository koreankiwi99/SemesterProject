Question ID: 201
Difficulty: hard

Context:
All lemurs that have agility and live in forests can climb trees. Sevyn does not thrive in his habitat. If Sevyn either explores the forest or forages for food (but not both), then he thrives in his habitat. Cookie does not thrive in his habitat. Cookie either takes dust baths or grooms each other, but not both. Sevyn does not ensure their survival. Sevyn plays with his troop. For all lemurs, if they explore the forest and lead the troop, then they ensure the troop's survival. Cookie does not have good health. If Sevyn climbs trees, then he either plays with his troop or grooms each other, but not both. If Lyric climbs trees, then he either plays with his troop or grooms each other, but not both. Sevyn either takes dust baths or grooms each other, but not both. Every lemur either climbs trees or forages for food. Sevyn prioritizes cleanliness. Lyric prioritizes cleanliness. For any lemur, if they prioritize cleanliness and take dust baths, then they have good health. Sevyn does not have good health. If Sevyn either leaps through trees or ventures off trail (but not both), then he explores the forest.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sevyn does not lead the troop.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Sevyn prioritizes cleanliness and does not have good health, so he does not take dust baths. From the XOR (dust baths or grooms), Sevyn grooms. Given he also plays with his troop, if he climbed trees the XOR (plays or grooms) would be violated; therefore he does not climb trees. From (climbs or forages), Sevyn forages. Since Sevyn does not thrive and (explores XOR forages) implies thriving, with foraging true, exploring must also be true. With explores true and the rule (explores ∧ leads → ensure survival), and given Sevyn does not ensure survival, it follows that he does not lead the troop.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
