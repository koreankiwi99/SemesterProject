Question ID: 203
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Lillian is a litterer, then she either damages soil or pollutes water, but not both. Everyone who either disposes waste or damages soil (but not both) harms the ecosystem. Lillian does not dispose waste. Lillian throws trash. Lillian does not harm wildlife. If Lillian neglects nature, then she is either a litterer or ignores rules, but not both. Lillian does not neglect her responsibility. If someone pollutes water and causes environmental harm, then they harm wildlife. Anyone who throws trash is a litterer. Lillian is either a conservationist or an environmental harm doer, but not both. Lillian does not ignore warnings. Whenever someone harms the ecosystem, they either ignore warnings or neglect their responsibility (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lillian is not a conservationist.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Lillian throws trash, so she is a litterer. A litterer must either damage soil or pollute water, but not both. From \"harms ecosystem -> (ignore warnings or neglect responsibility)\" and the facts that she does not ignore warnings and does not neglect her responsibility, by contrapositive she does not harm the ecosystem. Using the contrapositive of \"(disposes waste XOR damages soil) -> harms ecosystem\" and knowing she does not dispose waste, we deduce she does not damage soil. Therefore, by the litterer XOR, she pollutes water. Given \"pollutes water and causes environmental harm -> harms wildlife\" and that she does not harm wildlife, we infer she does not cause environmental harm. The statement \"conservationist XOR environmental harm doer\" gives no further link to harming the ecosystem or causing environmental harm, so we cannot determine whether she is a conservationist or an environmental harm doer. Thus, we cannot conclude that she is not a conservationist.",
  "answer": "C"
