Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Noel is creative and does not take risks, so he tries new things. Trying new things implies he is either adaptable or open to change (but not both); given he is adaptable, he is not open to change. He seeks new experiences, which implies he either lives in the present or embraces change (or both), but not being open to change does not rule out embracing change (no rule links these), so we cannot conclude he lives in the present. If he lived in the present, he would value moments in life and thus appreciate impermanence, making resisting false. However, we cannot establish that he lives in the present or that he values moments. Given the exclusive choice that he either appreciates or resists impermanence, but lacking grounds to pick one, the claim that he resists impermanence cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
