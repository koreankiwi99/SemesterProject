Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Victor follows conventions or breaks rules' and 'Victor does not break rules', Victor follows conventions. If Victor lacked original thought, then he would follow conventions or think critically, but not both; since he also thinks critically, that would contradict following conventions. Therefore, Victor does not lack original thought, and by the XOR, he has a rich imagination. Victor honors tradition and cherishes memories; combined with 'If Victor respects his heritage, then (honors tradition XOR cherishes memories)', this implies he does not respect his heritage. From 'holds sentimental items -> respects heritage or values family legacies' and not respecting heritage, Victor values family legacies. With rich imagination and valuing family legacies, he draws from his experiences. None of these facts establish whether he is (or is not) a creative person. The only rule about being a creative person is one-way ('If Victor is a creative person, then he finds unique inspirations and produces exceptional work'), and we lack grounds to affirm or deny that antecedent. Hence, it is uncertain whether Victor is not a creative person.",
