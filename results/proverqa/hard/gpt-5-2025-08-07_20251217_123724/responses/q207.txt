==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Jase pursues personal interests, and since he either pursues personal interests or makes sacrifices (but not both), he does not make sacrifices. He values teamwork, and given he either values teamwork or is a strategic thinker (but not both), he is not a strategic thinker. With a strong work ethic and the rule that he is either a strategic thinker or demonstrates leadership (but not both), he demonstrates leadership. From demonstrating leadership, he can become a senior officer, but this does not establish that he is a senior officer. Only if he is a senior officer would he earn respect. Since we cannot conclude that he is a senior officer, whether he earns respect remains undetermined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
