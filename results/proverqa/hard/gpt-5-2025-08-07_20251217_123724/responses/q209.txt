Model Response:
==================================================
{"reasoning":"Timothy remains focused, so he works under pressure. Working under pressure implies either exercising self-control or thinking cautiously; since he does not think cautiously, he exercises self-control. Facing challenges and exercising self-control implies he stays calm. Taking risks and staying calm makes him a hero. From not handling emergencies and the XOR rule on acting quickly vs. making decisive moves (and he does not make decisive moves), he does not act quickly; thus, by the initial disjunction, he is brave. None of the given rules relate these facts to being skilled or not skilled. Therefore, whether Timothy is not skilled cannot be determined from the information provided.","answer":"C"}
