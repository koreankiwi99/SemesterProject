Question ID: 210
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Asa cannot create innovative technologies. Karsyn serves his local community. If Asa understands thermal stability, then he can design heat-resistant materials. Avery is not creative. If Asa has expertise, then he either publishes papers or conducts research (or both). If Asa has an excellent academic record and strong curiosity, then he will pursue a PhD. If Asa examines material behavior, then he analyzes composite properties. Francesca conducts research or works in industry. Asa has an excellent academic record. Whoever conducts research contributes to society. Anyone who analyzes composite properties or studies material interactions can improve material efficiency. Asa conducts research or works in industry. Avery cannot create innovative technologies. If Karsyn has an excellent academic record and strong curiosity, then he will pursue a PhD. Asa either contributes to society or serves his local community, but not both. If Francesca attends university, then he is either curious or creative (but not both). Asa serves his local community. If Asa either analyzes composite properties or designs heat-resistant materials (but not both), then he can create innovative technologies. If someone has expertise, then they solve real problems and contribute to society. If Francesca either analyzes composite properties or designs heat-resistant materials (but not both), then he can create innovative technologies. If Asa pursues a PhD, then he either improves material efficiency or works in industry, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Asa understands thermal stability.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Asa serves his local community and the XOR rule (contributes to society or serves local community, but not both), Asa does not contribute to society. Since conducting research implies contributing, Asa does not conduct research; given (conducts research or works in industry), he works in industry. Expertise implies contributing, so Asa does not have expertise. If Asa understands thermal stability, then he can design heat-resistant materials (HRM). Also, if exactly one of (analyzes composite properties, HRM) holds, then he can create innovative technologies; but he cannot create innovative technologies, so either both are true or both are false. We have no information forcing analyzes composite properties to be true or false, so HRM remains undetermined. Consequently, whether Asa understands thermal stability cannot be determined from the premises.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
