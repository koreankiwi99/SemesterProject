==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Meadow enjoys fresh mountains, so by the exclusive rule she does not breathe toxic air. She sees polluted rivers; with not breathing toxic air, the exclusive condition holds, so she grows up in an industry town. From that, she either witnesses destruction or sees animal suffering (and we already know she sees animal suffering). We also have that she either witnesses destruction or lives near polluted areas, but this does not force that she lives near polluted areas. The rule for becoming an environmental activist requires that she either lives near polluted areas or cares about the environment; neither is established. There is also no rule implying she does not become an activist. Therefore, whether she becomes an environmental activist cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
