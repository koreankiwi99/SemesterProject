Question ID: 212
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If someone either creates public art or designs street murals (but not both), then they contribute to the cultural identity of their community. Those who contribute to the cultural identity of their community represent that community. If Malik honors his tradition, he may not be embracing modernism, and vice versa. Malik does not embrace modernism. Anyone who represents their community or tells local stories can preserve cultural heritage. Malik does not celebrate local history. Malik does not support artistic expression. Malik does not design street murals. Anyone who preserves cultural heritage or celebrates local history supports artistic expression. If Malik engages in street art, then he either tells local stories or promotes cultural exchange.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Malik enhances the beauty of his community.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Given Malik does not support artistic expression. From (preserves cultural heritage or celebrates local history) -> supports artistic expression, we get that he neither preserves cultural heritage nor celebrates local history. From (represents community or tells local stories) -> preserves cultural heritage and the fact he does not preserve it, we infer he neither represents his community nor tells local stories. From contribute to cultural identity -> represent, he does not contribute to cultural identity. From (creates public art XOR designs street murals) -> contribute to cultural identity and the fact he does not contribute, we conclude not(CPA XOR DSM); with given not designing street murals, he also does not create public art. None of the rules connect any of these facts to “enhances the beauty of his community,” nor to its negation. Thus the statement cannot be determined from the premises.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
