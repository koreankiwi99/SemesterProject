Question ID: 213
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Mekhi faces adversity, then he will show resilience and find a way to overcome it. Trenton either experiences failure or avoids risks. If Landen learns from his mistakes, then he will achieve success. Musa does not gain recognition. If Trenton faces adversity, then he will either become stronger or stay motivated, but not both. Landen does not gain recognition. If Landen experiences failure, then he will either learn from his mistakes or stay motivated, but not both. Musa pursues his passions or achieves success. Musa becomes stronger. If Mekhi sets goals and achieves success, then he will gain recognition. Musa sets goals. Mekhi becomes stronger. Musa does not avoid risks. If Musa learns from his mistakes, then he will achieve success. If Musa sets goals and achieves success, then he will gain recognition. If Musa faces adversity, then he will either become stronger or stay motivated, but not both. If Musa experiences failure, then he will either learn from his mistakes or stay motivated, but not both. Musa either experiences failure or avoids risks. Musa either has determination or stays motivated.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Musa does not find a way to overcome.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Musa does not avoid risks and must therefore experience failure. From sets goals and the rule that (sets goals ∧ achieves success) → gain recognition, together with Musa does not gain recognition, it follows that Musa does not achieve success. Hence he did not learn from his mistakes (since learning from mistakes would imply success). Given he experienced failure and cannot have learned from mistakes, the XOR rule forces that he stays motivated. We also know Musa becomes stronger. If Musa faced adversity, the rule says he would either become stronger or stay motivated, but not both; since both are true, he must not face adversity. No rule links Musa to “finding a way to overcome” (that consequence is only given for Mekhi), and from not facing adversity we cannot conclude he does or does not find a way to overcome. Therefore, the statement about Musa not finding a way to overcome is not determined.",
  "answer": "C"
