Context:

For all humans, if someone is a good footballer, then they either have good speed or have good agility (or both). Jamari has strategic skills. If Jamari either trains regularly or eats nutritious food (but not both), then he has endurance. Megan has quick reflexes. Jamari does not inspire others. Aya does not inspire others. If Jamari has good agility and strong technique, then he will outperform others. If Martin has good agility and strong technique, then he will outperform others. Jamari either excels under pressure or has strong technique, but not both. Jamari does not excel under pressure. If someone has strategic skills and performs well, then they can lead their team successfully. Megan cannot lead his team successfully. Martin does not excel under pressure.

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Jamari has quick reflexes, so he performs well. With strategic skills and performing well, he would lead his team, but we’re told he cannot, indicating inconsistency we can’t resolve here. Jamari does not inspire others; from (outperforms ∨ gets recognition) → inspires, contraposition gives that he neither outperforms nor gets recognition. Jamari does not excel under pressure, so (XOR) he has strong technique. If he had good agility and strong technique, he would outperform; since he does not outperform, he does not have good agility. Being a good footballer implies having good speed or good agility; since he lacks good agility, it would require good speed. We have no information establishing or refuting good speed. Therefore, whether Jamari is a good footballer cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
