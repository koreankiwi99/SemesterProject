Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Samantha works under a mentor, so she gains practical experience. Given the XOR rule (gains practical experience or reads widely), she does not read widely. She attends seminars, and since reads widely is false, the XOR condition (reads widely or attends seminars) holds, so she has formal education. She does not put in diligent effort; with (diligent effort or hard work ethic), she must have a hard work ethic. Achieving recognition implies natural talent XOR hard work ethic; since hard work ethic is true, natural talent is false. With formal education true and natural talent false, the XOR condition (formal education or natural talent) holds, so she is successful. Therefore, the statement 'Samantha is not successful' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
