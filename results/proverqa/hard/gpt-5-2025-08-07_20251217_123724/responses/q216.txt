==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Colten listens carefully, so he can follow directions. By the exclusive-or with working independently, he does not work independently. By the other exclusive-or, not working independently implies he lends a helping hand. Lending a helping hand implies he either fixes broken things or has common sense. Independently, every person has either common sense or is intelligent, and Colten specifically is either intelligent or kind-hearted (or both). Nothing forces kind-hearted to be true or false: if he is not kind-hearted, he can be intelligent; if he is kind-hearted, that is also consistent. Therefore, whether Colten is kind-hearted cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
