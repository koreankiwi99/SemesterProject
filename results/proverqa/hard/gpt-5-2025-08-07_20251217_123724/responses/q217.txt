==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From ambition, Alvaro works diligently. Given the exclusive (learns quickly or works diligently), he does not learn quickly. Since he sets targets and not learns quickly, the exclusive condition (sets targets xor learns quickly) holds, so he stays motivated. Facing adversity implies (stays motivated xor pursues goals); with stays motivated true, pursues goals is false. The statement 'pursues goals or has passion' then forces has passion true. With passion, (achieve success xor inspire others); since he achieves success, he does not inspire others. From 'pushes limits or inspires others' and not inspiring others, he pushes limits. No rule mentions 'overcome challenges', nor links it to any derived property, so we cannot determine its truth value.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C
