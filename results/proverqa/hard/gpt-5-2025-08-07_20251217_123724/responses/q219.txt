  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Heaven runs a small business and does not support environmental causes, so by the exclusive-or rule she fosters local economies. Given she does not drive social change, and the rule that (builds community XOR fosters local economies) implies driving social change, this XOR must be false; since she fosters local economies, she also builds a strong community. From the rule that if Heaven either values sustainability or is passionate about nature then she finds innovative solutions, and since she does not find innovative solutions, we infer she is neither valuing sustainability nor passionate about nature. The only rule linking passionate about nature to discovering natural remedies is specific to Fiona, not general. There is no rule that allows concluding Heaven discovers (or does not discover) natural remedies. Therefore, the statement is not determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
