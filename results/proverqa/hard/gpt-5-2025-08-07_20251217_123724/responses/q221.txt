==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "“Resilient” is never defined in the premises. From the facts: Matias is a professional athlete and stays disciplined, so he does not seek feedback; by the XOR with seeking feedback/believing in himself, he believes in himself. Given he faces setbacks and cannot be able to overcome obstacles (explicitly stated), the rule XOR(learns from mistakes, analyzes errors) -> able to overcome obstacles plus not analyzing errors forces that he does not learn from mistakes; thus, from facing setbacks (learn or work hard), he must work hard. Working hard and believing in himself implies he strives for success, hence has ambition, sets goals, and is determined. However, no rule links any of these properties (or inability to overcome obstacles) to being “resilient.” Therefore, whether Matias is resilient cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
