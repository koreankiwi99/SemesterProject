{
  "reasoning": "From the exclusive-or statement that Dr. Archie either understands plant life or publishes research findings, and given he does not publish, it follows he understands plant life. However, no given rule links understanding plant life, leading in his field, or developing treatments to 'having specialized knowledge.' Since 'specialized knowledge' is not defined or implied by any provided predicate, the statement cannot be determined from the premises.",
  "answer": "C"
}
