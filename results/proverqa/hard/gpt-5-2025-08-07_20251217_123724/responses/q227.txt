Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From the premises: Clay does not engage the audience, so by (engages or has charisma) he has charisma. He does not ignite imagination, so by (holds attention or ignites imagination) he holds attention. Anyone who holds attention either evokes curiosity or manipulates emotions; Clay does not evoke curiosity, so he manipulates emotions. With charisma, he either manipulates emotions or creates illusions (but not both); thus he does not create illusions. Since he performs miracles and does not create illusions, by the exclusive rule he is a master of deception. However, “possesses a unique talent” is not defined in the premises, nor can uniqueness be established relative to others. Therefore its truth cannot be determined from the given information.",
