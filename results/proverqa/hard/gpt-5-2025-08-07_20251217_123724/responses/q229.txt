Question ID: 229
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Amanda is not disciplined. If Amanda is persistent, then she is both open-minded and a problem solver. Amanda is motivated. If Amanda is an experienced designer, then she either solves real-world problems or has attention to detail, but not both. If Greta is motivated, then she is either disciplined or persistent (but not both). Anyone who has good taste or solves real-world problems can be an innovative designer. Amanda is an experienced designer. If Amanda is motivated, then she is either disciplined or persistent (but not both). Amanda does not think critically. If Amanda has strong foundations, then she is either strategic or solves real-world problems (but not both). If someone sets high standards, then they work diligently and have attention to detail.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Amanda is not practical.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Amanda's motivation and not being disciplined, she must be persistent; thus she is a problem solver. Using the rule (TC ∨ AD) -> VP with ¬VP and ¬TC, we infer ¬AD. Given she is an experienced designer and (SRP XOR AD), we conclude she solves real-world problems. However, no premise defines or even mentions ‘practical’ or links it to any other property. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Amanda is practical or not.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
