Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Brittany appreciates serenity, so she values her privacy. Given the XOR between emotional depth and valuing privacy, she does not exhibit emotional depth. She also does not have an original style. From 'stands out -> (original style or emotional depth)', by contrapositive, Brittany does not stand out. From '(creates unique masterpieces XOR develops new techniques) -> stands out', by contrapositive and not standing out, the XOR is false, so the two have the same truth value. Since she does not develop new techniques, she also does not create unique masterpieces. From 'if Brittany is an innovative artist -> create unique masterpieces', by contrapositive, she is not an innovative artist. Therefore, the statement is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}
