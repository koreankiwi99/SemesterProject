Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "James does not value knowledge. If he read books, he would value knowledge and explore culture, so he does not read books. From 'either engages in sports or reads books,' he engages in sports. Given sports and 'either meditates regularly or practices mindfulness, but not both,' and knowing he does not meditate, James practices mindfulness. The only rule about inner peace (feels calm) is: if (connects with nature XOR appreciates wildlife) then feels calm. We know he does not appreciate wildlife, but we have no information about whether he connects with nature; thus we cannot determine whether he feels calm. There is no rule linking mindfulness directly to inner peace. Therefore, whether James finds inner peace is undetermined.",
  "answer": "C"
