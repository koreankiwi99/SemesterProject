Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Boone creates unique items and the rule that (mass-produces XOR creates-unique) implies custom maker, together with Boone is not a custom maker, we infer that Boone both creates unique items and mass-produces goods. Given Boone is either a craftsman or mass-produces goods (but not both), he is not a craftsman. With Boone does not value handcrafting and the rule that (follows-traditional XOR values-handcrafting) implies craftsman, he must not follow traditional methods; by the XOR with uses natural ingredients, he uses natural ingredients. None of these facts entail that Boone is a meticulous artist or that he produces high-quality soaps. The only rule yielding high-quality soaps requires Boone to be a meticulous artist, which is not established. There is also no rule showing he is not skilled. Therefore, whether Boone is a skilled soap maker cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
