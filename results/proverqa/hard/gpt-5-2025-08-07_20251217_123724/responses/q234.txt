Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "Addilynn embraces challenges and is open-minded, so she thinks outside the box. With imagination and thinking outside the box, she is creative. She partners with companies and does not export goods overseas, so (exclusive-or) she enters global markets. She does not develop new products; with entering global markets (exclusive-or), she expands into new markets. Not investing in a startup and expanding into new markets (exclusive-or) implies she takes risks. Given she is either business-savvy or takes risks (but not both), taking risks means she is not business-savvy. Thus, the antecedent 'creative XOR business-savvy' is true (creative true, business-savvy false). However, there is no information connecting being creative or business-savvy to being successful, so we cannot conclude she is successful. Therefore, the statement is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
