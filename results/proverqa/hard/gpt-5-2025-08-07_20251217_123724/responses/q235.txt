Question ID: 235
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Esme does not uncover new insights. Esme does not analyze rock formations. If Esme either studies xenoliths or studies volcanoes (but not both), then she gains recognition. Sergio creates maps. If Esme researches the Earth's history, then she either investigates magma or studies volcanoes (or both). Esme either collects samples or creates maps, but not both. Arthur does not analyze rock formations. Esme either analyzes rock formations or studies volcanoes, but not both. If a geologist either surveys terrain or measures strata (but not both), then they conduct fieldwork. Every geologist either examines fossils or conducts fieldwork. If Esme either collects samples or publishes research (but not both), then she advances knowledge. Esme does not explore remote areas. If Esme gains recognition, then she publishes research and conducts fieldwork. If a geologist mentors students and develops new methods, then they can gain recognition. Esme creates maps. Every geologist who advances knowledge either explores remote areas or uncovers new insights (or both). If Esme either examines minerals or models Earth processes (but not both), then she publishes research. Esme does not examine fossils.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Esme does not study xenoliths.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Esme does not analyze rock formations, and (analyzes rock formations XOR studies volcanoes), so she studies volcanoes. Esme creates maps and (collects samples XOR creates maps), so she does not collect samples. Treating Esme as a geologist: since every geologist either examines fossils or conducts fieldwork and Esme does not examine fossils, she conducts fieldwork. Every geologist who advances knowledge must either explore remote areas or uncover new insights, but Esme does neither; thus she does not advance knowledge. From (collects samples XOR publishes research) -> advances knowledge and not advancing knowledge, we get not (collects samples XOR publishes research); with not collecting samples, this yields she does not publish research. From gains recognition -> (publishes research and conducts fieldwork) and not publishing research, we conclude she does not gain recognition. From (studies xenoliths XOR studies volcanoes) -> gains recognition and not gaining recognition, we infer not (studies xenoliths XOR studies volcanoes); since she studies volcanoes, she must also study xenoliths. Therefore, the statement \"Esme does not study xenoliths\" is false.",
  "answer": "B"
