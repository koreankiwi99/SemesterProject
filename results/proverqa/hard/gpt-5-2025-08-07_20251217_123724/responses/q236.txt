Question ID: 236
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Thatcher either forges ahead or bounces back (but not both), then he overcomes adversity. If Jesse either faces criticism or grows from a situation, then he becomes resilient. Samir does not perform well under challenging circumstances. For Samir, either staying calm or acting on instinct is sufficient, but not necessarily both. If Thatcher either avoids conflict or seeks resolution (but not both), then he can handle pressure. Samir seeks resolution. If Samir faces failure, then he either finds new strength or grows from it (or both). Samir either avoids conflict or overcomes adversity, but not both. Brittany does not admit fault. For Thatcher, either staying calm or acting on instinct is sufficient, but not necessarily both. Thatcher acts on instinct. Anyone who faces criticism or admits fault can develop mental toughness. If Samir either forges ahead or bounces back (but not both), then he overcomes adversity. If Samir takes a risk, then he either learns from it or bounces back, but not both. Samir forges ahead. If Samir either faces criticism or grows from a situation, then he becomes resilient. Samir acts on instinct. Jesse forges ahead. Everyone who either stays calm or can handle pressure is able to perform well under challenging circumstances. If Samir either avoids conflict or seeks resolution (but not both), then he can handle pressure. Samir does not admit fault. Samir takes a risk. Jesse takes a risk. Samir does not develop mental toughness. For all humans, if someone makes a mistake, then they either learn from it or grow from it (or both). Thatcher does not develop mental toughness. Thatcher seeks resolution. Samir does not become resilient.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Samir does not make a mistake.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Samir does not become resilient' and 'If Samir either faces criticism or grows from a situation, then he becomes resilient', Samir neither faces criticism nor grows from any situation. Samir takes a risk, so by 'If Samir takes a risk, then he either learns from it or bounces back, but not both', he either learns from the risk or bounces back. If he learned (and thus did not bounce back), then with 'Samir forges ahead' the XOR rule ('forges ahead or bounces back (but not both) -> overcomes adversity') would give overcomes adversity. Then, by the XOR with avoiding conflict, he would not avoid conflict; together with 'seeks resolution', the XOR rule would yield 'can handle pressure', and thus (via 'stays calm or can handle pressure -> perform well') he would perform well—contradicting 'Samir does not perform well'. Hence he must bounce back from the risk, not learn from it. Regarding mistakes: the only rule is 'if someone makes a mistake, then they learn from it or grow from it (or both)'. Since Samir does not grow from any situation, if he made a mistake he would have to learn from it, which is not ruled out. There is no rule that implies he did or did not make a mistake, and learning from a mistake is independent of learning from the risk. Therefore, whether Samir makes a mistake is undetermined.",
