Question ID: 237
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Eren does not follow orders. If Marco is either a fearless leader or inspires others (but not both), then he leads by example. Eren inspires others. Raiden does not follow orders. If someone is a young soldier, then they follow orders and respect their superiors. If Eren is a warrior, then he is either a determined fighter or a self-serving traitor, but not both. If Eren is either a fearless leader or inspires others (but not both), then he leads by example. If Eren abandons friends and prioritizes himself, then he can be a cowardly deserter. If Eren has strong convictions, then he is a fearless leader. Eren either compromises his values or stands by his principles, but he does not do both. Eren does not lead by example. If Daisy is a young soldier, then he is either a fearless leader or a determined fighter, but not both. Eren does not compromise his values. Raiden does not join the military. If Marco joins the military, then he either faces adversity or serves with honor. Raiden does not compromise his values. Daisy does not put others first. If Daisy faces adversity, then he either stands by his principles or is a cowardly deserter (or both).

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Eren inspires others and does not lead by example. From the rule (fearless leader XOR inspires others) -> leads by example, since he does not lead by example and inspires others, he must also be a fearless leader (so both FL and IO hold, making the XOR false). From not following orders and the rule that young soldiers follow orders, Eren is not a young soldier. The only rules mentioning determined fighter (DF) or cowardly deserter (CD) require antecedents we do not have: being a warrior (which would imply DF XOR self-serving traitor) or abandoning friends (which would allow CD). No given facts establish DF or CD for Eren. Therefore, whether Eren is (DF XOR CD) cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
