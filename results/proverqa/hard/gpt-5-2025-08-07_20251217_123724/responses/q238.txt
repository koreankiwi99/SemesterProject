Question ID: 238
Difficulty: hard

Context:
For all botanists, if they investigate plant reproduction and explore self-fertilization, then they can study autogamy. Atharv collects plant samples. Dante investigates plant reproduction. Alec develops new theories. Atharv develops new theories. If Dr. Alec studies autogamy, then he will make groundbreaking discoveries and contribute to agriculture. If Dr. Atharv analyzes plant mechanisms, then he will explore self-fertilization. Dr. June either publishes research or makes groundbreaking discoveries. If Dr. Atharv collects plant samples, then he either develops new theories or earns academic recognition, but not both. If Dr. Atharv studies autogamy, then he will make groundbreaking discoveries and contribute to agriculture. If Dr. Atharv conducts fieldwork, then he either publishes research or earns academic recognition. Dr. Atharv conducts fieldwork. Atharv investigates plant reproduction. Dr. Atharv analyzes plant mechanisms. Dr. June analyzes plant mechanisms. If Dr. June analyzes plant mechanisms, then he will explore self-fertilization. Alec collects plant samples.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Atharv contributes to agriculture.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Atharv investigates plant reproduction. Dr. Atharv analyzes plant mechanisms, so he explores self-fertilization. For all botanists, investigating plant reproduction together with exploring self-fertilization leads to studying autogamy. Therefore, Dr. Atharv studies autogamy. Given: if Dr. Atharv studies autogamy, then he will make groundbreaking discoveries and contribute to agriculture. Hence, Dr. Atharv contributes to agriculture.",
  "answer": "A"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
