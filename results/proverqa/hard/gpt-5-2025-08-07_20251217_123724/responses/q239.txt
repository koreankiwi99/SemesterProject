  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Eva values self-improvement, she pursues her passion; pursuing her passion implies she has a setback. Thus the antecedent (had a setback or experienced failure) is satisfied. The only rule about finding a new purpose applies specifically to Wynter (loses direction -> finds new purpose). There is no rule linking Eva’s setback or failure to finding a new purpose, nor any independent fact that Eva finds a new purpose. Therefore we cannot conclude the consequent, nor its negation.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
