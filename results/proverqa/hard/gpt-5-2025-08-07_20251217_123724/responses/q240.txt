Question ID: 240
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Aliza is a skilled craftswoman, then she either works independently or is an experienced quarryman, but not both. Aliza is attentive to detail. If Penny either spots high-quality stone or extracts precise cuts (but not both), then she masters stonework. Penny understands geology or knows masonry. Penny does not create lasting structures. Penny has engineering skills. Penny is attentive to detail. Penny works independently. If someone understands geology and extracts precise cuts, then they can create lasting structures. If Aliza is an experienced quarryman, then she either spots high-quality stone or earns the respect of her colleagues (or both). If Aliza is attentive to detail, then she is a skilled craftswoman. Penny either works with rock or is an experienced quarryman. Ocean either knows masonry or has engineering skills, but not both. Penny either knows masonry or has engineering skills, but not both. Haven understands geology or knows masonry. Anyone who works with stone either knows masonry or builds structures. Penny does not master stonework. If Aliza either spots high-quality stone or extracts precise cuts (but not both), then she masters stonework. Ocean has engineering skills. If Penny is a skilled craftswoman, then she either works independently or is an experienced quarryman, but not both. If Penny is attentive to detail, then she is a skilled craftswoman.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Penny earns the respect of her colleagues.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

{
  "reasoning": "Penny is attentive to detail, so she is a skilled craftswoman. For Penny, being a skilled craftswoman implies she either works independently or is an experienced quarryman, but not both. Since Penny works independently, she is not an experienced quarryman. Given \"Penny either works with rock or is an experienced quarryman\" and she is not an experienced quarryman, she works with rock (stone). Anyone who works with stone either knows masonry or builds structures; Penny has engineering skills and, by the exclusive rule, does not know masonry, so she builds structures. Penny does not master stonework, and if (spots high-quality stone XOR extracts precise cuts) then she would master stonework; hence that XOR is false. She understands geology, and if someone understands geology and extracts precise cuts, then they can create lasting structures; but Penny does not create lasting structures, so she does not extract precise cuts. With the XOR false and no extracts precise cuts, she also does not spot high-quality stone. There is no rule connecting Penny’s properties to earning the respect of her colleagues (the respect rule given applies only to Aliza). Therefore, whether Penny earns respect cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
