Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Michelle is artistic. If someone is artistic, then they either capture imaginations or inspire children. Michelle does not spark curiosity and paints vibrantly; if she captured imaginations, she would tell stories, and telling stories plus painting vibrantly would imply she can connect with others, which contradicts the fact that she cannot connect with others. So she does not capture imaginations, hence she inspires children. The only rule about Michelle being creative is one-way: if Michelle is creative, then she either inspires children or brings joy to adults (but not both). We already know she inspires children, but there is no rule that infers she is creative from inspiring children, nor any rule that denies she is creative. Therefore, whether Michelle is creative cannot be determined from the given information.",
