  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Skyla learns new languages and explores cultures, so she travels frequently. With travel, she must either appreciate nature or collect art (but not both). Since she collects art, she does not appreciate nature. She either enjoys outdoor activities or loves gardening (inclusive); given she does not enjoy outdoor activities, she loves gardening. The rule (passion for botany XOR love of gardening) implies appreciation of nature; since she does not appreciate nature, the XOR must be false, so both must share the same truth value. With love of gardening true, passion for botany is also true. However, there is no information that entails she studies rare flowers or conserves natural habitats. Therefore, while she does have a passion for botany, the second part of the statement is undetermined, making the whole conjunction uncertain.",
