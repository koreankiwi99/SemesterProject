Question ID: 243
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Kaylee studies frogs, then she can either contribute to scientific knowledge or inspire others, but not both. If Kaylee lives in tropical regions, then she appreciates wildlife and explores rainforests. Kaylee examines habitats or analyzes amphibians. If Kaylee loves nature, then she studies frogs and values biodiversity. Enzo either documents wildlife or works in laboratories, but not both. If Kaylee either explores rainforests or analyzes amphibians (but not both), then she studies frogs. Kaylee publishes wildlife papers. If Kaylee either creates habitats or raises animals (but not both), then she works in laboratories. Enzo is not a conservationist. Kaylee either teaches wildlife courses or protects ecosystems, but not both. Kaylee does not collect samples. Enzo either explores rainforests or documents wildlife, but not both. Kaylee either teaches wildlife courses or analyzes amphibians, but not both. Kaylee either explores rainforests or documents wildlife, but not both. Kaylee does not inspire others. For all humans, if someone either publishes wildlife papers or protects ecosystems, then they are a conservationist. Kaylee is not a conservationist. If Kaylee attends conferences, then she either authors papers or develops theories, but not both. Enzo either teaches wildlife courses or analyzes amphibians, but not both. Shane does not conduct experiments. If Bode either explores rainforests or analyzes amphibians (but not both), then she studies frogs. Kaylee either documents wildlife or works in laboratories, but not both. If someone works in laboratories, then they collect samples and develop theories. If Bode studies frogs, then she can either contribute to scientific knowledge or inspire others, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kaylee does not contribute to scientific knowledge.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'works in laboratories -> collects samples' and 'Kaylee does not collect samples', Kaylee does not work in laboratories. By the XORs, she therefore documents wildlife and does not explore rainforests. From '(publishes papers OR protects ecosystems) -> conservationist' and 'Kaylee is not a conservationist', the contrapositive gives not protects (and not publishes, which conflicts with the given but still yields not protects). With 'teaches courses XOR protects', not protects implies she teaches courses; with 'teaches courses XOR analyzes amphibians', this makes analyzes amphibians false. Since both explores rainforests and analyzes amphibians are false, the condition that would imply she studies frogs is not satisfied, so we cannot conclude she studies frogs. Without establishing that she studies frogs, and given only that she does not inspire others, there is no rule forcing either contributes or not contributes. Hence, whether she does not contribute to scientific knowledge is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
