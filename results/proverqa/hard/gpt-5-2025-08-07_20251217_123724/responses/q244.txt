Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Mila sets clear goals' and the rule 'If Detective Mila sets clear goals, then she either manages her time effectively or achieves her objectives, but not both', together with 'Mila manages her time effectively', we conclude Mila does not achieve her objectives. From 'Mila does not think critically' and 'If Detective Mila handles pressure well, then she is either someone who remains calm or someone who thinks critically (but not both)', if she handled pressure well she would have to remain calm; then by 'If Detective Mila remains calm, then she has experience' we’d get experience, contradicting 'Mila does not have experience'. Hence, Mila does not handle pressure well. Using 'Anyone who is organized either handles pressure well or achieves their objectives (or both)', and since both are false, by contrapositive Mila is not organized. Given 'If someone is detail-oriented, then they are organized and focused' and 'Mila is not focused', we have not(organized and focused), so by contrapositive Mila is not detail-oriented. There is no information implying Mila is procedural or meticulous, nor information to rule both out. Therefore, the disjunction 'meticulous or procedural or detail-oriented' cannot be established as true or false; it is uncertain.",
