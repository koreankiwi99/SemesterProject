Question ID: 246
Difficulty: hard

Context:
For every person, either they find inner peace or they discover a new meaning in life, but these two are not necessarily related. For Matthew, facing challenges and finding solace are mutually exclusive. Matthew loses everything. If Matthew reassesses his priorities, then he either discovers a new meaning in life or restarts his life (or both). If someone hits rock bottom, then they reassess their priorities. Matthew faces challenges. If Matthew restarts his life, then he will either pursue his passion or find solace, but not both. Anyone who loses everything will hit rock bottom. Matthew finds inner peace.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Matthew pursues his passion.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

{
  "reasoning": "Matthew loses everything, so he hits rock bottom and therefore reassesses his priorities. From reassessing, he either discovers a new meaning in life or restarts his life (or both). He faces challenges, and facing challenges is mutually exclusive with finding solace, so he does not find solace. If he restarts his life, then he must either pursue his passion or find solace (but not both); given not solace, restart would force pursuing his passion. However, reassessing does not entail that he restarts (he might only discover a new meaning), so pursuing his passion is not guaranteed. Therefore, it is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
