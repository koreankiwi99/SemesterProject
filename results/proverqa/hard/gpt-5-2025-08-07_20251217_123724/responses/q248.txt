Question ID: 248
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Anyone who publishes papers and presents findings can receive international recognition. Elisa explores new ideas. Beckham learns from others. Papito sets goals. Elisa has a strong work ethic. If Elisa has curiosity, then she conducts innovative research and pushes boundaries. Greyson does not develop new treatments. If Elisa has passion, then she will conduct innovative research. If Elisa sets goals, then she overcomes obstacles and is highly motivated. Elisa sets goals. If Elisa either collaborates with experts or makes breakthrough discoveries (but not both), then she advances scientific knowledge. If Elisa collaborates with experts, then she either learns from others or gains new insights (but not both). Elisa does not solve complex problems. If someone either explores new ideas or has curiosity, then they solve complex problems. Anyone who conducts innovative research and receives international recognition can make breakthrough discoveries. If Papito understands brain functions, then she can either develop new treatments or receive international recognition, but not both. Elisa gains new insights. If Elisa understands brain functions, then she can either develop new treatments or receive international recognition, but not both. Elisa overcomes obstacles. If Elisa has a strong work ethic, then she is either highly motivated or advances scientific knowledge, but not both. Greyson explores new ideas. Elisa does not develop new treatments. Elisa learns from others. Anyone who enjoys learning or faces challenges can be highly motivated.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Elisa understands brain functions.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Elisa sets goals, so she is highly motivated and overcomes obstacles. With a strong work ethic and the rule (highly motivated XOR advances scientific knowledge), she does not advance scientific knowledge. Elisa both learns from others and gains new insights; since collaboration would force exactly one of these, she does not collaborate. From (collaborates XOR makes breakthrough discoveries) -> advances scientific knowledge and advances scientific knowledge is false, we get not(collaborates XOR breakthrough); with not(collaborates), this yields not(breakthrough). If Elisa understood brain functions, then (develop new treatments XOR receive international recognition) holds; given she does not develop new treatments, she would receive international recognition. Having both innovative research and international recognition would imply breakthrough discoveries, which we know is false; thus she would not be conducting innovative research. However, nothing establishes that she does or does not understand brain functions. Therefore, the statement cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
