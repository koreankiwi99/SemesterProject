{
  "reasoning": "Holden does not run a popular kitchen. If Holden is a skilled chef, then he runs a popular kitchen; thus Holden is not a skilled chef. Since Holden is a passionate cook and must be either a skilled chef or creative (but not both), he is creative. Anyone who pays attention to details or is successful can build a loyal customer base, but Holden cannot; therefore he is not successful and does not pay attention to details. If Holden is either meticulous or creative (but not both), then he is successful. Since he is not successful and is creative, the XOR antecedent must be false, which implies Holden is also meticulous. Therefore, the statement is true.",
  "answer": "A"
