Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From follows-her-instincts, Rosalyn is a sleuth (and tracks leads). As a sleuth, she analyzes clues or gathers evidence; we also know she gathers evidence. Since she is an investigator, exactly one of uncovering facts or seeking truth holds (but we cannot tell which). We also have that she either analyzes clues or uncovers facts, which does not resolve whether she is seeking truth. There is no rule linking hiding truth to any given property (transparent/dishonest is given, but hiding truth is not defined as either), so whether she hides truth is also undetermined. Hence, the statement that she is either seeking truth or hiding truth (but not both) cannot be determined from the premises.",
  "answer": "C"
