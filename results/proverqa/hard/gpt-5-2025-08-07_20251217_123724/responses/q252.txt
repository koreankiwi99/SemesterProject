Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Ramon plays chess and is fascinated by tactics, so he studies games. By the chess rule (XOR), he does not anticipate outcomes. He also plans ahead; thus (plans ahead XOR anticipates) holds, making him strategic. He analyzes situations, so he is a logical problem solver; combined with being strategic, this fits the XOR (logical problem solver vs. creative). However, no rule connects any of these traits to the ability to outmaneuver opponents. Therefore, whether he cannot outmaneuver his opponents is not determined by the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}
