{
  "reasoning": "Baylor has a strong build, so he is fast. From not having clear vision and the XOR with facing a challenging course, he faces a challenging course. With facing a challenging course and the given fact that he remains focused, the XOR implies he is not anxious; thus, from the anxious/calm XOR, he must be calm. Good breeding implies either winning championships or having excellent training (but not both). If he had excellent training, then (since he does not perform tricks) he would have to respond to commands, which by the XOR with loyal (and given he is loyal) would force him to not be calm—contradicting that he is calm. Therefore, he does not have excellent training, so he wins championships. Being fast implies either winning championships or becoming legendary (but not both); since he wins championships, he does not become legendary. Hence, the statement is false.",
