Question ID: 254
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Gustavo learns from failure. Anyone who makes impossible shots either masters strategies or wins competitions. If Gustavo is a skilled archer, then he can either anticipate his opponent's moves or make impossible shots, but not both. Gustavo pursues perfection. For Gustavo, either he achieves success or he experiences failure, but not both at the same time. If Gustavo either pursues perfection or remains humble, then he achieves success. Everyone who becomes legendary does not remain humble, and everyone who remains humble does not necessarily become legendary. Gustavo experiences failure. If Gustavo wins competitions and stays focused, then he becomes legendary. Gustavo does not master strategies. Gustavo manages pressure or stays focused. Gustavo either learns from failure or manages pressure, but not both. Gustavo is a skilled archer.

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Gustavo is a skilled archer, so he must either anticipate his opponent's moves or make impossible shots, but not both. He does not master strategies. If he makes impossible shots, then he must win competitions; with stays focused (derived from not managing pressure), he becomes legendary—this is consistent. If instead he anticipates moves, that also remains consistent since no rule forbids it. Nothing in the premises forces one branch over the other. Therefore, we cannot determine whether he anticipates moves, so the claim that he cannot anticipate is not established.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
