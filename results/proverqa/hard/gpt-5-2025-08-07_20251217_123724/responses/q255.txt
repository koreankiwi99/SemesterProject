  "reasoning": "Esteban does not manage finances, and we know he either manages finances or overspends; therefore, he overspends money. Anyone who overspends will regret their actions later, so Esteban will regret his actions later. Given Esteban lives wastefully and the rule that if he lives wastefully then he either loses his fortune or regrets his actions later, but not both, the fact that he regrets his actions later implies he does not lose his fortune. Thus, the statement 'Esteban loses his fortune' is false.",
