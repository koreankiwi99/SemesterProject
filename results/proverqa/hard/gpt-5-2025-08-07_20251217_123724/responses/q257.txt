Question ID: 257
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Callan has a unique design, then it either pioneers a discovery or breaks boundaries (or both). If Galilea is either remarkable or has a unique design (but not both), then it makes history. Galilea does not make history. Galilea runs smoothly. Galilea has advanced sensors. If Galilea has a unique design, then it either pioneers a discovery or breaks boundaries (or both). Galilea either travels a long distance or is remarkable. Any spacecraft that meets specifications or is well maintained is fully functional. Callan does not make history. Galilea is maintained. Galilea does not break boundaries. If Callan is either remarkable or has a unique design (but not both), then it makes history. If Galilea is either fully functional or completely damaged (but not both), then it is remarkable. Galilea either pioneers a discovery or gathers critical data, but not both. Kenji runs smoothly. Any spacecraft with advanced sensors gathers critical data. Galilea operates normally or is fully functional. Kenji has advanced sensors. All maintained spacecraft either operate normally or run smoothly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Galilea is completely damaged.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Galilea is maintained, and any well-maintained spacecraft is fully functional, so Galilea is fully functional. She has advanced sensors, hence gathers critical data; by the XOR rule (either pioneers a discovery or gathers critical data, but not both), she does not pioneer a discovery. Given she also does not break boundaries, if she had a unique design (which would require pioneering or breaking boundaries), that would contradict the facts; thus she does not have a unique design. From the rule that if (remarkable XOR unique design) then makes history, and since she does not make history and lacks a unique design, Galilea is not remarkable. Now, if (fully functional XOR completely damaged) then remarkable; since she is not remarkable, the XOR antecedent must be false. Because she is fully functional, the only way for the XOR to be false is that she is also completely damaged. Therefore, Galilea is completely damaged.",
  "answer": "A"
