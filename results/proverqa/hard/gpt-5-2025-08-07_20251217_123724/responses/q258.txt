{
  "reasoning": "Esteban loves designer brands and enjoys fine dining, so he has luxurious tastes. He craves attention and does not listen to others; given the exclusive choice, he therefore ignores advice. With luxurious tastes and ignoring advice, he invests recklessly. He also has common sense, so he lives frugally and makes informed decisions; by the exclusive rule, he does not spend excessively. There is no given rule that links investing recklessly, living frugally, or ignoring advice to necessarily facing financial difficulties. Thus, whether he will face financial difficulties cannot be determined from the premises.",
