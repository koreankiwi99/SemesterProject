==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Aileen appreciates music, so she instructs movement. With instructs movement, she must love waltz or love salsa (exclusive); given she loves waltz, she does not love salsa. Aileen has stage experience; thus she performs ballet or rumba (exclusive). Since she performs ballet, she does not perform rumba. She dances samba; with not performing rumba, the condition (rumba XOR samba) holds, so she teaches dance. Teaching dance implies she loves salsa or enjoys tango (exclusive). Since she does not love salsa, she enjoys tango. Given (enjoys tango XOR dislikes tango), enjoying tango implies she does not dislike tango. Therefore, the statement is true.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
