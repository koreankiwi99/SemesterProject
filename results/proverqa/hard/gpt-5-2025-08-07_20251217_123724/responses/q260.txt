==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Norah publishes her findings, so she is an expert researcher, which implies she is methodical or perceptive. She is an analyst and works precisely while also thinking logically; from the exclusive-or conditions, this makes her not systematic and thus methodical. She has attention to detail and is not careful, so she must be an archaeologist, which implies she is meticulous or perceptive. None of the premises mention or imply anything about being intelligent or not intelligent. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Norah is not intelligent.",
  "answer": "C"
}
