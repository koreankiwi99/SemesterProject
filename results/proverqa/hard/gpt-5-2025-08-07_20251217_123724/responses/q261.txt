{
  "reasoning": "Violet values serenity, so she practices yoga. If she did not meditate daily, then (yoga XOR meditate) would hold, giving her inner peace, which implies she respects tradition and thus lives humbly. Since she does not appreciate simple things, living humbly would force her to serve others; combined with her pursuing personal growth, she would feel fulfilled—contradicting the fact that she does not feel fulfilled. Therefore, she must also meditate daily. Given she performs ablutions and meditates daily, it follows that she feels calm.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Ground Truth: A
