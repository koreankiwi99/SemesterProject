==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Laurel gets regular vaccinations, and grooming and vaccinations are mutually exclusive, so she does not receive proper grooming. She gets regular exercise and lacks clean water; by the XOR rule (exercise -> nutritious food XOR clean water), she eats nutritious food. Laurel does not look healthy; from (nutritious food XOR good genes) -> looks healthy and not healthy, we get not XOR, so good genes is also true. With good genes true and/or grooming -> radiant coat, Laurel has a radiant coat. Laurel is either a champion or has a noble bloodline; since she does not have a noble bloodline, she is a champion. With radiant coat, she must either excel in show jumping or be a champion, but not both. Since she is a champion, she does not excel in show jumping.",
  "answer": "A"
}
