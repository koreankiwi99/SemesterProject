Question ID: 263
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Every parasite either invades a host or manipulates cellular machinery. India attaches to a host. If Queenie attaches to a host, then she will infect it. Queenie attaches to a host. Queenie does not invade a host. If Queenie has a strong flagellum, then she will dominate her host. Any parasite that dominates its host will reproduce successfully. If Queenie is a virulent parasite, then she either colonizes tissues or dominates her host, but not both. If Queenie infects her host, then she either multiplies rapidly or evades the host's defenses, but not both. All parasites are either able to adapt to their host or survive in its environment, if they reproduce successfully. Queenie does not colonize tissues. Queenie is able to adapt to her host. Every parasite that manipulates cellular machinery of a host either evades the host's defenses or survives in its environment. If Queenie either penetrates cells or secretes toxins (but not both), then she infects her host. Queenie is a virulent parasite.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Queenie multiplies rapidly.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "Queenie attaches to a host, so she infects it. From the rule about infection, she either multiplies rapidly or evades the host’s defenses, but not both. She does not invade a host; since every parasite either invades or manipulates cellular machinery, she manipulates cellular machinery. From that, she either evades defenses or survives in the environment (inclusive or). This does not force evasion, so we cannot determine whether the infection rule selects 'multiplies rapidly' or 'evades.' Both possibilities are consistent with the other facts (she also dominates and reproduces successfully). Therefore, whether she multiplies rapidly is not determined.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
