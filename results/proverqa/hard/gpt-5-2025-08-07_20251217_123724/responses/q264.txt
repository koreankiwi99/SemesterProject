==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Everyone seeks understanding or values knowledge' and 'Jacqueline does not seek understanding', she values knowledge. Then, by the XOR rule, she either studies philosophy or explores history; but 'Anyone who explores history gains insight' and 'Jacqueline does not gain insight' eliminate 'explores history', so she studies philosophy. With 'engages in intellectual discussions', she reads critical theory. She embraces cultural traditions, so by the XOR with 'challenges the status quo', she does not challenge the status quo. The conditional about reading critical theory leading to challenging the status quo requires an exclusive-or antecedent we cannot confirm, so no contradiction. None of the premises mention Susan Sontag or influence, so the statement about her being not influenced by Susan Sontag cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
