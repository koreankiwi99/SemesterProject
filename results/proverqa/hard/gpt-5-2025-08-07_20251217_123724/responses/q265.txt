Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From understanding critical theory, Gunner participates in activism and challenges the status quo. Given he questions authority and seeks truth, the exclusive-or implies he does not reject conformity. With 'does not embrace diversity' and the rule that valuing individuality implies an exclusive-or between rejecting conformity and embracing diversity, valuing individuality would force rejecting conformity, which contradicts the earlier result; hence he does not value individuality. Nothing given implies he is informed. If he were informed, the exclusive-or between advocating for change and challenging the status quo (with challenging already true) would make advocating for change false, which then forces seeking personal freedom true, which in turn forces fighting against oppression (since he does not value individuality); this remains consistent with all constraints. If he is not informed, there is no conflict either. Therefore, whether Gunner is informed cannot be determined, so the statement 'Gunner is not informed' is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
