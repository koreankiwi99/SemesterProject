  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Alexander writes books and receives awards. From the rule that writing books implies exactly one of being recognized or receiving awards, he is not recognized. Since he also shares knowledge and (discoveries ∧ shares knowledge) → recognized, it follows by modus tollens that he does not make discoveries. We have no rule that determines whether he studies plants or is dedicated to healing (the statement allows one or both). With no further constraints tying dedication to healing to other facts, we cannot conclude that he is not dedicated to healing.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
