==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From appreciating history, Brock visits cemeteries and values sacrifices. He shares personal stories, so by the exclusive-or with paying respects, he does not pay respects. Visiting cemeteries then forces (by another exclusive-or) that he honors heroes. He does not protect others; thus, from 'protects others or serves his country,' he serves his country. Loving reading plus 'if loves reading and pursues an academic career then mastery' and the fact he lacks mastery implies he does not pursue an academic career; by the exclusive-or with writing history books, he writes history books; and by 'teaches others or pursues an academic career,' he teaches others. However, there is no premise linking any of these facts to 'respects tradition,' nor is 'respects tradition' otherwise defined. Therefore, whether Brock respects tradition (or does not) cannot be determined from the given information.",
