Question ID: 272
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Amiyah does not pioneer medical breakthroughs. Amiyah does not make new discoveries. If Amiyah is an expert or makes new discoveries, then she gains recognition. If Amiyah has sapremia, then she can either receive innovative treatment or contribute to medical research, but not both. Amiyah does not gain recognition. Amiyah attends conferences. Amiyah teaches at a university. If Amiyah works in a lab, then she can either contribute to medical research or teach at a university, but not both. If someone publishes scientific papers and attends conferences, then they can become an expert. Amiyah does not have a rare condition. If Amiyah receives innovative treatment, then she either has a rare condition or pioneers medical breakthroughs (or both). Amiyah either publishes scientific papers or works in a lab, but not both. If Amiyah collects data or analyzes results, then she can publish scientific papers.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Amiyah has sapremia.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Amiyah does not gain recognition, and (expert or makes new discoveries) implies recognition. Since she also does not make new discoveries, she is not an expert. With attends conferences and (publishes papers ∧ attends conferences) → expert, she cannot be publishing papers. From the exclusive-or (publishes papers ⊕ works in a lab), she must work in a lab. Working in a lab implies (contributes to research ⊕ teaches at a university); given she teaches at a university, she does not contribute to research. If she had sapremia, then (receives innovative treatment ⊕ contributes to research); since she does not contribute to research, that would force receiving innovative treatment. But receiving innovative treatment implies (rare condition or pioneers breakthroughs); both are false (she has no rare condition and does not pioneer breakthroughs), so she cannot have received innovative treatment. Hence the XOR consequent of sapremia is false, so she does not have sapremia.",
  "answer": "B"
