Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Aspyn values self-expression, so she dedicates her life to art and cultivates imagination. Dedicating her life to art implies she pursues a full-time career, and by the full-time vs hobby exclusivity, she does not maintain her art only as a hobby. From not playing music and the clause that she either plays music or writes poetry, she writes poetry. By the exclusive choice between writing poetry and enjoying drawing, she does not enjoy drawing. Since she must either enjoy drawing or have creative talent, she has creative talent. With creative talent, she must either become a professional artist or maintain it only as a hobby (but not both). As she does not maintain it only as a hobby, she becomes a professional artist.",
  "answer": "A"
}
