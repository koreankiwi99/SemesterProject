Question ID: 275
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If someone enjoys writing, then they express themselves creatively. If Maddison works in a library, then she either creates indexes or organizes collections, but not both. If someone keeps diaries and creates poetry, then they enjoy writing. Anyone who shares learning appreciates history or promotes education (or both). Maddison does not promote education. Anyone who collects rare texts either values knowledge or shares learning (or both). Maddison does not appreciate history. If Maddison has a good memory or is detail-oriented, then she can collect rare texts. If Maddison values knowledge, then she works in archives and organizes collections. If Maddison admires scholars, then she collects rare texts and treasures ancient wisdom. Maddison either works in archives or studies librarianship, but not both. If Maddison either translates texts or edits manuscripts (but not both), then she shares learning. Maddison either enjoys writing or loves books, but these two interests are mutually exclusive. Maddison admires scholars. Maddison does not express herself creatively.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Maddison can become a curator.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From admiring scholars, Maddison collects rare texts. Collecting rare texts implies she either values knowledge or shares learning. But sharing learning would force her to appreciate history or promote education, both of which are false, so she does not share learning and thus values knowledge. Valuing knowledge implies she works in archives and organizes collections. She does not express herself creatively, so she does not enjoy writing; by the mutual exclusion, she loves books. None of the premises mention curatorship or link any of Maddison’s properties to being (or being able to become) a curator, nor is it ruled out. Therefore, whether she can become a curator cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
