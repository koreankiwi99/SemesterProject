{
  "reasoning": "As a socialite, Egghead must either plan weddings or host events, but not both. He plans weddings, so he does not host events. Since he must either host events or throw awesome parties, he therefore throws awesome parties. Throwing awesome parties implies either infectious energy or attracting big crowds; he does not attract big crowds, so he has infectious energy. By the XOR with charisma, he does not have charisma. Given he has either charisma or an outgoing personality, he must have an outgoing personality. By the XOR between outgoing and introverted personalities, he cannot be introverted.",
  "answer": "B"
}
