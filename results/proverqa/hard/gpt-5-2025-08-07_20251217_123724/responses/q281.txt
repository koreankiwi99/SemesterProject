Question ID: 281
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Hadleigh evaluates outcomes. For anyone who appreciates botany and enjoys care giving, they can study horticultural therapy. Hadleigh has curiosity. If someone pursues their passion, then they face challenges and think outside the box. Hadleigh pursues her passion. If someone assesses situations and evaluates outcomes, then they can take calculated risks. If Hadleigh either sets high goals or overcomes obstacles (but not both), then she faces challenges. If Jayla either takes calculated risks or questions conventional wisdom (but not both), then she thinks outside the box. Jayla pursues her passion. If Jayla faces challenges, then she is either persistent or stays motivated, but not both. Anyone who explores new ideas and seeks innovative solutions is thinking outside the box. If Hadleigh has curiosity, then she either assesses situations or solves problems, but not both. Hadleigh does not question conventional wisdom. If Hadleigh either takes calculated risks or questions conventional wisdom (but not both), then she thinks outside the box. Hadleigh stays motivated. Issac evaluates outcomes. If Jayla studies horticultural therapy and has persistence, then she will succeed in research. Hadleigh does not solve problems. If Hadleigh faces challenges, then she is either persistent or stays motivated, but not both. If Hadleigh has experience, then she assesses situations and collaborates with others.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Hadleigh will succeed in research.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From curiosity and the XOR rule, Hadleigh assesses situations (since she does not solve problems). With assessing situations and evaluating outcomes, she can take calculated risks. From pursuing her passion, she faces challenges and thinks outside the box; with challenges and the XOR rule, and given she stays motivated, she is not persistent. The only rule about succeeding in research applies specifically to Jayla (if Jayla studies horticultural therapy and has persistence). There is no general rule linking Hadleigh’s traits to succeeding in research, nor evidence that Hadleigh meets any success condition. Thus, we cannot determine that Hadleigh will succeed in research.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
