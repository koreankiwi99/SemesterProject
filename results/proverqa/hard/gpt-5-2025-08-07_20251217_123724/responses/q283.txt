Question ID: 283
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Crew does not know biology. If Crew either rescues amphibians or researches marine life (but not both), then he studies axolotls. If Crew loves aquatic life, then he will study axolotls. Crew does not have a passion for nature. If someone cares for animals and understands ecology, then they can advocate for conservation. Anyone who enjoys scuba diving and appreciates marine life will love aquatic life. For all humans, if they value wildlife and help endangered species, then they care for animals. Crew helps endangered species. If Crew studies axolotls, then he either establishes a sanctuary or advocates for their conservation, but not both. Crew knows biology or understands ecology. Crew values wildlife. Crew has a passion for nature or loves aquatic life.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Crew does not establish a sanctuary.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "- Crew does not have a passion for nature, and either has a passion for nature or loves aquatic life; therefore, he loves aquatic life. Loving aquatic life implies he studies axolotls.\n- If he studies axolotls, then exactly one of the following is true: he establishes a sanctuary or he advocates for their conservation.\n- He does not know biology, and either knows biology or understands ecology; thus he understands ecology. With valuing wildlife and helping endangered species, he cares for animals; with caring and understanding ecology, he can advocate for conservation (ability), but this does not imply he actually advocates for axolotls.\n- Hence we cannot determine which branch of the exclusive choice (sanctuary vs advocacy) holds. Therefore, whether he establishes a sanctuary is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
