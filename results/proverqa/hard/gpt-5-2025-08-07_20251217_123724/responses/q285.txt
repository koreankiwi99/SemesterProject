Elian attends design events. If Elian either stays updated on the latest fashion or attends design events (but not both), then he follows current trends. Marcel either respects classics or stays updated on the latest fashion, but not both. Marcel attends design events. If someone either collects vintage items or adorns spaces luxuriously (but not both), then they appreciate elegance. Marcel is not a skilled craftsman. For all humans, if someone is an interior designer, then they either create beautiful spaces or have exquisite taste (or both). Anyone who admires refinement and enjoys beautiful things appreciates elegance. Elian either respects classics or stays updated on the latest fashion, but not both.

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Elian admires refinement and enjoys beautiful things, so he appreciates elegance, which implies he has artistic flair. Having artistic flair means he is either a skilled craftsman or an interior designer, but not both; since he is not a skilled craftsman, he is an interior designer. Being an interior designer implies he either creates beautiful spaces or has exquisite taste (or both). We also know he follows current trends (from attending design events and not staying updated, via the XOR rule), but this does not force or forbid creating beautiful spaces. Therefore, we cannot deduce whether he has exquisite taste; it remains possible but not entailed.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
