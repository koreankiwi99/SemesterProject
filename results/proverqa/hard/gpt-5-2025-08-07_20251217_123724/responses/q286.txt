==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Juliana embraces change, and since she either pursues excellence or embraces change (but not both), she does not pursue excellence. From 'values quality or pursues excellence,' she must value quality. Therefore, Juliana is an artisan and has attention to detail. As an artisan, she either preserves cultural heritage or supports local communities (but not both); given she supports local communities, she does not preserve cultural heritage. With 'preserves cultural heritage or creates unique textiles (but not both),' not preserving implies she creates unique textiles. However, there is no rule connecting any of these facts to 'learning traditional weaving.' Thus, whether Juliana learns traditional weaving cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C

Correct: Yes
