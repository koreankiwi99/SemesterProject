Question ID: 287
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Andi either reads avidly or analyzes data (but not both), then she is a fast learner. Noel is intelligent or adventurous. Noel does not retain information. If Noel either reads avidly or analyzes data (but not both), then she is a fast learner. Noel is a polyglot. If someone significantly contributes to their field, then they are intelligent. Cielo does not read avidly. Everyone who is a fast learner either has a good memory or retains information (or both). If Noel is a polyglot, then she either has a good memory or speaks multiple languages, but not both. Noel either communicates effectively or is intelligent, but not both. Noel does not read avidly. If Noel conducts research, then she either uncovers secrets or has a good memory (or both). Cielo does not retain information. Evander is intelligent or adventurous. Noel either speaks multiple languages or communicates effectively, but not both. Noel analyzes data.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Noel is adventurous.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Noel analyzes data and does not read avidly, satisfying the XOR condition, so she is a fast learner. Fast learners have good memory or retain information; since Noel does not retain information, she has a good memory. Being a polyglot implies (good memory XOR speaks multiple languages); thus speaks multiple languages is false. Given (speaks multiple languages XOR communicates effectively), she communicates effectively. Given (communicates effectively XOR intelligent), she is not intelligent. Since Noel is (intelligent or adventurous) and not intelligent, she must be adventurous. Therefore, the statement is true.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
