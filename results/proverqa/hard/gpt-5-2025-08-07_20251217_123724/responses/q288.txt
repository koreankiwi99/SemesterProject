If Jasper either sets priorities or overcomes obstacles (but not both), then he has strong determination. Quincy does not set goals. Paula does not read sea conditions. If Elodie knows weather patterns or masters navigation skills, then he can win sailing competitions. Jasper does not read sea conditions. Everyone who understands currents either plots their course or anticipates winds (or both). Paula understands currents. Elodie is not a successful sailor. Jasper does not plot his course. Jasper does not study tides. If Jasper studies charts, then he masters navigation skills. If Quincy either knows weather patterns or reads sea conditions (but not both), then he is a successful sailor. Jasper understands currents. All confident individuals who can win competitions also stay focused. If Jasper either knows weather patterns or reads sea conditions (but not both), then he is a successful sailor.

  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Jasper understands currents, and since he does not plot his course, he must anticipate winds. Because he anticipates winds and does not study tides, he respects the ocean, which implies he wins sailing competitions and has strong determination. However, there is no rule that implies he masters navigation skills (the only given route is studying charts, which is not stated), nor any rule that defines or implies he has sailing experience. Neither conjunct is derivable or refutable from the premises, so the conjunction’s truth is unknown.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
