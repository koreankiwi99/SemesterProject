==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From the premises: Influential and builds trust implies not commands attention. If Cynthia worked hard, then (given she does not achieve success) she would earn respect, which with not commands attention would force leadership positions; combined with vision this would imply driving innovation, contradicting the given that she does not drive innovation. Hence she does not work hard and thus is a manager. With authority and trusting her instinct, she does not think carefully; being a manager then implies she acts on impulse. From not driving innovation and having vision, she does not hold leadership positions; therefore she solves problems (from the given disjunction). However, no rule mentions or entails anything about 'protects her interests,' nor its negation. Therefore, its truth value cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
