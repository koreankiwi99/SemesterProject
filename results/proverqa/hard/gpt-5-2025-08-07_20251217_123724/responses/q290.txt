==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From faces challenges, Walter seeks guidance, and thus finds inner peace; but given he neither lives sincerely nor acts with compassion, the set is inconsistent in that area and does not inform devoutness. From not leading a good life and (values morality or has faith) -> good life, we infer Walter does not have faith. Then (reads scriptures XOR practices meditation) -> has faith, so he does neither. Attends church and prays regularly do not entail devoutness by any given rule. The only mention of devout is the disjunction \"Walter is spiritual or devout,\" and with \"everyone is either spiritual or atheistic, but not both\" we still cannot determine which holds. No rule links any derived facts to being devout or not devout. Therefore, whether Walter is devout cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
