Question ID: 292
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Aliyah trusts her instinct. Aliyah has strong intuition. Anyone who speaks confidently or writes clearly can communicate complex ideas. If Aliyah meets deadlines, then she either collaborates well or works independently, but not both. If Aliyah collaborates well, then she has strong intuition and can communicate complex ideas. Aliyah does not work independently. Aliyah either thinks logically or trusts her instinct, but not both. Aliyah does not evaluate data effectively. If Aliyah makes accurate conclusions, then she either thinks logically or evaluates data effectively (but not both). If someone is accurate, then they are either precise in measurements or reliable in findings (or both). For Aliyah, being able to communicate complex ideas and being reliable in findings are mutually exclusive. Everyone who approaches problems systematically either thinks logically or considers multiple perspectives (or both). Aliyah does not have attention to detail. Aliyah is accurate or innovative. Aliyah meets deadlines. If Aliyah is precise in measurements, then she either has attention to detail or makes accurate conclusions (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Aliyah is not innovative.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "Aliyah meets deadlines and does not work independently, so by the XOR rule she collaborates well. Collaborating well implies she can communicate complex ideas. For Aliyah, communicating complex ideas and being reliable in findings are mutually exclusive, so she is not reliable in findings. If Aliyah were accurate, then by 'accurate -> (precise or reliable)' and not reliable, she must be precise. Being precise implies (by XOR) either attention to detail or accurate conclusions; since she lacks attention to detail, she must make accurate conclusions. But accurate conclusions require (by XOR) either thinking logically or evaluating data effectively, and Aliyah does neither (she trusts her instinct, thus not logical, and she does not evaluate data effectively). Contradiction. Therefore, Aliyah is not accurate. Given 'Aliyah is accurate or innovative', innovative must be true. Hence, 'Aliyah is not innovative' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
