Question ID: 293
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Sloan either obeys commands or performs tricks (but not both), then he is domesticated. Every horse that participates in parades either executes maneuvers or responds to cues. Saeedi is not fast. Saeedi is trained. For every horse, it is either domesticated or wild, but not both. If Saeedi either obeys commands or performs tricks (but not both), then he is domesticated. If Saeedi has strength, then he is either fast or roams free, but not both. Dilan participates in parades. Saeedi either follows training or performs tricks. Saeedi does not execute maneuvers. If Saeedi has beauty, then he has a lovely gait and performs tricks. Dilan is not fast. Saeedi participates in parades. If Saeedi either listens carefully or reacts quickly (but not both), then he follows training. Dilan does not execute maneuvers. Fiona either roams free or follows training, but not both. If Dilan has strength, then he is either fast or roams free, but not both. Saeedi has strength. Sloan is trained. Saeedi either roams free or follows training, but not both. If Saeedi is trained, then he either obeys commands or responds to cues (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Saeedi is a wild horse.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Saeedi has strength and is not fast, so by the fast-or-roams-free (but not both) rule, he roams free. Since he either roams free or follows training (but not both), he does not follow training. Given he either follows training or performs tricks, he must perform tricks. Saeedi participates in parades and does not execute maneuvers, so he responds to cues. Being trained implies obeys-commands XOR responds-to-cues; since he responds to cues, he does not obey commands. Now, obeys-commands (false) XOR performs-tricks (true) holds, which implies Saeedi is domesticated. As every horse is either domesticated or wild, but not both, Saeedi is not wild. Therefore the statement that Saeedi is a wild horse is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
