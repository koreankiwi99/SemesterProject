==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Rosalina puts others first, so she protects the vulnerable. She does not save lives, but since she must either save lives or risk her life, she risks her life. Risking her life implies she is either courageous or serves others; since she does not serve others, she is courageous. If courageous, then exactly one of earning respect or inspiring leadership holds. We have no information to choose which one. Therefore, we cannot determine whether she does not earn respect.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
