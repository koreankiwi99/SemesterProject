Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Andy does not earn global recognition.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Andy does not value efficiency, and he must value efficiency or have a strong work ethic; therefore he has a strong work ethic. He speaks at conferences, so he leads project teams. From having a strong work ethic and the rule (dedicated to innovation XOR leads project teams), since he leads project teams, he is not dedicated to innovation. Andy does not foster collaboration; given (expert XOR fosters collaboration), he is an expert. With (shares knowledge XOR guides newcomers) implying mentors, and Andy guides newcomers and does not share knowledge, he mentors others. From (expert -> mentors XOR pioneering new technology), since he mentors, he is not pioneering new technology. No rule links any of Andy’s properties (leading teams, mentoring, speaking at conferences, etc.) to earning global recognition. Therefore, whether Andy earns global recognition cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
