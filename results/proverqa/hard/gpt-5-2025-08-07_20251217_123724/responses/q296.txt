==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From medical condition and not volunteering, Jaxton participates in sports. With chronic illness and sports, he faces challenges, which implies he will (and thus can) overcome adversity. Determination with the fact that he creates change implies he does not make a positive impact. Resilience then forces inspire (since it's XOR with making a positive impact). Given he can overcome adversity, and it's XOR between finding personal strength and inspiring others, his inspiring others means he does not find personal strength. Therefore, the statement is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
