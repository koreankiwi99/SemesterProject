==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Chosen avoids hunters and finds water, so by contrapositive of 'If Chosen thrives in Madagascar, then (find water XOR avoid hunters)', Chosen does not thrive in Madagascar. From outsmarts predators, Chosen has charisma. Given 'If (charisma XOR leads the group) then inspires' and 'Chosen does not inspire', Chosen must both have charisma and lead the group. Also, since 'plays with others -> feels happiness' and Chosen does not feel happiness, he does not play with others. None of these facts (nor any rule provided) relate to Chosen being fearless. The only fearless-related rule concerns Rocky, not Chosen. Therefore, whether Chosen is fearless cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
