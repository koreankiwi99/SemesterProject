Question ID: 298
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Muppet does not become more efficient. All robots that acquire new skills learn from experience and improve their performance. If Muppet either executes predefined programs or follows scheduled routines (but not both), then it receives remote commands. Muppet improves its performance. Any robot that can process information is able to analyze data. If a robot learns from experience and achieves its mission objectives, then it becomes more efficient. Muppet does not operate offline. Muppet either performs tasks autonomously or has advanced sensors. For all robots, if a robot has advanced sensors and has deep learning capabilities, then it can make informed decisions. Muppet can process information. Muppet either receives remote commands or performs tasks autonomously, but not both. If Muppet makes precise calculations, then it will achieve its mission objectives. Muppet either receives remote commands or operates offline, but not both. Muppet acquires new skills. Every robot that can analyze data either has deep learning capabilities or can make precise calculations.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Muppet can make informed decisions.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Muppet can process information, so it can analyze data. Any robot that can analyze data either has deep learning capabilities (DLC) or can make precise calculations (PC). If Muppet had PC, then it would achieve its mission objectives; combined with learning from experience (from acquiring new skills), that would imply it becomes more efficient—contradicting the given that it does not. Therefore, Muppet must have DLC. From XOR(receives remote commands, operates offline) and not operating offline, Muppet receives remote commands; from XOR(receives remote commands, performs tasks autonomously), it does not perform tasks autonomously. Given it either performs tasks autonomously or has advanced sensors, it must have advanced sensors (AS). With AS and DLC, Muppet can make informed decisions.",
  "answer": "A"

Result:

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
