==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Faith does not have strong connections. Since volunteering implies strong connections, Faith does not volunteer. With an outgoing nature implying she either volunteers or cares for others, she must care for others. Given she does not spread happiness and that joyful personality plus caring implies spreading happiness, Faith is not joyful. From good energy or joyful, she must have good energy; thus she cares for others (again). Appreciating beauty gives her good taste, and she is also imaginative, so both are true. If she had creative expression, she would have exactly one of good taste or imaginative, which is false; hence she does not have creative expression. If passionate about music, then creative expression or joyful; both are false, so she is not passionate about music. Also, inspirational implies uplifting, but she is not uplifting, so she is not inspirational. If she were passionate about art XOR music, she would be inspirational; thus not (art XOR music). With not passionate about music, this yields not passionate about art. Therefore, the statement 'Faith is not passionate about art' is true.",
  "answer": "A"
