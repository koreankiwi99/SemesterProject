Question ID: 300
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Lakelynn does not regain confidence. Steven does not practice mindfulness. Steven does not seek medical attention. Orion is physically inactive. If Orion's patients feel better, then they regain confidence. If Steven's patients feel better, then they regain confidence. If Steven's patients experience symptoms, then they either find a support network or overcome depression (or both). Brayan does not lead a balanced life. Steven's patients manage stress or overcome depression. If Lakelynn's patients get medical treatment and follow their prescription, then they can overcome depression. Steven does not regain confidence. Steven either has a debilitating condition or leads a healthy lifestyle, but not both. Lakelynn does not seek medical attention. If someone stays positive, then they can improve their mental health. Steven either leads a healthy lifestyle or is physically inactive, but not both. Steven does not lead a balanced life. Lakelynn's patients manage stress or overcome depression. If Steven either manages stress or practices mindfulness (but not both), then he leads a balanced life. Steven is physically inactive. For anyone who has a support system and engages in hobbies, they can manage stress. Everyone who has a debilitating condition either seeks medical attention or takes medicine (or both). For anyone who eats nutritious food and exercises regularly, they can lead a healthy lifestyle. If someone takes medicine and improves their mental health, then they feel better.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Steven's patients get medical treatment, then they can improve their mental health.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From the XORs, Steven is physically inactive, so he does not lead a healthy lifestyle; therefore, by the other XOR, he has a debilitating condition. Hence he either seeks medical attention or takes medicine; given he does not seek medical attention, he takes medicine. However, this concerns Steven himself, not his patients. For Steven’s patients, we only know: (i) if they feel better then they regain confidence, and (ii) they manage stress or overcome depression. There is no rule linking Steven’s patients getting medical treatment to improving their mental health. The only treatment-related rule given is about Lakelynn’s patients (not Steven’s). Also, the medicine rule is one-way: taking medicine and improving mental health implies feeling better; it does not let us infer improving mental health from receiving treatment. Therefore, the implication about Steven’s patients is not entailed and could fail in some models, making it uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
