==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From the premises we can derive that Hamza prefers structure → values order; he believes in authority while not prioritizing discipline → has strict views; he learns quickly and adapts → works strategically; has big ideas and thinks critically → sets high goals; high goals + works strategically → ambitious; ambitious → seeks control; seeks control → suppresses individual freedoms and imposes harsh laws. However, there is no rule linking these traits to holding absolute power. The only statement about absolute power concerns Kash, not Hamza. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Hamza holds absolute power or not.",
  "answer": "C"
}
