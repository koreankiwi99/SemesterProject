Question ID: 303
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Noelle does not become an expert. Anyone who has curiosity and collects samples can conduct botanical research. Noelle does not document her findings. If Noelle does not have a green thumb or receives training, then she can tend to plants. If Noelle explores nature, then she either documents her findings or collects samples (or both). For every human, either they have a green thumb or they do not have a green thumb, but not both. If someone tends to plants and cultivates rare species, then they can become an expert. Noelle examines fungi. Noelle has curiosity. Noelle explores nature. Noelle either examines fungi or studies common plants, but not both. If Noelle conducts botanical research, then she either cultivates rare species or studies common plants, but not both.

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Noelle explores nature, and since she does not document, she must collect samples. With curiosity and collecting, she conducts research. Research implies either cultivating rare species or studying common plants; but examining fungi excludes studying common plants, so she cultivates rare species. If tending plants and cultivating rare species then expert; given she is not an expert, she must not tend plants. From (not green thumb or training) implies tending, the contrapositive gives that not tending implies having a green thumb and not trained. Thus she has a green thumb, so the statement 'Noelle does not have a green thumb' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
