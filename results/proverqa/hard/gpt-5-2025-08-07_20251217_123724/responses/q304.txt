Question ID: 304
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If someone avoids publicity and keeps a low profile, then they remain unnoticed. Anders publishes research. If someone either collects plant samples or studies flora (but not both), then they are passionate about botany. Anders does not earn accolades. Anders does not explore nature. If Anders is influential, then he either builds a network or gains recognition (but not both). Anders either remains unnoticed or earns accolades, but not both. Anders does not pursue artistic interests. Anders either remains unnoticed or gains recognition, but not both. If Anders is passionate about botany, then he explores nature and contributes to science. If Anders either makes notable discoveries or publishes research (but not both), then he gains recognition. Anders either pursues artistic interests or contributes to science, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Anders is meticulous in his research.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Anders does not pursue artistic interests, so by the XOR rule he contributes to science. He does not earn accolades, and by the XOR rule (remains unnoticed or earns accolades), he must remain unnoticed; thus, by the other XOR (remains unnoticed or gains recognition), he does not gain recognition. He publishes research. If he did not make notable discoveries, then the XOR condition (notable discoveries or publishes research) would hold and imply he gains recognition, contradicting the above. Therefore, he also makes notable discoveries, making the XOR antecedent false and avoiding the recognition conclusion. He is not passionate about botany because that would require exploring nature, which he does not. None of the given rules connect any facts to being meticulous in his research. Therefore, whether he is meticulous is not determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
