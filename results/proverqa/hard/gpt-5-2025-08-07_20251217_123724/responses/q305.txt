Francis studies genetics. Arlo studies genetics. If a botanist appreciates nature and understands ecosystems, then they can nurture gardens. If Rowen nurtures gardens, then he is passionate about plants and collaborates with experts. Francis understands ecosystems. If Diana loves the outdoors, then he experiments with new techniques and collaborates with experts. If a botanist studies genetics and collects field data, then they can publish groundbreaking work. If Rowen is passionate about plants, then he is dedicated to research and mentors students. Anyone who conducts outdoor experiments will collect field data. If Arlo owns an orchard, then he values biodiversity and collaborates with experts. Rowen does not love the outdoors. If Arlo nurtures gardens, then he is passionate about plants and collaborates with experts. Arlo conducts outdoor experiments.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Arlo contributes to conservation.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Arlo appreciates nature, understands ecosystems, studies genetics, and conducts outdoor experiments (thus collects field data). Some rules would allow a botanist with these traits to be able to nurture gardens or to be able to publish groundbreaking work, but we are not told Arlo is a botanist, and the rules use \"can\" (ability) rather than asserting he actually does those actions. There is no given rule linking any of Arlo’s established traits (e.g., appreciating nature, understanding ecosystems, collecting field data) to contributing to conservation. Nothing states or implies he contributes to conservation, nor that he does not. Therefore, the truth of the statement cannot be determined from the information provided.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
