==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Treasure has muscle mass and light bones, so she is built for speed, which makes her athletic, hence fast and strong-willed. Being disciplined with an exclusive condition and given that she has stamina implies she is not enduring. However, no premise connects these traits to being valued, and 'valued' is never defined. Thus, the truth of 'Treasure is valued' cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}
