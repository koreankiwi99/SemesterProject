Question ID: 307
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Any being that experiments with DNA or uses unstable compounds can have genetic mutations. Sevyn analyzes data. Sevyn explores planetary environments. Any being that is radiation sensitive or undergoes cell division can have genetic mutations. If Sevyn works in a lab or analyzes data, then she studies genetics. Sevyn either studies genetics or is exposed to a mutagenic serum, but not both. Jimena explores planetary environments. If Sevyn is exposed to a mutagenic serum or has genetic mutations, then she develops extraordinary abilities. If Lauryn works in a lab or analyzes data, then she studies genetics. Malakai analyzes data. Lauryn either studies genetics or is exposed to a mutagenic serum, but not both. If Sevyn craves knowledge, then she seeks new discoveries and conducts field research. A being either conducts field research or experiments with DNA, but these two activities are not necessarily related. Sevyn either explores planetary environments or conducts field research, but these two activities are not necessarily related.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sevyn does not develop extraordinary abilities.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Sevyn analyzes data, so by the rule (if works in a lab or analyzes data -> studies genetics), she studies genetics. Given the XOR (either studies genetics or is exposed to a mutagenic serum, but not both), Sevyn is not exposed to a mutagenic serum. Extraordinary abilities occur if Sevyn is exposed to a mutagenic serum or has genetic mutations. Since she is not exposed, we would need her to have genetic mutations. However, the rules only provide conditions under which a being can have genetic mutations (e.g., experiments with DNA, uses unstable compounds, radiation sensitive, undergoes cell division), none of which are established as facts for Sevyn. Even the statement that a being either conducts field research or experiments with DNA does not ensure she experiments with DNA, and even if she did, it only implies she can have mutations, not that she does. Therefore, we cannot determine whether she develops extraordinary abilities or not. The statement that she does not develop extraordinary abilities is thus uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
