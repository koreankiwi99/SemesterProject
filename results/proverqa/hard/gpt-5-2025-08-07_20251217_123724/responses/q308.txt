{
  "reasoning": "Lawson both desires wealth and values privacy. If he sought recognition, he would have exactly one of those, so he does not seek recognition. Given he either seeks recognition or eschews fame (but not both), he eschews fame. Anyone who eschews fame works behind the scenes, so Lawson works behind the scenes. Also, from not craving the spotlight and the disjunction with preferring anonymity, he prefers anonymity; with being highly skilled, he ghostwrites, which also implies working behind the scenes. Since (talented writer ∧ works behind the scenes) ⇒ influential, and Lawson is not influential while he does work behind the scenes, it follows that he is not a talented writer.",
  "answer": "A"
