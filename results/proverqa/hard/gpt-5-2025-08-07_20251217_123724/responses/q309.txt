Question ID: 309
Difficulty: hard

Context:
For any mythical creature that roams dreamscapes and is omnipotent, they will inspire awe. If Elaine sees beyond the surface or listens deeply, then he can hold wisdom. If Elaine embodies balance, then he either holds wisdom or masters the cosmos, but not both. If Dakari possesses magic, then he can weave illusions. If Dakari understands nature and controls elements, then he masters the cosmos. If Dakari sees beyond the surface or listens deeply, then he can hold wisdom. Dakari does not inspire awe. Dakari sees beyond the surface. Dakari embodies balance. If Dakari shapeshifts his form, then he either navigates realms or controls elements. Dakari understands nature. If Dakari possesses intuition, then he either holds wisdom or speaks the truth, but not both. Every mythical creature has powers or possesses magic. If Dakari embodies balance, then he either holds wisdom or masters the cosmos, but not both. Dakari roams dreamscapes. If Dakari either controls elements or has powers (but not both), then he is omnipotent.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Dakari roams dreamscapes and does not inspire awe. For mythical creatures, if one roams dreamscapes and is omnipotent, then they inspire awe; thus Dakari is not omnipotent. Dakari sees beyond the surface, so he can hold wisdom. With embodying balance, he either holds wisdom or masters the cosmos, but not both; hence he does not master the cosmos. Since he understands nature and (if he controlled elements he would master the cosmos), he must not control elements. If (controls elements XOR has powers) then omnipotent; because he is not omnipotent and does not control elements, he also does not have powers. Every mythical creature has powers or possesses magic; therefore Dakari possesses magic. If Dakari possesses magic, then he can weave illusions. Hence, Dakari can weave illusions.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
