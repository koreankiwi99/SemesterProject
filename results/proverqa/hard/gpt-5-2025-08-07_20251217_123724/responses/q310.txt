==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Melissa develops recipes and does not create menus, so by the XOR rule she is a skilled chef. A skilled chef must either host classes or write cookbooks (but not both); since she writes cookbooks, she does not host classes. Melissa must therefore become a culinary influencer by her other XOR (hosts classes or influencer). She experiments with spice combinations and does not create unique recipes, so by XOR she understands flavor profiles. Being a foodie implies she either masters cooking skills or understands flavor profiles (but not both); thus she does not master cooking skills. From \"masters cooking skills or learns preservation techniques,\" she must learn preservation techniques. Learning preservation techniques implies she can either start a food business or become a culinary influencer (but not both). Since she is a culinary influencer, she cannot start a food business. Therefore, the statement is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
