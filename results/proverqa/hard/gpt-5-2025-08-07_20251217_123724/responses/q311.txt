Question ID: 311
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Shmoops senses energy or understands emotions, then it can build trust. If Shmoops either respects boundaries or has empathy (but not both), then it values harmony. Shmoops can understand emotions if Shmoops has compassion. Any being that prioritizes coexistence respects boundaries. If Shmoops either detects vibrations or senses energy (but not both), then it is intuitive. Shmoops does not detect vibrations. If Shmoops either reads body language or shares thoughts (but not both), then it is able to connect with others. Shmoops is not intuitive. If Shmoops has empathy, then it either builds trust or can read minds, but not both. Shmoops connects with others or understands emotions. Shmoops can read minds. Shmoops does not value harmony. If Shmoops forms a telepathic bond, then it shares knowledge. Shmoops prioritizes coexistence. If Shmoops connects with others, then it will form a telepathic bond.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Shmoops shares knowledge.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Prioritizing coexistence implies Shmoops respects boundaries. Since XOR(respects boundaries, empathy) would imply valuing harmony but Shmoops does not value harmony, both must be true: Shmoops has empathy and respects boundaries. With empathy true and can read minds true, the XOR rule forces builds trust to be false. From (senses energy or understands emotions) -> builds trust and builds trust is false, it follows that Shmoops neither senses energy nor understands emotions. Given (connects with others or understands emotions) and understands emotions is false, Shmoops connects with others. Then connects with others -> forms a telepathic bond -> shares knowledge. Therefore, Shmoops shares knowledge.",
  "answer": "A"

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
