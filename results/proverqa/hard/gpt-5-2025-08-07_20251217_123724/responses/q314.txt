Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Jaziel learns quickly, so he has versatile skills. He also has specialized knowledge. If he had wide interests, he could not have both, so he does not have wide interests. Hence, from the XOR with avid reader, Jaziel is an avid reader, and from the XOR with inspiring teacher, he is not an inspiring teacher. From (influential or achieves success) -> impact and the fact Jaziel is not impactful, it follows he is neither influential nor successful. From (prodigious writer XOR inspiring teacher) -> influential, with inspiring teacher false, prodigious writer would imply influential. Since he is not influential, he cannot be a prodigious writer. Therefore, the statement is false.",
  "answer": "B"

Ground Truth: B
