If Emmy advances historical knowledge, then she will gain recognition. Emmy either pursues alternate careers or is dedicated to archaeology, but not both. If Emmy either makes groundbreaking discoveries or uncovers lost artifacts (but not both), then she advances historical knowledge. Anyone who uncovers lost artifacts or deciphers ancient texts can shed new light on history. Emmy does not gain recognition. If Emmy sheds new light on history, then she will inspire others. Emmy does not pursue alternate careers.

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Emmy does not pursue alternate careers, and since it’s an exclusive or with being dedicated, she is dedicated to archaeology. Being dedicated implies exactly one of (making groundbreaking discoveries, becoming a leading expert). Emmy does not gain recognition, so she did not advance historical knowledge. Emmy does not inspire others; since shedding light implies inspiring, she did not shed light. From (uncovering or deciphering) implying shedding light, she neither uncovers nor deciphers; thus she does not uncover. The rule (groundbreaking XOR uncovering) implies advancing; contrapositive with not advancing gives not (groundbreaking XOR uncovering). With not uncovering, this forces not groundbreaking. Therefore, from the exclusive choice under dedication, she must become a leading expert. Hence, the statement 'Emmy does not become a leading expert' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
