Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Ali has a creative job, which implies she works either in corporate or a nonprofit, but not both. Since Ali works in a nonprofit, she does not work in corporate. Given Ali is either an artist or works in corporate (but not both), not working in corporate implies Ali is an artist. Artists either express their emotions freely or inspire others (or both). Ali follows tradition and, by the exclusive choice with pursuing passions, does not pursue her passions. From the statement that Ali either pursues her passions or finds inner peace, she must find inner peace. The statements about finding inner peace or inspiring others do not force whether she inspires others. Thus, from being an artist, Ali could either express her emotions freely or (only) inspire others; both are consistent with the rest. Therefore, whether Ali expresses her emotions freely cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
