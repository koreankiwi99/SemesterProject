Question ID: 318
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If a botanist examines plant structures and collects botanical samples, then they explore botany. Every botanist either publishes scientific papers or discovers new species, but not necessarily both. Julio either identifies plant habitats or analyzes botanical data, but not necessarily both. Every botanist who explores botany either discovers new species or earns academic recognition (or both). Julio publishes scientific papers. If Julio studies plant classification, then he travels to rainforests and specializes in Commelinidae. Julio does not earn academic recognition. For every botanist, either they are specialized in Commelinidae or they are not specialized in Commelinidae, but not both. Every botanist either researches plant species or analyzes botanical data. Julio identifies plant habitats. Every botanist either explores botany or studies plant classification.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Julio is not specialized in Commelinidae.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "The only rule connecting Julio to specialization is: if Julio studies plant classification, then he specializes in Commelinidae. We are not given (nor can we derive) that Julio studies plant classification. His lack of academic recognition only implies that if he explores botany, he must discover new species, which does not determine specialization. Even if Julio is a botanist, the dichotomy (specialized or not, but not both) does not tell us which case holds. Therefore, whether Julio is not specialized in Commelinidae cannot be determined from the premises.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
