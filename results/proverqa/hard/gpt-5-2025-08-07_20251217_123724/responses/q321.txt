Question ID: 321
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Candy does not continue to evolve. Candy either processes data quickly or enhances accuracy. Candy does not process data quickly. If Candy stays relevant forever and meets user expectations, then she continues to evolve. Candy receives regular updates. Candy either predicts user needs or handles large capacity, but not necessarily both. If a computer program efficiently manages data and predicts user needs, then it becomes an indispensable tool. If Iker becomes an indispensable tool and receives regular updates, then she stays relevant forever. Skyla does not handle large capacity. If Candy becomes an indispensable tool and receives regular updates, then she stays relevant forever. Candy does not boost research. Skyla does not continue to evolve. Any computer program that streamlines processes will improve productivity. Candy does not handle large capacity. Candy meets user expectations. For all computer programs, if a program is well-designed, then it efficiently manages data and streamlines processes. Any computer program that is refined will enhance accuracy. A computer program that improves productivity and enhances accuracy will boost research.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Candy is well-designed.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From \"Candy either processes data quickly or enhances accuracy\" and \"Candy does not process data quickly,\" Candy enhances accuracy. From \"Candy either predicts user needs or handles large capacity (but not necessarily both)\" and \"Candy does not handle large capacity,\" Candy predicts user needs. Assume for contradiction that Candy is well-designed. Then, by the rule, well-designed implies it streamlines processes and efficiently manages data. Streamlining processes implies improving productivity; with enhancing accuracy, this implies boosting research. But Candy does not boost research, a contradiction. Additionally, efficiently managing data together with predicting user needs would make Candy indispensable; with receiving updates, she would stay relevant forever; with meeting user expectations, she would continue to evolve—contradicting that she does not continue to evolve. Therefore, Candy is not well-designed.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
