Question ID: 324
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Leilani examines mineral formations. For any mineralogist, they either examine mineral formations or study crystal structures, but it's possible to do both. Any mineralogist who works hard or sets goals is diligent. Every mineralogist who draws accurate conclusions either studies crystal structures or contributes to technology advancements (or both). Leilani either publishes research or focuses on theoretical work, but not both. If Leilani is either diligent or innovative (but not both), then she is distinguished. If Leilani is an experienced mineralogist, then she either evaluates results or draws accurate conclusions, but not both. Leilani is innovative. Leilani focuses on theoretical work. All meticulous mineralogists analyze samples and draw accurate conclusions. Leilani does not contribute to technology advancements. All diligent mineralogists are meticulous and publish research.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Leilani is not distinguished.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Leilani focuses on theoretical work and, by the exclusive-or with publishing, she does not publish research. From 'All diligent mineralogists publish research,' contrapositive gives that not publishing implies she is not diligent. She is innovative. Thus exactly one of {diligent, innovative} is true, so by the given rule (XOR implies distinguished), Leilani is distinguished. Therefore, 'Leilani is not distinguished' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
