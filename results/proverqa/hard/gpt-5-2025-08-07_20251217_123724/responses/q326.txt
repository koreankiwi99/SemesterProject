==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Jaylani is adaptable, so she embraces freedom. With the XOR (settles down or embraces freedom), she does not settle down. She loves nature and does not appreciate routine, so by the XOR rule she values comfort. Valuing comfort implies either enjoying stability or settling down; since she does not settle down, she enjoys stability. By the XOR (enjoys stability or likes travel), she does not like travel. Given “either likes travel or is a land lover,” and not liking travel, she is a land lover. By the XOR (land lover or sea goer), she is not a sea goer. Therefore, the statement that Jaylani is a sea goer is false.",
  "answer": "B"
