Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Paloma is detail-oriented and culturally sensitive; from being detail-oriented she understands lighting. She cannot edit images and knows photography techniques. She either buys quality equipment or has a creative vision (not exclusive), but nothing directly implies that she travels extensively. Becoming a professional photographer requires both traveling extensively and having a good camera (which itself requires buying quality equipment). Whether she buys equipment is not established. If she did travel and buy equipment, a chain would force her to have good eyesight, which would conflict with the rule that good eyesight implies exactly one of detail-oriented or culturally sensitive (she is both). This shows that travel plus buying equipment cannot both be true, but it does not determine whether she travels. Since no rule entails or forbids her traveling, the statement remains undetermined.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: B
