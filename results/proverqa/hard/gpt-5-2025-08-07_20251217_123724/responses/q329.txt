Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From the premises: King Cruz has leadership skills, and by the XOR rule he either makes wise decisions or shows empathy. He seeks counsel and does not evaluate options, so he must possess good judgment, which implies he makes wise decisions. Hence, he makes wise decisions (and thus not both wise and empathetic). However, there is no information linking being a just ruler to bringing prosperity or forging unity, nor any link from wise decisions to prosperity or unity. We cannot confirm the consequent or refute the antecedent. Therefore, the truth of the conditional cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
