==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Ayan is either careful or careless, but not both. He would be careful if he is meticulous. He is meticulous only if (organizes notes XOR tracks data); since he does not track data, this reduces to requiring that he organizes notes. However, we only know Ayan keeps records or organizes notes, which does not force that he organizes notes. Thus we cannot conclude he is meticulous or careful. Therefore, whether Ayan is careless remains undetermined, making 'Ayan is not careless' uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
