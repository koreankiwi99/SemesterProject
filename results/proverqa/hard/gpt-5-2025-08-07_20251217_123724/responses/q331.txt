==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From career goals and not having strong motivation, Tate must pursue his passion. Pursuing his passion implies either being dedicated or achieving success, but not both; since Tate achieves success, he is not dedicated. Being ambitious and not enjoying freedom forces prioritizing leisure, which (with the leisure-or-work-tirelessly XOR) implies he does not work tirelessly. None of the premises connect any of these traits to becoming an expert. There is no rule deriving expertise or its negation. Therefore, whether Tate becomes an expert is not determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: C
