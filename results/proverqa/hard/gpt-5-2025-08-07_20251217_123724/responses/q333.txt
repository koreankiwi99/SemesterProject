Question ID: 333
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If someone advances medical knowledge and communicates effectively, then they can inspire others. Jude either appreciates biological complexity or values scientific discovery (or both). Anyone who studies morphogenesis either identifies developmental mechanisms or understands cellular processes (or both). Rosemary either appreciates biological complexity or values scientific discovery (or both). Jude does not make new discoveries. Jude shares ideas or communicates effectively. Jude does not achieve recognition. Anyone who inspires others or makes new discoveries will achieve recognition. Anyone who appreciates biological complexity understands cellular processes or advances medical knowledge (or both). Ryan does not achieve recognition. Ryan either has curiosity or understands cellular processes, but it is possible for Ryan to have both. Jude has curiosity. Jude either has curiosity or understands cellular processes, but it is possible for Jude to have both. Saint has curiosity. Anyone who speaks clearly and listens actively can communicate effectively. Jude does not share ideas.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jude values scientific discovery.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From “Jude shares ideas or communicates effectively” and “Jude does not share ideas,” Jude communicates effectively. Given Jude does not achieve recognition and (inspires others or makes new discoveries) implies recognition, by contrapositive Jude does not inspire and does not make new discoveries. Since (advances medical knowledge and communicates effectively) implies inspires, with CE true this forces Jude does not advance medical knowledge. If Jude appreciates biological complexity, then he understands cellular processes or advances medical knowledge; with not advancing medical knowledge, this would imply he understands cellular processes, which is consistent. Because we only know Jude either appreciates biological complexity or values scientific discovery (or both), and we cannot rule out appreciating complexity nor force valuing scientific discovery, whether Jude values scientific discovery remains undetermined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
