{
  "reasoning": "Bridger tells profound stories and does not speak from the heart, so by the XOR rule he has high inspirational value. From that, he is either receiving divine messages or highly intellectually capable, but not both; since he is highly intellectually capable, he is not receiving divine messages. Bridger has intuitive insight, implying (by XOR) either extensive knowledge or great wisdom. From 'Bridger lives in harmony with nature' and the XOR with understanding cosmic principles, he does not understand cosmic principles; combined with 'Bridger understands cosmic principles or has extensive knowledge', he has extensive knowledge, hence not great wisdom. The only rule linking being revered as a prophet applies to Jayson, not Bridger. With no rule connecting Bridger’s properties to being revered (and given he neither receives divine messages nor possesses great wisdom), we cannot conclude he is revered, nor can we conclude he is not. Therefore, it is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
