==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Ellis makes time for others, so he is thoughtful. He does not stand up for himself, and since it is given that he either stands up for himself or treats others kindly (inclusive), he must treat others kindly. Therefore, he has good intentions. If he has good intentions, he is thoughtful (and not empathetic). However, no rule links being thoughtful, kind, or having good intentions to offering support. Thus, whether Ellis offers support cannot be determined.",
