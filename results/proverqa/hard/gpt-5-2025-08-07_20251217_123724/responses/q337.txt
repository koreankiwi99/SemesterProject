Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From the premises, we can infer Maia explores deserts (since she does not protect succulents and must do one or the other), gains deeper knowledge and conserves plants (from exploring deserts), collects specimens and therefore does not share her findings (due to the XOR with conserving plants), and cultivates succulents while not understanding ecosystems (due to the XOR). However, no rule mentions or implies that Maia studies cacti, nor that she does not study cacti. Therefore, the truth of the statement cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
