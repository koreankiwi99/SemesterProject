Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From being passionate about research, Ameer collaborates and specializes. From prioritizing others' wellbeing, he has strong ethics. Given he does not inspire others and that anyone with strong ethics and pursues noble goals would inspire others, Ameer does not pursue noble goals; thus the disjunction 'values integrity or pursues noble goals' implies he values integrity. The only link to studying hard is: if Ameer studies hard, then he makes meaningful contributions. Nothing in the premises forces that he does or does not make meaningful contributions, nor that he studies hard. Therefore, whether Ameer studies hard cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
