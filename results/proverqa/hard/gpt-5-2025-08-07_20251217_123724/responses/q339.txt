Question ID: 339
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Presley does not try new techniques. If Presley is an innovative artist, then he either creates visually stunning work or applies mathematical principles in his art (or both). Presley takes creative risks. If an artist understands color theory and uses natural light effectively, then they can create visually stunning work. Presley does not pursue creative expression. For Presley, either his work focuses on functionality or it creates visually stunning effects, but these two aspects are mutually exclusive. If an artist is comfortable with taking risks, they will experiment fearlessly. Every artist who experiments fearlessly pushes boundaries. If Presley either tries new techniques or takes creative risks (but not both), then he is comfortable with uncertainty. All artists who push boundaries are innovative artists. For Presley, either his work focuses on functionality or he pursues creative expression, but these two aspects are mutually exclusive.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Presley applies mathematical principles in his art.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'either functionality or visually stunning (mutually exclusive)' and 'either functionality or creative expression (mutually exclusive)' with 'not creative expression', Presley’s work focuses on functionality. Hence it is not visually stunning. If he were an innovative artist, then (visually stunning or applies math). Given not visually stunning, innovative would imply he applies math. However, we cannot derive that Presley is innovative: the only path given is comfortable with taking risks -> experiment fearlessly -> push boundaries -> innovative, and we are not told he is comfortable with taking risks (only that he takes creative risks and is comfortable with uncertainty). Therefore, whether he applies mathematical principles is undetermined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
