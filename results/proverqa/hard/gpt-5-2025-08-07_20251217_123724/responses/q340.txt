Question ID: 340
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Mccoy has good memory. For any elephant that avoids sunlight and feels hot, it stays cool. If Dimples has good memory, then she does not necessarily have large ears, and if Dimples has large ears, then she does not necessarily have good memory. Mccoy does not need relaxation. Dimples does not stay cool. Either Dimples enjoys cool temperatures or she prefers warm temperatures, but not both. Dimples does not need relaxation. Any elephant that exercises outside or lives in the desert feels hot. Dimples does not live in the desert. Either Ocean enjoys cool temperatures or she prefers warm temperatures, but not both. All elephants who either avoid sunlight or prefer warm temperatures (but not both) seek shade. Dimples has good memory. Dimples exercises outside. All elephants that seek shade have large ears and need relaxation. Any elephant that has good hearing or lives in the savannah has large ears. Ocean does not live in the desert. Mccoy does not stay cool. If Dimples loves refrigerators, then she either avoids sunlight or has sensitive skin (or both).

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "Dimples exercises outside, so she feels hot. Since she does not stay cool, she cannot both avoid sunlight and feel hot; thus she does not avoid sunlight. All elephants that seek shade need relaxation, but Dimples does not need relaxation, so she does not seek shade. From the rule 'if (avoid sunlight XOR prefer warm) then seek shade', not seeking shade implies the XOR is false. With 'not avoid sunlight', this means 'prefer warm' is false. Given the asserted XOR 'enjoys cool temperatures XOR prefers warm temperatures', with 'prefer warm' false, it follows that Dimples enjoys cool temperatures.",
  "answer": "A"

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
