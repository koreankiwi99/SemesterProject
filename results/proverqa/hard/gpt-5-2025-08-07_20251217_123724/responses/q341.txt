Thus, exactly one of (asks questions, explores concepts) holds, so Ahmad is curious. Being curious implies exactly one of (makes discoveries, drives innovation); since Ahmad makes discoveries, he does not drive innovation. Ahmad thinks critically, so he solves problems; solving problems implies he pursues research. Pursuing research implies exactly one of (achieves recognition, drives innovation); since he does not drive innovation, he must achieve recognition.",
  "answer": "A"
