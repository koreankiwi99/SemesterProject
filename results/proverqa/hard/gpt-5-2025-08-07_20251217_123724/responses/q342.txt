{
  "reasoning": "Raphael values critique, and everyone who values critique either embraces debate or is open-minded. He does not embrace debate, so he must be open-minded. If he were open-minded and had unconventional views, he would challenge the status quo, which would imply (given he does not write influential books) that he speaks authoritatively, and with extensive knowledge that would make him gain recognition—contradicting the given that he does not gain recognition. Therefore, he cannot have unconventional views. From the exclusive-or between being a respected authority and having unconventional views, he must be a respected authority. From the exclusive-or between being a respected authority and being a doubted expert, he cannot be a doubted expert.",
