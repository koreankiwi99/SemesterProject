==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Kenna encourages free expression, so by the XOR with following conventional rules, she does not follow conventional rules and thus thinks outside the box. She also values individuality (given she does not appreciate conformity). However, the only statement involving welcoming diverse perspectives is: if Kenna collaborates or welcomes diverse perspectives, then she creates innovative work. This gives a sufficient but not necessary condition for creating innovative work and does not allow inferring whether she welcomes diverse perspectives. Nothing else constrains welcoming diverse perspectives. Therefore, we cannot determine whether she does not welcome diverse perspectives.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
