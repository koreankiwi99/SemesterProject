Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From lives a private life and the XOR with being respected, Jasper is not respected by others. He does not build businesses. If he has financial knowledge then he invests wisely; if he understands economics and reads market trends, he has financial knowledge, but we are not given that he understands economics. The disjunctions (manages assets or has financial knowledge) and (manages assets or invests wisely) do not force invests wisely to be true; it could be satisfied by managing assets. If he does invest wisely (with builds businesses false), then he pursues material wealth and thus is not philanthropic, but there is no rule connecting any of these traits to leaving a lasting impact. No premise mentions or implies “leaves a lasting impact,” and nothing entails its negation. Therefore the truth of the statement cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
