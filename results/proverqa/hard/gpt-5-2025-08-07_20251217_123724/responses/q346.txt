{
  "reasoning": "Everyone either makes plans or sets goals; Araya does not make plans, so she sets goals and is motivated. If motivated, she either pursues hobbies or has a stable job (but not both). She is pursuing hobbies, so she does not have a stable job. Araya follows her intuition and enjoys exploration, so she embraces spontaneity. Given she either values practicality or embraces spontaneity (but not both), embracing spontaneity means she does not value practicality. Since she either values practicality or has a creative passion (but not both), not valuing practicality implies she has a creative passion. If she has a creative passion or a stable job (or both), she leads a balanced life. Therefore, Araya leads a balanced life, making the statement that she does not lead a balanced life false.",
