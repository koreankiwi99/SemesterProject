Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Ayleen works outdoors and the rule that working outdoors implies exactly one of studies horticulture or appreciates landscaping, and given she appreciates landscaping, we infer she does not study horticulture. The only way to derive cares for plants (which would give her expertise in botany) is via the XOR condition: loves gardening or studies horticulture (but not both) -> cares for plants. Since she does not study horticulture, this reduces to needing loves gardening, but we cannot establish that; we only know enjoys nature or loves gardening, which doesn’t confirm loves gardening. Thus we cannot conclude she cares for plants, and therefore cannot conclude she has expertise. Given the exclusive choice that she either has or lacks expertise, but with no determination which, the claim that she does not lack expertise (i.e., she has expertise) is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
