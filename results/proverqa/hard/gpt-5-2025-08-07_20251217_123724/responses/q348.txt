Context:
If Saul finds an inspirational figure, then he will either become a success or pay tribute to that figure, but not both. Saul does not continue to create. Saul practices diligently. If someone gains recognition and develops a unique voice, then they will continue to create. If someone explores their own style, they may not necessarily find an inspirational figure, and vice versa. Saul draws from influences. Saul values feedback. If Saul produces original work, then he will earn critical acclaim. Saul does not earn critical acclaim. If Saul either stays true to himself or values feedback (but not both), then he will remain authentic. If Saul diligently practices and stays true to himself, then he will gain recognition. Saul does not remain authentic. If Saul either draws from influences or pays tribute to a figure, then he produces original work.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From values feedback and not remain authentic, the XOR rule implies Saul also stays true to himself. With diligent practice and staying true, he gains recognition. From not continuing to create and the rule that (recognition AND unique voice) -> continue, we infer he does not develop a unique voice (and thus did not explore his own style). None of these establish whether he finds an inspirational figure. The only rule about becoming a success requires that antecedent (finding an inspirational figure), which is not given or derivable. There is no rule directly linking success to recognition or any other established facts. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Saul becomes a success.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
