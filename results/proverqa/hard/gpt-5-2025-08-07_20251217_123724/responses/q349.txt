Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Emmy is famous, so she is a public figure. Public figure implies ruthless XOR sophisticated; given Emmy is sophisticated, she is not ruthless. Emmy holds a leadership role, so authority XOR compassionate. Emmy does not help others, but \"helps others or volunteers generously\" implies she volunteers generously; thus she is compassionate. Therefore, by XOR, she is not in authority. Emmy is either kind or has authority (but not both); since she does not have authority, she is kind. Now, ruthless XOR kind holds (not ruthless, kind true), so by the rule \"if ruthless or kind (but not both) then complex,\" Emmy is complex. Hence, \"Emmy is not complex\" is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
