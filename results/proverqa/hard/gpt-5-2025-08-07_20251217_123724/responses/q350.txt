Question ID: 350
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Rebekah is either a dedicated researcher or pursues independent projects, but not both. If Rebekah is a well-funded entomologist, then she either has a mentor or makes breakthroughs (but not both). Rebekah specializes in bees. If Rebekah is successful or has experience, then she makes breakthroughs. If Rebekah is curious, then she can solve complex problems and pursue independent projects. Every innovative entomologist either explores remote areas or develops new theories (or both). Rebekah does not explore remote areas. If Rebekah either investigates ecosystems or pursues independent projects (but not both), then she is innovative. Rebekah studies wasps. If Rebekah either makes breakthroughs or publishes papers (but not both), then she advances her field. All entomologists who advance their field are dedicated researchers and inspire others. Rebekah does not publish papers. If Molly either investigates ecosystems or pursues independent projects (but not both), then she is innovative. Rebekah investigates ecosystems. Any entomologist who either collects rare samples or discovers new species can be successful. Rebekah collaborates with colleagues. If Rebekah studies moths, then she either specializes in bees or studies wasps, but not both. Bryce does not develop new theories. If Rebekah either classifies insects or analyzes wing patterns (but not both), then she studies moths. Rebekah does not develop new theories. An entomologist either inspires others or collaborates with colleagues, but not necessarily both. For any entomologist, examining nocturnal behaviors and analyzing camouflage techniques can lead to innovation. If Rebekah either studies butterflies or studies moths (but not both), then she is successful.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rebekah does not study butterflies.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "Rebekah does not explore remote areas and does not develop new theories. Since every innovative entomologist must explore remote areas or develop new theories, Rebekah is not innovative. From (investigates ecosystems XOR pursues independent projects) → innovative and the fact that she investigates ecosystems, it follows she must also pursue independent projects to avoid the XOR being true; hence she pursues independent projects. Given (dedicated researcher XOR pursues independent projects), she is not a dedicated researcher. If she made breakthroughs, then (breakthroughs XOR publishes papers) would imply she advances her field, which implies she is a dedicated researcher—contradicting the above. Therefore, she does not make breakthroughs. Then (successful or experienced) → breakthroughs forces that she is not successful and not experienced. Also, if she studied moths, then (specializes in bees XOR studies wasps) must hold, but she both specializes in bees and studies wasps, so she does not study moths. The rule (studies butterflies XOR studies moths) → successful, together with not studying moths and not being successful, implies she does not study butterflies. Therefore, the statement is true.",
