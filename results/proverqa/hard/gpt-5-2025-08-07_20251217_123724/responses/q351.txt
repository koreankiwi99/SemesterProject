Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Isabela does not overcome obstacles and does pursue her passions, so by the XOR rule she has ambition. With ambition, she must satisfy XOR(sets goals, achieves success); since she achieves success, she does not set goals. Given XOR(sets goals, meets deadlines), this implies she meets deadlines. She does not stay motivated, so by contrapositive of (XOR(meets deadlines, faces challenges) -> stays motivated), we get not XOR, and with meets deadlines true, faces challenges must also be true. From encountering problems, XOR(helps others, supports family) holds. Also, supports family -> XOR(prioritizes well-being, values community), but she has both well-being and values community, so by contrapositive she does not support her family; hence she helps others. Facing challenges and helping others implies she is brave. Since she is either brave or fearful, but not both, she is not fearful.",
