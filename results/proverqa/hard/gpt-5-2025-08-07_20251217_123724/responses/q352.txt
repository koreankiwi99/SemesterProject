Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Boden appreciates silence and, given the XOR rule (appreciates silence or plays an instrument, but not both), he does not play an instrument. He has a creative vision, so he writes lyrics. Boden composes music only if (writes lyrics XOR creates harmonies) holds. We know he writes lyrics, but we do not know whether he creates harmonies. The general rule that every person either conveys emotions through their art or creates harmonies (but not necessarily both) plus the fact that Boden conveys emotions does not exclude that he might also create harmonies. Hence we cannot conclude the XOR holds, so we cannot conclude he composes. The only given sufficient condition for bringing people joy is playing an instrument or composing music; he does not play an instrument and composing is undetermined. Therefore, whether Boden brings people joy is undetermined, making the statement “Boden does not bring people joy” uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
