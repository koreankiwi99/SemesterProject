Question ID: 353
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Cuddlebug either respects nature or harms nature (but not both), then he is responsible. Devin visits beaches or enjoys hiking. If Devin enjoys hiking, then he either grows up outdoors or appreciates biodiversity, but not both. For Devin, he either conserves wildlife or harms nature, but not both. If Cuddlebug grows up outdoors, then he values the ecosystem and promotes sustainability. For anyone, if they love marine life and promote sustainability, then they conserve wildlife. If Devin either protects habitats or preserves water quality (but not both), then he conserves wildlife. Devin does not appreciate biodiversity. If Devin grows up outdoors, then he values the ecosystem and promotes sustainability. Devin does not explore caves. Cuddlebug does not explore caves. Devin loves marine life. Devin collects rocks.

Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Devin is not responsible.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Devin collects rocks and does not explore caves, so by the exclusive-or rule he enjoys hiking. Enjoying hiking implies (exclusively) growing up outdoors or appreciating biodiversity; since he does not appreciate biodiversity, he grows up outdoors. Growing up outdoors gives him promoting sustainability. With loves marine life and promotes sustainability, he conserves wildlife. Thus, by the XOR with harming nature, he does not harm nature. However, there is no rule connecting Devin’s conservation or other traits to being responsible; the only responsibility rule given applies specifically to Cuddlebug. Therefore, we cannot determine Devin’s responsibility status.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
