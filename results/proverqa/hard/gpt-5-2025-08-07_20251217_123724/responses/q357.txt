Question ID: 357
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Addison either publishes research or leads workshops (but not both), then she is influential. If Faye either studied fungi or discovered a new species (but not both), then she is renowned. If Faye is influential, then she collaborates with others and mentors students. If Muffinhead either studied fungi or discovered a new species (but not both), then she is renowned. If a mycologist receives awards, then they are respected. Faye leads workshops. Faye is not respected. Addison leads workshops. All mycologists who collaborate with others develop new techniques and share knowledge. Faye shares knowledge. Every mycologist who contributes to the field is either influential or advances scientific knowledge (or both). If Faye has passion, then she is renowned and makes an impact. Muffinhead is not respected. Faye did not discover a new species. Addison shares knowledge. Faye does not develop new techniques. If Faye either publishes research or leads workshops (but not both), then she is influential. If a mycologist publishes research and is renowned, then they receive awards.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Faye did not study fungi.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Faye leads workshops. If Faye were influential, she would collaborate; for mycologists, collaborating implies developing new techniques, but Faye does not develop new techniques, so Faye is not influential. Given she leads workshops yet is not influential, the XOR rule (publishes research or leads workshops, but not both) must be false; therefore she also publishes research. For mycologists, publishing research and being renowned implies receiving awards, which implies being respected. Since Faye is not respected, she is not renowned. She also did not discover a new species, so the XOR premise (studied fungi or discovered a new species, but not both) reduces to: if she studied fungi, then she is renowned. Because she is not renowned, she did not study fungi. Hence, the statement is true.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
