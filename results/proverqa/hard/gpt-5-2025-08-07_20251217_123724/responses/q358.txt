Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Alfonso pursues continuing education, so by the XOR rule he does not have strong ethics. He has strong morals and is not generous, so he is selfless. Since he does not pursue personal gain, by XOR he is compassionate; then by the compassion XOR he is not empathetic. If he were motivated to help others, he would have either empathy or strong ethics, but he has neither, so he is not motivated. By contrapositive of (dedicated to osteopathy or passionate about healthcare) -> motivated, he is neither dedicated to osteopathy nor passionate about healthcare. He does not gain patients' trust, so by contrapositive he does not improve patient outcomes. None of these premises address whether he has (or lacks) advanced skills, and no rule links “advanced skills” to any given attributes. Therefore, the truth of “Alfonso does not have advanced skills” cannot be determined from the information provided.",
  "answer": "C"
