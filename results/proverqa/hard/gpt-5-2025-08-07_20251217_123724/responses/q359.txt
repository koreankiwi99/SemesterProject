Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Aarav is well-traveled, and since he does not have local knowledge, the XOR rule implies he speaks many languages. He also does not value honesty; by the exclusive-or with understanding cultures, he understands cultures. Thus he speaks many languages and understands cultures, so he can communicate well. Aarav serves nobly, so he is admired. Given he holds high office and must be either respected or admired (but not both), being admired implies he is not respected. The queried statement is: If Aarav is either charismatic or diplomatic (but not both), then he is respected. We have no information that establishes whether he is charismatic or diplomatic. Since the antecedent is undetermined while the consequent (respected) is false, we cannot determine the truth of the conditional overall from the given facts.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
