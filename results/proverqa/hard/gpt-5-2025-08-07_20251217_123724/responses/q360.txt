Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Valeria serves others, and since she either serves others or seeks power (but not both), she does not seek power. From the premises, at least one of {values compassion, craves wealth} is true. If she craves wealth (with not seeking power), then by the XOR rule (seeks power or craves wealth), she is driven by personal gain; otherwise, she might instead act selflessly, but the premises do not link being driven by personal gain or acting selflessly to being selfish or selfless. Separately, Valeria is either selfless or selfish (but not both), yet no rule connects this to any other derived facts. Therefore, we cannot determine whether she is not selfish.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
