Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Esmeralda has a calm demeanor. From this, exactly one of the following holds: she soothes skittish animals or she participates in therapy (but not both). We have no rule that forces therapy. The only other relevant routes point to soothing: (1) gentle nature implies either builds trust or soothes (not exclusive, so it does not force soothing), and (2) soothing would also follow from even temper or calm under pressure, which are not given. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the disjunction selects soothing or therapy. Hence, whether Esmeralda participates in therapy is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
