Question ID: 362
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Dr. Gabrielle does not make groundbreaking discoveries. Gabrielle coordinates fieldwork. Gabrielle dedicates herself to research. If Dr. Gabrielle is a renowned biologist, then she either makes groundbreaking discoveries or protects marine life. If Dr. Gabrielle publishes research or attends conferences, then she becomes an expert in her field. Gabrielle does not establish protected areas. Every biologist who studies animal behavior either analyzes data or publishes research (or both). If Dr. Gabrielle leads projects, then she collaborates with her peers and mentors students. If Dr. Gabrielle either leads projects or coordinates fieldwork, then she is highly motivated. Dr. Gabrielle does not analyze data. Gabrielle does not become an expert in her field. If Dr. Gabrielle dedicates herself to research, then she gains recognition and collaborates with her peers. Every biologist who protects marine life either studies animal behavior or establishes protected areas (or both). Dr. Gabrielle is not highly motivated.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Gabrielle does not contribute to conservation.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "We know Gabrielle does not establish protected areas. From (PR or AC) -> Expert and the fact she is not an expert, we infer she neither publishes research nor attends conferences. The rules connecting conservation acts say: if a biologist protects marine life, then they study animal behavior or establish protected areas. However, it is never stated that Gabrielle is a biologist, and the only rule that could force protecting marine life requires her to be a renowned biologist, which is not given. Thus, whether she protects marine life (a conservation activity) is undetermined. Given we only know she does not establish protected areas and have no determination about protecting marine life, we cannot conclude that she does not contribute to conservation. Therefore, the statement is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
