Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Lenora chooses natural remedies, and for her it’s either natural remedies or avoids additives (but not both), so she does not avoid additives. She buys organic; since buys organic XOR avoids additives implies shops healthy, she shops healthy, which implies she reads nutrition labels. Reading labels implies she eats balanced meals. She does not get enough sleep. Since (eats balanced meals XOR gets enough sleep) holds, she takes regular exercise. From (takes regular exercise XOR chronic pain), taking regular exercise means she does not have chronic pain. From (chronic pain XOR pain-free), not having chronic pain implies she is pain-free.",
  "answer": "A"
