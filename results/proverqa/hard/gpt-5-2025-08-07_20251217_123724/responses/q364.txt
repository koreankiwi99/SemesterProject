==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Valeria prioritizes others or puts others first' and 'Valeria does not prioritize others', we infer Valeria puts others first. Then, by 'Anyone who helps those in need or puts others first can act selflessly', Valeria can act selflessly, but this does not guarantee she actually acts selflessly. To be remembered as a hero, we need 'Valeria cares for others and acts selflessly'. We cannot establish 'acts selflessly' (only 'can act selflessly'), nor can we establish 'cares for others' because we cannot confirm she works under pressure or handles emergencies (she does not make quick decisions, and 'everyone manages resources or handles emergencies' leaves it undecided). There is also no rule that directly yields 'not a hero'. Therefore, whether she will be remembered as a hero is undetermined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
