Question ID: 366
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Keanu has sharp hooves. All active deer have strong senses and good vision. All deer with powerful muscles and a lightweight build can run quickly. Keanu is calm. Florence is active. If a deer has keen senses, it may not necessarily run quickly, and vice versa. A deer either has a gentle nature or explores the wild, but not both is not necessarily true. All deer that live in the forest have keen senses. Keanu is not playful. Any deer that is surefooted or can leap far can explore the wild. Zayd has sharp hooves. Any deer that has sharp hooves and agile legs can run quickly. If Keanu has large ears or good vision, then he can live in the forest. Keanu has strong senses. Zayd is not playful. Keanu is active. If Keanu is calm, then he is either playful or has a gentle nature, but not both. Zayd has strong senses. If Keanu is fleet, then he is either capable of leaping far or is powerful, but not both. If Keanu has large antlers, then he is either capable of leaping far or has agile legs, but not both.

Question:

  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Keanu is active, so he has good vision; with good vision he can live in the forest, and living in the forest gives him keen senses. He is calm and not playful; by the given exclusive-or rule this means he has a gentle nature. The only rule about large antlers says: if Keanu has large antlers, then he either can leap far or has agile legs (but not both). Neither branch causes any contradiction: leaping far would allow exploring the wild, but there is no valid exclusivity between gentle nature and exploring the wild (explicitly stated as not necessarily true). Agile legs together with sharp hooves would allow running quickly, which is also not contradicted by any rule. There is no rule that implies he has large antlers, nor any rule that forbids it. Therefore, whether Keanu lacks large antlers cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
