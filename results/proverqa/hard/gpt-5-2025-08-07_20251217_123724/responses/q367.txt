Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'If Fallon examines antiquities, then (analyzes data XOR draws accurate conclusions)', together with 'Fallon does not analyze data' and 'Fallon does not draw accurate conclusions', the XOR consequent would be false if she examined antiquities; thus she does not examine antiquities. Given 'Fallon examines antiquities or interprets her finds correctly', she must interpret her finds correctly. From the XOR 'Fallon either explores historical sites or interprets her finds correctly (but not both)', she therefore does not explore historical sites. Using 'Fallon either explores historical sites or uncovers ancient artifacts', with 'not explores', we conclude she uncovers ancient artifacts. Fallon becomes an expert only if she both uncovers ancient artifacts and studies their significance. We have no information that she studies their significance, nor that she does not. Hence we cannot determine whether she became an expert, so the statement 'Fallon did not become an expert' is not established.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
