Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Yareli is empathetic, and empathy implies exactly one of respectful-of-boundaries or listens-actively. Since she is respectful of boundaries, she does not listen actively. She does not build strong relationships; by contrapositive of (listens actively or cares for others) -> builds strong relationships, she neither listens actively nor cares for others. Given (cares for others or puts patients first), she must put patients first. Putting patients first implies being a dedicated doctor, which in turn implies gaining international recognition. Therefore, it is false that she does not gain international recognition.",
  "answer": "B"
}
