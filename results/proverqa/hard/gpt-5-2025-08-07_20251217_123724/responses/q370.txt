  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Anthony does not meet deadlines' and 'Anthony meets deadlines or faces challenges', Anthony faces challenges. With 'If Anthony faces challenges, then he is either resilient or self-motivated (but not both)' and 'Anthony does not adapt quickly' plus 'Anthony is either resilient or adapts quickly (but not both)', we get resilient true and self-motivated false. From 'If Anthony has no formal education, then he is self-motivated', not self-motivated implies he does not have no formal education (i.e., he has formal education). Regarding the target claim, we have an exclusive-or: either Anthony is knowledgeable about ancient cultures (KAC) or uninformed about ancient cultures (UAC), but not both. We also have 'KAC or ignorant of history (IH)'. If UAC is true, then KAC is false, so IH must be true; IH implies lacks interest in the past or no formal education; since he does not have no formal education, this yields lacks interest in the past—consistent with all facts. If KAC is true, then UAC is false—also consistent. Thus both possibilities are consistent with the premises, so we cannot determine that Anthony is not uninformed about ancient cultures.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
