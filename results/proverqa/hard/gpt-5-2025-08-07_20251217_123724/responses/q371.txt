Question ID: 371
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Tate does not observe animal behavior. For any person, they either study biodiversity or understand pollinators, but it's possible they do both. If Tate is outdoorsy, then he either values conservation or the ecosystem, but not both. Cora either appreciates ragwort or disapproves of it, but not both. If Tate explores the outdoors, then he understands pollinators and loves wildflowers. Mallory protects wildlife. For Tate, he either studies biodiversity or observes animal behavior, but it's possible he does both. Tate protects wildlife. If someone protects wildlife, then they respect nature. Tate either appreciates ragwort or disapproves of it, but not both. Everyone who respects nature either understands the importance of pollinators or values the ecosystem (or both). If Tate values the ecosystem, then he will appreciate ragwort.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Tate disapproves of ragwort.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Tate does not observe animal behavior, and for Tate it’s (studies biodiversity or observes animal behavior), so he studies biodiversity. Tate protects wildlife, hence he respects nature. Everyone who respects nature either understands pollinators or values the ecosystem (or both). If he values the ecosystem, then he appreciates ragwort, which would make disapproval false. But it’s also possible he only understands pollinators and does not value the ecosystem; in that case, the exclusive choice between appreciating or disapproving remains undetermined by the premises. Since we cannot deduce whether he values the ecosystem, we cannot fix whether he appreciates or disapproves. Therefore, whether he disapproves is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
