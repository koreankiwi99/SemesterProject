Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Chanel is well-respected, so she has authority. With authority, she must be either humorous or empathetic, but not both; however, both are stated, creating a conflict that does not inform credibility. From not using complex vocabulary and not appearing intellectual, Chanel cannot be speaking jargon; by the XOR (jargon or expert knowledge), she must have expert knowledge. With a large following and the XOR (charismatic or expert knowledge), she is not charismatic. None of the given rules relate Chanel’s properties to credibility, and there is no direct statement about Chanel being credible or not. Therefore, whether Chanel is not credible cannot be determined from the information provided.",
  "answer": "C"
