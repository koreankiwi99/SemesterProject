==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Zain has a multicultural family, so he can speak multiple languages. Speaking multiple languages implies (biculturally aware XOR appreciates diverse customs); since he does not appreciate diverse customs, he is biculturally aware. Respecting culture implies he values local traditions; with (values local traditions XOR embraces global citizenship), he does not embrace global citizenship. From (fosters cultural understanding XOR embraces global citizenship), he must foster cultural understanding. Being biculturally aware implies (facilitate international dialogue XOR foster cultural understanding); since he fosters cultural understanding, he does not facilitate international dialogue. Therefore, the statement is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Ground Truth: B
