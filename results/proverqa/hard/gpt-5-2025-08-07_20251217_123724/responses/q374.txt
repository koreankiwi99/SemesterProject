Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Hope appreciates nature, so she values balance and engages in yoga. Hope does not live intentionally and does not write poetry. From (mindfulness XOR write poetry) -> lives intentionally and not live intentionally with not write poetry, we get not mindfulness. Given (mindfulness or meditates daily), she must meditate daily. Everyone who meditates daily is either calm or finds inner peace (or both). If she is calm, then she takes good photos; if not calm, we have no rule implying she takes good photos. Since we cannot determine whether she is calm, we cannot determine whether she takes good photos. Therefore, the statement that she does not take good photos is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
