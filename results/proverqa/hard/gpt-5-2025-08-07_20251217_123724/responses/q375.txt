==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From living in a metropolis and the XOR rule, Norah loves a serene atmosphere and thus does not enjoy nightlife. Given she is introspective (from the XOR with enjoys socializing), and the premise 'enjoys socializing or likes crowds,' she must like crowds. The XOR condition on (likes crowds, enjoys nightlife) makes her prefer an urban lifestyle, which implies she enjoys city life. We also know: Norah either appreciates nature or values knowledge (or both). However, nothing in the premises determines whether she values knowledge specifically; she could satisfy the disjunction by appreciating nature alone or by valuing knowledge (or both). Therefore, the claim that Norah does not value knowledge cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
