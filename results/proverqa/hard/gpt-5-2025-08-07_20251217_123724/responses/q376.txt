Question ID: 376
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Lucille does not have high endurance. Lucille has fast feet. If someone has strategic skills, then they are not necessarily a formidable fighter, and vice versa. Lucille does not have strategic skills. Lucille either trains rigorously or is motivated, but not both. If Lucille has quick reflexes, then she is aggressive. If Lucille either trains rigorously or delivers powerful blows (but not both), then she has high endurance. If Lucille is a professional boxer, then she either builds a strong physique or trains rigorously, but not both. If Lucille either has fast feet or quick reflexes, then she delivers powerful blows. Lucille is motivated.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lucille is not defensive.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Lucille is motivated and must be either trained rigorously or motivated, but not both, so she is not training rigorously. She has fast feet, which implies she delivers powerful blows. Since (trains rigorously XOR delivers powerful blows) implies high endurance, she would have high endurance—contradicting the given statement that she does not have high endurance. Regardless, no rule connects any given traits to being defensive. Therefore, whether Lucille is (not) defensive cannot be determined from the premises.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
