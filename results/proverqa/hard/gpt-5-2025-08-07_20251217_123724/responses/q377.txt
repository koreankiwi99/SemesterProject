Question ID: 377
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Tate utilizes a plant. Tate protects species or exploits resources. If Tate utilizes a plant, then he either reduces waste or exploits resources, but not both. If someone either consumes excessively or wastes resources (but not both), then they overuse resources. Tate lives extravagantly. Tate reduces waste. Anyone who overuses resources and ignores warnings can disrupt the ecosystem. If Walter pursues research, then he either disrupts the ecosystem or conserves the environment, but not both. Tate ignores warnings. Tate pursues research. If Tate pursues research, then he either disrupts the ecosystem or conserves the environment, but not both. If Tate seeks knowledge, then he either finds innovative solutions or respects nature (or both). If someone lives extravagantly, then they will overuse resources.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Tate either respects nature or harms nature, but not both.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From utilizing a plant and the exclusive-or rule, Tate reduces waste and thus does not exploit resources. Given 'protects species or exploits resources' and not exploiting, he protects species. Living extravagantly implies he overuses resources; with ignoring warnings, he can disrupt the ecosystem, but 'can' does not guarantee he does. Separately, because he pursues research, he either disrupts the ecosystem or conserves the environment (but not both). However, there is no rule linking 'disrupts the ecosystem' to 'harms nature' nor linking 'conserves the environment' or any other given fact to 'respects nature'. Also, we have no rule that he seeks knowledge (the only place 'respects nature' appears). Therefore, we cannot conclude that he respects nature, harms nature, or that exactly one of these holds. The statement remains unprovable.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
