Question ID: 378
Difficulty: hard

Context:
For all scientists, if a scientist is renowned, then they either make breakthrough discoveries or receive accolades (or both). If Dr. Clark conducts innovative research, then he will either advance the field or improve existing processes, but not both. If Dr. Clark pursues a PhD, then he either dedicates his career to research or works in industry, but not both. Dr. Clark pursues a PhD. If Dr. Kylan conducts innovative research, then he will either advance the field or improve existing processes, but not both. Dr. Clark leads research teams. Dr. Clark conducts innovative research. Dr. Kylan publishes papers. Dr. Clark either conducts experiments or teaches at a university. Dr. Clark does not drive progress. If Dr. Clark either develops new techniques or makes breakthrough discoveries (but not both), then he will advance his field. All scientists either study phenomena or develop new techniques. Dr. Clark either teaches at a university or works in industry, but not both. If Dr. Clark publishes papers and influences others, then he is renowned. Dr. Harrison pursues a PhD. Dr. Kylan does not create new materials. Dr. Clark does not create new materials. If a scientist develops new techniques, then they will drive progress in their field. Every scientist who dedicates their career to research either improves existing processes or creates new materials. Clark influences others. If Dr. Clark either leads research teams or teaches at a university (but not both), then he collaborates with his peers. Dr. Clark publishes papers. Clark does not collaborate with his peers. Any scientist who studies complex phenomena or tests new hypotheses can advance their field. Dr. Clark dedicates his career to research if he is passionate about science.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Clark does not receive accolades.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Clark leads research teams and does not collaborate. Since (lead XOR teach) -> collaborate, and he leads, teach must also be true to keep the XOR false; thus he teaches and does not work in industry. From PhD and (dedicate XOR industry), he dedicates his career to research. Dedication implies (improve OR create); with not create, he improves. With innovative research implying (advance XOR improve) and improve true, he does not advance. From (develop -> drive) and not drive, he does not develop. Then (develop XOR breakthrough) -> advance plus not advance and not develop implies not breakthrough. Clark publishes and influences, so he is renowned; renowned implies (breakthrough OR accolades). With not breakthrough, he must receive accolades. Hence, 'Dr. Clark does not receive accolades' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
