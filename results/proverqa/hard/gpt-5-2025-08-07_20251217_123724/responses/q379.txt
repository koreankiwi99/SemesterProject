Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Kiaan does not explain complex concepts, and since he either makes learning fun or explains complex concepts, he must make learning fun. Making learning fun implies he inspires others, which implies exactly one of: he makes groundbreaking discoveries (G) or leaves a lasting legacy (L). He pursues lifelong education and, given it is exclusive with publishing research, he does not publish (P = false). From 'if (P xor H) then highly respected' and 'not highly respected', (P xor H) must be false; with P false, H must also be false. If G were true, then he would be renowned, which would force (N xor H) true; with no noble award (N = false), this would force H true, contradicting H false. Thus G is false, so L is true. Therefore, 'Kiaan does not leave a lasting legacy' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
