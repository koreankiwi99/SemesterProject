==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Given: Layne snores loudly. The rule (snores loudly XOR sleep apnea) -> breathing issues combined with 'Layne does not have breathing issues' forces sleep apnea to be true (to make the XOR false). From sleep apnea -> sleeps heavily, and (sleeps heavily ∧ snores loudly) -> disturbs others -> strong presence ∧ unique routine, which contradicts 'Layne does not have a strong presence', showing the premises are inconsistent. Regardless, there is no rule linking Layne to being well known; the only well-known rule is specific to Hayes. Thus, 'Layne is well known' is neither entailed nor refuted by the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
