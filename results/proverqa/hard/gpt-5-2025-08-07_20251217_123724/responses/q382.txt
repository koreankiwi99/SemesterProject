Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Gustavo either struggles financially or achieves success, but not both; given he struggles financially, he does not achieve success. If he remained humble, he would connect with his audience, which would imply he achieves success—contradicting the prior fact—so he is not humble and thus must be charismatic. However, none of the premises mention or relate to Gustavo having (or lacking) exceptional talent, and no given rule links charisma or any other stated property to exceptional talent. Therefore, whether he lacks exceptional talent cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
