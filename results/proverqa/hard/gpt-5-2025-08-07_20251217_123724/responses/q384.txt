==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Eliana is passionate, so she organizes the community and mobilizes volunteers. She works on large scale projects and lacks strategic vision, so by the exclusive-or rule she implements new technologies. From organizing and implementing, she can reduce waste, but this does not assert that she actually reduces waste. She does not conserve resources, and the disjunction 'appreciates beauty or loves nature' does not establish that she loves nature. Even if she did love nature (which would imply caring for the environment), there is no rule linking any of Eliana’s confirmed traits to 'supports conservation efforts.' The only statement about supporting conservation efforts concerns Jesse. Therefore, whether Eliana supports conservation efforts cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
