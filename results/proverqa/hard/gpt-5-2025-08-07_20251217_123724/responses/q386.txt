==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Sweetsie loves her colony and has a strong stinger, so by the rule \"All bees that love their colony and have a strong stinger will protect their hive,\" Sweetsie protects her hive. Any bee that protects its hive will sting when threatened; hence Sweetsie stings when threatened. There is no rule making Sweetsie a bee that never stings (the \"never stings\" condition is stated only for Anderson). Since \"stings when threatened\" and \"never stings\" cannot both be true, exactly one holds, making the exclusive-or statement true.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Ground Truth: C
