==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Devin loves water, so he enjoys boating. From boating and not working on a cruise, he must become a fisherman. With a passion for the ocean, the exclusive choice is marine biologist or fisherman; since he is a fisherman, he is not a marine biologist. Devin enjoys surfing and has a beach house, so (by the exclusive rule) he does not live in a coastal town. Given he either lives in a coastal town or grew up by the sea, he must have grown up by the sea. Growing up by the sea forces an exclusive choice between marine biologist and coastal steward; since he is not a marine biologist, he becomes a coastal steward. Therefore, the statement that Devin does not become a coastal steward is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
