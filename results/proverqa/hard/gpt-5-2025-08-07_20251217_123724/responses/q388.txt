==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Aarav values inclusion and embraces change, so he accepts diversity. Accepting diversity implies he is open-minded, and being open-minded implies he is culturally aware (and respects traditions). However, we only know that Aarav has intuition or is an effective diplomat; we cannot conclude he is an effective diplomat. There is no information about Aarav being multilingual. Thus, the statement 'Aarav is multilingual, or he is both culturally aware and an effective diplomat' cannot be determined as true or false from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
