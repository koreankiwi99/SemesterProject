Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From works-for-non-profit and not-supporting-local-initiatives, Jemma provides shelter. Given provides shelter and not-empowering-families, she must build homes. Building homes implies exactly one of creates-communities or inspires-others. If creates-communities were false, then (designs-neighborhoods XOR creates-communities) would make her foster connection, which (with not-lead-by-example) would force drives-social-change. With not-advocate-for-rights, that would satisfy the XOR condition, implying she makes a difference, contradicting the given that she does not. Hence creates-communities is true, and therefore inspires-others is false.",
  "answer": "B"

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
