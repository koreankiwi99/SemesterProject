Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Thiago does not analyze statistical data, and since he either conducts in-depth research or analyzes data (but not both), he conducts in-depth research. Given the exclusive-or between telling human stories and conducting in-depth research, he does not tell human stories. Since he either tells human stories or is a photojournalist, he must be a photojournalist. As a photojournalist, he either exposes social injustice or captures real-life stories, but not both; we cannot determine which. From Thiago not seeking the truth and the rule that investigative reporters or those who investigate crimes seek the truth, he is neither an investigative reporter nor someone who investigates crimes. From the rule that documenting humanitarian issues and capturing real-life stories implies raising global awareness, and given he does not raise global awareness, we infer that not both documenting humanitarian issues and capturing real-life stories hold. However, since we cannot determine whether he captures real-life stories, we cannot conclude whether he documents humanitarian issues. Therefore, the claim that he does not document humanitarian issues is uncertain.",
