Question ID: 391
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If a fish blends with its environment, then it avoids predators. Tiger does not protect his family. Everything guards his territory or becomes a leader. Tiger explores the reef. Captain does not protect his family. Everything has sharp teeth. Tiger does not hunt alone. Frank guards his territory. Tiger does not avoid predators. Every fish that feels secure either has good reflexes or swims confidently (or both). If Tiger lives in a coral reef, then he either blends with his environment or has camouflage scales (or both). If Tiger explores the reef, then he is either a confident swimmer or hunts alone, but not both. If Frank has sharp teeth and is fearless, then he will protect his family. If Tiger swims quickly, then he darts between rocks and has a unique appearance. If Captain explores the reef, then he is either a confident swimmer or hunts alone, but not both. If Tiger has sharp teeth and is fearless, then he will protect his family. Tiger either has a unique appearance or blends with his environment, but not both. Tiger has sharp teeth. Tiger does not have a strong will. Captain does not avoid predators. Captain does not have a strong will. If Frank earns respect, then he has a unique appearance and a strong will. Captain explores the reef. If Tiger earns respect, then he has a unique appearance and a strong will.

Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "From 'If Tiger earns respect, then he has a unique appearance and a strong will' and 'Tiger does not have a strong will', by contraposition Tiger does not earn respect. Also, 'If a fish blends then it avoids predators' and 'Tiger does not avoid predators' imply Tiger does not blend; with the exclusive-or 'unique appearance or blends', Tiger has a unique appearance (irrelevant to the main claim). The target statement becomes: If Tiger defends his home (guards his territory), then he becomes a leader (since earning respect is false). The only relevant rule is 'Everyone guards his territory or becomes a leader', which does not imply that a guarding individual is a leader; Tiger could guard without being a leader. We cannot determine the truth of the conditional from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C
