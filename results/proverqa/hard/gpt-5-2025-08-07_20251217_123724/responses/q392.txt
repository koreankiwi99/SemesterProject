==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From lives near water and not documenting habitats, Anastasia studies wildlife. Studying wildlife implies she educates others or advocates conservation; but from pursuing scientific research with supports local communities (exclusive or), advocates conservation is false, so she educates others is true. We also have a separate disjunctive fact: she either educates others or protects the environment (or both). Since educates others is already true, this does not force protects the environment. No given rule connects any facts to appreciates nature. Therefore, we cannot determine whether she protects the environment or appreciates nature; the target disjunction remains undetermined.",
  "answer": "C"
}
