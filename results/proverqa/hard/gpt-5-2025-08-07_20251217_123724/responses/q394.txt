Question ID: 394
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If a drag queen becomes a star, then they earn fans. Sweetness has stage presence. For all drag queens, if a drag queen is talented, then they have a charismatic stage presence or are inspiring to the audience (or both). Sweetness does not gain recognition. If Sweetness expresses himself freely and loves the spotlight, then he becomes a star. Sweetness does not earn fans. Every drag queen who performs drag either has a charismatic stage presence or has artistic flair (or both). Sweetness does not interact with the audience. If Sweetness crafts his own style, then he designs his own costumes. Every drag queen either interacts with the audience or performs with confidence, but not both is not explicitly stated. If Sweetness either chooses his own wigs or styles his own hair (but not both), then he creates his own persona. Every drag queen who performs with confidence either creates their own persona or designs their own costumes (or both). If a drag queen has artistic vision, then they take risks on stage and love the spotlight. Sweetness is not inspiring to the audience. Sweetness does not experiment with makeup. If Sweetness either creates his own persona or experiments with makeup (but not both), then he is able to express himself freely. A drag queen either has a charismatic stage presence or designs their own costumes, but not necessarily both. If Sweetness either loves the spotlight or has stage presence (but not both), then he gains recognition.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Sweetness (a drag queen) has stage presence and does not gain recognition. From the rule \"if loves the spotlight or has stage presence (but not both), then gains recognition,\" and since he has stage presence yet does not gain recognition, he must also love the spotlight (so the XOR antecedent is false). He does not interact with the audience; by the rule that every drag queen either interacts or performs with confidence, he performs with confidence. Performing with confidence implies he either creates his own persona or designs his own costumes. If he created his own persona (and he does not experiment with makeup), then by the XOR rule he would be able to express himself freely; combined with loving the spotlight, he would become a star and thus earn fans—contradicting \"does not earn fans.\" Therefore he does not create his own persona and so must design his own costumes. To assess talent: the only link given is \"if talented, then (charismatic stage presence or inspiring).\" We know he is not inspiring, but nothing allows us to infer whether he does or does not have charismatic stage presence (having stage presence and/or designing costumes doesn’t settle it), and the converse (charismatic -> talented) is not given. Thus we cannot determine whether he is talented.",
