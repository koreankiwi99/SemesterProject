Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Snookums thrives in groups, so she is social. Given she is social and does not have a lone habitat, the XOR rule implies she lives with others. Cats that live with others either share their affection or form strong ties; since Snookums does not form strong ties, she shares her affection (not necessarily with multiple others). She dominates a harem and is stated to form strong alliances; by the XOR rule for harem dominance, she therefore does not have multiple partners. The only path to 'diverse relationships' is via being polyandrous (polyandrous implies multiple partners or diverse relationships). We cannot establish that Snookums is polyandrous, because the needed antecedent (sharing affection with multiple others) is not given. Thus we cannot determine whether she has diverse relationships. Therefore, the statement that she does not have diverse relationships is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
