Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kartier is selfless.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Kartier takes calculated risks and does not exhibit resilience. Since XOR(takes risks, faces challenges) -> resilience, with risks true and resilience false, faces challenges must be true. By XOR(faces challenges, positive impact), positive impact is false. If appreciated then positive impact, so appreciated is false. Given (gains recognition or appreciated), gains recognition must be true (not needed further). Kartier does not do volunteer work; with XOR(donates, volunteers), she donates. Donating implies XOR(generous, selfish). If generous, then she can make a difference, and with putting others first she would be appreciated—contradicting not appreciated. Therefore, generous is false and selfish is true. With XOR(selfless, selfish), selfless is false. Hence, the statement 'Kartier is selfless' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
