Options:

  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Savannah does not spot opportunities and (analyzes trends -> spot opportunities), we get she does not analyze trends. Given (builds client relationships or analyzes trends) and not analyze trends, she builds client relationships. With (conveys insights xor builds client relationships), she does not convey insights. She explains data, and (explains data xor conveys insights) -> can communicate complex ideas, so she can communicate complex ideas. With (understands the market xor can communicate complex ideas), she does not understand the market. Since (leading economist -> understands the market), not understanding the market implies she is not a leading economist. There is no rule implying (or denying) that non–leading economists make accurate predictions for Savannah, so whether she makes accurate predictions cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
