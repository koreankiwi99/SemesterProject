==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Isabella tells the truth, so she is found not guilty. From that, exactly one of the following is true: she is protected from reputational damage or she is financially compensated. No given rule determines which of the two occurs: we are not told she takes a stand (which would imply protection), and the consequences of filing a lawsuit or taking legal action (clearing her name, restoring honor, regaining trust) do not decide compensation. Therefore, whether she is financially compensated cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
