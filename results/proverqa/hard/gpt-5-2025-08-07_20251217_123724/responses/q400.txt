{
  "reasoning": "Zelda roams freely, so she does not live in stables. If (lives in stables xor forms a herd) then she thrives in company; since she does not thrive in company, she cannot form a herd. From 'either social animal or solitary creature (but not both)' and 'does not have companions' plus the universal disjunctions, Zelda is solitary and thus not social. If (forms a herd xor forms a strong bond) then social; with not herd and not social, she does not form a strong bond. From (gentle xor aggressive) -> forms a strong bond and not forms a strong bond, the antecedent must be false: not (gentle xor aggressive). Given Zelda has an aggressive nature, this implies she also has a gentle nature. Therefore, 'Zelda does not have a gentle nature' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
