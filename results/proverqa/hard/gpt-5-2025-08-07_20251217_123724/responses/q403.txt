Question ID: 403
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Every vulture either consumes remains or eats carrion (or both). If Peyton thrives alone, then she has a strong stomach and is adaptable. All vultures that track carrion have a keen sense of smell. If Peyton flies high, then she either dives steeply or soars effortlessly, but not both. Jonathan either soars effortlessly or tracks carrion, but not both at the same time. Franco dives steeply. Peyton either hunts preys or eats carrion. Peyton either soars effortlessly or tracks carrion, but not both at the same time. Peyton flies high. If Jonathan flies high, then she either dives steeply or soars effortlessly, but not both. All vultures that eat carrion have strong stomachs. Every vulture either scans the open plains or consumes remains, but not necessarily both. Peyton scans the open plains. Peyton dives steeply. Jonathan scans the open plains. If Franco has either a strong stomach or a keen sense of smell (but not both), then she is an effective scavenger. Every vulture either rides the wind or soars effortlessly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Peyton is an effective scavenger.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Peyton flies high and the XOR rule, and given Peyton dives steeply, Peyton does not soar effortlessly. By the XOR between soars effortlessly and tracks carrion, Peyton tracks carrion, which implies she has a keen sense of smell. However, there is no rule that makes Peyton an effective scavenger from having a keen sense (or from any other of her traits). The only rule about being an effective scavenger applies specifically to Franco. We also cannot prove Peyton eats carrion (the disjunctions allow alternatives), so we cannot derive further properties that would imply effectiveness. Neither the statement nor its negation is derivable; therefore it is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
