  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Julian is either curious or avoids risks, but not both' and 'Julian does not avoid risks', Julian is curious. Curiosity implies he values knowledge and respects history. Given 'Julian does not make new breakthroughs' and 'If Julian pursues discovery or reads widely, then he will make new breakthroughs' with 'Julian does not read widely', we infer Julian does not pursue discovery. Since he values knowledge and does not pursue discovery, the XOR condition ('values knowledge or pursues discovery, but not both') is satisfied, so he is a passionate researcher. That implies he finds the resources he needs and overcomes challenges. With 'If someone keeps things tidy and finds the resources they need, then they can achieve success' and 'Julian does not achieve success', we conclude he does not keep things tidy. However, there is no stated link between being organized/disorganized and keeping things tidy. The only direct statement about organization is 'Julian is either organized or disorganized, but not both', which does not specify which holds. Therefore, whether Julian is disorganized cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"

Result:

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
