{
  "reasoning": "River gets distracted and does not find new interests, so he must have a vivid imagination. He does not plan ahead and must act spontaneously. Being reflective implies he is either a critical thinker or spontaneous (but not both); since he is spontaneous, he is not a critical thinker. Given he either speaks fluently or thinks critically (but not both), he speaks fluently. If someone writes well and speaks fluently, they express themselves effectively; but River cannot express himself effectively, so he does not write well. Since he is creative and must either write well or excel in art (but not both), he excels in art. With a vivid imagination, he excels in either art or music (but not both); since he excels in art, he does not excel in music. Therefore, the statement is false.",
  "answer": "B"
