Question ID: 406
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Alana explores new places. Anyone who is spontaneous and trusts their intuition can learn to embrace uncertainty. If Alana explores new places, then she will take calculated risks. Alana makes her own decisions. Anyone who values independence and embraces uncertainty is free-spirited. If Alana has a creative nature, then she is either guided by reason or trusts her intuition (but not both). Alana is not guided by reason. Alana has a creative nature. Alana appreciates simple things. If someone makes their own decisions and takes calculated risks, then they value independence. If someone has an open mind and tolerates ambiguity, then they can embrace uncertainty. Alana is spontaneous. For all humans, if someone is free-spirited, then they either love adventure or pursue creative passions (or both). Alana either pursues creative passions or appreciates simple things, but these two traits do not necessarily overlap in her life.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Alana explores new places, so she takes calculated risks. Combined with making her own decisions, she values independence. From her creative nature and not being guided by reason, she trusts her intuition. Being spontaneous and trusting her intuition means she can learn to embrace uncertainty, but this does not establish that she actually embraces uncertainty. Without embracing uncertainty, we cannot conclude she is free-spirited. Moreover, even if she were free-spirited, that would only imply she either loves adventure or pursues creative passions, and we have no information ruling out the latter. Therefore, we cannot determine that Alana loves adventure.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: A
