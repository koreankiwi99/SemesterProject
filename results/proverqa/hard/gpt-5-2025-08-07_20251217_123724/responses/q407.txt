Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Zane is not comfortable on stage and performs publicly, so by the rule (perform -> stage fright or comfortable) he must have stage fright. With stage fright and the XOR (stage fright or entertaining), he is not entertaining. Given he is charismatic and (funny XOR entertaining), he must be funny. Being funny implies exactly one of: gain popularity or build a loyal following. If he is talented, then he gains popularity, which would exclude building a loyal following. But we cannot deduce that he is talented from the given disjunction (works hard or talented). Thus, both scenarios (gain popularity or build a loyal following) are possible. Therefore, whether he does not build a loyal following is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
