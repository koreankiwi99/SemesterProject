Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From not achieving timeless fame and not creating an original work, and given (original work XOR lasting legacy) implies timeless fame, Ellie does not leave a lasting legacy. With not mentoring and (mentoring XOR inspiring) implying lasting legacy, she does not inspire future generations. Since (culturally influential and pursues excellence) implies inspiring, she is not culturally influential. From (masters foreign language or recognition) implies culturally influential, she neither masters a foreign language nor achieves recognition; thus, given (critical acclaim or recognition), she earns critical acclaim. None of the premises link these facts to being a world-class opera singer. Therefore, the statement about being a world-class opera singer cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}
