Question ID: 410
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Elianna either specializes in microbiology or is environmentally conscious, but not necessarily both. If Rosalie conducts lab research, then she has a PhD and collaborates with peers. Elianna either cares about nature or is environmentally conscious. If Elianna investigates microorganisms or analyzes plant samples, then she can examine fungal behavior. If Elianna has a PhD, then she either publishes academic papers or develops new treatments, but not both. If Elianna researches plant diseases, then she either examines fungal behavior or studies water molds (but not both). Elianna does not publish academic papers. If Elianna studies water molds, then she specializes in microbiology. If Elianna investigates downy mildew or examines crop pathogens, then she studies water molds. If Rosalie has a PhD, then she either publishes academic papers or develops new treatments, but not both. If Elianna conducts lab research, then she has a PhD and collaborates with peers. Elianna conducts lab research. Elianna either develops new treatments or examines fungal behavior, but not both. Elianna is either environmentally conscious or innovative (or both). Elianna researches plant diseases.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Elianna is innovative.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Elianna conducts lab research, so she has a PhD. With a PhD and not publishing, she must develop new treatments. By the XOR rule with developing vs examining fungal behavior, she does not examine fungal behavior. Since she researches plant diseases and must either examine fungal behavior or study water molds (but not both), she studies water molds, which implies she specializes in microbiology. None of this determines whether she is environmentally conscious. The statement 'environmentally conscious or innovative (or both)' only guarantees at least one is true; without evidence that she is not environmentally conscious, we cannot conclude she is innovative. Therefore, whether she is innovative is not determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
