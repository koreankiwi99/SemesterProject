Difficulty: hard

Context:
All enthusiastic beginners need training and seek guidance. If Zora values precision and pays attention to details, then she will create masterpieces. If Serenity needs training and is inept with tools, then she will avoid projects. Everyone who is a perfectionist pays attention to details. If Serenity either works alone or avoids projects (but not both), then she values precision. If Zora needs training and is inept with tools, then she will avoid projects. If someone lacks experience, then they need training. Aryan does not learn quickly. Zora is a perfectionist. Zora is self-taught. If Serenity values precision and pays attention to details, then she will create masterpieces. Haley does not work alone. Zora is not formally educated. Aryan does not create masterpieces. If Aryan masters her trade, then she is either formally educated or inexperienced, but not both. If Zora either works alone or avoids projects (but not both), then she values precision. Zora is either skilled with tools or inept with tools, but not both. Haley is self-taught. Zora does not work alone. Zora does not create masterpieces. If Zora either masters her trade or is self-taught, then she has natural talent. Zora does not excel professionally. If Zora either fears failure or profits elsewhere (but not both), then she will avoid projects. If Zora is highly motivated, then she has natural talent and is a diligent worker. Zora does not learn quickly. Serenity is not formally educated. If Zora masters her trade, then she is either formally educated or inexperienced, but not both. For all humans, if they either have natural talent or learn quickly, then they excel professionally. Anyone who cares about details will value precision. Haley does not excel professionally. If Aryan either masters her trade or is self-taught, then she has natural talent. Aryan is a perfectionist.

{
  "reasoning": "Zora is a perfectionist, so she pays attention to details. Given that if Zora values precision and pays attention to details then she creates masterpieces, and we know she does not create masterpieces, it follows that Zora does not value precision. From the rule that if (works alone XOR avoids projects) then she values precision, and since she does not value precision, we infer not(XOR). With Zora not working alone, this yields that she does not avoid projects. Using the rule that if Zora needs training and is inept with tools then she avoids projects, and knowing she does not avoid projects, we conclude it is not the case that she both needs training and is inept with tools. This leaves open whether she is inept with tools (but does not need training) or skilled with tools. No other premises determine her tool skill. Therefore, whether Zora is not skilled with tools is undetermined.",
  "answer": "C"
