Question ID: 412
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Everly is not disciplined. All horses that do cross-country either have good agility or are athletic (or both). If Everly has good coordination, then he has muscle and obeys commands. Everly listens to his rider. Everly does not perform well. Everly has good endurance. Everly competes in events. If Everly has good endurance, then he either excels in show jumping or performs dressage (but not both). If Ramona either has good reflexes or competes in events (but not both), then he has good coordination. If Everly has good breeding and an intelligent nature, then he excels in show jumping. Ramona listens to his rider. Everly either has a quick reaction or has good reflexes (or both). If Everly either has good reflexes or competes in events (but not both), then he has good coordination. If Everly either listens to his rider or obeys commands (but not both), then he is disciplined. If Everly has a good temperament, then he either responds to commands or performs dressage (or both). If Everly either clears fences or gallops long distances (but not both), then he does cross-country. Everly is not athletic. Everly does not have good agility. For all horses, if they have good balance and respond to cues, then they obey commands. Everly does not have muscle. Any horse that is strong or has good stamina performs well. If Everly has good reflexes, then he either does cross-country or performs dressage (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Everly is well-trained.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From listens to his rider and the rule that if (listens XOR obeys) then disciplined, together with Everly not disciplined, we infer he also obeys commands (so the XOR is false). From not having muscle and the rule (good coordination -> muscle and obeys), we infer Everly does not have good coordination. Given he competes in events, the rule (good reflexes XOR competes -> good coordination) implies he must also have good reflexes (so the XOR is false). Good reflexes imply cross-country or dressage; but since cross-country would require agility or athleticism and Everly has neither, he must perform dressage. With endurance and the XOR (show jumping or dressage), performing dressage implies he does not excel in show jumping. None of the given rules define or link “well-trained” to any provided properties (disciplined, obeys commands, listens to rider, etc.). Therefore, whether Everly is well-trained cannot be determined from the premises.",
  "answer": "C"

Correct: Yes
