Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Shelby is self-sufficient, so she lives off the land. Anyone who lives off the land is either prepared for emergencies or has food storage (inclusive). Shelby is a rural resident and does not buy from local markets, so she grows her own crops. Shelby tends a garden, so she cultivates an orchard; with not raising livestock, this satisfies the XOR condition for being a farm owner. As a farm owner, she either grows her own crops or has food storage, but not both; since she grows her own crops, she does not have food storage. Therefore, from living off the land, the only remaining option is that she is prepared for emergencies. Given prepared vs. unprepared is exclusive, she is not unprepared. Hence the statement 'Shelby is unprepared for emergencies' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
