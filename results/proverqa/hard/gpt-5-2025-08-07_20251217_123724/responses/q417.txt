==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Tristan being reserved and not preferring solo work, (reserved XOR prefers solo) implies he avoids confrontation. With avoids confrontation and not valuing privacy, (avoids confrontation XOR values privacy) implies he is introspective. The only given route to being a successful lawyer is (builds trust XOR wins cases) -> successful, but we have no information about builds trust or wins cases. There is no rule linking charismatic or persuasive to builds trust or wins cases. Moreover, we don't even know Tristan is persuasive (only 'good listening skills or persuasive'). Thus we cannot deduce the conditional is always true, nor can we refute it. The truth of the statement is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
