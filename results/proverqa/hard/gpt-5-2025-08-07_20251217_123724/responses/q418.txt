==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Alaina funds medical research and does not develop new treatments, so by the XOR condition she combats serious diseases. Combating serious diseases implies she either advocates for patients' rights or gains international recognition; since she does not gain international recognition, she advocates for patients' rights. Advocating for patients' rights implies she does not pioneer a medical breakthrough. Receiving a noble award implies (dedicated to cancer research XOR pioneers a medical breakthrough); with not pioneering a breakthrough, she is dedicated to cancer research. Being dedicated to cancer research implies (makes groundbreaking discoveries XOR improves patients' lives). Also, she does not contribute to medicine, and (contributes to medicine or makes groundbreaking discoveries) holds; thus she makes groundbreaking discoveries. By the XOR, this means she does not improve patients' lives. Therefore, 'Dr. Alaina Thompson does not improve patients' lives' is true.",
  "answer": "A"
