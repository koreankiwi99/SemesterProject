==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Kahlani knows good taste' she values quality. She runs a brewpub and does not foster community, so she seeks innovation. To conclude she enjoys craft beer via the rule 'if values quality and appreciates uniqueness then enjoys craft beer', we also need appreciates uniqueness. We can only derive appreciates uniqueness if she respects tradition (which would imply it) or if she seeks originality/loves experimentation; neither is established. The statements 'honors culture or respects tradition' and 'embraces diversity' do not force respects tradition. Therefore we cannot determine whether she enjoys craft beer. Since she either enjoys craft beer or prefers mass-produced beer (but not both), and we cannot determine which, the claim that she prefers mass-produced beer is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
