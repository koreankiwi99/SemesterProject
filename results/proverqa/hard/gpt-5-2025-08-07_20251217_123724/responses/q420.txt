==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Hunter uses bait or knows ictiobus' and 'Hunter does not use bait', Hunter knows ictiobus. Then, 'If Hunter knows ictiobus, then he either reads the water or understands currents, but not both' with 'Hunter does not understand currents' gives that he reads the water. From 'If Hunter can read the water, then he is either skilled or experienced, but not both' and 'Hunter is not skilled', he is experienced. With 'Hunter knows the river' and 'If Hunter knows the river, then he either has experience or catches fish, but not both', having experience implies he does not catch fish. From 'Hunter either catches fish or is successful' and not catching fish, he is successful. Thus he is not unsuccessful; therefore the statement 'Hunter is an unsuccessful fisherman' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
