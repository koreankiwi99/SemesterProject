{
  "reasoning": "Matias makes mistakes and either admits fault or takes responsibility (but not both). Since he avoids blame and cannot both admit fault and avoid blame, he does not admit fault; thus he takes responsibility. Taking responsibility implies he either has integrity or is accountable (but not both); given he is accountable, he does not have integrity. No given rule links Matias’s (lack of) integrity, accountability, or other stated traits to gaining (or not gaining) others’ trust. The only trust-related rule provided is specific to Seven. Therefore, whether Matias gains the trust of others cannot be determined from the information given.",
  "answer": "C"
