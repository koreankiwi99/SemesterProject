Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Samantha is dedicated, so she is self-taught. She faces challenges, so she puts in persistent effort. She excels in her craft, so she builds a reputation. From persistent effort, she must either acquire expertise or build a reputation, but not both; since she builds a reputation, she does not acquire expertise. From being self-taught, she must either gain recognition or acquire expertise, but not both; since she does not acquire expertise, she must gain recognition. Therefore, the claim that she does not gain recognition is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
