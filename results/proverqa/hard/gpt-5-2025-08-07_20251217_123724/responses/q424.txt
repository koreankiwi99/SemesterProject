{
  "reasoning": "Jase holds authority, and from holding authority he must prioritize his own safety or put others first (but not both). Jase also pursues personal gain, and since he either pursues personal gain or puts others first (but not both), he does not put others first. Therefore he prioritizes his own safety. Jase supports others and does not make tough calls, so (makes tough calls XOR supports others) holds, implying he is in a leadership position. Being in a leadership position entails he either acts selflessly or prioritizes his own safety (but not both); since he prioritizes his own safety, he does not act selflessly. Jase faces danger, which implies he either acts selflessly or avoids risks; since he does not act selflessly, he avoids risks. Given (avoids risks XOR courageous), avoiding risks means he is not courageous. Since Jase is either courageous or cowardly (but not both), not courageous implies he is cowardly. Hence, the statement that Jase is cowardly is true.",
