Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Aiden has confident body language and connects with others, so he is naturally charismatic. He produces understated pieces, and by the exclusive rule, he does not produce emotionally resonant work. To infer visually stunning creations, we would need Aiden to be an inspiring artist (which implies emotionally resonant or visually stunning), but that requires both natural charisma and creative vision. Creative vision is not established, and no other rule links him to visually stunning creations. Therefore, it cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}
