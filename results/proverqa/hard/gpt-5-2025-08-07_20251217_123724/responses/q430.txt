{
  "reasoning": "Dennis is passionate about printing, so he uses traditional techniques. From high standards and the XOR rule, since Dennis pursues mastery, he does not enjoy precision work. From strong work ethic and the XOR rule, not enjoying precision work implies Dennis crafts ink by hand. If someone values perfection then they seek unique results; Dennis does not seek unique results, so he does not value perfection. Everyone who crafts ink by hand either values perfection or pays attention to details; since Dennis does not value perfection, he pays attention to details. Using traditional techniques and paying attention to details implies producing high-quality work. Therefore, Dennis produces high-quality work.",
