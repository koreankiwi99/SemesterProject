Question ID: 432
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Elsie is a misinformation spreader. If someone is a reliable informer, then they are trustworthy. Elsie fact-checks her posts. Elsie is responsible if she cites references. If someone shares the truth and respects others' opinions, then they are trustworthy. Elsie either engages her audience or creates quality content. If someone values accuracy, then they create quality content. If Elsie verifies facts or is trustworthy, then she is respected online. Elsie does not have moral integrity. If Elsie is either a credible source or a misinformation spreader (but not both), then she is a reliable informer. If Elsie creates quality content and is respected online, then she has moral integrity. Elsie is not responsible. If someone either fact-checks their posts or cites references (but not both), then they value accuracy.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Elsie is not a credible source.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Elsie is not responsible, and if she cites references then she is responsible; thus she does not cite references. She fact-checks her posts, and with not citing references, the exclusive-or rule implies she values accuracy, hence she creates quality content. Suppose Elsie were not a credible source. Since she is a misinformation spreader, the exclusive-or (credible XOR misinformation spreader) would hold, making her a reliable informer, hence trustworthy. Trustworthy implies she is respected online; with quality content, that would force her to have moral integrity—contradicting the given that she does not have moral integrity. Therefore, she cannot be not credible; she must be credible (likely both credible and a misinformation spreader). Hence the statement 'Elsie is not a credible source' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
