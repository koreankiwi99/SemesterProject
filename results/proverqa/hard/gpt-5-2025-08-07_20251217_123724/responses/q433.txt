  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "We know Shiloh does not have good intentions, and everyone either has good intentions or gains knowledge, so Shiloh gains knowledge. We also know Shiloh is selfless or educated (or both). However, there is no information that rules out her being educated, nor any rule linking gaining knowledge to being educated. Thus we cannot deduce that she is selfless, nor can we deduce that she is not selfless. Therefore, the truth of 'Shiloh is selfless' cannot be determined from the given information.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
