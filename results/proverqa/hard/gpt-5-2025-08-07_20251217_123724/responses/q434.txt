Question ID: 434
Difficulty: hard

Context:
All dogs are either affectionate or care deeply (or both). If Archie either reads body language or senses emotions (but not both), then he offers support. Archie is intuitive. If a dog senses emotions and is protective, then it stays by its owner's side. Every dog that has empathy provides comfort. All loyal dogs are protective and love unconditionally. If Archie is intuitive, then he is either loyal or has empathy, but not both. Archie does not offer support. Archie either enjoys playtime or is affectionate, but not necessarily both. Archie does not stay by his owner's side. Archie reads body language. All dogs that have energy enjoy playtime. Archie has energy.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Archie does not provide comfort.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Archie reads body language and does not offer support. Since (reads XOR senses) would imply offering support, the XOR must be false; with reads true, this forces senses emotions to be true as well. Given he senses emotions and does not stay by his owner's side, he cannot be protective (since sensing + protective would imply staying by the owner's side). If loyal then protective, so not protective implies not loyal. From being intuitive and (loyal XOR empathy), not loyal implies empathy is true. Empathy implies providing comfort. Therefore, the statement 'Archie does not provide comfort' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
