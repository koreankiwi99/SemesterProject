Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "We know Jackson is neither outgoing nor charismatic; since standing out implies (outgoing XOR charisma), Jackson does not stand out. Also, since being identifiable implies having visible tattoos and wearing distinctive jewelry, and Jackson does not wear distinctive jewelry, he is not identifiable. However, we are told only that Jackson has distinct palmar patterns or a rare scar (or both). Distinct palmar patterns correspond to unique fingerprints, but the disjunction does not let us determine whether that specific disjunct holds. No other rule resolves this. Therefore, whether Jackson has (or does not have) unique fingerprints is undetermined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C
