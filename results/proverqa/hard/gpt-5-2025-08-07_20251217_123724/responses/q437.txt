{
  "reasoning": "Zander either explores themes or writes semi‑autobiographical works, and he does not explore themes, so he writes semi‑autobiographical works. If he writes semi‑autobiographical works, then he is either critically acclaimed or widely popular, but not both. Given he does not evoke emotions, the rule \"if (resonates XOR evokes) then authentic voice\" reduces to \"if resonates then authentic voice.\" Since he does not have an authentic voice, he does not resonate with readers. From \"if draws from life or is widely popular then resonates,\" not resonating implies he is not widely popular (and not drawing from life). With semi‑autobiographical works and not widely popular, the XOR forces that he is critically acclaimed. Therefore, the statement \"Zander is not critically acclaimed\" is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
