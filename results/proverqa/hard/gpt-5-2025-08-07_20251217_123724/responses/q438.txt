{
  "reasoning": "Mae speaks in front of a crowd, so she is either confident or nervous (but not both). She faces criticism, so she is nervous; hence she is not confident. Mae does not sing alone and must perform in public; performing in public implies she is either stage-frightened or confident (but not both). Since she is not confident, she has stage fright. Mae either has stage fright or is charismatic (but not both), so she is not charismatic. Mae is not hard-working; since success would imply being hard-working, Mae is not successful. If Mae were (charismatic xor talented), she would be successful; since she is not successful, not(charismatic xor talented) holds. With not charismatic, this implies not talented. Therefore, 'Mae is talented' is false.",
