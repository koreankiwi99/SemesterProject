Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Pudding purrs frequently, so she is affectionate. If affectionate, then she is either a charming companion or gets into mischief, but not both. Pudding does not stay healthy, and if she plays outside then she stays healthy; hence she does not play outside. Given she either plays outside or gets into mischief, she must get into mischief. From the exclusive choice, getting into mischief implies she is not a charming companion. If she were charismatic, she would be a charming companion; since she is not a charming companion, she is not charismatic. Therefore the statement is false.",
  "answer": "B"
