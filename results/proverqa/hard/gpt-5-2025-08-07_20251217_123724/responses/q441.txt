Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Kohen runs frequently and does not have a muscular body. From (runs XOR exercises) -> muscular, by modus tollens we get NOT (runs XOR exercises); since he runs, he must also exercise regularly. Eating nutritious food and exercising regularly implies a large build; large build implies an intimidating appearance. From (intimidating XOR gentle), he is not gentle; from (gentle XOR elegant), he is elegant. Given he does not perform well and (athletic or endurance) -> perform well, he is neither athletic nor has endurance. With no speed, (agile or speed) -> athletic forces not agile; from (agile XOR strong), he is strong. If strong, then (carriage XOR elegant); since he is elegant, he cannot serve as a carriage horse. Therefore, the statement is false.",
  "answer": "B"
