  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Grant acts spontaneously and is TF XOR AS, so he does not think freely. From (FR or TF), he follows rules. From (CM XOR FR), he does not create masterpieces. He has creativity, and (ODC ∧ HC -> CM); since not CM, infer not ODC. He cannot generate innovative ideas, and (TOB or SPD -> GII), so not TOB and not SPD. Thus not (ODC or TOB). Since brilliant artist implies (ODC or TOB), by modus tollens Grant is not a brilliant artist. Therefore the statement is true.",
  "answer": "A"
}
