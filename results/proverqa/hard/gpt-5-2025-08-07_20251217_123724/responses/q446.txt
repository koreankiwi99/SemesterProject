==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Nevaeh does not act with integrity. Since following one’s conscience implies acting with integrity, Nevaeh does not follow her conscience. If Nevaeh were brave, she would either follow her conscience (impossible) or persevere; but persevering implies resilience and Nevaeh lacks resilience. Thus, Nevaeh is not brave. From (makes sacrifices XOR takes risks) -> brave and not brave with not taking risks, it follows she does not make sacrifices. Everyone either makes sacrifices or faces adversity; hence Nevaeh faces adversity, which implies she is compassionate and selfless. None of the premises relate loyalty to any of these traits. Therefore, whether Nevaeh shows loyalty is not determined.",
  "answer": "C"
