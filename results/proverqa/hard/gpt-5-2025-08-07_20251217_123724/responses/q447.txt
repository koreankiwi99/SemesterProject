Damir does not value conservation. Damir either preserves habitats or explores ecosystems, but not both. Damir does not contribute to environmental science. If Damir pursues nature photography, then he either ventures into the wilderness or collects plant samples (or both). If Damir ventures into the wilderness, then he will discover new species. Damir values conservation or enjoys outdoor activities. Damir preserves habitats. If Damir pursues biological research, then he either studies plant species or contributes to environmental science. If someone collects plant samples, then they appreciate nature. If Damir studies plant species, then he can become a botany expert. Damir does not appreciate nature. If Damir conducts field work, then he either collects plant samples or documents wildlife, but not both. If Damir discovers a new species, then he either explores ecosystems or pursues biological research, but not both.

Question:

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:

{
  "reasoning": "Damir does not value conservation, and (values conservation or enjoys outdoor activities) holds, so he enjoys outdoor activities. Enjoying outdoor activities implies he pursues nature photography, which implies he either ventures into the wilderness or collects plant samples. Since collecting plant samples would imply appreciating nature, but Damir does not appreciate nature, he does not collect samples; thus he ventures into the wilderness. Venturing implies he discovers a new species. Discovering a new species implies either exploring ecosystems or pursuing biological research, but not both. Because Damir preserves habitats and (preserves habitats xor explores ecosystems), he does not explore ecosystems; therefore he pursues biological research. Pursuing biological research implies either studying plant species or contributing to environmental science. Since he does not contribute to environmental science, he studies plant species. Studying plant species implies he can become a botany expert. Hence, the statement that Damir cannot become a botany expert is false.",
  "answer": "B"

Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
