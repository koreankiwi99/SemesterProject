Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Kevin has a PhD, so by the XOR rule he either collects data alongside rivers or writes books; since he writes books, he does not collect rivers. He conducts field research; combined with not collecting rivers, the XOR condition for field research/collecting rivers is met, so he works outdoors. Working outdoors implies he either studies marine life or has scientific interests. He pursues artistic passions, and by the XOR with scientific interests, he does not have scientific interests. Therefore, he must study marine life. Anyone who studies marine life cares about conservation, so Kevin cares about conservation.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
