{
  "reasoning": "Vance makes sound judgments and does not think carefully, so he plans ahead and thus values stability. Given he is either a thrill seeker or values stability (but not both), he is not a thrill seeker. He does not take risks, and since (forward thinker or open to new experiences) implies taking risks, he is not a forward thinker (and not open). From (impulsive XOR thrill seeker) implies forward thinker and not being a forward thinker, it follows that not (impulsive XOR thrill seeker). With not a thrill seeker, this yields not impulsive. Since he is cautious and not impulsive, (impulsive XOR cautious) holds, so he is innovative.",
  "answer": "A"
