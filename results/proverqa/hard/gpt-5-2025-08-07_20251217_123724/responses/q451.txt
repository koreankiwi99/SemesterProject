Question ID: 451
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Lane values privacy. For anyone, valuing privacy and seeking fame are mutually exclusive. If Lane works hard, then he either gains recognition or is admired by his peers (or both). Lane is charismatic. Lane is dedicated. Lane does not achieve success. If Lane is humble, then he is either well-reputed or charismatic, but not both. If Lane is either dishonorable or has integrity, then he will have a good reputation. Lane either acts with honor or is dishonorable. For everyone, being humble and seeking fame are mutually exclusive. If Lane is admired by his peers, then he achieves success. Everyone who is dedicated is either respected or admired by their peers (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lane is loyal.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Lane is dedicated. From 'Dedicated -> (Respected or Admired)' and 'Admired -> Success' with 'Not Success', we infer Lane is not admired; therefore, he must be respected. No rule connects any of Lane's properties (privacy, charisma, respect, honor/dishonor, fame, success) to being loyal, nor is loyalty or its negation given. Thus, whether Lane is loyal cannot be determined from the premises.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
