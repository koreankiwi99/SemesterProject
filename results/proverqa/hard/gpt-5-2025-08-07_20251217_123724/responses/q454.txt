==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From the premises: Mira holds a leadership position and makes a positive impact (thus not inspiring others, due to the XOR). She does not value her privacy, so by the exclusive condition she connects with others, which (via the rule that those with a strong vision or who connect with others can be charismatic) makes her charismatic; being charismatic and already innovative implies she is not a pioneering business leader (XOR). She makes informed decisions, so she drives business growth, which contradicts the given statement that she does not drive business growth. Despite these derived facts and contradictions, there is no rule connecting any of them to ‘achieving professional success’ nor any direct statement about it. Therefore, we cannot determine whether she achieves (or does not achieve) professional success.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
