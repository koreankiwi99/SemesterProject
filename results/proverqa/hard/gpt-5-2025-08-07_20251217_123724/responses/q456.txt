==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Axel promotes justice and values human rights, so he advocates for equality. He works in a factory and lives in poverty, so he (can) sympathizes with workers; with advocating for equality, this yields supporting the proletariat. To join the Bolshevik party we also need Axel to believe in socialism. However, we only know: (1) Axel either pursues political power or endorses capitalism, but not both; and (2) Axel either endorses capitalism or believes in socialism, but not both. From charisma and seeking influence we get that he can pursue political power, but not that he actually does. Therefore we cannot rule out that he endorses capitalism, and thus cannot conclude he believes in socialism. Since believing in socialism remains unresolved, whether Axel joins the Bolshevik party is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
