==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From not well-rounded and (balances life ⊕ has hobbies) -> well-rounded, with not hobbies, we get not balances life. Given balances life ⊕ hard-working, Mallory must be hard-working. Also, values knowledge ∧ passionate -> inspire; since Mallory does not inspire and values knowledge, she is not passionate. The statement uses 'dedicated,' which is not defined or equated to either 'hard-working' or 'passionate' in the premises. If 'dedicated' meant hard-working, it would be true; if it meant passionate, it would be false. Without an explicit definition, the truth of 'Mallory is dedicated' cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C
