Question ID: 459
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Delilah cannot communicate complex ideas. Delilah masters algorithms if she can crack complex codes. For Delilah, either she has deep knowledge of computer systems or she can communicate complex ideas, but not necessarily both. Delilah protects sensitive data. Delilah does not develop secure protocols. If someone understands encryption and studies code patterns, then they can excel in cryptography. If Delilah works on high-profile projects, then she either has deep knowledge of computer systems or master algorithms (but not both). Anyone who excels in cryptography either identifies system vulnerabilities or develops secure protocols (or both). If Delilah passes a hacking competition, then she either wins national awards or excels in cryptography (or both). Delilah understands encryption. Delilah studies code patterns. Delilah has a proven track record. Delilah has strong problem-solving skills. If Delilah protects sensitive data, then she is either a skilled cybersecurity expert or masters algorithms (or both). If Delilah has strong problem-solving skills, then she works on high-profile projects and has a proven track record.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Delilah does not create unbreakable passwords.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Delilah cannot communicate complex ideas, and since she must have either deep knowledge or communication ability, she has deep knowledge. Strong problem-solving implies she works on high-profile projects, and with the exclusive condition (deep knowledge xor mastering algorithms), mastering algorithms is false. Understanding encryption and studying code patterns implies she excels in cryptography; given she does not develop secure protocols, she must identify system vulnerabilities. Protecting sensitive data then implies she is a skilled cybersecurity expert (since mastering algorithms is false). However, there is no statement linking any of these facts to creating unbreakable passwords. No rule mentions or implies whether she creates or does not create unbreakable passwords, so the claim cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
