Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Mohammad studies diseases, then he will work on cures. Mohammad works on cures if he has medical training. Mohammad develops practical skills.

Mohammad explores nature or studies diseases. Hallie does not explore nature. For Mohammad, either he develops practical skills or pursues knowledge, but not both. Mohammad does not explore nature. If Mohammad has passion, then he either pursues knowledge or makes discoveries.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Mohammad contributes to science and improves human lives.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'Mohammad explores nature or studies diseases' and 'Mohammad does not explore nature', it follows that Mohammad studies diseases. Therefore, by 'If Mohammad studies diseases, then he will work on cures', he works on cures, and by 'If someone works on cures, then they improve human lives', he improves human lives. However, nothing in the premises links studying diseases, working on cures, developing practical skills, or any other given condition to 'contributes to science'. Moreover, since he develops practical skills and the XOR with 'pursues knowledge' holds, he does not pursue knowledge, and we have no information that he makes discoveries. Thus, whether he contributes to science is not determined. The conjunction 'contributes to science and improves human lives' is therefore uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
