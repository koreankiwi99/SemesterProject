Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Davis inspires a new generation.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Davis faces harsh criticism, so by the XOR (earns acclaim or faces harsh criticism), he does not earn acclaim. Given also that Davis does not gain recognition, the rule \"If Davis becomes an expert, then he either earns acclaim or gains recognition (but not both)\" implies he cannot be an expert. Hence, by contrapositive of \"If Davis studies extensively, then he will become an expert,\" he does not study extensively; therefore the XOR condition (reads widely or collects data) is false. He does dedicate his lifework (since he does not pursue his passion), but there is no rule linking Davis’s known facts to inspiring a new generation. The only inspire-related rule concerns Emilia. Thus, there is neither a proof that Davis inspires a new generation nor a proof that he does not. The statement is therefore uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
