By the rule that every bear either enjoys walking or loves nature, Pooh must love nature. If Pooh loves nature, then he either finds honey quickly or finds it easy to find honey, but not both. Pooh explores the forest and has a good memory; from exploring the forest, he must have either finds honey quickly or has a good memory, but not both.
