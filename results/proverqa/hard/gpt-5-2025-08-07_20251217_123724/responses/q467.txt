Question ID: 467
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If a researcher uses qualitative methods, then they either collect data or identify patterns. Everyone who collects data either analyzes their findings or publishes papers (or both). If Dr. Lubber is meticulous, then he produces accurate results and gains international recognition. Dr. Lubber does not design experiments. Dr. Lubber does not make new discoveries. If Dr. Lubber achieves a breakthrough, then he either collaborates with others or develops innovative methods, but not both. Every researcher collects data or conducts thorough research. If Dr. Eren either designs experiments or develops innovative methods (but not both), then he makes new discoveries. For every researcher, they either publish papers or teach students, but not both is not necessarily true. Dr. Lubber teaches students. If Dr. Lubber either designs experiments or develops innovative methods (but not both), then he makes new discoveries. For any researcher who gains international recognition, they must conduct thorough research and develop innovative methods. Dr. Lubber does not analyze his findings. Dr. Lubber produces accurate results. Any researcher who publishes breakthroughs or leads collaborative projects can gain international recognition.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Lubber is not meticulous.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From: If Dr. Lubber either designs experiments or develops innovative methods (but not both), then he makes new discoveries. Given he does not design experiments and does not make new discoveries, it follows he does not develop innovative methods (otherwise the XOR antecedent would hold and imply discoveries). Any researcher who gains international recognition must develop innovative methods; thus Dr. Lubber cannot gain international recognition. If he were meticulous, he would gain international recognition. Since he cannot, he is not meticulous.",
  "answer": "A"
}

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
