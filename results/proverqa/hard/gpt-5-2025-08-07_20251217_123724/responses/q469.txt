Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From (Legendary or WorldwideRecognition) -> Revered and the fact Jaxx is not revered, we infer he is not legendary and does not gain worldwide recognition. Given VisionaryIdeas and (InspiresOthers and VisionaryIdeas) -> Legendary, not legendary implies Jaxx does not inspire others. Since he lives in a fantasy world and (FantasyWorld and UniqueAbility) -> InspiresOthers, not inspiring others (with FantasyWorld true) implies Jaxx does not have a unique ability. Interpreting special powers as a unique ability (or magical gift), Jaxx thus does not possess special powers.",
  "answer": "A"
}
