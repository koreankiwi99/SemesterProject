Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Cohen does not advocate for human rights and does not speak out against injustice. Since seeking justice implies speaking out or advocating, Cohen cannot be seeking justice. Cohen also does not report fairly. Pursuing truth implies seeking justice or reporting fairly, so Cohen does not pursue truth. Given Cohen either pursues truth or values integrity, he must value integrity. From driven to succeed XOR values integrity, Cohen is not driven to succeed. From (ambitious XOR driven) implies highly motivated and Cohen is not highly motivated, we get not (ambitious XOR driven); with not driven, this yields not ambitious. Since Cohen is ambitious or dedicated, and he is not ambitious, he must be dedicated. Therefore, the statement 'Cohen is not dedicated' is false.",
  "answer": "B"
