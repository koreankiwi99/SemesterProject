Question ID: 472
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Sky does not have natural talent. If Sky is an artist, then she either tells a story or evokes emotion, but not both. Sky evokes emotion. If Sky either expresses emotion or connects with the audience (but not both), then she builds a connection. Sky does not achieve success. If someone performs with elegance and connects with the audience, then they inspire others. If Sky has passion, then she tells a story and speaks from her heart. If Sky inspires others, then she will achieve success. Sky cannot touch the hearts of others. For all humans, if they are trained in ballet or have natural talent, then they perform with elegance. Sky is an artist. Anyone who either tells a story or builds a connection can touch the hearts of others. Sky expresses emotion.

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Sky is an artist; by the XOR rule (artist -> tells a story XOR evokes emotion) and given she evokes emotion, she does not tell a story. Anyone who tells a story or builds a connection can touch hearts, but Sky cannot touch hearts, so she does not build a connection. The rule (expresses emotion XOR connects) -> builds a connection, together with expresses emotion true and builds a connection false, forces connects with the audience to be true (to make the XOR antecedent false). From connects true and (performs with elegance AND connects) -> inspires, plus inspires -> achieve success and the fact that Sky does not achieve success, we get not inspires, hence not (performs with elegance AND connects); since connects is true, she does not perform with elegance. From (trained in ballet OR natural talent) -> performs with elegance, its contrapositive yields that not performing with elegance implies neither trained in ballet nor having natural talent. Therefore, Sky is not trained in ballet.",
