{
  "reasoning": "The premises establish various facts about Archer (e.g., he handles emergencies, anticipates risks, has high responsibility, stays calm), and include rules about responsibility, critical tasks, pressure, focus, and safety. However, there is no rule connecting any of these properties—including handling emergencies—to 'can save lives.' There is also no statement denying that he can save lives. Therefore, based solely on the given information, whether Archer can save lives cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
