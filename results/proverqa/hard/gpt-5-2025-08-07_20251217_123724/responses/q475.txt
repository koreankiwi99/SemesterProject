Question ID: 475
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Scott is vulnerable, then he either needs protection or forms senses (but not both). Scott is not vulnerable. Everyone who either forms senses or develops organs requires care. If Scott either receives oxygen or gains weight (but not both), then he develops organs. For every human, they are either born or unborn, but not both. All humans who grow inside their mother need nourishment and are born. If Scott can walk, then he achieves independence. For all humans, if they either develop organs or grow inside their mother, then they depend on others. If Scott is a child, then he either needs protection or can walk, but not both. Scott does not require care. If someone depends on others, then they are vulnerable. If Nola can walk, then he achieves independence. Scott develops a brain. For Scott, he either needs nourishment or can walk, but the ability to walk implies he no longer needs nourishment in the same way as before. Scott does not achieve independence. Anyone who develops blood either grows inside the womb or breathes air (or both). All humans who develop a brain will react to stimuli and form senses.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Scott is unborn.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "We can infer Scott cannot walk from: If Scott can walk, then he achieves independence, and Scott does not achieve independence (contrapositive). From Scott either needs nourishment or can walk, with not walking, Scott needs nourishment. However, nothing links needing nourishment to being unborn. The rule All humans who grow inside their mother need nourishment and are born does not let us infer growing inside the mother from needing nourishment. We have no information that Scott grows inside his mother, develops organs, breathes air, or otherwise that would determine born vs. unborn. Therefore, whether Scott is unborn cannot be determined from the given facts.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
