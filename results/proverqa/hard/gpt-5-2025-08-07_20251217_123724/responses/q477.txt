{
  "reasoning": "- Kairi does not take risks, and (seeks stability or takes risks) holds, so she seeks stability.\n- From (thinks outside the box XOR seeks stability), seeking stability implies she does not think outside the box.\n- Kairi is an artist and explores uncertainty; by (embraces chaos XOR explores uncertainty), she does not embrace chaos.\n- (Embrace chaos or limit innovation) -> think outside the box; with not embracing chaos, if she limited innovation then she would think outside the box.\n- If Kairi were conventional, then (conventional or follows tradition) -> limit innovation would make her limit innovation, hence think outside the box—contradicting the earlier conclusion. Therefore, she is not conventional.\n- From (free-spirited XOR conventional), not conventional implies free-spirited.\n- Thus, “Kairi is free-spirited” is true.",
