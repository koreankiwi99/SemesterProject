  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Dayana has good listening skills, and can read body language. From GLS -> (analyzes behavior XOR read body language), having read body language makes analyzes behavior false. Critical thinking implies understanding others. From understanding -> (analyzes behavior OR empathetic), with analyzes behavior false, Dayana must be empathetic. Empathetic -> (intuitive XOR rational thoughts); given Dayana is not intuitive, she must have rational thoughts. The rule (rational thoughts XOR sane) then makes her not sane. By the human rule (sane XOR insane), not sane implies insane. Therefore, Dayana is insane.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
