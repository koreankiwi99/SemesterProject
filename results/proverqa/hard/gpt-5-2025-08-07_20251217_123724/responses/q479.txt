==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Sam has engineering skills, and since he either has engineering skills or designs infrastructure (but not both), he does not design infrastructure. Sam cares about others, so he connects isolated areas. Thus exactly one of {designs infrastructure, connects isolated areas} is true, triggering: if Sam either designs infrastructure or connects isolated areas (but not both), then he builds bridges. Therefore, Sam builds bridges, which implies exactly one of {fosters economic growth, unites communities}. Sam succeeds in projects, which means exactly one of {strengthens social bonds, empowers local residents}; given he empowers local residents, he does not strengthen social bonds. Since Sam overcomes obstacles, he either unites communities or strengthens social bonds (or both); with strengthens social bonds false, he must unite communities. Hence, from the bridge rule’s exclusivity, he does not foster economic growth.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:

Correct: Yes
