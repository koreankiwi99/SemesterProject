Question ID: 481
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Dash does not develop spikes. If Dash grows in size, then he either strengthens his body or develops horns (or both). Dash grows in size. Dash did not strengthen his body. If Dash's body parts ossify, then he either gains protection or loses agility, but not both. If Dash matures, then he will grow sharp claws. If Dash either raises his scales or bares his teeth (but not both), then he will become defensive. Dash's body parts ossify. If Dash is defensive, then he lives in groups and relies on his intelligence. Dash does not become formidable. If Dash develops horns, then he will either grow sharp claws or thicken his scales, but not both. If Dash either develops spikes or grows sharp claws (but not both), then he will become defensive. Every dinosaur that either thickens its scales or gains protection will become formidable. Dash does not rely on his intelligence. Dash lives in groups.

Question:

Options:
  A) True

  C) Uncertain

{
  "reasoning": "Dash grows in size and did not strengthen his body, so he must develop horns. If he develops horns, then he either grows sharp claws or thickens his scales (but not both). We also know Dash is not formidable, and every dinosaur that either thickens its scales or gains protection becomes formidable; by contrapositive, Dash neither thickens his scales nor gains protection. Thus, from the horns rule, he must grow sharp claws (since thickening scales is ruled out). Since Dash’s body parts ossify and ossification leads to either gaining protection or losing agility (but not both), and gaining protection is ruled out, Dash must lose agility. Therefore, the statement is true.",
  "answer": "A"
