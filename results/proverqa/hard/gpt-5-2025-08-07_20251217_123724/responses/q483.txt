Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Hailey studies ecology, so she either protects nature or destroys habitat (but not both). She also either conserves wildlife or harms wildlife (but not both), and either harms wildlife or protects nature. None of these force harms wildlife: she could protect nature and thus conserve wildlife. Separately, from ignores rules -> disregards waste -> litters publicly -> harms the ecosystem -> damages the planet, but we are told she does not damage the planet, which implies she does not harm the ecosystem; this creates an inconsistency about harming the ecosystem but provides no link to harming wildlife. There is no rule that compels harms wildlife, so we cannot conclude she does not conserve wildlife.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
