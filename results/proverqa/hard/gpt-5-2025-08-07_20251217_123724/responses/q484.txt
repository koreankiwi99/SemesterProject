Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From 'If someone achieves their goals, then they are confident and have strong convictions' and the facts that Kelly is confident but does not have strong convictions, we infer by contrapositive that Kelly does not achieve her goals. Given 'If Kelly is dedicated and works hard, then she achieves her goals' and that Kelly works hard, her not achieving implies she is not dedicated. Also, Kelly loses arguments and 'Kelly either wins cases or loses arguments, but not both' implies she does not win cases. From 'If Kelly is either confident in her speech or passionate, then she wins her cases' and not winning, we infer she is neither confident in her speech nor passionate. The only stated sufficient condition for Kelly being successful is: if she is either dedicated or passionate (but not both). Since she is neither dedicated nor passionate, that condition does not hold. However, there is no rule that says she is successful only in that case, nor any rule that directly makes her not successful. Therefore, whether Kelly is successful cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
