Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Jade loves the ocean, so she is a seasoned sailor. Given she is not a master cartographer, the XOR rule makes her an excellent navigator. Excellent navigator implies exactly one of: lead expeditions or chart new paths. Jade craves challenge, so she seeks new experiences. The rule (enjoys spontaneity XOR seeks new experiences) -> free-spirited, together with Jade not being free-spirited, forces both enjoys spontaneity and seeks new experiences to be true. From (enjoys spontaneity XOR prefers order), prefers order is false; thus she does not value routine (since valuing routine implies preferring order). By the XOR (values routine or adventurous), Jade must be adventurous. Adventurous implies she charts new paths. Therefore, by the navigator XOR, she does not lead expeditions. The statement is false.",
  "answer": "B"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
