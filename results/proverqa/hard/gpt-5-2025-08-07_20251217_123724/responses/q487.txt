Question ID: 487
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Joaquin has a real-world impact. Kenna is intelligent or innovative. If Caroline is a software engineer, then she is either theoretically sound or has practical experience, but not both. Kenna learns programming. Joaquin is either theoretically sound or has a real-world impact, but not both. Everyone is either intelligent or has practical experience, but the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive. If Kenna has specialized knowledge, then she is both theoretically sound and passionate. Anyone who works on projects has practical experience. If someone learns programming and enjoys problem solving, then they write code. If Kenna writes code, then she is a software engineer. If Kenna is a software engineer, then she is either theoretically sound or has practical experience, but not both. Kenna is either theoretically sound or has a real-world impact, but not both. Kenna enjoys problem solving. Caroline enjoys problem solving. If Caroline writes code, then she is a software engineer. If someone reads widely and thinks critically, then they are intelligent. Joaquin learns programming. Kenna has a real-world impact.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kenna is not innovative.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Kenna learns programming and enjoys problem solving, so she writes code and thus is a software engineer. As a software engineer, she must be either theoretically sound or have practical experience, but not both. Kenna also has a real-world impact and is in an XOR with being theoretically sound, so she is not theoretically sound. Therefore, from the software engineer XOR, she has practical experience. No given rule connects these facts to innovation. The only statement about innovation is that Kenna is intelligent or innovative, which does not determine whether she is innovative. Hence, whether Kenna is not innovative cannot be concluded.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
