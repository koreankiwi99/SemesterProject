Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Anahi is open-minded and does not share personal stories, so by the exclusive-or rule she forges meaningful connections. From 'sociable or empathy -> can build bridges' and 'Anahi cannot build bridges', we deduce she is neither sociable nor empathetic. Since everyone values kindness or has empathy, she must value kindness. From 'not love adventure' and '(explores cities or tries new food) -> love adventure', we infer she neither explores cities nor tries new food. Given enjoys solitude and 'if (prioritizes community XOR enjoys solitude) then sociable', and since she is not sociable, we conclude prioritizes community is true; therefore, by the XOR with values independence, she does not value independence. Using 'if (travels alone XOR explores cities) then values independence' and not valuing independence with not exploring cities, we infer she does not travel alone; hence, by the XOR with receiving warm hospitality, she receives warm hospitality. None of the given rules define or imply anything about being culturally curious, so the truth of 'Anahi is not culturally curious' cannot be determined.",
  "answer": "C"
