==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From feeling invincible and not asserting dominance, Simba must have confidence. With confidence and seeking adventure, he takes risks. Since risk-takers either develop caution or learn from mistakes, and Simba does not develop caution, he learns from mistakes. Given he learns from mistakes and does not listen to others (exactly one), he values wisdom. With wisdom and respecting experience, he follows elders, hence not impulsive. However, no rule links these facts to whether he faces danger. Therefore, we cannot determine if he will (or will not) face danger.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
