==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "From Meredith’s generous spirit, she shares credit and values collaboration. Given she does not attribute success, the exclusive-or rule implies she remains humble. From making breakthroughs, she either receives awards or craves fame; if she craves fame, she hunts for recognition, which by the XOR with selfless dedication determines only that she cannot have both, but this still gives no rule about leaving a lasting legacy. The only rule connecting leaving a lasting legacy is specific to Lewis, not Meredith. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Meredith leaves a lasting legacy or not.",
  "answer": "C"
}

Ground Truth: C
