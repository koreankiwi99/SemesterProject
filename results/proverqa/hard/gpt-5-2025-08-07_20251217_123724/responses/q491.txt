Question ID: 491
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Cason does not prosper in harsh environments. If a plant has a waxy coating and stores water, then it thrives in arid conditions. Cason tolerates shade. Any plant that exudes gel either prospers in harsh environments or thrives in arid conditions (or both). If Cason either develops roots or blooms in water (but not both), then it can survive extremes. If Cason is an endangered plant, then it either grows rapidly or survives extremes, but not both. For Cason, either it requires constant watering or produces soothing gel, but not both. Cason either exudes gel or blooms in water, but not both. Cason either has healing properties or thrives in arid conditions, but not both. If Cason has adaptive leaves, then it can survive extremes. If Cason either has healing properties or produces soothing gel (but not both), then it is medicinal. Cason needs sunlight. If Cason needs sunlight, then it either requires constant watering or tolerates shade, but not both. Cason grows rapidly. Cason is an endangered plant. Cason does not develop roots.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cason is not resilient.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Cason is endangered and grows rapidly. From 'If Cason is an endangered plant, then it either grows rapidly or survives extremes, but not both,' this means Cason does not survive extremes. If blooms-in-water were true (with 'Cason does not develop roots'), then 'develops roots XOR blooms in water -> survive extremes' would force surviving extremes, contradicting the above; hence blooms-in-water is false. Therefore, Cason cannot survive extremes. Interpreting resilience as the ability to survive extremes, Cason is not resilient. Thus, the statement is true.",
  "answer": "A"
}

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: A
Correct: No
