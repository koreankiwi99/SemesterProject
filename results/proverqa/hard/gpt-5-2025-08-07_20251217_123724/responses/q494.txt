Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Raul owns a big plot and needs extra help, so he will employ workers. Since he employs workers and does not mechanize tasks, he manages a large plantation. Managing a large plantation implies either harvesting efficiently or using sustainable practices (but not both); given he uses sustainable practices, he does not harvest efficiently. Being an experienced farmer then forces that he grows high-quality beans (not harvest efficiently). He works independently, so he does not share knowledge with others. The only rule mentioning supporting local projects is: if Raul dedicates time to his farm, then he either grows high-quality beans or supports local projects. We do not know that he dedicates time, and even if he did, the disjunction could be satisfied solely by growing high-quality beans. No rule links his known traits (e.g., sustainable practices, employing workers) directly to improving the community. Thus, we cannot determine that Raul can improve the community, nor can we refute it.",
  "answer": "C"
