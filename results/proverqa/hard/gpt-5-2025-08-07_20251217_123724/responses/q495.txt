Difficulty: hard

Context:
All penguins who either guard their nest or are protective are defending their family. If Pancake has a mate, then he is either loyal or protective, but not both. If Pancake dives deep, then he either finds food or hunts efficiently, but not both. Any penguin that builds a nest or raises its young can care for its chicks. Pancake keeps vigilant. All penguins who either guard their nest or keep vigilant will safeguard their territory. Pancake hunts efficiently. Pancake either raises his young or migrates seasonally, but not at the same time. Pancake migrates seasonally. Pancake is devoted. Pancake has a mate. Pancake builds a nest. If Pancake cares for his chicks and defends his family, then he can find food. If Pancake is either loving or devoted (but not both), then he is loyal. Pancake dives deep. Pancake does not safeguard his territory.

Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Pancake is not loving.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Pancake dives deep and hunts efficiently; from the XOR rule (dives deep -> finds food or hunts efficiently, but not both), he does not find food. He builds a nest, so he can care for his chicks. If he cares for his chicks and defends his family, then he can find food; since he does not find food, he is not defending his family. From (guard nest or protective) -> defends family and not defending family, it follows he is neither guarding his nest nor protective. Having a mate implies loyal or protective, but not both; since he is not protective, he is loyal. The rule (loving XOR devoted) -> loyal does not let us infer whether he is loving, especially since he is already devoted and loyal can arise from having a mate. Therefore, whether Pancake is loving remains undetermined. Hence, the statement 'Pancake is not loving' is uncertain.",
  "answer": "C"

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
