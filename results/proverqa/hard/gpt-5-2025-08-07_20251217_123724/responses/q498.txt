Question ID: 498
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Saul does not achieve his goals. Saul is not receiving support. Saul does not set realistic goals. If Saul either regains confidence or builds self-esteem (but not both), then he overcomes adversity. If Saul meets challenges, then he either becomes discouraged or finds new strength, but not both. If Saul either uses assistive devices or requires medical attention (but not both), then he is disabled. If someone requires medical attention and has a strong will, then they can achieve goals. Anyone who achieves success will build their self-esteem. If Saul faces obstacles, then he either loses motivation or finds new strength, but not both. Saul uses assistive devices. Saul does not overcome adversity. If someone suffers injuries, then they face obstacles and develop resilience. Saul has a strong will. Saul either builds self-esteem or sets realistic goals, but not both. If Saul finds new strength, then he either regains confidence or rediscovers purpose, but not both. Saul rediscovers his purpose. If someone recognizes their ability and makes progress, then they can regain confidence. If Saul is disabled, then he is either receiving support or suffering injuries (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Saul does not lose motivation.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "1) From 'Saul either builds self-esteem or sets realistic goals, but not both' and 'Saul does not set realistic goals', we get that Saul builds self-esteem. 2) Since '(regains confidence XOR builds self-esteem) -> overcomes adversity' and Saul does not overcome adversity while he does build self-esteem, regaining confidence must also be true (so the XOR is false, avoiding the implication). 3) With 'finds new strength -> (regains confidence XOR rediscovers purpose)' and both regains confidence and rediscovers purpose true, the XOR is false; by contrapositive, Saul does not find new strength. 4) Saul uses assistive devices. If he also required medical attention, then with strong will he would (can) achieve goals, contradicting 'Saul does not achieve his goals'; hence he does not require medical attention. Therefore, (uses assistive devices XOR requires medical attention) holds, so Saul is disabled. 5) If disabled, then (receiving support XOR suffering injuries). Since he is not receiving support, he must be suffering injuries. 6) Suffering injuries implies facing obstacles. Then 'faces obstacles -> (loses motivation XOR finds new strength)'; with 'does not find new strength', this forces 'loses motivation' to be true. Therefore, 'Saul does not lose motivation' is false.",
