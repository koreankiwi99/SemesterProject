Model Response:
==================================================
{
  "reasoning": "Ashlynn does not achieve success, and since developing resilience implies achieving success, she does not develop resilience. She experiences failure, which implies (learns from mistakes XOR faces life challenges). Given she avoids risks and (learns from mistakes XOR avoids risks), she does not learn from mistakes; thus she faces life challenges. Facing life challenges implies (develops resilience or has a supportive family); with not developing resilience, she must have a supportive family. Having a supportive family implies (becomes dependent or becomes independent). She lacks motivation (from the disjunction with not struggling with decisions) and also has low self-esteem. If she became dependent, it would require (lacks motivation XOR low self-esteem), which is false since both are true; hence she does not become dependent. Therefore, with supportive family and not dependent, she must become independent. So the statement \"Ashlynn does not become independent\" is false.",
  "answer": "B"
