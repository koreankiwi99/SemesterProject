From the small-business rule (supports environmental causes XOR fosters local economies), Heaven must foster local economies.\n- If (builds a strong community XOR fosters local economies) then drives social change. Since Heaven does not drive social change and does foster local economies, it follows she also builds a strong community (so the XOR would be false).\n- From (builds a strong community XOR creates successful products), with builds a strong community true, creates successful products must be false.\n- Heaven does not find innovative solutions. Given that (values sustainability OR is passionate about nature) implies finding innovative solutions, we conclude Heaven neither values sustainability nor is passionate about nature.\n- There is no rule connecting Heaven to discovering natural remedies.

Since she does not strive for excellence and she values quality, XOR must be false, so she also seeks perfection.\n- If she seeks perfection, then she thinks creatively or takes risks. She does not take risks, so she thinks creatively.\n- Being a photographer implies she reacts quickly or thinks creatively; we already have thinks creatively, so no information about reacting quickly is forced.\n- We have: Lucy either reacts quickly or has good reflexes; and exactly one of good reflexes or slow reflexes.
