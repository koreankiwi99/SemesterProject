Question:

  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Legend has a good temperament, and “fast or good temperament, but not both” implies Legend is not fast.
2) From “Legend is either a champion or fast,” and not fast, it follows Legend is a champion.
3) Legend is well-trained, and “well-trained or racing background, but not both” implies Legend does not have a racing background.
4) If Legend had a unique color, then he would be either large breed or have a racing background, but not both. Since he does not have a racing background, unique color would imply large breed, which implies strong muscles.
5) If Legend has strong muscles or an athletic build, then he is competitive. He does not have an athletic build; thus unique color would force strong muscles, which would make him competitive. But Legend is not competitive. Therefore, Legend cannot have a unique color.
6) Since Legend is a champion and champions have either a unique color or a distinctive marking, and unique color is false, Legend must have a distinctive marking.
