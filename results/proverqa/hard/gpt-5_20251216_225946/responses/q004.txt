Question ID: 4
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Dayana has a PhD in biology. If Landen has a passion for reptiles, then he will study caimans. Landen protects endangered species. Barrett either works with local communities or ventures into remote locations, but not both. Landen does not work with local communities. Vihaan either ventures into remote locations or earns global recognition, but not both. Landen either works with local communities or ventures into remote locations, but not both. Landen has experience with wildlife rescue. If Dayana has a PhD in biology, then he either documents animal behavior or has experience with wildlife rescue, but not both. Landen either ventures into remote locations or earns global recognition, but not both. Landen has a PhD in biology. If Landen has a PhD in biology, then he either documents animal behavior or has experience with wildlife rescue, but not both. Barrett protects endangered species. Anyone who discovers new species and publishes research papers can earn global recognition. If Landen has field experience, then he either ventures into remote locations or specializes in reptile biology, but not both. If Landen studies caimans, then he can either gain the respect of the indigenous community or contribute to caiman conservation, but not both. Landen, as a wildlife explorer, either documents animal behavior or has a passion for reptiles, but not necessarily both. If Landen protects endangered species, then he can either gain the respect of the indigenous community or earn global recognition, but not both. If Landen loves animals, then he has a passion for reptiles.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Landen contributes to caiman conservation.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Landen does not work with local communities, and he must either work with local communities or venture into remote locations (but not both). Therefore, Landen ventures into remote locations.
- Landen either ventures into remote locations or earns global recognition (but not both). Since he ventures into remote locations, he does not earn global recognition.
- Landen protects endangered species, which implies he either gains respect of the indigenous community or earns global recognition (but not both). Since he does not earn global recognition, he must gain the respect of the indigenous community.
- Landen has a PhD in biology and either documents animal behavior or has experience with wildlife rescue (but not both). Given he has experience with wildlife rescue, he does not document animal behavior.
- As a wildlife explorer, Landen either documents animal behavior or has a passion for reptiles (inclusive). Since he does not document animal behavior, he must have a passion for reptiles.
- If Landen has a passion for reptiles, then he studies caimans. So he studies caimans.
- If Landen studies caimans, then he either gains respect of the indigenous community or contributes to caiman conservation (but not both). Since he already gains the respect of the indigenous community, he does not contribute to caiman conservation.

Therefore, the statement “Landen contributes to caiman conservation” is false.

ANSWER: B

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
