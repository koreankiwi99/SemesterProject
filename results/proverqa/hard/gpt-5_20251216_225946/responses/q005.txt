Question ID: 5
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Lennon has feathers. If Lennon either eats pollen or sips sap (but not both), then he collects nectar. Lennon does not locate food. Lennon does not avoid predators. Any insect that finds shelter either avoids predators or locates food (or both). If Lennon has feathers, then he spreads seeds and flies efficiently. If Lennon hibernates during winter, then he migrates seasonally. Louisa does not avoid predators. Lennon finds shelter or migrates seasonally. If Karim has feathers, then he spreads seeds and flies efficiently. Lennon either collects nectar or spreads seeds, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lennon does not pollinate flowers.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Lennon has feathers" and "If Lennon has feathers, then he spreads seeds and flies efficiently," Lennon spreads seeds (and flies efficiently).
- Given "Lennon either collects nectar or spreads seeds, but not both," and we know he spreads seeds, Lennon does not collect nectar.
- From "Any insect that finds shelter either avoids predators or locates food (or both)" and given Lennon does not avoid predators and does not locate food, Lennon does not find shelter.
- From "Lennon finds shelter or migrates seasonally," and not finds shelter, Lennon migrates seasonally.
- There is no rule linking any of these traits (spreads seeds, migrates, flies efficiently, etc.) to pollinating flowers. No statement implies Lennon pollinates or does not pollinate flowers.

Conclusion: The truth of "Lennon does not pollinate flowers" cannot be determined from the given information.
