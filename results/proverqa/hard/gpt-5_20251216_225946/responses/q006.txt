  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Jimmy values integrity, so he leads his community (and empowers others).
- If he leads his community, then he either champions environmental causes (CEC) or supports human rights (SHR) (or both).
- Jimmy organizes rallies, and if someone supports human rights and organizes rallies, then they inspire others. But Jimmy does not inspire others. Therefore, SHR is false.
- With SHR false and leading his community, he must champion environmental causes (CEC true).
- From “If someone listens actively then they build trust” and “Jimmy does not build trust,” we get that Jimmy does not listen actively (not central to the goal).
- If someone holds conservative beliefs or values tradition, then they are respected. Jimmy is not respected, so he neither holds conservative beliefs nor values tradition. Given the XOR “either conservative or progressive (but not both),” Jimmy must have progressive views (PV).
- From PV, it follows that he either fights for social justice (FJS) or advocates for equality (AE), or both.
- Nothing in the premises rules out FJS or AE. We know CEC is true, but that doesn’t exclude FJS. Therefore, AE cannot be determined to be necessarily true or necessarily false.

Conclusion: Whether Jimmy advocates for equality is uncertain.
