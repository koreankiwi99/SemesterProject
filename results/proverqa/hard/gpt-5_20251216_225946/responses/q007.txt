Question ID: 7
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Wyatt values accuracy or is a perfectionist. Wyatt strives for precision. Anyone who examines data or seeks truth can evaluate evidence. Anyone who concentrates hard or evaluates thoroughly thinks carefully. If Wyatt either seeks patterns or analyzes data (but not both), then he evaluates evidence. If Wyatt acts on instinct, then he is careless. Wyatt does not value accuracy. Chloe values accuracy or is a perfectionist. Wyatt does not attack problems. If Queen either seeks patterns or analyzes data (but not both), then he evaluates evidence. Wyatt does not follow rules. Anyone who attacks problems or considers details thinks carefully. Queen does not attack problems. Wyatt does not analyze data. Wyatt either follows rules or is spontaneous. If someone strives for precision, then they consider details and evaluate evidence. Wyatt seeks patterns. If Wyatt is spontaneous, then he is either impulsive or thinks carefully (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Wyatt is either a perfectionist or careless, but not both.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Wyatt values accuracy or is a perfectionist" and "Wyatt does not value accuracy," it follows that Wyatt is a perfectionist.
- From "Wyatt strives for precision," he considers details and evaluates evidence; by the rule linking considering details to thinking carefully, Wyatt thinks carefully.
- From "Wyatt does not follow rules" and "Wyatt either follows rules or is spontaneous," Wyatt is spontaneous. Then, by the given XOR rule, exactly one of impulsive or thinks carefully holds; since we already have thinks carefully, that is consistent (not impulsive).
- The only path to Wyatt being careless is: if he acts on instinct, then he is careless. There is no information that he acts on instinct, nor any rule connecting spontaneity to acting on instinct. No rule rules out being careless either.

Therefore, Wyatt is definitely a perfectionist, but whether he is careless is undetermined. Hence the statement "Wyatt is either a perfectionist or careless, but not both" is not logically determined.
