Question ID: 8
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Vincent is trustworthy or has expertise. Vincent examines evidence or thinks critically (or both). Hugh examines evidence or thinks critically (or both). If Vincent has expertise, then he works diligently and solves complex cases. Vincent has keen insight. Anyone who evaluates clues or makes connections can think critically. If someone has keen insight, then they analyze data and understand motives. If Vincent follows clues, then he will uncover the truth. If Vincent investigates crime, then he either examines evidence or analyzes data (but not both). Vincent investigates crime. If someone solves complex cases and thinks critically, then they can uncover the truth. If Vincent either identifies patterns or connects clues (but not both), then he is able to analyze data. Vincent did not find justice. If someone uncovers the truth, then they can find justice. Vincent values integrity or is trustworthy. If Vincent is reliable, then he either has expertise or has experience, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Vincent is not skilled.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Vincent has keen insight,” we get: Vincent analyzes data (and understands motives).
- From “Vincent investigates crime” and “if he investigates crime, then either examines evidence or analyzes data (but not both),” and since he analyzes data, it follows he does not examine evidence.
- From “Vincent examines evidence or thinks critically (or both),” and since he does not examine evidence, it follows he thinks critically.
- If Vincent has expertise, then he solves complex cases; with thinking critically, that only gives the ability to uncover the truth, not that he actually does. Nothing here contradicts “Vincent did not find justice,” since the rules only grant abilities (“can”), not outcomes.
- The premise “Vincent is trustworthy or has expertise” does not let us determine whether he has expertise. Hence whether he is “skilled” (most plausibly mapped to having expertise) cannot be determined.

Conclusion: We cannot deduce that Vincent is not skilled; it remains undetermined.
