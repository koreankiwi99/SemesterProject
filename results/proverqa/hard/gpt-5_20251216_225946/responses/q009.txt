==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- David is reliable, so he works well under pressure and has good judgment.
- David either works well under pressure or thinks critically, but not both; since he works well under pressure, he does not think critically.
- David has experience; with not thinking critically, the exclusive-or rule implies he responds effectively.
- David works behind the scene and, by the exclusive-or with assisting people, he does not assist people. From “assists people or provides quality care,” he must provide quality care.

None of the given rules link working well under pressure, responding effectively, or any other established trait of David to “remains calm” or “acts quickly.” No rule implies or denies either property for David.
