Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Muffin is nocturnal.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Muffin enjoys exploring, so by the rule “loves climbing or enjoys exploring → playful,” Muffin is playful.
- Muffin does not have a good memory, and “Muffin either has a good memory or is curious,” so Muffin is curious.
- From “territory → family bonds” and “Muffin has territory,” we would get family bonds, but we are also told “Muffin does not have family bonds,” creating a contradiction. Using contrapositive on the universal rule gives ¬lives-in-groups and ¬territory, which conflicts with “has territory.” This inconsistency does not yield any information about being nocturnal.
- The only rule involving nocturnal is: if Muffin is nocturnal, then she is either social or solitary (but not both). We have no premises that force nocturnal, nor any that rule it out.

Conclusion: The information does not determine whether Muffin is nocturnal.

ANSWER: C
