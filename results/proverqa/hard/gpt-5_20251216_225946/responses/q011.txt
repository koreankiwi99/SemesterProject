Question ID: 11
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Dr. Marlon reads often. Dr. Marlon follows his experience or trusts his instinct. Dr. Marlon does not follow his experience. Dr. Marlon is not analytical. If Dr. Marlon either learns quickly or has good memory, then he is analytical. If Dr. Marlon has good memory, then he is either rational or intuitive, but not both. Dr. Marlon learns quickly if he reads often. If Dr. Marlon values insight, then he both listens carefully and trusts his instinct. Anyone who trusts their instinct is intuitive. Everyone is rational or emotional (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Marlon's patients are emotional.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Dr. Marlon follows his experience or trusts his instinct" and "Dr. Marlon does not follow his experience," it follows that he trusts his instinct.
- Anyone who trusts their instinct is intuitive, so Dr. Marlon is intuitive.
- "Dr. Marlon reads often" and "Dr. Marlon learns quickly if he reads often" imply he learns quickly.
- "If Dr. Marlon either learns quickly or has good memory, then he is analytical," but we are told he is not analytical, creating an inconsistency. Regardless, none of this gives information about his patients.
- The only statement about people generally is "Everyone is rational or emotional (or both)." This applies to patients, giving that they are rational or emotional (or both), but it does not entail that they are emotional specifically.

Conclusion: We cannot determine that Dr. Marlon’s patients are emotional; they could be rational but not emotional.
