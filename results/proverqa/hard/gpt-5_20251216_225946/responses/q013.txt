Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Aubree is innovative.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Aubree explores questions and seeks answers, so she is curious.
- If curious, then either philosophical thinker or pragmatic approach, but not both. Given Aubree has a pragmatic approach, she is not a philosophical thinker.
- Aubree is either a philosophical thinker or an astrophysicist, but not both. Since she is not a philosophical thinker, she is an astrophysicist.
- If astrophysicist, then either a logical analyzer or an outside-the-box thinker, but not both. Given Aubree is a logical analyzer, she is not an outside-the-box thinker.
- Aubree is either an outside-the-box thinker or a conventional thinker. Since she is not outside-the-box, she is a conventional thinker.
- Aubree either follows established rules or is an unconventional thinker, but not both. Given she follows established rules, she is not an unconventional thinker.
- Therefore, Aubree is a conventional thinker and not an unconventional thinker, which satisfies the condition “either a conventional thinker or an unconventional thinker (but not both).” By the given rule, this implies she is innovative.
