Guy is either disciplined or thinks creatively, but not both. If someone either seeks specialized certification or applies for fellowships (but not both), then they pursue alternate credentials. If Marlowe has momentum, then he is either disciplined or sets high goals, but not both. Marlowe works hard. Vanessa does not earn recognition. Marlowe has momentum. If Guy is ambitious and pursues alternate credentials, then he will earn recognition. Marlowe thinks creatively. Anyone who sets high goals or works hard is ambitious.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Marlowe does not have a PhD.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From Marlowe works hard, and "Anyone who sets high goals or works hard is ambitious," we get Ambitious(M).
- Marlowe has momentum, and "If Marlowe has momentum, then he is either disciplined or sets high goals, but not both."
- Also, "Marlowe is either disciplined or thinks creatively, but not both," and Marlowe thinks creatively. Hence Marlowe is not disciplined.
- Therefore, from momentum’s XOR, Marlowe must set high goals.
- With works hard and/or sets high goals, Marlowe is ambitious (already established).
- Given "If Marlowe is ambitious and pursues alternate credentials, then he will earn recognition" and the fact "Marlowe does not earn recognition," it follows that Marlowe does not pursue alternate credentials.
- From "If Marlowe does not have a PhD, then he will pursue alternate credentials," taking the contrapositive: if he does not pursue alternate credentials, then he has a PhD.
- Therefore, Marlowe has a PhD.

Conclusion: The statement "Marlowe does not have a PhD" is false.
