Question ID: 17
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Selah has thecodont teeth, then she is a formidable predator. Selah has a serpent body. If Selah has wings and a serpent body, then she can rule the ocean. If Selah rules the ocean, then she either has sharp claws or thecodont teeth, but not both. For Selah, if she respects nature, then she does not necessarily possess ancient magic, and if she possesses ancient magic, then she does not necessarily respect nature. Selah has a powerful tail. Selah respects nature. Emelia respects nature. Kelly has a serpent body. Kali maintains ecological balance. Selah maintains ecological balance. Any mythical creature that protects the environment is a mythical guardian. If Emelia is a mythical guardian, then she either has sharp claws or a powerful tail, but not both. If Selah maintains ecological balance, then she either is a mythical guardian or possesses ancient magic (or both). Selah has wings. If Selah is a mythical guardian, then she either has sharp claws or a powerful tail, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Selah is not a formidable predator.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Selah has wings and a serpent body, so she can rule the ocean.
- Ruling the ocean implies she has exactly one of sharp claws or thecodont teeth.
- Selah has a powerful tail.
- Selah maintains ecological balance, which implies she is either a mythical guardian or has ancient magic (or both).
- If Selah is a mythical guardian, then (given she has a powerful tail) she cannot have sharp claws. Combined with ruling the ocean (exactly one of sharp claws or thecodont teeth), this forces her to have thecodont teeth, which makes her a formidable predator.
- However, it is not guaranteed that Selah is a mythical guardian; she could instead only have ancient magic. In that case, ruling the ocean still leaves open whether she has sharp claws or thecodont teeth. If she has sharp claws (and not thecodont teeth), we cannot conclude she is a formidable predator.

Conclusion: It is possible Selah is a formidable predator and also possible she is not; thus the statement “Selah is not a formidable predator” is not entailed.
