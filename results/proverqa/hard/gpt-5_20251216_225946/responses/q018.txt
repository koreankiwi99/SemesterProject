Question ID: 18
Difficulty: hard

Context:
For all frogs, they either hunt at night or need high humidity, but not necessarily both. Every frog either survives in water or has adapted to its environment. If Cairo lives in a rainforest, then he either has adapted to his environment or thrives in his ecosystem, but not both. Cairo basks in sunlight. Any frog that needs high humidity or lives among plants can live in a rainforest. Cairo either basks in sunlight or survives in water, but not both. Cairo rests during the day. Every frog either rests during the day or hunts at night, but not necessarily both. Cairo does not live among plants. If Cairo either breathes moist air or has permeable skin (but not both), then he needs high humidity.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cairo thrives in his ecosystem.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Cairo either basks in sunlight or survives in water, but not both" and "Cairo basks in sunlight," it follows that Cairo does not survive in water.
- From "Every frog either survives in water or has adapted to its environment," and since Cairo does not survive in water, Cairo must have adapted to his environment.
- If Cairo lives in a rainforest, then "he either has adapted to his environment or thrives in his ecosystem, but not both." Since he has adapted, if he lives in a rainforest, he does not thrive.
- Do we know that Cairo lives in a rainforest? No. "Any frog that needs high humidity or lives among plants can live in a rainforest" expresses possibility, not actuality. We don’t know that Cairo needs high humidity, and we are told he does not live among plants.
- Therefore, whether Cairo thrives remains undetermined: if he lives in a rainforest, he does not thrive; if he does not, nothing given settles whether he thrives.
