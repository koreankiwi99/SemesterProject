Question ID: 19
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Anyone who explores the world either seeks wisdom or pursues knowledge (or both). Stone does not understand the world. If someone values serenity and finds inner peace, then they can live in harmony. If Stone pursues knowledge, then he understands the world. Stone is spiritual or adventurous (or both). Stone either conserves resources or advances technology, but not both. Stone does not appreciate beauty. If Stone practices mindfulness, then he either seeks balance or values serenity, but not both. Stone seeks balance or lives in harmony. Everyone who respects the environment either conserves resources or protects wildlife (or both). For Stone, valuing serenity and pursuing knowledge are mutually exclusive. Anyone who loves nature and is spiritual can find inner peace. Everyone who either lives in harmony or appreciates beauty is someone who respects their environment. Stone loves nature. Stone does not protect wildlife. Stone advances technology.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Stone is not adventurous.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Stone advances technology and must either conserve resources or advance technology, but not both. Therefore, he does not conserve resources.
- If someone respects the environment, they either conserve resources or protect wildlife. Stone does neither (does not conserve; does not protect wildlife), so he does not respect the environment.
- Anyone who lives in harmony or appreciates beauty respects the environment. Since Stone does not respect the environment, he neither lives in harmony nor appreciates beauty.
- Stone seeks balance or lives in harmony. Since he does not live in harmony, he seeks balance.
- If Stone pursues knowledge, he understands the world. But he does not understand the world, so he does not pursue knowledge.
- Stone is spiritual or adventurous (or both). There is no rule that forces “not adventurous,” nor any rule linking adventurousness to a contradiction with the above facts. He could be spiritual and not adventurous, or adventurous (with or without being spiritual). Both are consistent with all given information.

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Stone is adventurous.
