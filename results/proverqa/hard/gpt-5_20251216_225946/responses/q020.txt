Question ID: 20
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Siena has wings. Siena stays nested. If Siena has wings, then she either flies freely or stays nested, but not both. If Siena has a loud song, then she either has bright plumage or attracts attention (but not both). Any bird that stands out either inspires artists or brings joy. Siena has camouflage plumage. Siena either flies freely or thrives in the forest. Siena has a distinct call. Siena either attracts attention or blends into her environment, but not both. If Siena has bright plumage, then she stands out and sings sweetly. Millie has wings. All basically wild birds fly freely and are adaptable. If Millie has wings, then she either flies freely or stays nested, but not both. If a bird has camouflage plumage, then it blends into its environment. If Angelo has either vibrant feathers or a beautiful song (but not both), then she inspires artists. Every bird that has a distinct call either attracts attention or stands out (or both). Siena does not bring joy.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Siena does not have a beautiful song.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Siena has wings and stays nested. From “wings -> exactly one of flies freely or stays nested,” Siena does not fly freely.
- From “either flies freely or thrives in the forest,” Siena must thrive in the forest.
- Siena has camouflage plumage, so she blends into her environment. From “exactly one of attracts attention or blends,” Siena does not attract attention.
- Siena has a distinct call; “distinct call -> attracts attention or stands out.” Since she does not attract attention, she stands out.
- “Stands out -> inspires artists or brings joy,” and Siena does not bring joy, so she inspires artists.
- None of the rules link Siena to “beautiful song.” The only mention of “beautiful song” concerns Angelo. Even if Siena had bright plumage, it would imply she sings sweetly, but “sings sweetly” is not stated to be the same as “beautiful song.”

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Siena has a beautiful song.
