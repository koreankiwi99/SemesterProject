==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Adeline sets goals" and "If Adeline sets goals, then she will work hard," Adeline works hard.
- Those with influence shape opinions, but Adeline does not shape opinions; thus Adeline does not have influence.
- If Adeline achieves success, then she gains recognition; if she gains recognition, then she has influence. Therefore, if she achieves success, she would shape opinions. Since she does not shape opinions, she does not achieve success.
- Given "Adeline achieves success or has expertise" and she does not achieve success, she must have expertise.
- She both works hard and has expertise. If Adeline were dedicated, she would have expertise or work hard, but not both. Since she has both, she is not dedicated.
- From "Adeline is intelligent or dedicated" and not dedicated, it follows that Adeline is intelligent.
