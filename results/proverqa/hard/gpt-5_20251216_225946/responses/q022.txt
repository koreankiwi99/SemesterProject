Question ID: 22
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Micah either follows his instincts or thinks critically, but not both. Micah survives harsh conditions. Micah values independence. Micah either has formal education or experiences frontier life, but not both. If Micah survives harsh conditions, then he is either able to adapt quickly or think critically (but not both). Micah is resourceful. If Micah learns from experience or adapts quickly, then he is self-taught. Micah does not learn from experience. If Micah values independence, then he lives off the grid and is resourceful. Micah follows his instincts. If Micah lives off the grid, then he either has formal education or is self-taught, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Micah grew up in the wilderness or experienced frontier life (or both), then he developed survival skills.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Micah either follows his instincts or thinks critically, but not both" and "Micah follows his instincts," conclude Micah does not think critically.
- From "If Micah survives harsh conditions, then he is either able to adapt quickly or think critically (but not both)" and he does not think critically, conclude he adapts quickly.
- From "If Micah learns from experience or adapts quickly, then he is self-taught" and he adapts quickly, conclude he is self-taught.
- From "If Micah values independence, then he lives off the grid and is resourceful" and given he values independence, conclude he lives off the grid.
- From "If Micah lives off the grid, then he either has formal education or is self-taught, but not both" and he is self-taught, conclude he does not have formal education.
- From "Micah either has formal education or experiences frontier life, but not both" and he does not have formal education, conclude he experiences frontier life.

Thus, the antecedent of the queried statement ("grew up in the wilderness or experienced frontier life") is true (due to experienced frontier life). However, there is no given rule that links growing up in the wilderness or experiencing frontier life to "developed survival skills," nor do we have any statement directly asserting or denying that he developed survival skills. Therefore, the conditional’s truth cannot be determined from the provided information.
