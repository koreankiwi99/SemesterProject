Question ID: 23
Difficulty: hard

Hallie does not become mainstream. If Hallie either experiments with genres or collaborates with other artists (but not both), then she releases popular music. If Hallie is charismatic, then she creates hit singles. Every musician who is part of a band either writes songs or performs live (or both). Hallie does not experiment with genres. Hallie does not release popular music. If Hallie either plays an instrument or composes music (but not both), then she is part of a band. For every musician, if they are either part of a band or a solo artist (but not both), then they are creative. Hallie has vocal range. If Hallie either creates hit singles or records top tracks (but not both), then she becomes mainstream. Hallie is either a solo artist or produces albums, but not both. Every musician who gains a following either creates hit singles or collaborates with other artists (or both). If Hallie has vocal range and produces albums, then she gains a following. Hallie does not record top tracks. Hallie does not write songs. If Hallie either sells tickets or wins awards (but not both), then she gains a following. Hallie does not perform live.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Hallie is not creative.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From “If XOR(E, C) then releases popular music” and given ¬E and ¬Ppop, we get ¬C (since XOR(E, C) must be false).
- From “If XOR(H, RTT) then mainstream” and given ¬M and ¬RTT, we get ¬H.
- From “gains a following -> (H or C)” and ¬H, ¬C, we get ¬GF.
- From “(VR ∧ Produce) -> GF”, with VR true and ¬GF, we deduce ¬Produce.
- From “XOR(Solo, Produce)” and ¬Produce, we get Solo.
- From “Band -> (WS or PL)” and given ¬WS and ¬PL, we deduce ¬Band.
- From “XOR(Band, Solo) -> Creative” and we have Solo true and ¬Band, the XOR antecedent is true, so Creative is true.

Thus, Hallie is creative. The statement “Hallie is not creative” is false.

ANSWER: B
