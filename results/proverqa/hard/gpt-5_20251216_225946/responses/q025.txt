Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ramon does not become a legend in chess.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Ramon thinks critically" and "Anyone who thinks critically has a strategic mind," Ramon has a strategic mind (SM).
- From "Ramon sets high goals" and "Everyone who sets high goals either dedicates time or practices often," together with "Ramon does not dedicate time," conclude Ramon practices often (PO).
- With SM and "If Ramon has a strategic mind, then he can either win major tournaments or become a legend in chess, but not both," exactly one of W (wins major tournaments) or L (becomes a legend) is true.
- If Ramon studies opponents (SO), then since he practices often, he would win major tournaments (SO ∧ PO ⇒ W), which would make L false. However, we only know "Ramon analyzes games or studies opponents" (AG ∨ SO), so SO is not guaranteed. Thus W is not guaranteed, and L is not guaranteed false.

Therefore, whether Ramon becomes a legend is not determined.

ANSWER: C

Result:

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
