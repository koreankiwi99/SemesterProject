Question ID: 29
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Maxine collaborates with peers or publishes research (or both). Iris values learning or is passionate about research. Iris does not publish research. Iris collaborates with peers or publishes research (or both). Iris does not seek self-improvement. If Iris is passionate about research, then she shares knowledge with others and collaborates with peers. If Daisy is passionate about research, then she shares knowledge with others and collaborates with peers. Iris studies Earth's geological processes. If Iris studies Earth's geological processes, then she can either discover new minerals or contribute to scientific knowledge, but not both. If Iris either contributes to scientific knowledge or pursues academic degrees (but not both), then she advances human understanding. If Iris either solves complex problems or analyzes data (but not both), then she is passionate about research. Iris does not value personal growth. Iris either advances human understanding or shares knowledge with others, but not both. If Iris is curious, then she either advances human understanding or has practical skills (but not both). Iris pursues academic degrees. Flora does not seek self-improvement. If Iris either values learning or seeks self-improvement (but not both), then she values personal growth.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Iris discovers new minerals.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Iris does not seek self-improvement and does not value personal growth. From “If Iris either values learning or seeks self-improvement (but not both), then she values personal growth,” with SSI = false, this reduces to “If Iris values learning, then she values personal growth.” Since she does not value personal growth, Iris does not value learning.
- From “Iris values learning or is passionate about research,” and not valuing learning, Iris must be passionate about research.
- Passionate about research implies she shares knowledge with others. From “Iris either advances human understanding or shares knowledge with others, but not both,” sharing knowledge being true implies advancing human understanding is false.
- Iris pursues academic degrees. From “If Iris either contributes to scientific knowledge or pursues academic degrees (but not both), then she advances human understanding,” with PAD true, this becomes (not CSG) -> AHU. Since AHU is false, we conclude CSG (contribute to scientific knowledge) is true.
- Iris studies Earth's geological processes, and from that “either discover new minerals or contribute to scientific knowledge, but not both.” With contributing to scientific knowledge true, discovering new minerals must be false.

Therefore, the statement “Iris discovers new minerals” is false.

ANSWER: B

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
