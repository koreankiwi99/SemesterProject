Question ID: 30
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Raelynn prioritizes stability. Raelynn does not take risks. Raelynn is curious. If someone either pushes boundaries or works with traditional techniques (but not both), then they are innovative. If Raelynn is innovative or takes risks, then she will achieve success. If Raelynn has a creative vision, then she will either achieve success or build a strong network, but not both. If Raelynn is curious, then she either thinks outside the box or pushes boundaries, but not both. If Major experiments with materials, then she creates innovative products. Raelynn does not think outside the box. Raelynn either experiments with materials or works with traditional techniques, but not both. Major does not take risks. Raelynn either prioritizes stability or can achieve success, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Raelynn creates innovative products.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Raelynn is curious and does not think outside the box, so by the XOR rule (curious -> exactly one of [thinks outside the box, pushes boundaries]), she pushes boundaries.
- Raelynn prioritizes stability. Given the XOR “either prioritizes stability or can achieve success, but not both,” this implies she cannot achieve success.
- From “If Raelynn is innovative or takes risks, then she will achieve success,” and knowing she does not take risks and cannot/will not achieve success, we infer she is not innovative (contrapositive).
- The rule “If someone either pushes boundaries or works with traditional techniques (but not both), then they are innovative” must have a false antecedent for Raelynn (since she’s not innovative). Because she does push boundaries, the XOR being false forces that she also works with traditional techniques.
- From “Raelynn either experiments with materials or works with traditional techniques, but not both,” and knowing she works with traditional techniques, she does not experiment with materials.
- The only given link to “creates innovative products” is specific to Major (if Major experiments with materials, then she creates innovative products). There is no rule connecting Raelynn’s properties to “creates innovative products.”

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Raelynn creates innovative products.
