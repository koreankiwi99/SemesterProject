Question ID: 31
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Frankie does not rest in his burrow. If an armadillo thrives in groups, then it is a social animal. Every armadillo that has unique friends either explores in groups or roams alone (or both). Any armadillo that lacks pack mates or wanders freely can roam alone. If Frankie lives in the desert, then he forms symbiotic relationships with other creatures and has protective instincts. If Frankie either travels with others or forages with family (but not both), then he tends to explore in groups. If Frankie lives in a colony, then he is either a social animal or forms symbiotic relationships with other creatures, but not both. If Frankie is searching for food, he does not necessarily have protective instincts, and vice versa. Armadillos that explore in groups value companionship. If Frankie prefers to spend nights alone and enjoys quiet spaces, then he sleeps soundly. Frankie either has unique friends or prefers to spend nights alone, but not both. Frankie does not value companionship. Any armadillo that coexists with insects or has an adaptive shell can form symbiotic relationships. All armadillos that find shaded areas stay hydrated and sleep soundly. Frankie lives in a colony. All curious armadillos dig complex burrows and have protective instincts. Frankie is searching for food. If Frankie rests in his burrow or sleeps soundly, then he will stay healthy. Frankie does not stay healthy. If Frankie roams alone, then he is not a social animal, and if Frankie is a social animal, then he does not necessarily roam alone. Frankie enjoys quiet spaces.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Frankie lives in the desert.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

1) From "If Frankie rests in his burrow or sleeps soundly, then he will stay healthy" and "Frankie does not stay healthy," we get that Frankie does not sleep soundly (and also does not rest in his burrow).

2) From "If Frankie prefers to spend nights alone and enjoys quiet spaces, then he sleeps soundly," together with "Frankie enjoys quiet spaces" and "Frankie does not sleep soundly," we infer Frankie does not prefer to spend nights alone.

3) From "Frankie either has unique friends or prefers to spend nights alone, but not both," and since he does not prefer nights alone, we conclude Frankie has unique friends.

4) From "Every armadillo that has unique friends either explores in groups or roams alone" and "Armadillos that explore in groups value companionship" with "Frankie does not value companionship," we conclude Frankie does not explore in groups; hence he roams alone.

5) From "If Frankie roams alone, then he is not a social animal," we get that Frankie is not a social animal.

6) From "Frankie lives in a colony" and "If Frankie lives in a colony, then he is either a social animal or forms symbiotic relationships, but not both," we deduce Frankie forms symbiotic relationships (since he is not social).

7) From "Frankie is searching for food" and "If Frankie is searching for food, he does not have protective instincts (and vice versa)," we conclude Frankie does not have protective instincts.

8) If Frankie lived in the desert, then he would both form symbiotic relationships and have protective instincts. But we have established he does not have protective instincts. Therefore, Frankie does not live in the desert.

ANSWER: B
