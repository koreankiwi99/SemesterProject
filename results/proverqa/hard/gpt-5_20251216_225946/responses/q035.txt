Question ID: 35
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Dean does not mentor students. Dean contributes to society. If Dean makes an impact and has expertise, then he receives awards. Dean is not an active volunteer. If Dean is either an expert ornithologist or a passionate conservationist (but not both), then he is a respected scientist. Dean either holds degrees or receives awards. If Dean either mentors students or inspires others (but not both), then he makes an impact. If Dean contributes to society, then he either receives awards or gains recognition (but not both). Dean either has expertise or works hard. Dean gains recognition. Dean does not publish research. Anyone who publishes research or is a respected scientist can inspire others. Dean does not work hard. If Dean is a passionate conservationist, then he is both an active volunteer and public speaker.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dean is not an expert ornithologist.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From contributes (C) and gains recognition (G) with C -> (A xor G), A (awards) must be false.
- From (D or A) and ¬A, D (holds degrees) is true.
- From (E or H) and ¬H, E (has expertise) is true.
- From (I ∧ E) -> A, with E true and ¬A, conclude ¬I (does not make an impact).
- From (M xor S) -> I and ¬I, we get ¬(M xor S). Given ¬M, this implies ¬S (does not inspire others).
- From (PR ∨ R) -> S and ¬S, infer ¬PR and ¬R (not a respected scientist).
- From P -> (V ∧ PS) and ¬V, conclude ¬P (not a passionate conservationist).
- From (O xor P) -> R and ¬R, we get ¬(O xor P). With ¬P, this forces ¬O.

Therefore, Dean is not an expert ornithologist.
