Question ID: 36
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Murphy either writes efficient code or designs intuitive interfaces (but not both), then he is a good software developer. Murphy reads technical books. If Murphy is passionate about coding, then he is a good software developer and enjoys problem solving. Anyone who reads technical books and participates in hackathons is dedicated to learning. If Murphy is dedicated to learning, then he will build innovative products. Murphy joins online forums. For Murphy, either networking with peers or attending tech conferences (but not both) are ways to advance in his career. Murphy networks with his peers. Murphy enjoys problem solving. If Murphy builds innovative products, then he either values user feedback or is passionate about coding (or both). If Murphy either attends tech conferences or joins online forums (but not both), then he participates in hackathons. Murphy either codes regularly or attends tech conferences. Murphy does not value user feedback. If Murphy engages in self-study, then he either participates in hackathons or contributes to open source projects (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Murphy creates fast software.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “either networking with peers or attending tech conferences (but not both)” and “Murphy networks with his peers,” conclude he does not attend tech conferences.
- Given he joins online forums and does not attend tech conferences, the exclusive-or condition for “attends tech conferences or joins online forums (but not both)” holds, so he participates in hackathons.
- He reads technical books and participates in hackathons, so he is dedicated to learning.
- If dedicated to learning, then he will build innovative products.
- If he builds innovative products, then he either values user feedback or is passionate about coding. Since he does not value user feedback, he must be passionate about coding.
- If passionate about coding, then he is a good software developer and enjoys problem solving (the latter is also given).
- None of the given facts establish that he writes efficient code, and “creates fast software” is not entailed by any stated condition. The only mention of efficient code appears in a one-way implication toward being a good developer; we cannot infer efficient code from him being a good developer.

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Murphy creates fast software.
