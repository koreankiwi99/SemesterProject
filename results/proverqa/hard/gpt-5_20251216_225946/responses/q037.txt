Question ID: 37
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Buster does not respond to calls. All dogs that listen to commands and behave properly are well-trained. Buster is either obedient or playful, but not necessarily both. Buster follows routines. Buster is either playful or loving (or both). If Buster either responds to calls or follows routines (but not both), then he listens to commands. All well-trained dogs are obedient and have good manners. Buster behaves properly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Buster is loving.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Buster does not respond to calls (not R) and follows routines (F). Since exactly one of R or F is true, the exclusive-or condition holds, so Buster listens to commands (L).
- Buster behaves properly (P). Thus, L and P imply Buster is well-trained (W).
- All well-trained dogs are obedient and have good manners, so Buster is obedient (O).
- We know Buster is either playful or loving (Pl ∨ Lv). Nothing provided rules out playful, and being obedient does not exclude playful. We cannot deduce not playful, nor can we deduce loving directly.
- Therefore, whether Buster is loving cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: C

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
