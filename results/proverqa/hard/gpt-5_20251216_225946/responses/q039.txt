Question ID: 39
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If someone follows clues and reveals evidence, then they can solve cases. If Esther either studies witness statements or analyzes forensic data, then she will crack the case. Esther does not crack the case. Norah either examines crime scenes or gathers evidence (or both). Esther either examines crime scenes or gathers evidence (or both). Esther does not solve cases. If Esther searches for clues or looks for patterns, then she will examine crime scenes. If Dax investigates carefully, then she will reveal evidence. Esther does not study witness statements. If Norah investigates carefully, then she will uncover the truth. If Esther investigates carefully, then she will reveal evidence. Esther reads reports or analyzes forensic data. If Esther either examines crime scenes or analyzes forensic data (but not both), then she follows clues. Esther does not gather evidence.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Esther did not uncover the truth.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Esther either examines crime scenes or gathers evidence” and “Esther does not gather evidence,” we get: Esther examines crime scenes.
- From “If Esther studies witness statements or analyzes forensic data, then she will crack the case,” together with “Esther does not crack the case” and “Esther does not study witness statements,” we deduce Esther does not analyze forensic data. Then from “Esther reads reports or analyzes forensic data,” we get: Esther reads reports.
- With examines crime scenes true and analyzes forensic data false, the exclusive-or condition implies: Esther follows clues.
- From “If someone follows clues and reveals evidence, then they can solve cases,” together with “Esther does not solve cases” and “Esther follows clues,” we infer: Esther does not reveal evidence.
- From “If Esther investigates carefully, then she will reveal evidence” and “Esther does not reveal evidence,” we infer: Esther does not investigate carefully.

There is no rule connecting Esther’s actions to “uncover the truth.” The only UT rule given is specific to Norah. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Esther uncovered the truth or not.
