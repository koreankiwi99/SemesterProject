==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Alliebear participates in conferences” and “either participates in conferences or delivers lectures, but not both,” she does not deliver lectures.
- From “Alliebear pursues a PhD” and “either gains acclaim or pursues a PhD, but not both,” she does not gain acclaim.
- From “If Alliebear either receives awards or delivers lectures (but not both), then she gains acclaim” and not delivering lectures, we get: if she receives awards then she gains acclaim. Since she does not gain acclaim, she does not receive awards.
- Given “Alliebear does not publish papers” and “If Alliebear earns recognition, then she either publishes papers or receives awards (or both),” but both publishing papers and receiving awards are false, she does not earn recognition.
- If Alliebear were a dedicated scientist, then she would produce innovative research and earn recognition. Since she does not earn recognition, she is not a dedicated scientist.

ANSWER: B
