Question ID: 44
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Oscar is either resilient in adversity or avoids risks, but not both. Leroy does not seek community help. Leroy is unable to overcome challenges. Kailani faces setbacks. If Oscar faces setbacks, then she either acts on impulse or finds new solutions (or both). If Genevieve is an entrepreneur, then she is either someone who avoids risks or seeks new opportunities, but not both. Genevieve is a creative problem solver. Kailani either acts on impulse or thinks ahead, but not both. Genevieve does not make safe investments. Genevieve is unable to overcome challenges. Genevieve is either resilient in adversity or avoids risks, but not both. If Genevieve faces setbacks, then she either acts on impulse or finds new solutions (or both). If Genevieve either makes safe investments or has backup plans (but not both), then she avoids risks. Genevieve either acts on impulse or thinks ahead, but not both. Anyone who thinks ahead or anticipates problems has backup plans. If Kailani is a creative problem solver, then she has a strong work ethic and is a successful business owner. Genevieve does not seek community help. All experienced individuals think ahead and make strategic decisions. Genevieve faces setbacks. Kailani anticipates problems. Everyone who either seeks community help or finds new solutions is able to overcome challenges. For all humans, if they take calculated risks, then they have backup plans and learn from mistakes. Oscar does not make safe investments. If Genevieve is a creative problem solver, then she has a strong work ethic and is a successful business owner. Genevieve anticipates problems. If Kailani either makes safe investments or has backup plans (but not both), then she avoids risks.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Genevieve is passionate about baking.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Genevieve faces setbacks. By the rule, she either acts on impulse or finds new solutions.
- Anyone who seeks community help or finds new solutions is able to overcome challenges. Genevieve is unable to overcome challenges, so she does not find new solutions (and indeed does not seek community help).
- Therefore, from the earlier disjunction, Genevieve acts on impulse.
- Given she acts on impulse and the XOR with thinking ahead, she does not think ahead.
- She anticipates problems; anyone who thinks ahead or anticipates problems has backup plans. So she has backup plans.
- She does not make safe investments. The XOR condition (safe investments or backup plans, but not both) holds, so she avoids risks.
- From “resilient in adversity XOR avoids risks,” avoiding risks implies she is not resilient in adversity.
- As a creative problem solver, she has a strong work ethic and is a successful business owner.
- None of the given facts or rules mention or imply anything about being passionate about baking.

Conclusion: The statement about baking is not derivable nor contradicted by the information.
