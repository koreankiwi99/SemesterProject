==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Memphis values independence and embraces spontaneity. If he had a free spirit, he would have exactly one of these, not both. Since he has both, Memphis does not have a free spirit.
- Anyone adventurous or who loves uncertainty takes risks. Memphis does not take risks, so he is neither adventurous nor does he love uncertainty.
- Anyone who explores widely or has many homes is adventurous. Since Memphis is not adventurous, he does not have many homes (and does not explore widely).
- If Memphis had many homes XOR traveled frequently, he would have a free spirit. Since he does not have a free spirit, not(many homes XOR travels frequently). With not many homes, this implies he does not travel frequently.
- Memphis is either a settled artist or travels frequently. Since he does not travel frequently, he is a settled artist.
- Memphis is either a nomadic artist or a settled artist, but not both. Since he is a settled artist, he is not a nomadic artist.

Conclusion: The statement "Memphis is a nomadic artist" is false.
