Question ID: 47
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Major does not dress elegantly. Major trains regularly. Major is not highly educated. Major is a famous figure. If Major has sympathy for others and is successful, then he supports charity. If Major is well-connected, then he is wealthy and an influential person. Major speaks well. If Major trains regularly and is a formidable opponent, then he can win championships. For Major, having wealth and supporting charity are mutually exclusive, but not necessarily exhaustive. Major has loyal fans. If someone has discipline and natural talent, then they can win championships. Anyone who speaks well or dresses elegantly can have high social status. If Major has natural talent, then he has high social status and works hard. Everyone who is a famous figure is either a respected leader or an influential person (or both). Major is not a popular figure. If Major has high social status, then he is either well-connected or highly educated (but not both). If Major wins championships, then he either supports charity or is a popular figure (or both). If Major is a skilled boxer, then he is a formidable opponent and has loyal fans. Major is not a respected leader.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Major is not a skilled boxer.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Major speaks well, and anyone who speaks well or dresses elegantly can have high social status. Therefore, Major has high social status.
2) If Major has high social status, then he is either well-connected or highly educated, but not both. Given Major is not highly educated, he must be well-connected.
3) If Major is well-connected, then he is wealthy and influential. Hence, Major is wealthy.
4) Wealth and supporting charity are mutually exclusive for Major, so Major does not support charity.
5) If Major wins championships, then he either supports charity or is a popular figure. Since Major is neither (not charitable, not popular), he cannot win championships.
6) If Major trains regularly and is a formidable opponent, then he can win championships. Major does train regularly, so since he cannot win championships, he is not a formidable opponent.
7) If Major is a skilled boxer, then he is a formidable opponent and has loyal fans. Since he is not a formidable opponent, he cannot be a skilled boxer.

Therefore, the statement "Major is not a skilled boxer" is true.
