Question ID: 48
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Orlando either reads widely or pursues knowledge (but not both), then he makes new connections. Orlando pursues knowledge or conducts meaningful research. Orlando does not advance industries. Everyone learns from others or pursues knowledge. Orlando develops new technologies. If Orlando works in a team, then he is either collaborative or follows instructions (but not both). Orlando does not achieve success. Orlando does not have an open mind. If Orlando is collaborative or has an open mind, then he can achieve success. Anyone who makes breakthrough discoveries either gains recognition or advances industries (or both). If Orlando makes new connections, then he is collaborative and thinks creatively. Orlando does not read widely. Orlando does not gain recognition. Anyone who conducts meaningful research or develops new technologies can improve people's lives. If someone sets clear goals and works with focus, then they can conduct meaningful research.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Orlando is an innovative scientist.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From (Collaborative or Open-mind) -> Achieve success, and given Orlando does not achieve success and does not have an open mind, we infer Orlando is not collaborative.
- From (Makes new connections) -> Collaborative, we infer Orlando does not make new connections.
- From (Reads widely XOR Pursues knowledge) -> Makes new connections and not making new connections plus not reading widely implies he does not pursue knowledge.
- From (Pursues knowledge or Conducts meaningful research) and not pursuing knowledge, we infer he conducts meaningful research.
- He also develops new technologies, and thus can improve people’s lives.
- From (Breakthrough discoveries) -> (Gains recognition or Advances industries) and given he gains no recognition and does not advance industries, we infer he does not make breakthrough discoveries.

No statement defines “innovative scientist” or equates it with any derived properties. Therefore, the truth of “Orlando is an innovative scientist” cannot be determined from the given information.
