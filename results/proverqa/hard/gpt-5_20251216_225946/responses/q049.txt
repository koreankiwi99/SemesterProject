Question ID: 49
Difficulty: hard

Context:
For Juliet, she either speaks directly or has empathy, but not necessarily both. Juliet does not speak directly. If someone connects with nature and prioritizes self-care, then they feel more centered. Juliet connects with nature. If Juliet feels more optimistic, then she will inspire others. Juliet offers guidance. Juliet cannot build strong relationships. Juliet prioritizes self-care. If Juliet spreads positivity, then she either inspires others or helps others heal, but not both. If Juliet either listens actively or offers guidance (but not both), then she helps others heal. Anyone who feels more confident or practices mindfulness can feel more optimistic. If someone has empathy and listens actively, then they can build strong relationships. If Juliet reads daily affirmations, then she feels more confident. Juliet spreads positivity.

Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Juliet reads daily affirmations.

  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "either speaks directly or has empathy" and "Juliet does not speak directly," we get: Juliet has empathy.
- From "has empathy and listens actively → build strong relationships" and "cannot build strong relationships," we infer Juliet does not listen actively.
- Given "offers guidance" and "listens actively or offers guidance (but not both) → helps others heal," with not listening actively, the XOR condition holds, so Juliet helps others heal.
- From "spreads positivity → inspires others XOR helps others heal" and helps others heal, we conclude she does not inspire others.
- From "feels more optimistic → inspire others" and not inspiring others, we infer she is not more optimistic.
- From "feels more confident or practices mindfulness → feels more optimistic" and not more optimistic, we infer she is neither more confident nor practicing mindfulness.
- From "reads daily affirmations → feels more confident" and not more confident, we infer she does not read daily affirmations.
