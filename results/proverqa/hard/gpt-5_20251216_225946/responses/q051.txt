Question ID: 51
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Makenzie either maps landforms or explores wilderness (but not both), then she seeks adventure. Makenzie cannot uncover secrets. Makenzie does not further her understanding. Makenzie does not contribute to science. Makenzie either explores wilderness or analyzes rocks, but not both. If Makenzie either collects fossil samples or advances knowledge (but not both), then she contributes to science. Anyone who loves nature and enjoys fieldwork can study geology. Anyone who charts new terrain or maps landforms can uncover secrets. If someone either collects fossil samples or analyzes rocks (but not both), then they further understanding. Makenzie does not chart new terrain. Makenzie does not seek adventure. Makenzie enjoys fieldwork. Makenzie loves nature.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Makenzie studies geology, then she can either make groundbreaking discoveries or inspire scientists, but not both.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Loves nature and enjoys fieldwork ⇒ studies geology (SG).
- Not seeking adventure plus “if maps landforms (ML) xor explores wilderness (EW) then seeks adventure” ⇒ not (ML xor EW).
- Not uncovering secrets and “if charts new terrain (CNT) or ML then uncover secrets,” with not CNT given ⇒ not ML.
- From not (ML xor EW) and not ML ⇒ EW is also false.
- From “EW xor analyzes rocks (AR)” and EW false ⇒ AR true.
- Not further understanding (FU) and “if collects fossil samples (CFS) xor AR then FU” ⇒ not (CFS xor AR). With AR true ⇒ CFS true.
- Not contributing to science (CS) and “if CFS xor advances knowledge (AK) then CS” ⇒ not (CFS xor AK). With CFS true ⇒ AK true.

None of these facts relate to “making groundbreaking discoveries” or “inspiring scientists.” Since SG is true, the conditional “If SG then (GBD xor ISc)” would require knowing that exactly one of those holds, which we cannot determine.

ANSWER: C

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
