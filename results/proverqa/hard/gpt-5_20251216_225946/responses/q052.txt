- If Norah is a thrill seeker, then she leads private expeditions. Given the XOR between leading private expeditions and being a professional guide, Norah is not a professional guide.
- Given the XOR between being a professional guide and being a novice adventurer, Norah is a novice adventurer.
- Given the XOR between being a novice adventurer and being an experienced climber, Norah is not an experienced climber.
- Given the XOR between being an experienced climber and an inexperienced climber, Norah must be an inexperienced climber.

Therefore, the statement "Norah is not an inexperienced climber" is false.
