Question ID: 53
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Ares is a champion. If Ares has noble bloodlines, then he either has an attractive appearance or excellent jumping skills (or both). If Ares is confident, then he either performs well in competitions or builds strong bonds with Rachel, but not both. If a horse has noble bloodlines, it is not necessarily confident, and if a horse is confident, it does not necessarily have noble bloodlines. Ares either has speed or agility, but not both. If Ares either has a shiny coat or a flowing mane (but not both), then he has an attractive appearance. Ares has a good temper. Ares does not have excellent jumping skills. If Ares is a champion, then he either has an attractive appearance or has speed (but not both). Ares responds to commands. If Ares builds strong bonds with Rachel, then he either has a good temper or responds to commands, but not both. Ares does not have agility.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ares performs well in competitions.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Ares does not have agility, and he has either speed or agility but not both. Therefore, Ares has speed.
- If Ares is a champion, then he has either an attractive appearance or speed, but not both. Since he has speed, he does not have an attractive appearance.
- If Ares has noble bloodlines, then he has either an attractive appearance or excellent jumping skills. But Ares has neither (not attractive, and does not have excellent jumping skills). Thus, he does not have noble bloodlines.
- Ares has a good temper and responds to commands. If he builds strong bonds with Rachel, then exactly one of good temper or responds to commands holds, which is false since both are true. Hence, he does not build strong bonds with Rachel.
- If Ares is confident, then exactly one of performs well or builds strong bonds holds. Since he does not build strong bonds, if he were confident, he would perform well. However, we have no information that he is (or is not) confident.

Conclusion: Whether Ares performs well in competitions cannot be determined.
