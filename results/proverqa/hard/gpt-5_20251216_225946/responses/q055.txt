  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “either builds lasting connections or values loneliness, but not both” and “Wyatt values loneliness,” we get: Wyatt does not build lasting connections.
- From “open-minded or follows a routine, but not both” and “Wyatt does not follow a routine,” we get: Wyatt is open-minded.
- From “appreciates moments or tries new things, but not both” and “Wyatt does not appreciate moments,” we get: Wyatt tries new things.
- From “travels frequently → (tries new things XOR explores new places)” and “Wyatt travels frequently” plus “tries new things,” we get: Wyatt does not explore new places.
- From “if Wyatt takes risks → achieves success” and “achieves success → (pursues passion or builds lasting connections)” together with “Wyatt does not pursue his passion” and “Wyatt does not build lasting connections,” it follows that Wyatt cannot take risks (otherwise contradiction). So Wyatt does not take risks.
- From “adventurous → (takes risks or explores new places)” and knowing Wyatt neither takes risks nor explores new places, we conclude Wyatt is not adventurous.
- From “enjoys uncertainty → adventurous,” we infer Wyatt does not enjoy uncertainty.

The statement asks about “Wyatt’s relationship is not spontaneous.” The notion of “spontaneous” (or “relationship is spontaneous/not spontaneous”) is never defined in the premises, and there is no explicit link from any derived trait (like not enjoying uncertainty or not being adventurous) to “relationship is not spontaneous.” Therefore, its truth value cannot be determined from the given information.
