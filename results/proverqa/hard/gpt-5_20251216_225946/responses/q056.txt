- If DedicatesFaith then Monk, so Monk is true.
- If Monk then (LivesOffLand XOR LivesSimply).
- Not FarmsOwnFood and (FarmsOwnFood OR LivesOffLand) implies LivesOffLand is true.
- From XOR, LivesSimply must be false.
- (LivesSimply OR Harmonious) with LivesSimply false implies Harmonious is true.
- (Harmonious XOR Disruptive) with Harmonious true implies Disruptive is false.
