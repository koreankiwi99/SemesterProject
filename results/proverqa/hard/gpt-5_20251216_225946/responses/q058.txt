Question ID: 58
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Marie pursues higher education. Marie builds consensus. If Marie promotes peace, then she will either face resistance or inspire others, but not both. Anyone who leads by example either inspires others or empowers the youth. Marie takes a risk. If Marie takes a risk, then she will either spark controversy or promote peace, but not both. For anyone, sparking controversy and building consensus are mutually exclusive. Marie either empowers the youth or pursues higher education, but not both. Marie works independently. Marie challenges the status quo. If Marie either challenges the status quo or fosters community (but not both), then she leads by example. Marie either works independently or fosters community, but not both. If someone believes in non-violence and engages in dialogue, then they promote peace.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Marie faces resistance.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Marie pursues higher education (H). From "Marie either empowers the youth or pursues higher education, but not both," we get E is false.
- Marie takes a risk (T). From "If Marie takes a risk, then she will either spark controversy or promote peace, but not both," we get S XOR P.
- Marie builds consensus (C). Since sparking controversy and building consensus are mutually exclusive, S is false. Hence from S XOR P, P is true.
- From "If Marie promotes peace, then she will either face resistance or inspire others, but not both," we have R XOR I.
- Marie works independently (W) and "either works independently or fosters community, but not both," so F is false.
- Marie challenges the status quo (Q). Since Q XOR F is true, "then she leads by example" gives L true.
- From "Anyone who leads by example either inspires others or empowers the youth," L implies I ∨ E. With E false, I is true.
- With I true and R XOR I, R must be false.

Therefore, "Marie faces resistance" is false.
