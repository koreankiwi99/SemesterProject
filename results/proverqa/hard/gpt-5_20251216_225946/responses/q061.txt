Question ID: 61
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Goldie is artistic, then she either writes stories or creates poetry (or both). Anyone who draws well or has good taste is artistic. Goldie is a charismatic performer. If someone is inspiring, then they either have a good imagination or have creativity (but both is allowed in the input logic expression). For all people, if someone is a charismatic performer, then they either have creativity or have irrepressible energy (or both). Goldie has good taste. For a person, being a good communicator and expressing themselves effectively can make them inspiring. Goldie does not create poetry. If someone either writes stories or composes music (but not both), then they have a good imagination. Goldie is passionate. Goldie does not compose music. If someone is passionate, then they are inspiring and think outside the box.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Goldie does not have irrepressible energy.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Goldie has good taste, so she is artistic. From “If Goldie is artistic, then she either writes stories or creates poetry (or both)” and “Goldie does not create poetry,” we conclude Goldie writes stories.
- Goldie does not compose music. Given “If someone either writes stories or composes music (but not both), then they have a good imagination,” Goldie has a good imagination.
- Goldie is passionate, so she is inspiring. From “If someone is inspiring, then they either have a good imagination or have creativity,” this is satisfied by her good imagination; it does not force creativity.
- Goldie is a charismatic performer. From “If someone is a charismatic performer, then they either have creativity or have irrepressible energy (or both),” Goldie has at least one of creativity or irrepressible energy. Nothing rules out irrepressible energy, and nothing forces creativity alone.

Therefore, whether Goldie lacks irrepressible energy cannot be determined.
