Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Alice inspires others.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Alice does not exemplify integrity and (Selfless XOR Help) -> Integrity, we get not(Selfless XOR Help). Given Alice does not help others, this implies Alice is not selfless.
- If Alice receives high honor then she is selfless and brave; since she is not selfless, she does not receive high honor. Also, if Alice displays courage then she receives high honor; since she does not receive high honor, she does not display courage.
- If Alice is a war hero, then she either receives high honor or inspires others. Since she does not receive high honor, being a war hero would imply she inspires others.
- However, we cannot deduce whether Alice is a war hero. We also cannot establish that she inspires others by any other rule. “Alice serves her country or is a war hero” and other facts do not force war-hero status.

Therefore, whether Alice inspires others cannot be determined.

ANSWER: C
