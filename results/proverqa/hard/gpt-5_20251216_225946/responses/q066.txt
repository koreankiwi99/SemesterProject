==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Amirah is a food blogger and does not host cooking shows, so she develops new recipes.
- She does not teach classes; thus (teach XOR develop) holds, so she writes cookbooks.
- Given (writes cookbooks XOR works as a chef), she does not work as a chef.
- She enjoys experimenting with food ⇒ she is a talented cook ⇒ (works as a chef XOR runs a restaurant). Since she doesn’t work as a chef, she runs a restaurant.
- If she runs a restaurant and is a successful chef, then she receives awards. But she does not receive awards, so she is not a successful chef.
- She is not passionate about cooking. The rule “if (passionate XOR skilled) then successful chef” reduces to “if skilled then successful chef.” Since she is not a successful chef, it follows she is not skilled.

ANSWER: B

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
