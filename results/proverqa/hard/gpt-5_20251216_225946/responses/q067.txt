Question ID: 67
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Ayan renounces violence, then he desires forgiveness and seeks redemption. Koen either seeks redemption or fights oppression, but not both. Ayan is either capable of violence or has compassion, but not both. Brooks has power. Brooks has influence. For all people, if they have influence and fight oppression, then they uphold justice. For Ayan, either embracing peace is an option or seeking redemption is an option, but they can't coexist. Ayan has power. If Rosalie is either murderous or protective (but not both), then he is notorious. Koen is not protective. Ayan either seeks redemption or fights oppression, but not both. Koen is either capable of taking lives or has compassion, but not both. Ayan has influence. Ayan is embracing peace. If Ayan has power, then he is either capable of taking lives or upholds justice, but not both. If Ayan lacks empathy or has aggression, then he can be murderous. Ayan is either capable of taking lives or has compassion, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ayan is not notorious.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Ayan is embracing peace, and for Ayan, embracing peace XOR seeking redemption holds. Thus, Ayan does not seek redemption.
- Ayan either seeks redemption or fights oppression, but not both. Since he does not seek redemption, he fights oppression.
- Ayan has influence. For all people, if they have influence and fight oppression, they uphold justice. Therefore, Ayan upholds justice.
- Ayan has power, and if Ayan has power, then he is either capable of taking lives or upholds justice, but not both. Since he upholds justice, he is not capable of taking lives.
- From Ayan either capable of taking lives or has compassion (but not both), he thus has compassion. From Ayan either capable of violence or has compassion (but not both), he is not capable of violence.
- The only statement about notoriety concerns Rosalie: if Rosalie is murderous XOR protective, then Rosalie is notorious. There is no rule linking Ayan’s properties to being notorious or not notorious.

Conclusion: We cannot determine Ayan’s notoriety from the given information.
