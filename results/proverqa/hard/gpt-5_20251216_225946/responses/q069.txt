Step-by-step reasoning:
- Drew needs external help, and for Drew it's either external help or self-sufficient (but not both). Therefore, Drew is not self-sufficient.
- Drew has healthcare coverage, which implies he is either self-sufficient or requires medication (but not both). Since he is not self-sufficient, he requires medication.
- If Drew requires medication, then he either has a strong support system or a chronic illness (but not both). Given he has a strong support system, he does not have a chronic illness.
- Drew faces health challenges, which implies he remains optimistic and takes personal responsibility.
