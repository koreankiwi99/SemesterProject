Question ID: 71
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Westyn either has a stable weight or has a weak immune system, but not both. Scott is healthy. If Scott ages gracefully, then he is either healthy or has a weak immune system, but not both. If Scott has a genetic mutation, then he either has high adaptability or is more resilient (but not both). Bryant does not have a rare trait. Bryant is more resilient. Scott does not develop slowly. If someone either has a rare trait or a unique genetic profile, then they are genetically diverse. If Bryant ages gracefully, then he is either healthy or has a weak immune system, but not both. If Reign has a genetic mutation, then he either has high adaptability or is more resilient (but not both). Bryant does not develop slowly. Scott does not have a stable weight. Scott either ages gracefully or has complex DNA, but not both. Anyone who has complex DNA and is genetically diverse develops slowly. Scott either has a stable weight or has a weak immune system, but not both. Bryant thrives under pressure. If Reign either has a genetic mutation or a chromosomal abnormality (but not both), then he has a unique genetic profile. If Scott lives a healthy lifestyle, then he will age gracefully. Scott thrives under pressure. If Scott either has a genetic mutation or a chromosomal abnormality (but not both), then he has a unique genetic profile. Scott is more resilient. Scott either stays fit or has a weak immune system. Scott does not have a rare trait. If Scott experiences environmental stress, then he either has high adaptability or has strong coping mechanisms (but not both). Reign either ages gracefully or has complex DNA, but not both. Anyone who thrives under pressure has high adaptability.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Scott has a chromosomal abnormality.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Scott is healthy. Scott does not have a stable weight, and SW xor WIS implies Scott has a weak immune system.
- If Scott aged gracefully, then H xor WIS would have to hold; but H and WIS are both true, so AG must be false. From AG xor CDNA, Scott has complex DNA.
- Scott thrives under pressure, so he has high adaptability. Given he’s also more resilient, both HA and MR are true. Therefore, from GM -> (HA xor MR), Scott cannot have a genetic mutation (GM is false).
- Anyone with complex DNA and genetically diverse develops slowly. Scott does not develop slowly, so he is not genetically diverse.
- If someone has a rare trait or a unique genetic profile, they are genetically diverse. Scott does not have a rare trait; since he’s not genetically diverse, he also does not have a unique genetic profile.
- If Scott has (GM xor CA), then he has a unique genetic profile. But UP is false and GM is false, so CA must also be false.

Conclusion: Scott does not have a chromosomal abnormality.

ANSWER: B

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
