Question ID: 72
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Bennett optimizes systems, then he either advances artificial intelligence or enhances computing capabilities, but not both. If someone improves software, then they enhance computing capabilities. Bennett studies multiprocessing. If Bennett studies multiprocessing, then he either develops efficient operating systems or pioneers breakthrough technologies, but not both. If Francesca studies multiprocessing, then he either develops efficient operating systems or pioneers breakthrough technologies, but not both. Bennett does not think critically. If Bennett collaborates with experts, then he either solves complex problems or creates novel solutions (but not both). Anyone who understands algorithms and designs system architecture can develop efficient operating systems. Bennett analyzes data. If Bennett either solves complex problems or analyzes data (but not both), then he thinks critically. If Bennett can solve complex problems, then he leads innovative projects and optimizes systems. Bennett either develops efficient operating systems or improves software. Bennett advances artificial intelligence. If Francesca can solve complex problems, then he leads innovative projects and optimizes systems.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Bennett pioneers breakthrough technologies.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Bennett analyzes data and does not think critically. Since XOR(solves complex problems, analyzes data) → thinks critically, and thinks critically is false, with analyzes data true, it follows that Bennett also solves complex problems.
- Solving complex problems implies Bennett optimizes systems.
- If he optimizes systems, then exactly one of (advances AI, enhances computing capabilities) is true. Given Bennett advances AI, he does not enhance computing capabilities.
- Improving software implies enhancing computing capabilities. Since he does not enhance computing capabilities, he does not improve software.
- Bennett either develops efficient operating systems or improves software. Since he does not improve software, he develops efficient operating systems.
- Studying multiprocessing implies exactly one of (develops efficient operating systems, pioneers breakthrough technologies). Since he develops efficient operating systems, he does not pioneer breakthrough technologies.

ANSWER: B

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
