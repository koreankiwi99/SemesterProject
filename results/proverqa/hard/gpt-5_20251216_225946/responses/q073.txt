Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- If Lovie fosters peace, then she heals her community, and healing implies earning respect. Since Lovie does not earn respect, she cannot foster peace.
- If someone values tolerance, then they foster peace. By contrapositive, since Lovie does not foster peace, she does not value tolerance.
- Lovie defends minorities. The rule says: if exactly one of (defends minorities, supports human rights) holds, then she advocates for freedom. Lovie does not advocate for freedom, so the “exactly one” condition must be false. Given she does defend minorities, this means she also supports human rights.
- The rule “if someone opposes extremism or values tolerance, then they promote social justice” does not allow us to infer opposing extremism from anything we have. We only know Lovie does not value tolerance; opposing extremism remains undetermined. No other rule links our derived facts to opposing extremism.

Conclusion: Whether Lovie opposes extremism cannot be determined.
