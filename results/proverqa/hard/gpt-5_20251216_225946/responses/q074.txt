Question ID: 74
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Twinkle is either agile or achieves high jumps, but not necessarily both. Twinkle follows rules. If a horse is patient and respects its rider, then it can stand still. If Twinkle performs dressage, then she is either disciplined or has good posture (but not both). If Twinkle is strong, then she is either agile or trustworthy (but not both). Twinkle has strength. Twinkle remains calm. Twinkle does not achieve high jumps. Twinkle either obeys commands or is disciplined. All horses that have good manners either obey commands or follow rules. Twinkle has good manners. If Twinkle has good reflexes, then she is either agile or has endurance (but not both). If Twinkle is disciplined, then she either remains calm or stands still (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Twinkle is well-trained or trustworthy, then she is useful for dressage.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Twinkle is either agile or achieves high jumps (not necessarily both)" and "Twinkle does not achieve high jumps," we deduce Twinkle is agile.
- From "Twinkle has strength" and "If Twinkle is strong, then she is either agile or trustworthy (but not both)," combined with agile, we deduce Twinkle is not trustworthy.
- The antecedent "well-trained or trustworthy" therefore reduces to just "well-trained."
- There are no premises linking "well-trained" to any other property, nor any linking "useful for dressage" to known properties. Thus, we cannot determine whether "If well-trained, then useful for dressage" holds from the given information.

ANSWER: C
