Difficulty: hard

Context:
Eddie cannot make groundbreaking findings. Everyone enjoys open spaces or is comfortable in enclosed spaces. If Angie either hikes outdoors or enjoys sunny days (but not both), then she prefers open areas. Angie studies rock formations. Zaylee does not explore caves. If Angie is a geologist, then she is either appreciative of subterranean landscapes or enjoys caving, but not both. Angie likes small rooms. Angie does not explore caves. Angie hikes outdoors. Angie either avoids tunnels or explores caves. Huggalump likes small rooms. Zaylee studies rock formations. If Huggalump understands ecosystems or values underground discovery, then she can make groundbreaking findings. Huggalump either avoids tunnels or explores caves. Angie is a geologist. If Angie understands ecosystems or values underground discovery, then she can make groundbreaking findings. If Eddie either hikes outdoors or enjoys sunny days (but not both), then she prefers open areas. Eddie hikes outdoors. Huggalump is a geologist. Angie cannot make groundbreaking findings. Angie does not enjoy sunny days. Anyone who enjoys caving or likes small rooms is comfortable in enclosed spaces. If someone has claustrophobia and likes wide spaces, then they avoid tunnels. If someone either appreciates subterranean landscapes or studies rock formations, then they value underground discovery.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Angie is either fearful of enclosed spaces or comfortable in enclosed spaces, but not both.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Angie likes small rooms” and “Anyone who enjoys caving or likes small rooms is comfortable in enclosed spaces,” it follows that Angie is comfortable in enclosed spaces.
- The only rule touching on being fearful (claustrophobia) is: “If someone has claustrophobia and likes wide spaces, then they avoid tunnels.” We can derive Angie avoids tunnels (since she either avoids tunnels or explores caves, and she does not explore caves), and she prefers open areas (from hiking outdoors XOR sunny days). However, this rule is one-way; avoiding tunnels and liking wide spaces does not imply claustrophobia. No rule states that being comfortable excludes being fearful.

Conclusion:
- We know Angie is comfortable in enclosed spaces.
- We have no basis to conclude whether she is or is not fearful of enclosed spaces.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the XOR claim.
