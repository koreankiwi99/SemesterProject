Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Niklaus does not plant seeds, and “Niklaus either plants seeds or manages a farm.” Therefore, Niklaus manages a farm.
- Niklaus works outdoors and does not grow groundnuts. Given “If Niklaus works outdoors, then he either runs a ranch or grows groundnuts (or both),” he must run a ranch.
- Anyone who runs a ranch owns animals; anyone who manages a farm or owns animals can raise livestock. This gives Niklaus the ability to raise livestock, but does not assert anything about growing crops.
- There is no rule connecting “nutritious crops” to any given facts. The only crop mentioned for Niklaus is groundnuts, and we only know he does not grow groundnuts. He could still grow other nutritious crops or none at all.

Conclusion: The truth of “Niklaus does not grow nutritious crops” cannot be determined from the given information.
