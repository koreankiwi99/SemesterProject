Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Aurelio does not reflect on his actions (RA = false).
- He has good intuition (GI = true), and GI implies SA xor RA. Since RA is false, SA must be true.
- If SA then LB xor TCE; given TCE is false, LB is true.
- He pursues wellbeing (WB = true). WB implies PA or MB; since MB is false, PA must be true.
- Given PA xor MS and PA is true, MS is false.
- PM or MS; since MS is false, PM is true.
- PM implies AD and SH; thus AD and SH are true.

Since Aurelio pursues wellbeing, he prioritizes his health. Therefore, the statement “Aurelio does not prioritize his health” is false.

ANSWER: B
