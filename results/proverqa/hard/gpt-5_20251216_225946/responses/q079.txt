==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Aries embraces paradoxes. Given “Aries either avoids complexity or embraces paradoxes, but not both,” Aries does not avoid complexity.
- Given “Aries either avoids complexity or pursues knowledge, but not both,” and he does not avoid complexity, Aries pursues knowledge.
- From “If Aries pursues knowledge, then he is either able to think discursively or develop critical thinking, but not both,” Aries has exactly one of: thinks discursively or develops critical thinking.
- Aries challenges conventional wisdom. From “If Aries challenges conventional wisdom, then he either influences public opinion or leaves a lasting impact, but not both,” and the given “Aries influences public opinion,” we get: Aries influences public opinion and does not leave a lasting impact.
- “Gains influence” appears only in the rule about Myla and is not linked generally to “influences public opinion” or to any property of Aries. There is no premise that lets us infer Aries gains influence, nor any that rules it out.

Therefore, whether Aries gains influence cannot be determined from the given information.
