==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Ayden does not experience shame” and “If Ayden loses influence, then he experiences shame,” we get Ayden does not lose influence.
- From “Ayden has a strong support system” and “If someone has a strong support system, they may not struggle with guilt, and vice versa,” we get Ayden does not struggle with guilt.
- Suppose Ayden were reckless. Then by “If Ayden is reckless, then he will either attract attention or lose trust, but not both,” and given “Ayden does not attract attention,” Ayden would lose trust.
- Losing trust implies damaging reputation, which implies facing consequences, which (given Ayden cannot lose influence) implies becoming isolated.
- With “Ayden engages in controversy,” becoming isolated would imply Ayden struggles with guilt.
- This contradicts that Ayden does not struggle with guilt. Therefore, Ayden is not reckless.
