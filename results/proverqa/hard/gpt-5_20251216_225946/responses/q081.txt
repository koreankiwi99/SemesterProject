==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Brandon drives regularly ⇒ he follows traffic rules and is a defensive driver. So D (defensive) is true.
- Brandon knows vehicle mechanics and enjoys mentoring ⇒ he can be a driving instructor. So I is true.
- If I, then exactly one of professional racer (P) and teaches road safety (S) is true. Given P is true, this forces S to be false.
- Brandon is either experienced (E) or teaches road safety (S), but not both. Since S is false, E must be true.
- If E, then exactly one of D (defensive) or C (cautious) is true. We already have D true, so C must be false.
- Exactly one of C (cautious) or Re (reckless) is true. Since C is false, Re must be true.

Therefore, Brandon is a reckless driver.
