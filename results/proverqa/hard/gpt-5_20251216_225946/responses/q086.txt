==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Forest lives in the rainforest, and the rule says rainforest implies either carnivorous or venomous (but not both). Since Forest does not have venom, Forest must be carnivorous.
- If Forest is carnivorous, then he is either stealthy or camouflaged (but not both). Given Forest is not camouflaged, Forest is stealthy.
- Any snake that has stealth or is agile is adaptable. Therefore, Forest is adaptable.
- If Forest is adaptable, then he can survive in harsh environments. Therefore, Forest can survive in harsh environments.
