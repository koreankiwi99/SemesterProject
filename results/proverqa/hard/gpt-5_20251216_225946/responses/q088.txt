Question ID: 88
Difficulty: hard

Context:
For all camels, if they have a dry mouth and feel weak, then they are thirsty. If Goobers carries a heavy load, then he either stumbles frequently or feels exhausted (or both). Goobers does not reach water. Goobers does not have strong legs. If a camel stumbles frequently, then it loses balance and gets injured. For every camel, it is either thirsty or well-hydrated, but not both. If Goobers feels exhausted, then he either rests in the shade or walks briskly, but not both. Every camel that crosses the desert is either thirsty or finds an oasis. Goobers does not lose balance. Goobers gets injured. Goobers carries a heavy load. Goobers either rests in the shade or traverses dunes, but not both at the same time. All camels that have owners are able to carry loads and traverse dunes. If Goobers traverses dunes, then he either crosses the desert or reaches water. Goobers walks briskly. All camels that find an oasis have strong legs and endurance. Blossom does not lose balance.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Goobers is well-hydrated.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Goobers carries a heavy load. If he carried a heavy load, then he either stumbles frequently or feels exhausted.
- If a camel stumbles frequently, then it loses balance and gets injured. Goobers does not lose balance, so he does not stumble frequently. Therefore, from the heavy load condition, he must feel exhausted.
- If Goobers feels exhausted, then he either rests in the shade or walks briskly, but not both. Given he walks briskly, he does not rest in the shade.
- Goobers either rests in the shade or traverses dunes, but not both. Since he does not rest in the shade, he traverses dunes.
- If Goobers traverses dunes, then he either crosses the desert or reaches water. He does not reach water, so he crosses the desert.
- Every camel that crosses the desert is either thirsty or finds an oasis. All camels that find an oasis have strong legs. Goobers does not have strong legs, so he did not find an oasis; thus he is thirsty.
- For every camel, it is either thirsty or well-hydrated, but not both. Since Goobers is thirsty, he is not well-hydrated.
