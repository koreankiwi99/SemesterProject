Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Wesson is not respected by peers.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “works tirelessly XOR prioritizes family life” and “prioritizes family life,” conclude Wesson does not work tirelessly.
- From “well-respected OR works tirelessly” and “not works tirelessly,” conclude Wesson is well-respected.
- If well-respected, then “selfless acts XOR helps unconditionally.” Given “does not help unconditionally,” conclude Wesson performs selfless acts.
- From “noble character -> (hero XOR selfless acts)” and “selfless acts,” conclude Wesson is not a hero.
- From “(recognized by governments OR respected by peers) -> hero” and “not a hero,” by contrapositive conclude not recognized by governments and not respected by peers.

Therefore, “Wesson is not respected by peers” is true.
