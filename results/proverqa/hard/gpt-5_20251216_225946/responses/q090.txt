Question ID: 90
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Atharv works hard, then he either achieves success or becomes an expert (but not both). Atharv does not feel content. If Atharv has creative talent, then he either brings joy to others or makes a difference (but not both). Atharv sets goals. Atharv does not make progress. Atharv takes risks. Atharv does not live a fulfilling life. Everyone who sets goals either makes progress or works hard (or both). For all humans, if someone follows their passion, then they will develop unique skills and bring joy to others. If Atharv either makes people smile or brings joy to others (but not both), then he lives a fulfilling life. Atharv does not become influential. If someone cares about their community and makes people smile, then they feel content. Atharv cares about his community. Atharv does not become an expert. If Atharv takes risks, then he either gains recognition or becomes influential, but not both. If Atharv develops unique skills, then he either achieves success or gains recognition (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Atharv follows his passion.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From sets goals (G) and not progress (¬P) with the rule G -> (P or H), Atharv must work hard (H).
- With H and not expert (¬E) and the rule H -> (S XOR E), Atharv achieves success (S).
- From takes risks (R) and not influential (¬I) with R -> (GR XOR I), Atharv gains recognition (GR).
- If Atharv had developed unique skills (U), rule U -> (S XOR GR) would be violated because both S and GR are true. Hence ¬U.
- From not fulfilling life (¬F) and (Sm XOR J) -> F, we get ¬(Sm XOR J). From cares about community (Com) and not content (¬C) with (Com ∧ Sm) -> C, we get ¬Sm. Together, ¬Sm and ¬(Sm XOR J) imply ¬J.
- Rule: If follows passion (FP) then U ∧ J. But we have ¬U and ¬J, so ¬(U ∧ J). By contrapositive, ¬FP.

Conclusion: Atharv does not follow his passion.
