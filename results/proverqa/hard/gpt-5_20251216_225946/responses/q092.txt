Question ID: 92
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Rio builds prototypes. Rio either prioritizes leisure or works diligently, but not both. Rio is passionate. If Rio holds patents, then he either builds prototypes or creates useful innovations, but not both. Either Rio is applauded by others or he is ridiculed by others, but not both. If Rio is passionate, then he thinks creatively and makes groundbreaking discoveries. If Rio either makes groundbreaking discoveries or creates useful innovations (but not both), then he is applauded by others. Rio holds patents. Rio does not prioritize leisure.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rio is ridiculed by others.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Rio is passionate" and "If Rio is passionate, then he thinks creatively and makes groundbreaking discoveries," Rio makes groundbreaking discoveries (MGD).
- From "Rio holds patents" and "If Rio holds patents, then he either builds prototypes or creates useful innovations, but not both," and given "Rio builds prototypes," it follows (by XOR) that he does not create useful innovations (CUI is false).
- Therefore, MGD is true and CUI is false, so (MGD XOR CUI) is true. By "If (MGD XOR CUI), then he is applauded," Rio is applauded (A).
- Given "Either applauded or ridiculed, but not both" (A XOR R), A being true implies R is false.

ANSWER: B

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
