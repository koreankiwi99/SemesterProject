Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Beckham does not create works of art.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Beckham dyes fabrics and stitches cloth. If he used leather, then he would do exactly one of those, so he does not use leather.
- He restores furniture, and since he does not use leather, he must work with wood.
- Working with wood and the rule “wood or modern, but not both” imply he does not make modern furniture.
- From “skilled upholsterer or modern, but not both,” he must be a skilled upholsterer.
- Beckham embraces innovation; with “values tradition or embraces innovation, but not both,” he does not value tradition. Since preserving heritage implies valuing tradition, he does not preserve heritage.
- If someone restores antiques and uses original techniques, they preserve heritage. Beckham uses original techniques, so he cannot restore antiques (otherwise he would preserve heritage, which he does not).
- As a skilled upholsterer, he must either restore antiques or create works of art. Since he does not restore antiques, he must create works of art.

Therefore, the statement “Beckham does not create works of art” is false.
