Question ID: 95
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Anyone who worked under a mentor or studied design has experience. Maci does not have good taste. If Maci has experience in fashion design, then she is either a perfectionist or creates quality work, but not both. Maci is not a perfectionist. Maci runs her own business. If Maci pays attention to details or has good taste, then she will produce beautiful designs. Maci either runs her own business or studies design, but not both. Maci learns from others. Maci does not produce beautiful designs. If Maci learns from others, then she has worked under a mentor.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Maci either values precision or cares about her appearance (or both).

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Learns from others -> worked under a mentor -> has experience.
- Has experience and “if experience then (perfectionist XOR creates quality work)” with “not a perfectionist” implies she creates quality work. (Not needed for final, but consistent.)
- Runs own business and “runs business XOR studies design” -> does not study design.
- “If pays attention to details or has good taste, then produces beautiful designs” and “does not produce beautiful designs” implies she neither pays attention to details nor has good taste.
- The statement “values precision or cares about her appearance” corresponds to “pays attention to details or has good taste.” Since both are false, the disjunction is false.

ANSWER: B

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: B
Correct: No
