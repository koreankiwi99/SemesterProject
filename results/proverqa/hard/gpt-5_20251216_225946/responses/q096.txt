Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Hope either works independently or collaborates with others, but not both" and "Hope does not work independently," we get: Hope collaborates with others.
- From "If Hope makes valuable contributions, then she thinks critically and collaborates with others" and "Hope does not think critically," we conclude: Hope does not make valuable contributions.
- From "If someone has innovative ideas, then they will make valuable contributions" and the above, we get: Hope does not have innovative ideas.
- From "If Hope either excels academically or pursues alternative careers (but not both), then she has innovative ideas" and "Hope does not excel academically," together with "not innovative ideas," we infer: Hope does not pursue alternative careers.
- From "Hope either pursues alternative careers or is a dedicated scientist, but not both" and "not alternative careers," we conclude: Hope is a dedicated scientist.
- From "If Hope is a dedicated scientist, then she either makes a groundbreaking discovery or inspires others (or both)" and "Hope does not inspire others," we deduce: Hope makes a groundbreaking discovery.
