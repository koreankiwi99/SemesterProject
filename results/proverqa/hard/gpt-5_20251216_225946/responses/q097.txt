Question ID: 97
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Jaxton has low energy and gets regular checkups, then he has anemia. Jaxton manages stress or prioritizes self-care. Jaxton experiences setbacks. If Jaxton listens to his doctor, then he maintains good health. If Jaxton experiences setbacks, then he either prioritizes self-care or seeks support (but not both). Jaxton does not seek support. Jaxton works hard. Jaxton eats nutritious food. Jaxton is either maintaining good health or has anemia, but not both. If Jaxton has ambition, then he prioritizes self-care and engages in regular exercise. If someone sets goals and works hard, then they have ambition. Jaxton sets goals. Jaxton either engages in regular exercise or needs a special diet, but these are not mutually exclusive. If Jaxton eats nutritious food, then he maintains good health.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jaxton requires medical treatment.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From Sets goals and Works hard, Jaxton has Ambition. Ambition implies he Prioritizes self-care and Engages in regular exercise.
- Setbacks with the XOR rule (self-care or seek support, not both) and the fact that he does not seek support confirm Prioritizes self-care.
- Eats nutritious food implies Maintains good health.
- Given Maintains good health XOR Has anemia, and Maintains good health is true, Has anemia is false.
- There is no rule connecting good health, anemia, special diet, or any other condition to “requires medical treatment.”

Conclusion: The information does not determine whether Jaxton requires medical treatment.
