Question ID: 101
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Dr. Lilian focuses on novel approaches, then she will advance her field. Dr. Ignacio does not formulate hypotheses. Dr. Lilian does not mentor students. Lilian does not gain international recognition. Dr. Lilian engages in critical thinking. Dr. Ignacio engages in critical thinking. Every scientist either collaborates with colleagues or publishes research papers. Lilian has curiosity. Lilian explores new ideas. If Dr. Lilian has expertise, then she either makes breakthroughs or influences policy, but not both. Dr. Lilian does not formulate hypotheses. Dr. Lilian does not lead innovative projects. If Dr. Lilian either analyzes data or designs experiments (but not both), then she publishes research papers. Any scientist who develops new theories or conducts experiments can improve their understanding of their field. Dr. Lilian does not conduct experiments. If Dr. Lilian engages in critical thinking, then she either explores new ideas or enhances her knowledge, but not both. Anyone who either improves their understanding or formulates hypotheses is enhancing their knowledge. If a scientist is curious and advances their field, then they develop new theories. Dr. Lilian studies microorganisms. If Dr. Lilian studies microorganisms, then she either contributes to sustainable agriculture or wins prestigious awards (or both). Emery does not gain international recognition. If a scientist reads scientific literature and participates in discussions, then they enhance their knowledge. If Dr. Lilian publishes research papers, then she either makes breakthroughs or leads innovative projects, but not both. If a scientist makes breakthroughs and wins prestigious awards, then they gain international recognition. If Dr. Lilian either collaborates with colleagues or mentors students (but not both), then she advances her field.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Lilian contributes to sustainable agriculture.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Dr. Lilian engages in critical thinking and explores new ideas. From the XOR rule (critical thinking -> exactly one of exploring new ideas or enhancing knowledge), she does not enhance her knowledge.
- Since enhancing knowledge would follow from either improving understanding or formulating hypotheses, and she does not formulate hypotheses, she also does not improve her understanding.
- If someone develops new theories or conducts experiments, they improve their understanding. Therefore, Lilian neither conducts experiments (already given) nor develops new theories.
- If curious and advancing the field, then they develop new theories. Lilian is curious, so because she does not develop new theories, she does not advance her field.
- If exactly one of collaborating or mentoring, then she advances. She does not mentor; if she collaborated, she would advance, which she does not. Hence, she does not collaborate.
- Every scientist collaborates or publishes. Since she does not collaborate, she publishes.
- If she publishes, then exactly one of making breakthroughs or leading innovative projects. She does not lead innovative projects, so she makes breakthroughs.
- If someone makes breakthroughs and wins prestigious awards, they gain international recognition. Lilian does not gain international recognition, so she does not win prestigious awards.
- She studies microorganisms, which implies she contributes to sustainable agriculture or wins prestigious awards (or both). Since she does not win awards, she must contribute to sustainable agriculture.

ANSWER: A
