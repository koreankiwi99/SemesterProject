Question ID: 102
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Julissa either tracks seed dispersal or analyzes bloom patterns, but not both. Jose either investigates root systems or tracks seed dispersal, but not both. Jaziel either investigates root systems or tracks seed dispersal, but not both. For Jaziel, he either classifies foliage or documents habitats, but not both. If Jaziel has a green thumb, then he analyzes bloom patterns and collects plant samples. Elena classifies foliage. If Jaziel explores remote regions, then he either identifies unique specimens or studies tropical flora. Julissa does not examine fungal growth. Jaziel is either specialized in rare plants or a general plant researcher, but not both. If Jose either examines fungal growth or analyzes bloom patterns (but not both), then he studies tropical flora. Every botanist who studies plant migration either researches plant adaptation or tracks seed dispersal (or both). Jaziel classifies foliage. If Jaziel has vast knowledge, then he excels in experimentation and specializes in rare plants. Jaziel either documents habitats or investigates root systems, but not both. Jaziel does not examine fungal growth. Jaziel either tracks seed dispersal or analyzes bloom patterns, but not both. Jose either documents habitats or investigates root systems, but not both. If Jaziel either examines fungal growth or analyzes bloom patterns (but not both), then he studies tropical flora. Any botanist who studies tropical flora or discovers new species is specialized in rare plants.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jaziel is a general plant researcher.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Jaziel classifies foliage. From “either classifies foliage or documents habitats, but not both,” it follows that he does not document habitats.
- From “either documents habitats or investigates root systems, but not both,” not documenting habitats implies he investigates root systems.
- From “either investigates root systems or tracks seed dispersal, but not both,” investigating root systems implies he does not track seed dispersal.
- From “either tracks seed dispersal or analyzes bloom patterns, but not both,” not tracking seed dispersal implies he analyzes bloom patterns.
- Jaziel does not examine fungal growth. Given “if either examines fungal growth or analyzes bloom patterns (but not both), then studies tropical flora,” with analyzes bloom patterns true and examines fungal growth false, Jaziel studies tropical flora.
- Any botanist who studies tropical flora is specialized in rare plants. Hence, Jaziel is specialized in rare plants.
- Since Jaziel is either specialized in rare plants or a general plant researcher, but not both, he is not a general plant researcher.

ANSWER: B

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
