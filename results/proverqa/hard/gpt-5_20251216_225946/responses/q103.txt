Question ID: 103
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Kehlani thrives in change. If Kehlani has complex social bonds, then she is either resourceful or intelligent, but not both. A leech either prioritizes its own survival or respects the needs of others, but not necessarily both. Kehlani does not prioritize her own survival. If Kehlani is intelligent, then she either cares for her host or protects the ecosystem, but not both. Kehlani does not care for her host. If Kehlani maintains balance in her ecosystem, then she is either adaptable or resourceful, but not both. Kehlani does not adjust her behavior. If Kehlani lives with crayfish and respects their needs, then she has complex social bonds. All leeches that are sensitive to their environment are adaptable and have strong instincts. If Kehlani either adjusts her behavior or thrives in change (but not both), then she is adaptable. Kehlani is cooperative. Kehlani communicates effectively. Kehlani maintains balance in her ecosystem. If Kehlani forms long-term attachments or shows empathy towards others, then she can have complex social bonds. If Kehlani is cooperative, then she lives with crayfish and communicates effectively. Jamir does not adjust her behavior. If Princeton is intelligent, then she either cares for her host or protects the ecosystem, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kehlani does not protect the ecosystem.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Kehlani thrives in change and does not adjust her behavior. The condition (adjusts behavior XOR thrives in change) holds, so Kehlani is adaptable.
- Kehlani maintains balance in her ecosystem, which implies she is either adaptable or resourceful, but not both. Since she is adaptable, she is not resourceful.
- Kehlani is cooperative, so she lives with crayfish. From the leech rule (a leech either prioritizes its own survival or respects others’ needs) and the fact that Kehlani does not prioritize her own survival, she respects others’ needs.
- Living with crayfish and respecting their needs implies Kehlani has complex social bonds.
- If Kehlani has complex social bonds, then she is either resourceful or intelligent, but not both. Since she is not resourceful, she must be intelligent.
- If Kehlani is intelligent, then she either cares for her host or protects the ecosystem, but not both. Kehlani does not care for her host, so she must protect the ecosystem.

Therefore, the statement “Kehlani does not protect the ecosystem” is false.
