Question ID: 105
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If a farmer works hard, then they value quality and are dedicated to their work. Anders does not use crop rotation. Every dedicated farmer either improves their crops or is experienced (or both). For all farmers, either they diversify their farm or improve their crops, but not necessarily both. Ronan either manages pests or increases crop yields. Ronan does not use crop rotation. Any farmer who uses quality seeds or optimizes soil conditions can increase crop yields. Every farmer monitors soil or manages pests. Ronan rotates fields. If Ronan is experienced, then he can either increase crop yields or develop new techniques, but not both. If Alyssa is experienced, then he can either increase crop yields or develop new techniques, but not both. If Bo either rotates fields or uses crop rotation (but not both), then he is dedicated. Ronan either uses sustainable methods or manages pests, but not both. If Ronan either rotates fields or uses crop rotation (but not both), then he is dedicated. Ronan diversifies his farm. Ronan uses sustainable methods. Bo diversifies his farm.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ronan does not develop new techniques.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Ronan uses sustainable methods (SM). From “Ronan either uses sustainable methods or manages pests, but not both,” SM implies he does not manage pests (¬MP).
- From “Ronan either manages pests or increases crop yields,” and ¬MP, we get that Ronan increases crop yields (IY).
- Ronan rotates fields (RF) and does not use crop rotation (¬CR). Hence (RF xor CR) holds, so by the rule, Ronan is dedicated (D).
- From “Every dedicated farmer either improves crops (IC) or is experienced (E),” we get IC or E for Ronan, but not which.
- If Ronan is experienced, then exactly one of {IY, develops new techniques (DNT)} is true. Since IY is true, E would imply ¬DNT. However, we do not know whether E is true (he could satisfy the dedicated condition via IC instead).
- No rule tells us about DNT when not experienced. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Ronan develops new techniques.

ANSWER: C

Result:

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
