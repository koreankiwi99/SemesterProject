Difficulty: hard

Context:
For every horse, either the horse participates in wassailing or the horse does not participate in wassailing, but not both. Vada does not enjoy outdoor activities. Tessa either enjoys outdoor activities or has participated in parades. If Kiddo has a good temperament, then she either wins competitions or is majestic (or both). Kiddo either works on a farm or competes in shows, but not both. Vada works on a farm. Kiddo works on a farm. Kiddo does not enjoy outdoor activities. Kiddo has a good temperament. All horses with a noble appearance are majestic. Tessa either works on a farm or competes in shows, but not both.

For Tessa, either she has participated in parades or she wins competitions, but not necessarily both. Tessa has a good temperament. If Kiddo is majestic, then she either competes in shows or participates in wassailing, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kiddo does not participate in wassailing.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Kiddo works on a farm and “works on a farm XOR competes in shows,” so Kiddo does not compete in shows.
- Kiddo does not enjoy outdoor activities and “enjoys outdoor activities OR has participated in parades,” so Kiddo has participated in parades.
- Kiddo has a good temperament and “good temperament -> (wins competitions OR is majestic),” so Kiddo either wins or is majestic.
- “If Kiddo is majestic, then (competes in shows XOR participates in wassailing).” Since Kiddo does not compete in shows, if she is majestic then she must participate in wassailing.

Thus:
- If Kiddo is majestic, she participates in wassailing (so the statement “Kiddo does not participate in wassailing” would be false).
- If Kiddo is not majestic, she wins competitions (by the good temperament rule), but nothing determines whether she participates in wassailing; she could either participate or not.

Therefore, the truth of “Kiddo does not participate in wassailing” cannot be determined from the given information.
