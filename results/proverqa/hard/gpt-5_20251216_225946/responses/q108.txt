==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- If Iyla excels in experiments, then she will achieve success; but Iyla does not achieve success, so she does not excel in experiments.
- Iyla discovers new properties. If she both discovered new properties and shared findings, she’d be an expert; since she is not an expert, she does not share her findings.
- Given she conducts experiments and must either share or keep notes private (but not both), and she does not share, she keeps her notes private.
- Since she either publishes or keeps notes private (but not both), and she keeps notes private, she does not publish.
- From “makes new findings or publishes,” not publishing implies she makes new findings. From “gains recognition or publishes,” not publishing implies she gains recognition.
- None of the premises mention, imply, or connect to “developing innovative remedies.” There is no rule linking her discoveries, recognition, expertise, or lack of success to developing (or not developing) innovative remedies.

Conclusion: The truth of “Iyla does not develop innovative remedies” cannot be determined from the given information.
