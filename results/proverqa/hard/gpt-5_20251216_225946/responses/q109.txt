Model Response:

- From “Wyatt has a family or lives alone,” conclude Wyatt lives alone.
- From “Anyone who avoids crowds and appreciates quiet is likely to like being alone,” with “Wyatt avoids crowds” and “Wyatt appreciates quiet,” deduce Wyatt likes being alone. Given “Wyatt either likes being alone or enjoys socializing, but not both,” he does not enjoy socializing.
- From “If Wyatt lives alone, then he either values solitude or enjoys socializing, but not both,” and since he does not enjoy socializing, conclude Wyatt values solitude.
- From “Whoever values solitude, prefers privacy,” conclude Wyatt prefers privacy.
