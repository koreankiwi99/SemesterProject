Question ID: 110
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Queenie has flagella, then she either releases waste products or produces toxins, but not both. If Queenie has a cell wall, then she can evade the immune system. Queenie colonizes intestines. If Queenie invades tissues, then she will produce toxins. Any parasite that breaks down food and colonizes intestines will release waste products. Queenie has flagella. Queenie disrupts digestion. If Queenie either produces toxins or adapts to environments (but not both), then she can evade the immune system. If Cora either produces toxins or adapts to environments (but not both), then she can evade the immune system. If Queenie can evade the immune system, then she can either multiply rapidly or dominate the gut microbiome, but not both. A parasite may either cause chronic disease or multiply rapidly, but not necessarily both. Queenie adapts to environments. If Queenie either disrupts digestion or infests her host (but not both), then she causes chronic disease. Cora adapts to environments. Queenie breaks down food. Leo has flagella. Queenie does not infest her host. Cora disrupts digestion.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Queenie is able to dominate the gut microbiome.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Queenie breaks down food and colonizes intestines, so she releases waste products.
- She has flagella, and with the rule "flagella ⇒ releases waste XOR produces toxins," releasing waste implies she does not produce toxins.
- Since she adapts to environments and does not produce toxins, the XOR condition (toxins XOR adapts) holds, so she can evade the immune system.
- If she can evade the immune system, then exactly one of these is true: she multiplies rapidly or she dominates the gut microbiome.
- She disrupts digestion and does not infest her host, satisfying the XOR condition for that rule, so she causes chronic disease. This does not determine whether she multiplies rapidly.
- No given rule links chronic disease to choosing between multiplying rapidly and dominating the gut. Therefore, we cannot determine whether she dominates the gut microbiome.

ANSWER: C

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
