Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Given: Kaia does not feel connected to her roots.
- Rule: If someone learns ancestral songs or appreciates their heritage, then they feel connected. Contrapositive gives: if not connected, then not learn songs and not appreciate heritage. So Kaia does not appreciate her heritage (and already does not learn songs).
- Rule: If someone preserves history or values their culture, then they appreciate their heritage. Contrapositive: if not appreciate, then not preserve history and not value culture. So Kaia does not value her culture (consistent with not preserving history).
- Given: Kaia honors her family. Rule: If (respect ancestors XOR honor family) then values culture. Contrapositive with not valuing culture implies the XOR is false; since Kaia honors her family, she must also respect her ancestors (both true makes XOR false).
- Given: Kaia either seeks material wealth or shows devotion, but not both; and she does not seek wealth. Therefore Kaia shows devotion, and by the given rule, she gets blessed.
- None of the rules link Kaia to praying for rain. The only prayer rule is specific to Carly. There is no information implying whether Kaia prays for rain or not.

Conclusion: The truth of “Kaia does not pray for rain” cannot be determined from the given information.
