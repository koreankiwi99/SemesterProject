Question ID: 112
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Any fish that is agile or curious can thrive in harmony with their surroundings. Matilda lives in cold water. If Matilda lives in cold water, then she has a slow metabolism and hibernates during winter. If Matilda lives in cold areas and has low activity, then she hibernates during winter. Matilda either hibernates during winter or gains energy, but not both. If Matilda eats plankton, then she gains energy and has shiny scales. Every fish with good vision either finds food or socializes with its school (or both). Any fish that swims quickly and finds food will gain energy. All fish that are agile can evade predators. If a fish stays safe and has spatial awareness, then it can navigate the reef. Matilda cannot navigate the reef. Matilda cannot thrive in harmony with her surroundings. Any fish that evades predators or dodges nets can stay safe. Matilda is active during the night. If Matilda is active during the night, then she follows currents and swims quickly. Matilda has spatial awareness. If Matilda has good vision or enjoys discovery, then she is curious.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Matilda does not explore her surroundings.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Matilda lives in cold water” → she hibernates during winter.
- Given the exclusive-or: hibernates XOR gains energy, so since she hibernates, she does not gain energy.
- From “If a fish stays safe and has spatial awareness, then it can navigate the reef,” plus Matilda has spatial awareness and cannot navigate → she does not stay safe.
- From “evades predators or dodges nets → stays safe,” and she does not stay safe → she neither evades predators nor dodges nets.
- From “all agile → evade predators,” and she does not evade predators → she is not agile.
- From “agile or curious → can thrive,” and “Matilda cannot thrive” → by contrapositive, she is neither agile nor curious; in particular, not curious.
- From “good vision or enjoys discovery → curious,” and not curious → by contrapositive, she neither has good vision nor enjoys discovery.

Not enjoying discovery corresponds to not exploring her surroundings. Therefore, the statement “Matilda does not explore her surroundings” is true.

ANSWER: A
