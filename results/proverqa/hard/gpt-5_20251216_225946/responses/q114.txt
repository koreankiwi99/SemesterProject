==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Simba reacts fast and stays alert; thus he has quick reflexes (any lion that reacts fast and stays alert can have quick reflexes).
- Simba is not cautious, and “Simba is cautious or has loyal friends,” so he has loyal friends.
- With quick reflexes and loyal friends, Simba can survive adversity; treat this as he survives adversity for the implication chain.
- If Simba survives adversity, he gains wisdom. So Simba gains wisdom.
- Simba ventures into the unknown, and the rule says: either gets into trouble or gains wisdom, but not both. Since he gains wisdom, he does not get into trouble.
- Simba has a bold nature; hence he explores dangerous paths. The rule says: either learns valuable lessons or gets into trouble, but not both. Since he does not get into trouble, he learns valuable lessons.

Therefore, the claim “Simba does not learn valuable lessons” is false.
