==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Miracle does not value harmony” and “Miracle values harmony or prioritizes others,” we deduce she prioritizes others (A = true).
- From “Miracle is either someone who prioritizes others or thinks of herself, but not both,” A = true implies she does not think of herself (S = false).
- From “Either Miracle puts others first or she is community-oriented, but she cannot be both,” A = true implies she is not community-oriented (C = false).
- From “Either Miracle is community-oriented or self-centered, but not both,” C = false implies she is self-centered (SC = true).

Therefore, the statement “Miracle is not self-centered” is false.
