  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Stone faces challenges and does not find creative solutions. From “faces challenges -> finds creative solutions or resourceful,” Stone must be resourceful.
- Stone manages time effectively, so he is productive.
- Stone values simplicity, so he has clarity and makes intentional decisions.
- If someone is stress-free and has clarity, then they live harmoniously. Stone does not live harmoniously and has clarity, so Stone is not stress-free.
- No rule connects Stone’s being organized to any of these properties. The only statement about “organized” pertains to Alexia, not Stone.

Therefore, we cannot determine whether Stone is organized.
