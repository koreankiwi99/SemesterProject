Question ID: 118
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Jade does not map terrain. Alyssa does not map terrain. If Faith loves the outdoors, then she examines fossils and classifies minerals. Alyssa enjoys hiking. Alyssa does not appreciate nature. Faith does not gain recognition. If Twinkle enjoys hiking, then she either appreciates nature or loves the outdoors (but not both). Anyone who analyzes rock formations either studies geology or uncovers the secrets of the Earth (or both). Alyssa does not gain recognition. If Alyssa values exploration, then she loves the outdoors. If Alyssa studies geology, then she can either make breakthroughs or gain recognition, but not both. If Alyssa enjoys hiking, then she either appreciates nature or loves the outdoors (but not both). If Faith studies geology, then she can either make breakthroughs or gain recognition, but not both. Jade does not uncover the secrets of the Earth. If Alyssa loves the outdoors, then she examines fossils and classifies minerals. If Alyssa either finds fault lines or reads seismic data (but not both), then she studies geology. If Jade either examines fossils or maps terrain (but not both), then she analyzes rock formations. Jade enjoys hiking. If Twinkle collects rocks, then she will classify minerals. Alyssa does not uncover the secrets of the Earth. Faith does not collect rocks. If Alyssa either examines fossils or maps terrain (but not both), then she analyzes rock formations.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Alyssa makes breakthroughs.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Alyssa enjoys hiking, and the rule says enjoying hiking implies exactly one of appreciating nature or loving the outdoors. Since Alyssa does not appreciate nature, she must love the outdoors.
- Loving the outdoors implies Alyssa examines fossils and classifies minerals.
- Alyssa examines fossils and does not map terrain, so the exclusive-or condition (examines fossils xor maps terrain) holds, which implies she analyzes rock formations.
- Analyzing rock formations implies she either studies geology or uncovers the secrets of the Earth. Since Alyssa does not uncover the secrets of the Earth, she must study geology.
- Studying geology implies exactly one of making breakthroughs or gaining recognition. Since Alyssa does not gain recognition, she must make breakthroughs.

ANSWER: A

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
