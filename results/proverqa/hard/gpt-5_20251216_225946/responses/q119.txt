==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Edward wins big and does not invest wisely. From "If Edward wins big, then he either invests wisely or donates generously (but not both)," it follows that Edward donates generously.
- Donating generously implies being a philanthropist.
- If Edward is philanthropic, then he is either altruistic or puts others first, but not both. Also, anyone who puts others first is altruistic. Therefore, Edward cannot be “puts others first” (since that would make him both), so he must be altruistic and not puts-others-first.
- From "Edward either puts others first or is selfish," and since he does not put others first, it follows that Edward is selfish.
- From "Either Edward is selfish or selfless, but not both," Edward being selfish implies he is not selfless.

Conclusion: Edward is not selfless.
