For any person, if they feel inadequate and criticize others, then they fear rejection. Brayan needs approval. Cherry has high status. Cherry does not look down on others. For Dominick, valuing authenticity and seeking attention are mutually exclusive. If Elsa either fears rejection or needs approval (but not both), then she hides her true self.

  B) False
  C) Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Elsa has high status” and “If Elsa has high status, then she either looks down on others or acts with empathy, but not both,” plus “Elsa does not look down on others,” we deduce Elsa acts with empathy.
- From “Elsa either craves validation or acts with empathy, but not both,” and she acts with empathy, we deduce Elsa does not crave validation.
- From “Elsa builds real connections with others” and “Elsa either builds real connections with others or fears rejection, but not both,” we deduce Elsa does not fear rejection.
- From “Elsa needs approval” and the XOR condition “If Elsa either fears rejection or needs approval (but not both), then she hides her true self,” since she needs approval and does not fear rejection, Elsa hides her true self.
- From “If Elsa hides her true self, then she either values authenticity or craves validation (or both),” and not craving validation, Elsa values authenticity.
- From “For Elsa, valuing authenticity and seeking attention are mutually exclusive,” and she values authenticity, Elsa does not seek attention.

No statements link Elsa’s insecurity to any of the above, and there are no facts about Elsa being manipulative or lonely. Thus:
- Whether Elsa is insecure is not determined by the premises.
- Even if Elsa were insecure, nothing forces her to be manipulative XOR lonely.

There exist models consistent with all given facts where Elsa is insecure and neither manipulative nor lonely, and also models where the conditional is vacuously true. Therefore the truth of the statement cannot be determined.
