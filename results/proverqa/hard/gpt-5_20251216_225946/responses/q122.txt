Question ID: 122
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Taytum eats insects. If Taytum has either aquatic adaptation or terrestrial adaptation (but not both), then she thrives. If Maximo is resilient, then she explores her environments and regenerates quickly. All thriving frogs are resilient. If Duke explores her environment and eats insects, then she is balanced. Taytum either lives in ponds or hibernates seasonally. Inaya either has terrestrial adaptation or hibernates seasonally, but not both. If Taytum has webbed feet, then she either migrates long distances or hibernates seasonally, but not both. If Taytum has strong skin, then she jumps far and explores her environments. If Taytum is resilient, then she explores her environments and regenerates quickly. Taytum does not migrate long distances. Taytum has webbed feet. Taytum either has terrestrial adaptation or hibernates seasonally, but not both. If Taytum explores her environment and eats insects, then she is balanced. Taytum is not balanced. Taytum regenerates quickly. If Taytum has gills or has lungs, then she can thrive.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Taytum has an aquatic adaptation.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Taytum has webbed feet and does not migrate long distances. From “webbed feet -> (migrates XOR hibernates),” she must hibernate seasonally.
2) From “terrestrial adaptation XOR hibernates seasonally,” and hibernation true, Taytum does not have terrestrial adaptation.
3) From “(explores ∧ eats) -> balanced,” with eats true and “not balanced,” Taytum does not explore.
4) From “resilient -> explores ∧ regenerates,” and not explores, Taytum is not resilient (contrapositive).
5) From “thriving -> resilient,” and not resilient, Taytum does not thrive (contrapositive).
6) From “(aquatic XOR terrestrial) -> thrives” and not terrestrial, this reduces to “aquatic -> thrives.” Since Taytum does not thrive, by contrapositive she does not have an aquatic adaptation.

Therefore, the statement “Taytum has an aquatic adaptation” is false.

ANSWER: B

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
