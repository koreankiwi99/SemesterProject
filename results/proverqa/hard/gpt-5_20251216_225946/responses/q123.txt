Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rosalina is disloyal to the state.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From not commands respect (¬CR) and (CR ⊕ K) → holds power (HP), we get K → HP.
- From HP → (influences others ∧ challenges status quo (C)), we get K → C.
- From C ⊕ obeys authority (A), C implies ¬A. Hence K → ¬A.
- From A ∨ loyal to state (S), if ¬A then S must be true. Thus if K then S true (not disloyal).

If K is false, then from gains influence (GI) ∨ K we must have GI true; this does not determine S. With K false, we can choose A true (then C false), and A ∨ S is satisfied regardless of S, so S could be false (disloyal) consistently. Alternatively, if C true then S must be true.

Therefore, both S and ¬S are consistent with the premises, so the statement “Rosalina is disloyal to the state” cannot be determined.

ANSWER: C
