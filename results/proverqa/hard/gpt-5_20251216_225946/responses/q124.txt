==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Aila meets new people ⇒ Aila rediscovers her passion and explores new interests.
- Given Aila either rediscovers her passion or faces a personal crisis (but not both), and she rediscovers her passion, Aila does not face a personal crisis.
- Aila undergoes significant change and for Aila, undergoing significant change implies either losing a loved one or facing a personal crisis (but not both). Since she does not face a personal crisis, Aila loses a loved one.
- Aila does not need time to heal. From the rule (for Aila) that (loses a loved one xor feels grief) ⇒ needs time to heal, the contrapositive implies not(needs time to heal) ⇒ not(xor), so with loses a loved one true, she must also feel grief.

The statement “Aila experiences tragedy” is not a defined predicate in the given rules, nor is it equated to losing a loved one or facing a personal crisis. Although losing a loved one could be considered a tragedy in everyday language, it is not formally specified here. Therefore, its truth value cannot be determined from the given information.
