Question ID: 125
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Augustine works hard, then he is either making breakthroughs or publishing papers (but not both). If Augustine exemplifies excellence, then he will win awards. If Augustine either conducts research or collects data (but not both), then he seeks knowledge. Augustine is either a famous scientist or an unknown scientist, but not both. Augustine does not explore ideas. Augustine gains respect. If Augustine wins awards, then he either earns recognition or gains respect (but not both). If Augustine conducts research, then he is either an unknown scientist or makes a breakthrough (or both). If Augustine works alone and avoids media, then he is an unknown scientist. Augustine solves puzzles. Augustine does not inspire others. Augustine does not analyze results. If Augustine is curious, then he either seeks knowledge or solves puzzles (but not both). Augustine earns recognition. Everyone explores ideas or is curious. Anyone who makes a breakthrough or wins awards inspires others. If someone monitors experiments, then they collect data. Augustine either analyzes results or collects data, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Augustine is a famous scientist.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Everyone explores ideas or is curious" and "Augustine does not explore ideas," Augustine is curious.
- If curious, then "seeks knowledge xor solves puzzles." Given "Augustine solves puzzles," it follows he does not seek knowledge.
- If "(conducts research xor collects data) then seeks knowledge." Since he does not seek knowledge, the XOR must be false, so either both or neither hold.
- "Either analyzes results or collects data, but not both" and "does not analyze results" imply he collects data. With XOR false above and collects data true, he must also conduct research.
- If he conducts research, then "unknown scientist or makes a breakthrough (or both)." Also, "Anyone who makes a breakthrough or wins awards inspires others," but "Augustine does not inspire others," so he neither makes a breakthrough nor wins awards.
- With no breakthrough, conducting research implies he must be an unknown scientist.
- Given "famous xor unknown," being unknown means he is not famous.
