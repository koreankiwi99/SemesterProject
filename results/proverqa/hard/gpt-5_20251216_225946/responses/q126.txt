Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Andy does not oppose terraforming.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Andy cares about nature, so he will pursue sustainable living.
- Given “Andy either pursues sustainable living or values environmental engineering, but not both,” and he pursues sustainable living, he does not value environmental engineering.
- Andy does not have practical skills, and “either practical skills or innovative ideas, but not both,” so he has innovative ideas.
- If Andy has innovative ideas, then he believes in space exploration; thus he believes in space exploration.
- If Andy believes in space exploration or values environmental engineering, then he supports terraforming; hence he supports terraforming.
- Andy either supports terraforming or opposes it, but not both. Since he supports terraforming, he does not oppose it.
