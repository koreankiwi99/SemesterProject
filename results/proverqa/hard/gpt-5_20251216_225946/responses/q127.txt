Question ID: 127
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Sapphire is attuned to elements. If Sapphire masters elemental magic, then she is either a skilled crystalweaver or can forge powerful talismans, but not both. Sapphire either crafts innovative jewelry or weaves protection spells, but not both. Sapphire does not control water elements. Sapphire does not create legendary artifacts. If Sapphire wields earth energy or harnesses air magic, then she can master elemental magic. If Sapphire is attuned to elements, then she is either able to craft innovative jewelry or forge powerful talismans, but not both. Sapphire summons fire energy. Sapphire either summons fire energy or weaves protection spells, but not both. If Sapphire is a skilled crystalweaver, then she can either create legendary artifacts or revolutionize magical practices, but not both. Sapphire either controls water elements or harnesses air magic, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sapphire does not revolutionize magical practices.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Sapphire does not control water elements (W = false). From "water xor air," this implies she harnesses air magic (Aair = true).
- If she wields earth or harnesses air, then she masters elemental magic. So she masters elemental magic (M = true).
- From "If M then skilled crystalweaver xor forges talismans," we get S xor T2.
- Sapphire summons fire energy (F = true). From "fire xor protection spells," this implies she does not weave protection spells (P = false).
- From "attuned to elements -> crafts jewelry xor forges talismans," we have J xor T2.
- Also "crafts jewelry xor protection spells" with P = false gives J = true. Thus from J xor T2, T2 = false.
- From S xor T2 and T2 = false, we get S = true (she is a skilled crystalweaver).
- If S then "create legendary artifacts xor revolutionize magical practices." Given she does not create legendary artifacts (L = false), it follows that she does revolutionize magical practices (R = true).

Therefore, the statement "Sapphire does not revolutionize magical practices" is false.
