Waylen either seeks social approval or takes risks, but not both. For Waylen, either he conforms to social norms or he embraces his individuality, but these two paths are mutually exclusive. Waylen either seeks social approval or values uniqueness, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Waylen does not find true acceptance.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Waylen takes risks, and “seeks social approval or takes risks, but not both” ⇒ he does not seek social approval.
- Open-minded and “open-minded ⇒ (challenge status quo XOR reject stereotypes)” with “does not challenge status quo” ⇒ he rejects stereotypes.
- “Does not seek social approval” and “seeks social approval XOR values uniqueness” ⇒ he values uniqueness.
- Values uniqueness ∧ rejects stereotypes ⇒ he can embrace his individuality (ability, not necessity).
- We have two exclusive-ors involving conformity:
  - Conform to social norms XOR express authentically.
  - Conform to social norms XOR embrace individuality.
  Since “can embrace” does not entail “does embrace,” we cannot fix whether he conforms or embraces, hence we cannot fix whether he expresses authentically.
- The only route to “finds true acceptance” given is: If he expresses authentically, then he finds true acceptance.
  - If he does express authentically, then he does find true acceptance, making the statement “Waylen does not find true acceptance” false.
  - If he does not express authentically, nothing implies that he finds true acceptance, so we cannot assert its negation either.

Therefore, the truth of “Waylen does not find true acceptance” cannot be determined from the premises.
