Question ID: 131
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Cupcake has golden eyes. If Cupcake is a solitary snake, then she lives in the rainforest. Cupcake is wild. Cupcake either has deadly precision or strikes quickly. Cupcake is not large. Cupcake is not carnivorous. If Cupcake is a wild snake and harmless, then she is not fierce. If Cupcake is aggressive, then she is venomous and dominates her territory. Cupcake has sharp fangs. If Cupcake has black scales, then she either has a coiled body or is large. If Cupcake lives in the rainforest, then she is either fierce or has deadly precision, but not both. For every snake, it is either venomous or non-venomous, but not both. Cupcake does not strike quickly. All snakes that have sharp teeth and attack preys are fierce. All snakes that have a coiled body and sharp fangs are carnivorous. If Cupcake has golden eyes, then she is either a snake that lives in the rainforest or a snake with black scales, but not both. Every snake is either harmless or venomous.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cupcake is non-venomous.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “If Cupcake has golden eyes, then she is either a snake that lives in the rainforest or a snake with black scales, but not both” and “Cupcake has golden eyes,” Cupcake is a snake and must be either rainforest-dwelling or black-scaled.
- If Cupcake had black scales, then (given “If Cupcake has black scales, then she either has a coiled body or is large” and “Cupcake is not large”) she would have a coiled body. With “Cupcake has sharp fangs” and “All snakes that have a coiled body and sharp fangs are carnivorous,” she would be carnivorous, contradicting “Cupcake is not carnivorous.” So Cupcake does not have black scales.
- Therefore, by the earlier exclusive choice, Cupcake is a snake that lives in the rainforest.
- From “Cupcake either has deadly precision or strikes quickly” and “Cupcake does not strike quickly,” Cupcake has deadly precision.
- From “If Cupcake lives in the rainforest, then she is either fierce or has deadly precision, but not both,” and since she has deadly precision, Cupcake is not fierce.
- None of the given rules connect these properties to being venomous or non-venomous. We only know that every snake is either venomous or non-venomous (but not both), yet no rule determines which one applies to Cupcake.

Conclusion: The statement “Cupcake is non-venomous” cannot be determined from the given information.
