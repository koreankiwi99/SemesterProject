==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Ensley is an entrepreneur, and entrepreneurs are either environmentally conscious or support sustainability (but not both). Since Ensley does not support sustainability, she must be environmentally conscious.
- Ensley is a local business owner, and local business owners are either environmentally conscious or live in the suburbs (but not both). Since she is environmentally conscious, she does not live in the suburbs.
- If she is either an urban dweller or lives in the suburbs (but not both), then she is community oriented. With suburbs false, this reduces to: if she is an urban dweller, then she is community oriented. But she is not community oriented, so she is not an urban dweller.
- She is either an urban dweller or a rural resident. With urban dweller false, she is a rural resident.
- She is either a city enthusiast or a rural resident, but not both. With rural resident true, city enthusiast is false.
- She is either a nature lover or a city enthusiast, but not both. With city enthusiast false, she is a nature lover.

Therefore, the statement is true.
