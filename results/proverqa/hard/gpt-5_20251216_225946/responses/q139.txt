- Griffin enjoys learning. Anyone who asks questions and enjoys learning is curious. So Griffin is curious.
- If someone is curious, they seek new experiences; if Griffin seeks new experiences, he travels extensively. Hence Griffin travels extensively.
- Griffin either follows traditions or explores cultures, but not both; and Griffin does not follow traditions. Therefore, Griffin explores cultures.
- If Griffin explores cultures, then he either samples local spirits or creates unique blends. Griffin does not create unique blends, so he samples local spirits.
