Question ID: 157
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Anyone who reads widely and thinks critically can have innovative thoughts. Rosalia is creative. Anyone who keeps detailed notes or measures carefully can value precision. Rosalia is attentive. Rosalia does not rely on intuition. Rosalia conducts experiments. For Rosalia, she is either logical or relies on intuition, but not both. Rosalia does not publish research. If Rosalia can solve complex problems, then she is either creative or logical (but not both). If Rosalia is attentive, then she is either detail-oriented or can appreciate beauty, but not both. If Rosalia loves nature or has a calm mind, then she is likely to make groundbreaking discoveries. Rosalia does not have keen observation. Rosalia does not think outside the box. If Rosalia either makes groundbreaking discoveries or publishes research (but not both), then she has innovative thoughts. If someone conducts experiments, then they value precision. Anyone who has keen observation or loves nature can appreciate beauty. If Rosalia either thinks outside the box or has innovative thoughts (but not both), then she can solve complex problems.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rosalia has a calm mind.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Rosalia is either logical or relies on intuition, but not both” and “Rosalia does not rely on intuition,” we conclude Rosalia is logical.
- Since Rosalia is both creative and logical, the statement “If she can solve complex problems, then she is either creative or logical (but not both)” implies she cannot solve complex problems (contrapositive).
- With “Rosalia does not think outside the box,” the rule “If (thinks outside the box XOR has innovative thoughts) then she can solve complex problems” reduces to “If she has innovative thoughts then she can solve complex problems.” Since she cannot solve complex problems, she does not have innovative thoughts.
- With “Rosalia does not publish research,” the rule “If (makes groundbreaking discoveries XOR publishes research) then innovative thoughts” reduces to “If she makes groundbreaking discoveries then innovative thoughts.” Since she does not have innovative thoughts, she does not make groundbreaking discoveries.
- From “If Rosalia loves nature or has a calm mind, then she makes groundbreaking discoveries,” and the fact she does not make groundbreaking discoveries, we infer (by contrapositive) that she neither loves nature nor has a calm mind.

Therefore, Rosalia does not have a calm mind.
