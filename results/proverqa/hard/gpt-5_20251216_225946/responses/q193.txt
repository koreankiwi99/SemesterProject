Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Ashley lives in harmony with other beings. If she lives in harmony, then she either communicates telepathically or reads minds (or both). She does not communicate telepathically, so she reads minds.
- Ashley has the ability to transform, and she either transforms or controls elements (but not both). Thus, she does not control elements.
- Any mythical creature that either controls elements or reads minds (but not both) possesses special powers. Ashley reads minds and does not control elements, so she possesses special powers.
- If Ashley has unique physical features or possesses special powers, then she plays a protective role. Since she possesses special powers, she plays a protective role.
