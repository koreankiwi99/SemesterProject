Payton conducts experiments. Anyone who works in their field or conducts experiments has practical experience.

If Eithan makes a new discovery, then she receives recognition and earns a prestigious grant. Rosalee is knowledgeable about marine life or passionate about research (or both). Payton does not publish research. If Payton either reads scientific articles or explores the ocean (but not both), then she is knowledgeable about marine life.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Payton is not passionate about research.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Payton conducts experiments, and anyone who conducts experiments has practical experience. So Payton has practical experience.
- Payton sets goals, which implies she studies hard; with thinking creatively, this implies she makes a new discovery.
- Making a new discovery gives her a prestigious grant. Having a prestigious grant implies she either works in her field or publishes research. Since she does not publish research, she must work in her field.
- None of the above entail anything about being passionate about research.
- We are given: Payton is knowledgeable about marine life or passionate about research (or both). We cannot conclude that she is not passionate; nor can we conclude that she is passionate, because we don’t know whether the “knowledgeable” disjunct (or both) holds.
- No other rule forces or forbids passion about research.

Therefore, whether Payton is not passionate about research cannot be determined.

ANSWER: C

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
