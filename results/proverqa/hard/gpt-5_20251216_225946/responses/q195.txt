Question ID: 195
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Taylor does not have social interaction. Jaxton does not build endurance. If Taylor either builds endurance or increases speed (but not both), then he trains regularly. If Jaxton either builds endurance or increases speed (but not both), then he trains regularly. Taylor stays healthy. Every horse either gets proper exercise or receives proper care, but these are not mutually exclusive. If Derek receives proper care, then he can either compete successfully or provide therapy comfort, but not both. If a horse trains regularly and stays healthy, then it can compete successfully. Jaxton either performs tasks or competes successfully. Abigail gains strength or increases speed. Jaxton gains strength or increases speed. Jaxton does not have social interaction. Jaxton stays healthy. Every horse either gets proper exercise or has social interaction, but these are not mutually exclusive. Jaxton does not gain strength. If Jaxton either follows a routine or has discipline (but not both), then he trains regularly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jaxton provides therapy comfort.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Jaxton does not gain strength, and we are told Jaxton gains strength or increases speed. Therefore, Jaxton increases speed.
- For Jaxton: (builds endurance XOR increases speed) implies trains regularly. Since he does not build endurance and does increase speed, the XOR condition holds, so Jaxton trains regularly.
- Jaxton stays healthy, and any horse that trains regularly and stays healthy can compete successfully. Hence, Jaxton competes successfully.
- The only rule involving therapy comfort with an exclusivity condition applies specifically to Derek (if Derek receives proper care, then compete successfully XOR provide therapy comfort). There is no such rule for Jaxton.
- We cannot derive that Jaxton provides therapy comfort, nor can we rule it out. His competing successfully does not, in general, preclude therapy comfort.

ANSWER: C

Result:

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
