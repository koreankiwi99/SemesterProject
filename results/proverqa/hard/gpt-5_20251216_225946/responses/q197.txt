Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Frankie lives in a fantasy world, then he either has supernatural powers or can fly, but not both. If Frankie can navigate the nucleus, then he can either repair DNA or assist transcription, but not both. Frankie can manipulate molecules. Frankie either regulates protein or assists transcription. Frankie either has supernatural powers or has microscopic size, but not both. If Frankie lives in a cell, then he understands biochemistry and knows genetics. Frankie can navigate the nucleus. If Kendall can navigate the nucleus, then he can either repair DNA or assist transcription, but not both. Kendall lives in a fantasy world. If Ximena lives in a fantasy world, then he either has supernatural powers or can fly, but not both. Kendall can fly. Frankie lives in a fantasy world. If Frankie knows genetics, then he will assist in transcription. Frankie can fly. If Frankie has microscopic size, then he lives in a cell and can manipulate molecules.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Frankie can repair DNA.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Frankie lives in a fantasy world and can fly. From “If fantasy, then either supernatural powers or can fly, but not both,” flying implies he does not have supernatural powers.
- From “either supernatural powers or microscopic size, but not both,” and not having supernatural powers, it follows that Frankie has microscopic size.
- Microscopic size implies he lives in a cell; living in a cell implies he knows genetics.
- Knowing genetics implies he assists in transcription.
- Frankie can navigate the nucleus; by that rule, he either repairs DNA or assists transcription, but not both. Since he assists transcription, he does not repair DNA.

ANSWER: B

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
