Question ID: 198
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Gary makes tactical decisions. Gary cannot handle critical situations. If Gary leads others effectively, then he either makes tactical decisions or communicates clearly, but not both. Anyone who thinks quickly and stays calm under pressure can handle critical situations. Gary gains experience or has training. If Gary takes risks, then he either acts impulsively or follows his instincts (but not both). Gary thinks quickly. Gary either performs heroic actions or takes risks. Anyone who prioritizes their own safety and has proper training can respond to emergencies effectively. Anyone who responds to emergencies either stays calm under pressure or leads others effectively (or both). Gary does not gain experience. Gary does not act impulsively. If Gary is brave, then he will perform heroic actions and earn accolades. Gary either prioritizes his own safety or is brave, but Gary may not necessarily do both. Gary does not follow his instincts. Gary communicates clearly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Gary does not earn accolades.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Gary gains experience or has training" and "Gary does not gain experience," Gary has training.
- "If Gary takes risks, then he either acts impulsively or follows his instincts (but not both)." Given Gary does not act impulsively and does not follow his instincts, Gary cannot be taking risks. From "Gary either performs heroic actions or takes risks," it follows Gary performs heroic actions.
- From "Anyone who thinks quickly and stays calm under pressure can handle critical situations," plus "Gary thinks quickly" and "Gary cannot handle critical situations," Gary does not stay calm under pressure.
- "If Gary leads others effectively, then he either makes tactical decisions or communicates clearly, but not both." Gary makes tactical decisions and communicates clearly, so he cannot be leading others effectively (otherwise XOR would fail). Thus Gary does not lead.
- "Anyone who responds to emergencies either stays calm under pressure or leads others effectively." Since Gary neither stays calm nor leads, he does not respond to emergencies.
- "Anyone who prioritizes their own safety and has proper training can respond to emergencies effectively." With training true and not responding, Gary does not prioritize his own safety.
- From "Gary either prioritizes his own safety or is brave," and not prioritizing safety, Gary is brave.
- "If Gary is brave, then he will perform heroic actions and earn accolades." Therefore Gary earns accolades.

Conclusion: The statement "Gary does not earn accolades" is false.
