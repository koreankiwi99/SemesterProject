Question ID: 199
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Stefan asks questions, then he explores opportunities and values experience. Stefan visits a foreign land. Stefan travels abroad. For all humans, if they either have curiosity or ask questions, then they seek knowledge. Stefan listens to podcasts. Anyone who reads widely or meets new people loves learning. If Stefan visits a foreign land, then he either becomes thoughtful or develops cultural appreciation, but not both. If Stefan either listens to podcasts or reads widely (but not both), then he has curiosity. If Stefan travels abroad, then he either immerses himself in the culture or becomes thoughtful (or both). Stefan does not value experience. Stefan does not seek knowledge. If Stefan loves learning, then he develops cultural appreciation and appreciates diversity. For all humans, if they immerse themselves in a culture, then they gain a new perspective.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Stefan does not gain a new perspective.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If Stefan asks questions then he values experience” and “Stefan does not value experience,” we get: Stefan does not ask questions.
- From “If he has curiosity or asks questions then he seeks knowledge” and “Stefan does not seek knowledge,” we get: Stefan does not have curiosity and does not ask questions.
- From “If he listens to podcasts or reads widely (but not both) then he has curiosity” and “Stefan listens to podcasts” with “Stefan does not have curiosity,” we infer it is not an exclusive-or, so he must also read widely.
- Reading widely implies he loves learning; loving learning implies he develops cultural appreciation. So DCA is true.
- From “If he visits a foreign land then exactly one of (thoughtful, DCA)” and DCA true, we get: he is not thoughtful.
- From “If he travels abroad then (immerses in culture or thoughtful)” and not thoughtful, we get: he immerses in the culture.
- Immersing in culture implies he gains a new perspective.

Therefore, Stefan gains a new perspective, so the statement “Stefan does not gain a new perspective” is false.
