Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Anastasia studies ecology” and “If Anastasia studies ecology, then she either advocates for sustainability or educates others (or both)” plus “Anastasia does not educate others,” it follows that Anastasia advocates for sustainability.
- From “Anastasia either has an artistic side or is an entomologist, but not both” and “Anastasia does not have an artistic side,” it follows that Anastasia is an entomologist. Given the entomologist rule (exactly one of caring for the environment or advocating), and she advocates, she does not care for the environment. (This is consistent but not needed for the target.)
- Anastasia nurtures her curiosity, which implies she has curiosity. Using “If Anastasia has curiosity, then she contributes to science and thinks critically,” it follows that Anastasia contributes to science.
- Therefore, the statement “Anastasia either appreciates beauty or contributes to science (or both)” is true because she contributes to science.
