Question ID: 201
Difficulty: hard

Context:
All lemurs that have agility and live in forests can climb trees. Sevyn does not thrive in his habitat. If Sevyn either explores the forest or forages for food (but not both), then he thrives in his habitat. Cookie does not thrive in his habitat. Cookie either takes dust baths or grooms each other, but not both. Sevyn does not ensure their survival. Sevyn plays with his troop. For all lemurs, if they explore the forest and lead the troop, then they ensure the troop's survival. Cookie does not have good health. If Sevyn climbs trees, then he either plays with his troop or grooms each other, but not both. If Lyric climbs trees, then he either plays with his troop or grooms each other, but not both. Sevyn either takes dust baths or grooms each other, but not both. Every lemur either climbs trees or forages for food. Sevyn prioritizes cleanliness. Lyric prioritizes cleanliness. For any lemur, if they prioritize cleanliness and take dust baths, then they have good health. Sevyn does not have good health. If Sevyn either leaps through trees or ventures off trail (but not both), then he explores the forest.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sevyn does not lead the troop.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Sevyn prioritizes cleanliness and does not have good health. From (Clean ∧ DustBaths -> GoodHealth), contrapositive gives ¬GoodHealth -> (¬Clean ∨ ¬DustBaths). Since Clean is true, ¬DustBaths. From Sevyn’s XOR (DustBaths ⊕ Grooms), Grooms is true.
- Sevyn plays with his troop (given). With both Plays and Grooms true, the rule “If Sevyn climbs, then exactly one of Plays or Grooms” forces ¬Climb.
- From “Every lemur either climbs or forages,” ¬Climb implies Forage is true.
- From ¬Thrive and (Explore ⊕ Forage) -> Thrive, we get ¬(Explore ⊕ Forage). Since Forage is true, Explore must also be true.
- From Explore ∧ Lead -> Ensure and ¬Ensure (given), Explore true implies Lead must be false.

Therefore, Sevyn does not lead the troop.
