Question ID: 203
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Lillian is a litterer, then she either damages soil or pollutes water, but not both. Everyone who either disposes waste or damages soil (but not both) harms the ecosystem. Lillian does not dispose waste. Lillian throws trash. Lillian does not harm wildlife. If Lillian neglects nature, then she is either a litterer or ignores rules, but not both. Lillian does not neglect her responsibility. If someone pollutes water and causes environmental harm, then they harm wildlife. Anyone who throws trash is a litterer. Lillian is either a conservationist or an environmental harm doer, but not both. Lillian does not ignore warnings. Whenever someone harms the ecosystem, they either ignore warnings or neglect their responsibility (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lillian is not a conservationist.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Lillian throws trash, so she is a litterer.
- If she is a litterer, then she either damages soil or pollutes water (but not both).
- She does not dispose waste. If she damaged soil, then (dispose waste XOR damage soil) would be true, implying she harms the ecosystem. But anyone who harms the ecosystem must either ignore warnings or neglect responsibility; Lillian does neither. So she does not harm the ecosystem. Hence she does not damage soil; therefore she pollutes water.
- If someone pollutes water and causes environmental harm, they harm wildlife. Lillian does not harm wildlife, so she does not cause environmental harm (does not harm the ecosystem).
- Lillian is either a conservationist or an environmental harm doer (but not both). Since she does not cause environmental harm, she is not an environmental harm doer; thus she must be a conservationist.

Therefore, the statement “Lillian is not a conservationist” is false.
