Question ID: 204
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Noel sees details. If Noel is reflective, then he either cherishes memories or values moments in life, but not both. Everyone who seeks new experiences either lives in the present or embraces change (or both). Noel either appreciates the impermanence of things or resists the impermanence of things, but not both. Noel seeks new experiences. Noel is adaptable. If Noel practices mindfulness, then he either connects with others or finds beauty everywhere (but not both). Noel does not take risks. Carly does not take risks. If someone lives in the present, then they value moments in life and find beauty everywhere. Noel is creative. Anyone who values moments in life appreciates the impermanence of things. Noel does not love nature. Anyone who sees details or loves nature can find beauty everywhere. If Noel has curiosity, then he is both reflective and lives in the present. If Noel is creative, then he either tries new things or takes risks, but not both. If Noel tries new things, then he is either adaptable or open to change, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Noel resists the impermanence of things.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Noel sees details, so by (SD or LN) -> FBE, Noel finds beauty everywhere.
- Noel is creative and does not take risks. From "creative -> (tries new things xor takes risks)" and not takes risks, Noel tries new things.
- From "tries new things -> (adaptable xor open to change)" and given adaptable, it follows open to change is false.
- Noel seeks new experiences, so by "seeks new experiences -> (lives in the present or embraces change)", we only know at least one of lives in the present (LP) or embraces change (EC) holds; which one is not determined.
- If LP were true, then by "LP -> values moments (VM) and FBE" and "VM -> appreciates impermanence (AIP)," we would get AIP true, and since (AIP xor resists impermanence (RIP)), RIP would be false.
- However, LP is not entailed: SNE could be satisfied by EC alone. If LP is false and EC true, then VM need not be true, so AIP need not be true, and (AIP xor RIP) allows RIP to be true without contradiction.
- No other rule forces VM or AIP, nor forces LP, so whether RIP holds cannot be determined.

Conclusion: The truth of "Noel resists the impermanence of things" is not determined by the premises.
