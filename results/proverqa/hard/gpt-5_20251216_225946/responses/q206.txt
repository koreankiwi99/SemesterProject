Question ID: 206
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Anyone who respects their ancestors and preserves their customs understands their heritage. Everyone either has a unique style or tells real stories, but the two are not necessarily related. Cayson does not appreciate history. Every authentic artist is either influenced by traditional styles or tells real stories. Slick does not promote artistic expression. If Slick speaks from the heart and connects with others, then he creates culturally significant work. If someone finds inspiration and has a creative vision, then they can create original work. Slick appreciates history or values diversity. Cayson draws inspiration. Slick is an authentic artist. Slick represents his culture. Slick draws inspiration. Slick expresses emotions. If Slick either expresses emotions or has a unique style (but not both), then he creates original work. Slick does not gain recognition. Slick respects his ancestors. Anyone who represents their culture either preserves customs or promotes artistic expression (or both). If Slick understands his heritage and values diversity, then he creates culturally significant work. If Slick draws inspiration and creates original work, then he gains recognition. Slick does not appreciate history.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Slick is influenced by modern styles.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Slick represents his culture and does not promote artistic expression, so he preserves customs. With respecting his ancestors, he understands his heritage. From “appreciates history or values diversity” and “does not appreciate history,” Slick values diversity, which with understanding his heritage implies he creates culturally significant work (not essential for the target claim).
- Slick draws inspiration and does not gain recognition. Since “if Slick draws inspiration and creates original work, then he gains recognition,” it follows that he does not create original work.
- Slick expresses emotions, and “(expresses emotions XOR unique style) → original work.” Because he does not create original work, the XOR antecedent must be false; given he expresses emotions, this forces that he also has a unique style.
- As an authentic artist, Slick is either influenced by traditional styles or tells real stories. Nothing links “modern styles” to these predicates, and no premise mentions modern styles or relates them to traditional styles (e.g., exclusivity).

Conclusion: There is no information to determine whether Slick is influenced by modern styles.
