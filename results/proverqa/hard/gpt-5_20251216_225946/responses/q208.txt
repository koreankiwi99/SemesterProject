Question ID: 208
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Gatlin has support. Gatlin does not learn from his mistakes. Everyone pursues their passions or sets goals. Gatlin builds resilience. Anyone who remains focused and builds resilience can overcome obstacles. Gatlin experiences failure. If someone has support and pursues their passions, then they find motivation. If Gatlin experiences failure, then he either remains focused or learns from his mistakes (but not both). If someone sets goals and overcomes obstacles, then they will achieve success. Gatlin does not find motivation.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Gatlin faces setbacks.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Gatlin has support and does not find motivation. If someone has support and pursues their passions, then they find motivation. Therefore, Gatlin does not pursue his passions.
- Everyone pursues their passions or sets goals. Since Gatlin does not pursue his passions, he must set goals.
- Gatlin experiences failure, and if he experiences failure then he either remains focused or learns from his mistakes (but not both). Given Gatlin does not learn from his mistakes, he must remain focused.
- Anyone who remains focused and builds resilience can overcome obstacles. Gatlin builds resilience, so he can overcome obstacles.
- If someone sets goals and overcomes obstacles, then they will achieve success. Therefore, Gatlin will achieve success.
- There is no given rule connecting “experiences failure” to “faces setbacks,” and “faces setbacks” is not stated elsewhere. Thus, whether Gatlin faces setbacks cannot be logically derived from the provided statements.
