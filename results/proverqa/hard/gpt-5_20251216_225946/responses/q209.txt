==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "If Timothy remains focused, then he will work under pressure" and "Timothy remains focused," Timothy works under pressure.
- From "Everyone who works under pressure either exercises self-control or thinks cautiously (or both)" and "Timothy does not think cautiously," Timothy exercises self-control.
- From "For anyone who faces challenges and exercises self-control, they can stay calm" and "Timothy faces challenges," Timothy stays calm.
- From "If Timothy takes risks and stays calm, then he is a hero" and "Timothy takes risks," Timothy is a hero.
- From "If Timothy either acts quickly or makes decisive moves (but not both), then he handles emergencies" and "Timothy does not handle emergencies," it follows that not(acts quickly XOR makes decisive moves). Given "Timothy does not make decisive moves," this implies Timothy does not act quickly.
- From "Timothy either acts quickly or is brave" and "Timothy does not act quickly," Timothy is brave.
- No statements relate being (not) skilled to any derived properties. Therefore, whether Timothy is not skilled cannot be determined.
