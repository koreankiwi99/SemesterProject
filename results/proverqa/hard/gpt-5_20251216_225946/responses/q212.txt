Question:

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Anyone who preserves cultural heritage or celebrates local history supports artistic expression” and “Malik does not support artistic expression,” by contrapositive Malik neither preserves cultural heritage nor celebrates local history (the latter also stated directly).
- Malik does not design street murals. We have no information that he creates public art, engages in street art, tells local stories, promotes cultural exchange, contributes to cultural identity, or represents his community.
- No premise links any of these properties to “enhancing the beauty of his community,” and there is no rule that allows us to infer that Malik does or does not enhance community beauty.

Therefore, the statement cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: C
