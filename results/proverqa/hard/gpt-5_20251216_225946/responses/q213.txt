Question ID: 213
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Mekhi faces adversity, then he will show resilience and find a way to overcome it. Trenton either experiences failure or avoids risks. If Landen learns from his mistakes, then he will achieve success. Musa does not gain recognition. If Trenton faces adversity, then he will either become stronger or stay motivated, but not both.

Musa becomes stronger. If Mekhi sets goals and achieves success, then he will gain recognition. Musa sets goals. Mekhi becomes stronger. Musa does not avoid risks. If Musa learns from his mistakes, then he will achieve success. If Musa sets goals and achieves success, then he will gain recognition. If Musa faces adversity, then he will either become stronger or stay motivated, but not both. If Musa experiences failure, then he will either learn from his mistakes or stay motivated, but not both. Musa either experiences failure or avoids risks. Musa either has determination or stays motivated.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Musa does not find a way to overcome.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Musa does not avoid risks, and “Musa either experiences failure or avoids risks” implies Musa experiences failure.
- With failure and “If Musa experiences failure, then either learn from mistakes or stay motivated (but not both),” Musa is either learning or motivated.
- Musa sets goals and does not gain recognition. From “If Musa sets goals and achieves success, then he will gain recognition,” it follows Musa does not achieve success.
- From “If Musa learns from his mistakes, then he will achieve success” and not success, Musa did not learn from his mistakes. Hence, from the earlier XOR, Musa stays motivated.
- Musa becomes stronger is given. If Musa faced adversity, then he would have to be either stronger or motivated, but not both. Since he is both stronger and motivated, he cannot be facing adversity.
- No rule links Musa to “finding a way to overcome”; that phrase appears only for Mekhi. Not facing adversity does not, by any given rule, imply Musa cannot find a way to overcome.

Therefore, whether Musa finds a way to overcome is not determined by the premises.
