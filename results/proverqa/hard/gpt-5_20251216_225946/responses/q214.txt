Question ID: 214
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Anyone who outperforms others or gets recognition inspires others. If someone has endurance or has quick reflexes, then they perform well. Jamari cannot lead his team successfully. Everyone either has endurance or has good speed, but not both is not necessarily true. Martin either excels under pressure or has strong technique, but not both. Jamari has quick reflexes. For all humans, if someone is a good footballer, then they either have good speed or have good agility (or both). Jamari has strategic skills. If Jamari either trains regularly or eats nutritious food (but not both), then he has endurance. Megan has quick reflexes. Jamari does not inspire others. Aya does not inspire others. If Jamari has good agility and strong technique, then he will outperform others. If Martin has good agility and strong technique, then he will outperform others. Jamari either excels under pressure or has strong technique, but not both. Jamari does not excel under pressure. If someone has strategic skills and performs well, then they can lead their team successfully. Megan cannot lead his team successfully. Martin does not excel under pressure.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jamari is a good footballer.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Anyone who outperforms others or gets recognition inspires others" and "Jamari does not inspire others," we infer that Jamari neither outperforms others nor gets recognition (modus tollens and De Morgan).
- Jamari either excels under pressure or has strong technique, but not both; and Jamari does not excel under pressure. Therefore, Jamari has strong technique.
- If Jamari had both good agility and strong technique, he would outperform others. Since he does not outperform and he does have strong technique, Jamari does not have good agility.
- Jamari has quick reflexes, so he performs well.
- Being a good footballer implies having good speed or good agility. We have shown Jamari does not have good agility, so if he were a good footballer he would need to have good speed. However, the premises do not establish whether Jamari has good speed. The statement that everyone has endurance or good speed (not necessarily exclusively) does not guarantee Jamari specifically has good speed.

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Jamari is a good footballer.
