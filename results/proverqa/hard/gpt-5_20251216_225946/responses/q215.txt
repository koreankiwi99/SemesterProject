Charli either gains practical experience or reads widely, but not both. Samantha does not put in diligent effort. Samantha works under a mentor. Samantha attends seminars.

If Samantha has either formal education or natural talent (but not both), then she is successful. Samantha achieves recognition.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Samantha is not successful.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Samantha works under a mentor ⇒ she gains practical experience (PE).
- Given PE ⊕ reads widely (RW), PE true implies RW false.
- Samantha attends seminars (AS). Since RW false and AS true, RW ⊕ AS holds ⇒ she has formal education (FE).
- Samantha does not put in diligent effort (¬DE), and DE ∨ hard work ethic (HWE) ⇒ HWE true.
- Samantha achieves recognition (AR), and AR ⇒ (natural talent (NT) ⊕ HWE). With HWE true, XOR forces NT false.
- Since FE true and NT false, FE ⊕ NT holds ⇒ by (FE ⊕ NT) ⇒ successful.

Therefore, Samantha is successful, so the statement “Samantha is not successful” is false.

ANSWER: B

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
