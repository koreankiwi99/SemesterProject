Question ID: 216
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Colten either works independently or lends a helping hand, but not both. All mechanically inclined people fix broken things and enjoy problem-solving. Colten either fixes broken things or reads manuals, but not necessarily both. Colten is either intelligent or kind-hearted (or both). Colten either works independently or follows directions, but not both. Colten listens carefully. Everyone who lends a helping hand either fixes broken things or has common sense (or both). A person either has common sense or is intelligent, but not necessarily both. Colten reads manuals. Anyone who listens carefully or asks questions can follow directions.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Colten is kind-hearted.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Colten listens carefully, so he can follow directions.
- From “works independently or follows directions, but not both,” and since he follows directions, he does not work independently.
- From “works independently or lends a helping hand, but not both,” and since he does not work independently, he lends a helping hand.
- If he lends a helping hand, then he either fixes broken things or has common sense (or both).
- He reads manuals, but that doesn't force whether he fixes broken things.
- If he lacks common sense, then he must fix broken things; also, everyone has either common sense or is intelligent. So it’s consistent that he is intelligent and not kind-hearted. It’s also consistent that he has common sense and is kind-hearted (if not intelligent).

Thus, whether Colten is kind-hearted cannot be determined.

ANSWER: C

Result:

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
