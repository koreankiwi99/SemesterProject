Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Heaven discovers natural remedies.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Heaven runs a small business and does not support environmental causes. From the small-business rule (supports environmental causes XOR fosters local economies), Heaven must foster local economies.
- If (builds a strong community XOR fosters local economies) then drives social change. Since Heaven does not drive social change and does foster local economies, it follows she also builds a strong community (so the XOR would be false).
- From (builds a strong community XOR creates successful products), with builds a strong community true, creates successful products must be false.
- Heaven does not find innovative solutions. Given that (values sustainability OR is passionate about nature) implies finding innovative solutions, we conclude Heaven neither values sustainability nor is passionate about nature.
- There is no rule connecting Heaven to discovering natural remedies. The only rule about discovering natural remedies pertains specifically to Fiona. Also, not being passionate about nature does not imply not discovering natural remedies.

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Heaven discovers natural remedies.
