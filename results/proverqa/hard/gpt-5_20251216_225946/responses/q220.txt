Question ID: 220
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Dangelo cooperates with others. Antonio communicates clearly. Either Clay has distinctive features or he looks like other polar bears, but not both. If Dangelo is an experienced hunter, then he either has distinctive features or has earned respect from others (or both). Clay either lives in groups or adapts to his environment, but these two are not necessarily related. Clay cooperates with others. Clay has courage. Every polar bear adapts to the environment or is an experienced hunter. Any polar bear that has battle scars or is large in size has distinctive features. If Clay has social skills and cooperates with others, then he tends to live in groups. If Clay has courage, then he either has respect or is intelligent, but not both. If Clay is an experienced hunter, then he either has distinctive features or has earned respect from others (or both). Clay is intelligent. If Chris has social skills and cooperates with others, then he tends to live in groups. Every polar bear who leads others either builds strong bonds with fellow bears or has social skills (or both). Clay communicates clearly. Antonio is intelligent. If Clay listens actively or communicates clearly, then he has social skills.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Clay does not look like other polar bears.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Clay communicates clearly, so by (listens actively or communicates clearly) -> social skills, Clay has social skills.
- Clay has social skills and cooperates with others, so by (social skills and cooperates) -> lives in groups, Clay lives in groups.
- Clay has courage, and courage implies respect XOR intelligence. Since Clay is intelligent, he does not have respect.
- If Clay were an experienced hunter, then (distinctive features or respect). Since he does not have respect, being an experienced hunter would force distinctive features.
- However, we cannot deduce that Clay is an experienced hunter. The rule “every polar bear adapts to the environment or is an experienced hunter” allows that he may only adapt.
- We also have an exclusive-or: either Clay has distinctive features or he looks like other polar bears, but not both. Without establishing distinctive features, we cannot rule out that he looks like other polar bears.

Conclusion: It cannot be determined whether Clay does not look like other polar bears.
