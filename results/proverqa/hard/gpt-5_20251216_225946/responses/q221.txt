Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Matias is resilient.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Matias is a professional athlete and stays disciplined. From the XOR rule (professional athlete → seeks feedback XOR stays disciplined), this implies Matias does not seek feedback.
- From (seeks feedback XOR believes in himself), not seeking feedback implies Matias believes in himself.
- Matias does not analyze errors. The rule (learns from mistakes XOR analyzes errors) → able to overcome obstacles reduces to (learns from mistakes → able to overcome obstacles). Given Matias is not able to overcome obstacles, by contrapositive he does not learn from mistakes.
- Matias faces setbacks; the rule says he either learns from mistakes or works hard. Since he does not learn from mistakes, he must work hard.
- Believes in himself and works hard implies he strives for success; hence he has ambition, sets goals, and is determined. 
- However, it is explicitly given that Matias is not able to overcome obstacles. Resilience corresponds to being able to overcome obstacles, so Matias is not resilient.
