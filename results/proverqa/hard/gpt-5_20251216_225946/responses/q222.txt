If Dr. Archie studies plant properties, then he will develop new treatments. Any botanist who explores remote areas or analyzes botanical data will study plant properties. If a botanist reads scientific literature and conducts experiments, then they can analyze botanical data. Dr. Archie does not publish research findings. Dr. Archie does not collect plant samples. If Dr. Archie either makes new discoveries or develops new treatments (but not both), then he leads in his field. Archie mentors students. Every botanist either collects plant samples or analyzes botanical data, but not necessarily both. Any botanist who loves nature will understand plant life. If Dr. Archie conducts experiments and tests hypotheses, then he can develop new treatments. Dr. Archie is either a leader in his field or mentors students, but not necessarily both. Dr. Archie either understands plant life or publishes research findings, but not both.

Model Response:
==================================================
- Dr. Archie does not publish research findings.
- Given the exclusive-or statement “either understands plant life or publishes research findings,” this implies Dr. Archie understands plant life.
- There is no statement linking “understands plant life,” being a leader, developing treatments, or any other given property to “having specialized knowledge.”
- It is not stated that Dr. Archie is a botanist, so rules about “any botanist …” cannot be directly applied to him.
- “Specialized knowledge” is not defined or entailed by the provided predicates.

ANSWER: C
