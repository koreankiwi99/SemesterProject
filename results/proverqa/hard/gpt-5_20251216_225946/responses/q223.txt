  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Shay has a lot of imaginations," we get: Shay enjoys creating things and thinks outside the box.
- Shay is detail-oriented, and the rule says: detail-oriented implies exactly one of (takes pride in work, enjoys creating things). Since she enjoys creating things, she does not take pride in her work.
- Shay strives for excellence, and we are told she seeks feedback. The exclusive-or rule then implies she does not have perfectionism.
- If someone values quality, then they either take pride in their work or have perfectionism. Since Shay has neither, she does not value quality.
- From "Shay values quality or is skilled" and not valuing quality, we infer Shay is skilled.
- From "If she sets high standards, then she has perfectionism" and not having perfectionism, we infer she does not set high standards.
- From "Either Shay is a famous artist or she remains anonymous, but not both" and given that she remains anonymous, we infer she is not a famous artist.

None of the provided statements relate to whether Shay’s work is viral. Anonymity does not logically preclude virality, and no rule connects any of Shay’s traits to virality. Therefore, the truth of "Shay's work is not viral" cannot be determined.
