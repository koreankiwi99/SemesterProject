Marlon does not nuzzle her owners. If Snuggems either nuzzles her owners or curls up tightly (but not both), then she purrs frequently. Marlon does not eat well. Snuggems is curious. Snuggems does not eat well. Snuggems enjoys attention. If Snuggems either likes engine noise or bats at wires (but not both), then she curls up tightly. For any cat, if it plays with toys and is lovable, then it brings joy. Snuggems does not climb high. If Snuggems is either mechanically inclined or affectionate (but not both), then she is lovable.

If Marlon is curious, then she either chases feathers or climbs high, but not both. If Snuggems either catches mice or bats strings (but not both), then she plays with toys.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “All cats that sleep soundly eat well and look healthy” and Snuggems does not eat well/does not look healthy, Snuggems does not sleep soundly (contrapositive). With “Every cat either sleeps soundly or curls up tightly,” Snuggems curls up tightly.
- Snuggems does not nuzzle her owners. So XOR(nuzzle, curl) holds, hence Snuggems purrs frequently. With “purrs frequently” and “enjoys attention,” Snuggems is affectionate.
- Snuggems is curious and does not climb high, so by the XOR rule she chases feathers.
- From “If XOR(plays with toys, chases feathers) then has fun” and Snuggems does not have fun, not-XOR holds; since she chases feathers, she also plays with toys.
- With plays with toys and “If plays with toys and lovable then brings joy” plus “Snuggems does not bring joy,” Snuggems is not lovable.
- Using “If XOR(mechanically inclined, affectionate) then lovable”: since Snuggems is affectionate and not lovable, the antecedent must be false. Given affectionate is true, XOR would be true exactly when she is not mechanically inclined; thus the antecedent being false implies she is mechanically inclined.

Therefore, “Snuggems is not mechanically inclined” is false.
