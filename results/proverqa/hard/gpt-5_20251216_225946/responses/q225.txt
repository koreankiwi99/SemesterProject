Question ID: 225
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If someone engages in yoga and gets enough sleep, then they feel rejuvenated. Carly has clarity. Everyone who reduces stress either finds balance or increases calmness (or both). If Carly lives longer, then she does not necessarily age gracefully, and if Carly ages gracefully, then she does not necessarily live longer. Carly does not stay positive. Everyone who exercises regularly either improves their mood or boosts their energy (or both). Carly does not feel rejuvenated. Everyone either has clarity or finds balance, but it's not always both at the same time. Carly stays hydrated. If Carly either reduces stress or improves her mood (but not both), then she stays positive. If Carly either gets enough sleep or stays hydrated (but not both), then she ages gracefully. Carly does not boost her energy. Carly engages in yoga. Carly does not increase calmness. Carly either exercises regularly or has good health.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Carly does not eat alkaline-rich foods.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From: If someone engages in yoga and gets enough sleep, then they feel rejuvenated. Given Carly engages in yoga and does not feel rejuvenated, it follows she does not get enough sleep.
- Given Carly stays hydrated and the rule: If Carly either gets enough sleep or stays hydrated (but not both), then she ages gracefully. Since she does not get enough sleep but does stay hydrated, she ages gracefully.
- From: If Carly either reduces stress or improves her mood (but not both), then she stays positive. Given Carly does not stay positive, the exclusive-or antecedent is false; thus reduces stress and improves mood are either both true or both false. Undetermined which.
- From: Everyone who exercises regularly either improves their mood or boosts their energy (or both), and Carly does not boost her energy. If she exercises, then she improves her mood; but we only know she either exercises regularly or has good health, so this remains undetermined.
- None of the given statements mention eating alkaline-rich foods or connect diet to any other provided predicates.

Conclusion: There is no information to determine whether Carly eats alkaline-rich foods.
