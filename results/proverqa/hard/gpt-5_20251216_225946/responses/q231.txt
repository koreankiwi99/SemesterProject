Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Brittany is an innovative artist.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Brittany appreciates serenity, so she values her privacy. Given the XOR (emotional depth or values privacy), Brittany does not exhibit emotional depth.
- Brittany does not have an original style, and she also lacks emotional depth. By contrapositive of “if someone stands out, then they either have an original style or exhibit emotional depth,” Brittany does not stand out.
- If (create unique masterpieces XOR develop new techniques) then Brittany stands out. Brittany does not develop new techniques, and she does not stand out; therefore, she does not create unique masterpieces.
- If Brittany is an innovative artist, then she creates unique masterpieces. Since she does not create unique masterpieces, she is not an innovative artist.
