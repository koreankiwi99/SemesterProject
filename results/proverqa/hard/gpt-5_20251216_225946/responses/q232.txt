Question ID: 232
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Kaylani does not explore culture. If James lives happily and has good relationships, then he can achieve his life goals. James does not meditate regularly. James has good health. James does not appreciate wildlife. James either engages in sports or reads books. If James sets life goals, then he either reads books or pursues hobbies. For all humans, if someone feels calm and has good health, then they can live happily. James has good relationships. Kaylani does not appreciate wildlife. If James engages in sports, then he either meditates regularly or practices mindfulness, but not both. James does not value knowledge. If James either connects with nature or appreciates wildlife (but not both), then he feels calm. James does not achieve his life goals. James does not explore culture. If a person reads books, then they value knowledge and explore culture. James either practices mindfulness or embarks on long journeys, but not necessarily both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? James does not find inner peace.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "If a person reads books, then they value knowledge and explore culture" and "James does not value knowledge," by contrapositive James does not read books.
- Given "James either engages in sports or reads books," and he does not read books, James engages in sports.
- From "If James engages in sports, then he either meditates regularly or practices mindfulness, but not both," and "James does not meditate regularly," it follows that James practices mindfulness.
- The only rule connecting to inner peace (interpreted as feeling calm) is: "If James either connects with nature or appreciates wildlife (but not both), then he feels calm." We know James does not appreciate wildlife, but we have no information about whether he connects with nature, so we cannot conclude whether he feels calm.
- No given rule states that practicing mindfulness implies feeling calm.

Conclusion: Whether James finds inner peace is not determined by the premises.
