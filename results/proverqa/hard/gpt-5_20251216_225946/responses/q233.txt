Context:
If Boone is a meticulous artist, then he produces high-quality soaps and innovates recipes. Albert takes pride in his work. Boone either follows traditional methods or uses natural ingredients, but not both. If Hayden either mass-produces goods or creates unique items (but not both), then he is a custom maker. Boone does not value handcrafting. Albert does not value handcrafting. If Boone either follows traditional methods or values handcrafting (but not both), then he is a craftsman. Boone is either a craftsman or mass-produces goods, but not both. Boone creates unique items. Boone is not a custom maker. If Albert either follows traditional methods or values handcrafting (but not both), then he is a craftsman. Natalie is a passionate craftsman. If Boone either mass-produces goods or creates unique items (but not both), then he is a custom maker. Hayden shares knowledge. Anyone who uses machinery and follows a standardized process can mass-produce goods. Natalie is not a custom maker. Hayden either follows traditional methods or uses natural ingredients, but not both. Natalie is either a craftsman or mass-produces goods, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Boone is a skilled soap maker.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Given Boone creates unique items (UI) and the rule: If exactly one of mass-produces (MP) or UI holds, then Boone is a custom maker (CM). Since Boone is not a custom maker, the XOR condition must be false. With UI true, this forces MP to also be true.
- From XOR(craftsman, MP) and MP true, Boone is not a craftsman.
- Given Boone does not value handcrafting (¬VH) and the rule: XOR(follows traditional methods FTM, VH) -> craftsman, this reduces to FTM -> craftsman. Since Boone is not a craftsman, FTM must be false.
- From XOR(FTM, uses natural ingredients UNI) and FTM false, we get UNI true.
- The only statement linking soap quality is: If Boone is a meticulous artist, then he produces high-quality soaps. There is no information that Boone is a meticulous artist, nor any other rule implying “skilled soap maker.” We also cannot infer its negation.

Conclusion: The truth of “Boone is a skilled soap maker” cannot be determined from the given information.
