Question ID: 237
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Eren does not follow orders. If Marco is either a fearless leader or inspires others (but not both), then he leads by example. Eren inspires others. Raiden does not follow orders. If someone is a young soldier, then they follow orders and respect their superiors. If Eren is a warrior, then he is either a determined fighter or a self-serving traitor, but not both. If Eren is either a fearless leader or inspires others (but not both), then he leads by example. If Eren abandons friends and prioritizes himself, then he can be a cowardly deserter. If Eren has strong convictions, then he is a fearless leader. Eren either compromises his values or stands by his principles, but he does not do both. Eren does not lead by example. If Daisy is a young soldier, then he is either a fearless leader or a determined fighter, but not both. Eren does not compromise his values. Raiden does not join the military. If Marco joins the military, then he either faces adversity or serves with honor. Raiden does not compromise his values. Daisy does not put others first. If Daisy faces adversity, then he either stands by his principles or is a cowardly deserter (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Eren is either a determined fighter or a cowardly deserter, but not both.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Eren inspires others.
- If XOR(fearless leader, inspires) then leads by example. Eren does not lead by example, so by contrapositive, NOT XOR(fearless leader, inspires). Since Eren inspires, this implies Eren is also a fearless leader.
- Eren either compromises his values or stands by his principles, but not both; and he does not compromise his values. Therefore, he stands by his principles.
- The only rules linking to “determined fighter” or “cowardly deserter” are:
  - If Eren is a warrior, then XOR(determined fighter, self-serving traitor). We don’t know Eren is a warrior.
  - If Eren abandons friends and prioritizes himself, then he can be a cowardly deserter. We have no such facts.
- No given rule connects fearless leader or standing by principles to being a determined fighter or a cowardly deserter.

Therefore, we cannot determine whether Eren is a determined fighter or a cowardly deserter, or whether exactly one holds.
