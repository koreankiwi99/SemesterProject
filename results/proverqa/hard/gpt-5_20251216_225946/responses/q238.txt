Question ID: 238
Difficulty: hard

Context:
For all botanists, if they investigate plant reproduction and explore self-fertilization, then they can study autogamy. Atharv collects plant samples. Dante investigates plant reproduction. Alec develops new theories. Atharv develops new theories. If Dr. Alec studies autogamy, then he will make groundbreaking discoveries and contribute to agriculture. If Dr. Atharv analyzes plant mechanisms, then he will explore self-fertilization. Dr. June either publishes research or makes groundbreaking discoveries. If Dr. Atharv collects plant samples, then he either develops new theories or earns academic recognition, but not both. If Dr. Atharv studies autogamy, then he will make groundbreaking discoveries and contribute to agriculture. If Dr. Atharv conducts fieldwork, then he either publishes research or earns academic recognition. Dr. Atharv conducts fieldwork. Atharv investigates plant reproduction. Dr. Atharv analyzes plant mechanisms. Dr. June analyzes plant mechanisms. If Dr. June analyzes plant mechanisms, then he will explore self-fertilization. Alec collects plant samples.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Atharv contributes to agriculture.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Dr. Atharv analyzes plant mechanisms and If Dr. Atharv analyzes plant mechanisms, then he will explore self-fertilization, we get: Dr. Atharv explores self-fertilization.
- Given Atharv investigates plant reproduction. Using the rule For all botanists, if they investigate plant reproduction and explore self-fertilization, then they can study autogamy, we can at most conclude he can study autogamy (and only if he is a botanist), not that he does study autogamy.
- The only route to contributing to agriculture for Atharv given is If Dr. Atharv studies autogamy, then he will make groundbreaking discoveries and contribute to agriculture. We do not have that he studies autogamy, only that he can (a possibility, not an actuality).
- Other facts (collects samples, develops new theories, conducts fieldwork, publishes research) do not entail contributing to agriculture.

Therefore, whether Dr. Atharv contributes to agriculture cannot be deduced.

ANSWER: C

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
