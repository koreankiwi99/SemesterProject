Question ID: 239
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Elsie does not embrace uncertainty. Elsie does not face adversity. Eva values self-improvement. If Wynter loses direction in life, then she will find a new purpose. If someone faces challenges and stays curious, then they take risks. If Eva pursues her passion, then she discovers resilience and has a setback. If Elsie pursues her passion, then she discovers resilience and has a setback. Eva does not embrace uncertainty. Eva reflects on her actions. If someone takes risks and reflects on their actions, then they gain wisdom. If Neil overcomes obstacles, then she either learns from her mistakes or gains wisdom (or both). If someone meets a dead end, then they have experienced failure. Wynter did not lose direction in life. Neil is adventurous. If Eva achieves success, then she either develops patience or gains wisdom (but not both). Eva is adventurous. Elsie values self-improvement. Anyone who is adventurous either takes risks or embraces uncertainty (or both). If Eva values self-improvement, then she pursues her passion and has mentorship. If Wynter values self-improvement, then she pursues her passion and has mentorship.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Eva had a setback or experienced failure, then she can find a new purpose.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Eva values self-improvement, so she pursues her passion and has mentorship. From pursuing her passion, Eva discovers resilience and has a setback. Therefore, the antecedent (“Eva had a setback or experienced failure”) is true.
- We also know Eva is adventurous and does not embrace uncertainty; thus she takes risks. She reflects on her actions, so she gains wisdom. None of these facts connect to finding a new purpose.
- The only rule about finding a new purpose is specific to Wynter: if Wynter loses direction in life, then she will find a new purpose. There is no rule linking Eva’s setback or failure to finding a new purpose, nor any rule preventing it.

Conclusion: Whether Eva can find a new purpose does not logically follow from the given information.

ANSWER: C
