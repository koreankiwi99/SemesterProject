Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Aliza is a skilled craftswoman, then she either works independently or is an experienced quarryman, but not both. Aliza is attentive to detail. If Penny either spots high-quality stone or extracts precise cuts (but not both), then she masters stonework. Penny understands geology or knows masonry. Penny does not create lasting structures. Penny has engineering skills. Penny is attentive to detail. Penny works independently. If someone understands geology and extracts precise cuts, then they can create lasting structures. If Aliza is an experienced quarryman, then she either spots high-quality stone or earns the respect of her colleagues (or both). If Aliza is attentive to detail, then she is a skilled craftswoman. Penny either works with rock or is an experienced quarryman. Ocean either knows masonry or has engineering skills, but not both. Penny either knows masonry or has engineering skills, but not both. Haven understands geology or knows masonry. Anyone who works with stone either knows masonry or builds structures. Penny does not master stonework. If Aliza either spots high-quality stone or extracts precise cuts (but not both), then she masters stonework. Ocean has engineering skills. If Penny is a skilled craftswoman, then she either works independently or is an experienced quarryman, but not both. If Penny is attentive to detail, then she is a skilled craftswoman.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Penny earns the respect of her colleagues.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Penny is attentive to detail, so she is a skilled craftswoman.
- For skilled craftswomen, either they work independently or are experienced quarrymen, but not both. Penny works independently, so she is not an experienced quarryman.
- Penny either works with rock or is an experienced quarryman; since she is not an experienced quarryman, she works with rock.
- Penny has engineering skills and must have exactly one of {knows masonry, engineering skills}, so she does not know masonry. Given she must either understand geology or know masonry, she understands geology.
- If someone understands geology and extracts precise cuts, they create lasting structures. Penny does not create lasting structures, so she does not extract precise cuts.
- If Penny either spots high-quality stone or extracts precise cuts (but not both), then she masters stonework. Penny does not master stonework; combined with not extracting precise cuts, she also does not spot high-quality stone.
- No rule links Penny to earning the respect of her colleagues; that condition appears only in a rule about Aliza. Therefore, nothing in the premises determines whether Penny earns respect.
