Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Michelle is creative.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Michelle is artistic. By the rule “If Michelle is artistic, then she either captures imaginations or inspires children,” she either captures imaginations or inspires children.
- If she captured imaginations, then by “Anyone who captures imaginations either tells stories or sparks curiosity,” and since Michelle does not spark curiosity, she would have to tell stories. Together with “Michelle paints vibrantly,” the rule “If someone tells stories and paints vibrantly, then they can connect with others” would make her able to connect. But Michelle cannot connect with others. Therefore, she does not capture imaginations, and hence she inspires children.
- Michelle is not able to express herself. By “Everyone who either thinks outside the box or brings joy to adults is able to express themselves,” contrapositive gives that she neither thinks outside the box nor brings joy to adults.
- Michelle embraces uncertainty and does not think outside the box, so the XOR condition holds for “embraces uncertainty or thinks outside the box,” implying she is able to find unique solutions.
- Michelle pursues her passions, so she is open-minded. Also, “Michelle is curious or explores new ideas” and “Michelle does not explore new ideas” together imply she is curious. But “If Michelle is open-minded, then she is either curious or able to find unique solutions (but not both)” creates a conflict with the previous derivation (both curious and able to find unique solutions). The premises are thus inconsistent on that point.
- Regarding creativity: “If Michelle is creative, then she can either inspire children or bring joy to adults, but not both.” We already have she inspires children and does not bring joy to adults, which is consistent with being creative. However, nothing given implies that she is creative, nor that she is not.

Conclusion: Michelle’s creativity cannot be determined from the information.
