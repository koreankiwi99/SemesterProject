Question ID: 242
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Skyla does not enjoy outdoor activities. Skyla works for a wildlife refuge. If Skyla travels frequently, then she either appreciates nature or collects art (but not both). If Skyla has expertise, then she speaks publicly and creates awareness. Skyla does not advocate for ecology. Anyone who supports sustainable practices or advocates for ecology can inspire others. Skyla either preserves water or supports sustainable practices. If Skyla inspires others, then she either leads by example or creates awareness (but not both). Skyla collects art. Skyla leads by example. Skyla learns new languages. Skyla explores cultures. Skyla has expertise. If Skyla works for a wildlife refuge, then she either supports sustainable practices or protects endangered species (but not both). Everyone who either has a passion for botany or loves gardening (but not both) appreciates nature. For Skyla, she either enjoys outdoor activities or has a love for gardening, but not necessarily both. If Skyla learns new languages and explores cultures, then she travels frequently.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Skyla has a passion for botany and either studies rare flowers or conserves natural habitats (or both).

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Learns new languages and explores cultures -> travels frequently.
- Travels frequently and collects art with XOR rule -> appreciates nature is false.
- Does not enjoy outdoor activities, and “either enjoys outdoor activities or loves gardening (not necessarily both)” -> loves gardening is true.
- If passion for botany were false, then (passion for botany XOR loves gardening) would be true, implying appreciates nature true, contradicting appreciates nature false. Therefore, passion for botany must be true.
- Works for a wildlife refuge -> supports sustainable practices XOR protects endangered species.
- If supports sustainable practices were true, then (supports sustainable practices or advocates ecology) -> inspires others. With expertise -> creates awareness, and also leads by example is true, this would violate the XOR in “if inspires others then either leads by example or creates awareness (but not both).” Therefore supports sustainable practices is false, so protects endangered species is true. Also from “preserves water or supports sustainable practices,” with supports false, preserves water is true.
- There is no given link between protecting endangered species or preserving water and “conserves natural habitats,” nor any information about “studies rare flowers.”

Conclusion:
- Passion for botany is true.
- Whether she studies rare flowers or conserves natural habitats is not determined.
