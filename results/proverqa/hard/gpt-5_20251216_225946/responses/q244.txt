Mila manages her time effectively. Travis does not have experience. If Detective Mila either examines evidence or analyzes data (but not both), then she is detail-oriented. Mila is not focused. Anyone who prioritizes tasks or maintains records is organized. Anyone who is organized either handles pressure well or achieves their objectives (or both). Mila does not have experience.

Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Detective Mila is meticulous, or procedural, or detail-oriented.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Mila sets clear goals and manages her time effectively. From “If Mila sets clear goals, then exactly one of (manages time, achieves objectives) holds,” we get AchievesObjectives(Mila) = false.
- Mila lacks experience. From “If Mila remains calm, then she has experience,” we get RemainsCalm(Mila) = false (modus tollens).
- From “If Mila handles pressure well, then exactly one of (remains calm, thinks critically) holds,” and since both RemainsCalm and ThinksCritically are false, we conclude HandlesPressureWell(Mila) = false (modus tollens).
- From “If organized then (handles pressure well or achieves objectives),” and since both are false, we get Organized(Mila) = false (contrapositive).
- From “If detail-oriented then organized and focused,” and given Mila is not focused and not organized, we conclude Mila is not detail-oriented.
- There is no information implying Mila is procedural or meticulous, nor that she is not.

Conclusion:
- Detail-oriented is false for Mila.
- Procedural and meticulous are undetermined.

Therefore, the disjunction “Mila is meticulous, or procedural, or detail-oriented” cannot be determined from the given facts.
