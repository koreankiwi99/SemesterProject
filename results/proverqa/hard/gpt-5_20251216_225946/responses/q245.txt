Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Abdullah does not express himself freely.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Abdullah settles down, so he values stability.
- For Abdullah, trying new adventures and valuing stability are mutually exclusive; since he values stability, he does not try new adventures.
- Abdullah explores cultures; with not trying new adventures, the XOR condition (explores cultures or tries new adventures, but not both) holds, so he seeks new experiences.
- If he seeks new experiences (and he does), he chases his passion; therefore he follows his heart.
- Abdullah loses his identity. Since finding one’s true self and losing identity are mutually exclusive, Abdullah does not find his true self.
- The only statement involving “expresses himself freely” is: everyone either conforms to society or expresses themselves freely (or both). We have no information that Abdullah conforms, nor any rule linking his other properties to expressing himself freely.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether Abdullah does not express himself freely.

ANSWER: C

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
