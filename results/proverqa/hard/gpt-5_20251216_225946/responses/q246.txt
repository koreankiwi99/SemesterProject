Question ID: 246
Difficulty: hard

Context:
For every person, either they find inner peace or they discover a new meaning in life, but these two are not necessarily related. For Matthew, facing challenges and finding solace are mutually exclusive. Matthew loses everything. If Matthew reassesses his priorities, then he either discovers a new meaning in life or restarts his life (or both). If someone hits rock bottom, then they reassess their priorities. Matthew faces challenges. If Matthew restarts his life, then he will either pursue his passion or find solace, but not both. Anyone who loses everything will hit rock bottom. Matthew finds inner peace.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Matthew pursues his passion.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Matthew loses everything → he hits rock bottom → he reassesses his priorities.
2) If he reassesses his priorities, then he either discovers new meaning or restarts his life (or both). So NM or RS is true.
3) Matthew faces challenges, and for him facing challenges and finding solace are mutually exclusive. Since he faces challenges, he does not find solace (¬SO).
4) If Matthew restarts his life, then he either pursues his passion or finds solace, but not both. Given ¬SO, if RS then PP must be true.
5) However, from step 2 we only know NM or RS; RS is not entailed. It could be that only NM is true and RS is false. No other rule implies PP, nor forbids it without RS.

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Matthew pursues his passion.

ANSWER: C

Result:

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
