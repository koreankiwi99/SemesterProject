Question ID: 248
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Anyone who publishes papers and presents findings can receive international recognition. Elisa explores new ideas. Beckham learns from others. Papito sets goals. Elisa has a strong work ethic. If Elisa has curiosity, then she conducts innovative research and pushes boundaries. Greyson does not develop new treatments. If Elisa has passion, then she will conduct innovative research. If Elisa sets goals, then she overcomes obstacles and is highly motivated. Elisa sets goals. If Elisa either collaborates with experts or makes breakthrough discoveries (but not both), then she advances scientific knowledge. If Elisa collaborates with experts, then she either learns from others or gains new insights (but not both). Elisa does not solve complex problems. If someone either explores new ideas or has curiosity, then they solve complex problems. Anyone who conducts innovative research and receives international recognition can make breakthrough discoveries. If Papito understands brain functions, then she can either develop new treatments or receive international recognition, but not both. Elisa gains new insights. If Elisa understands brain functions, then she can either develop new treatments or receive international recognition, but not both. Elisa overcomes obstacles. If Elisa has a strong work ethic, then she is either highly motivated or advances scientific knowledge, but not both. Greyson explores new ideas. Elisa does not develop new treatments. Elisa learns from others. Anyone who enjoys learning or faces challenges can be highly motivated.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Elisa understands brain functions.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Elisa learns from others and gains new insights. Given “If Elisa collaborates with experts, then she either learns from others or gains new insights (but not both),” we conclude by contrapositive that Elisa does not collaborate with experts.
- Elisa has a strong work ethic and sets goals. From “If Elisa sets goals, then she is highly motivated,” and “If Elisa has a strong work ethic, then she is either highly motivated or advances scientific knowledge, but not both,” we get that she is highly motivated and therefore does not advance scientific knowledge.
- From “If Elisa either collaborates with experts or makes breakthrough discoveries (but not both), then she advances scientific knowledge” and the fact she does not advance scientific knowledge, we infer the antecedent is false. Since she does not collaborate, this implies she does not make breakthrough discoveries.
- If Elisa understands brain functions, then (given she does not develop new treatments) she would receive international recognition. Nothing provided contradicts her receiving international recognition, nor do we have any statement that forces understanding brain functions.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether Elisa understands brain functions.

ANSWER: C

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
