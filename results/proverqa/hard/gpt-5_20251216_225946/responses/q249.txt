==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Holden is a passionate cook. By the rule “If Holden is a passionate cook, then he is either a skilled chef or creative, but not both,” we get XOR(SkilledChef(H), Creative(H)).
- If Holden were a skilled chef, he would run a popular kitchen. But Holden does not run a popular kitchen. Therefore, Holden is not a skilled chef, so by the XOR, Holden is creative.
- Holden cannot build a loyal customer base. From “Anyone who pays attention to details or is successful can build a loyal customer base,” it follows that Holden is neither paying attention to details nor successful.
- From “If Holden is either meticulous or creative (but not both), then he is successful” and the fact that Holden is not successful, we get that Holden is not XOR(meticulous, creative). Since Holden is already known to be creative, not XOR implies he must also be meticulous.

Therefore, Holden is meticulous.
