Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rosalyn is either seeking truth or hiding truth, but not both.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Rosalyn follows her instincts, so she is a sleuth and tracks down leads.
- As a sleuth, she must analyze clues or gather evidence; we are given she gathers evidence (and possibly analyzes clues, but not required).
- She is an investigator. By the given rule, an investigator is either uncovering facts or seeking truth, but not both. Therefore, exactly one of “uncovering facts” and “seeking truth” holds.
- We also know “analyzes clues or uncovers facts” holds, which is consistent but does not force “seeking truth.”
- Rosalyn is transparent (and thus not dishonest), but there is no rule linking transparency or dishonesty to “hiding truth.”
- There is no premise that defines or implies whether Rosalyn is “hiding truth.”

Conclusion:
We cannot determine whether Rosalyn is hiding truth, so we cannot assess the exclusive-or between “seeking truth” and “hiding truth.”
