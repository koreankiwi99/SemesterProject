Question ID: 253
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Rex has a strong build. Every horse that has excellent training either responds to commands or performs tricks (or both). Baylor either gets anxious or stays calm, but not both. If Baylor faces a challenging course, then he either remains focused or gets anxious, but not both. If Baylor has a strong build, then he can endure long races and is fast. If a horse receives proper care, then it is well-nourished and stays calm. Baylor remains focused. Baylor does not have good agility. Baylor either has clear vision or faces a challenging course, but not both. Baylor has good breeding. If Baylor participates in a competition, then he either develops strategic instincts or faces a challenging course, but not both. Baylor is loyal. August does not perform tricks. Baylor has muscular legs. If Baylor has muscular legs, then he is either able to endure long races or has good agility, but not both. If Baylor is fast, then he can either win championships or become legendary, but not both. If Baylor faces competition, then he gets anxious and releases energy. Baylor has a strong build. Baylor does not perform tricks. Baylor does not have clear vision. If Baylor responds to commands, then he either stays calm or is loyal (but not both). If Baylor has good breeding, then he can either win championships or have excellent training, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Baylor becomes legendary.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Baylor’s strong build, he can endure long races and is fast.
- From muscular legs and not having good agility, he must be able to endure long races (consistent).
- Baylor does not have clear vision; by the XOR with clear vision/challenging course, he faces a challenging course.
- Given he remains focused and challenging-course -> focused XOR anxious, he is not anxious.
- By anxious XOR calm, he is calm. Also, he is loyal (given).
- If he responded to commands, then calm XOR loyal must hold; but both calm and loyal are true, so he cannot be responding to commands.
- If he had excellent training, then (responds OR performs tricks). He does not perform tricks; thus excellent training would force responding, which is impossible. Therefore, excellent training is false.
- From good breeding -> win championships XOR excellent training, with excellent training false, he must win championships.
- From being fast -> win championships XOR become legendary, with winning true, becoming legendary is false.
