Question ID: 254
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Gustavo learns from failure. Anyone who makes impossible shots either masters strategies or wins competitions. If Gustavo is a skilled archer, then he can either anticipate his opponent's moves or make impossible shots, but not both. Gustavo pursues perfection. For Gustavo, either he achieves success or he experiences failure, but not both at the same time. If Gustavo either pursues perfection or remains humble, then he achieves success. Everyone who becomes legendary does not remain humble, and everyone who remains humble does not necessarily become legendary. Gustavo experiences failure. If Gustavo wins competitions and stays focused, then he becomes legendary. Gustavo does not master strategies. Gustavo manages pressure or stays focused. Gustavo either learns from failure or manages pressure, but not both. Gustavo is a skilled archer.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Gustavo cannot anticipate his opponent's moves.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Gustavo is a skilled archer, so by the rule: Skilled Archer -> (Anticipate moves XOR Make impossible shots). Thus exactly one of A (anticipate) or MIS (make impossible shots) is true.
- Gustavo does not master strategies (MS is false).
- If MIS, then (MS or Wins competitions). With MS false, MIS would force Wins competitions (WC) true.
- Gustavo learns from failure (LF true) and “either learns from failure or manages pressure, but not both” implies Manages pressure (MP) is false.
- “MP or Stays focused (SF)” with MP false gives SF true.
- If WC and SF then Legendary (LEG), and LEG implies not humble (¬RH). This causes no contradiction with other statements.
- Two consistent cases:
  1) A true -> MIS false -> WC not forced -> all other facts remain consistent.
  2) A false -> MIS true -> WC true -> with SF true -> LEG true -> ¬RH; still consistent.
- Therefore, the premises do not force A to be false; both A and ¬A are consistent.

Conclusion: We cannot determine that Gustavo cannot anticipate his opponent’s moves.
