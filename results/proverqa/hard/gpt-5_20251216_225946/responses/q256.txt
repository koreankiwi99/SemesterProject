Question ID: 256
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Dorian either finds food or protects Sarah, but not both. Rex either provides comfort or gets attention, but not both. Sawyer barks loudly. Rex barks loudly. Rex does not avoid dangers. If Rex is loyal, then he either protects Sarah or brings joy, but not both. If a dog runs quickly and plays frequently, then it keeps active. All dogs that scavenge successfully explore areas and keep active. Any dog that wags its tail or barks loudly can get attention. Every dog that defends its family will protect its owner. For any dog, if they perform tricks and act cute, then they get attention. If Rex finds food, then he will either avoid dangers or scavenge successfully. Rex either finds food or protects Sarah, but not both. Sawyer plays outdoors. Rex does not explore areas. Every dog either provides comfort or brings joy.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rex is not loyal.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Rex barks loudly. Any dog that wags its tail or barks loudly can get attention. Therefore, Rex gets attention.
- Rex either provides comfort or gets attention, but not both. Since Rex gets attention, he does not provide comfort.
- Every dog either provides comfort or brings joy. Since Rex does not provide comfort, he must bring joy.
- Rex either finds food or protects Sarah, but not both. If Rex found food, then (given he does not avoid dangers) he would scavenge successfully, which would imply he explores areas. But Rex does not explore areas. Therefore, Rex does not find food, so he protects Sarah.
- If Rex is loyal, then he either protects Sarah or brings joy, but not both. We have both: Rex protects Sarah and brings joy. Thus the exclusive-or condition fails.
- By contrapositive, since the consequence of loyalty is false, Rex is not loyal.
