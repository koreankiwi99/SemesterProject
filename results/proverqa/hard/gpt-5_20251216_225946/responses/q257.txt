Question ID: 257
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Callan has a unique design, then it either pioneers a discovery or breaks boundaries (or both). If Galilea is either remarkable or has a unique design (but not both), then it makes history. Galilea does not make history. Galilea runs smoothly. Galilea has advanced sensors. If Galilea has a unique design, then it either pioneers a discovery or breaks boundaries (or both). Galilea either travels a long distance or is remarkable. Any spacecraft that meets specifications or is well maintained is fully functional. Callan does not make history. Galilea is maintained. Galilea does not break boundaries. If Callan is either remarkable or has a unique design (but not both), then it makes history. If Galilea is either fully functional or completely damaged (but not both), then it is remarkable. Galilea either pioneers a discovery or gathers critical data, but not both. Kenji runs smoothly. Any spacecraft with advanced sensors gathers critical data. Galilea operates normally or is fully functional. Kenji has advanced sensors. All maintained spacecraft either operate normally or run smoothly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Galilea is completely damaged.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Galilea has advanced sensors → gathers critical data.
- “Pioneers discovery XOR gathers data” and gathers data → not pioneers.
- Given “not break boundaries.” If Galilea had a unique design, then (pioneers or breaks). Both are false → not unique design.
- If (remarkable XOR unique design) then makes history. Given not makes history and not unique design → not remarkable.
- Galilea is maintained → fully functional.
- If (fully functional XOR completely damaged) then remarkable. Given not remarkable → not XOR(fully functional, completely damaged). Since fully functional is true, completely damaged must also be true.

ANSWER: A

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
