Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Esteban will face financial difficulties.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Esteban loves designer brands and enjoys fine dining, so he has luxurious tastes.
- Esteban craves attention. Given the XOR rule and the fact that he does not listen to others, he must ignore advice.
- Having luxurious tastes and ignoring advice implies Esteban invests recklessly.
- Esteban has common sense, so he lives frugally and makes informed decisions.
- Given the XOR between living frugally and spending excessively, and that he lives frugally, he does not spend excessively.
- There is no rule linking investing recklessly (or ignoring advice) directly to “facing financial difficulties,” nor do we have evidence he accumulates debt or otherwise must face financial trouble. He also lives frugally, which counters such a conclusion.

Conclusion: It cannot be determined from the given information whether Esteban will face financial difficulties.
