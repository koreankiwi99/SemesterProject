Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Aileen does not dislike tango.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From Aileen has stage experience and the rule (stage experience -> ballet XOR rumba), and given Aileen performs ballet, conclude Aileen does not perform rumba.
- Given Aileen dances samba and not rumba, the XOR condition (rumba XOR samba -> teaches dance) is satisfied, so Aileen teaches dance.
- Aileen appreciates music implies she instructs movement. Then by the XOR rule (instructs movement -> loves waltz XOR loves salsa) and given Aileen loves waltz, conclude she does not love salsa.
- From teaches dance -> loves salsa XOR enjoys tango, and since she does not love salsa, conclude Aileen enjoys tango.
- The given XOR (enjoys tango XOR dislikes tango) with enjoys tango true implies Aileen does not dislike tango.

ANSWER: A
