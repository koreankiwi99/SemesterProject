Question ID: 260
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Norah is not careful. Norah publishes her findings. If Norah has attention to detail, then she is either an archaeologist or is careful (or both). Norah thinks logically. If Norah is an analyst, then she is either systematic or methodical (but not both). Norah is an analyst. If Norah publishes her findings, then she is an expert researcher. Norah has attention to detail. Anyone who solves puzzles is perceptive. If Norah works precisely, then she is either systematic or thinks logically (but not both). All archaeologists are either meticulous or perceptive. If someone is an expert researcher, then they are either methodical or perceptive. Norah works precisely.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Norah is not intelligent.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Norah has attention to detail and “if attention to detail, then archaeologist or careful.” Given Norah is not careful, she must be an archaeologist.
- Archaeologist implies meticulous or perceptive (at least one).
- Norah publishes findings, so she is an expert researcher, hence methodical or perceptive.
- Norah works precisely and “works precisely -> systematic XOR thinks logically.” Since she thinks logically, she is not systematic.
- Norah is an analyst and “analyst -> systematic XOR methodical.” With not systematic, she must be methodical.
- Thus methodical is true; perceptive remains undetermined. No premise connects any of these traits to being intelligent.

Conclusion: The statement “Norah is not intelligent” cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: C
