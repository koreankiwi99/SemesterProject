==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From P(Violet) and the rule (P ∧ S) -> F, together with ¬F(Violet), we get ¬S(Violet).
- Given ¬A(Violet) and ¬S(Violet), H(Violet) -> (S ∨ A) implies ¬H(Violet) (contrapositive).
- From R(Violet) -> H(Violet) and ¬H(Violet), we infer ¬R(Violet).
- From IP(Violet) -> R(Violet), we get ¬R(Violet) -> ¬IP(Violet).
- From (M xor Y) -> IP and ¬IP(Violet), we infer ¬(M xor Y); thus M and Y have the same truth value.
- VS(Violet) implies Y(Violet); with ¬(M xor Y) and Y(Violet), we conclude M(Violet).
- ABL(Violet) is given. With M(Violet) and ABL(Violet), the rule (ABL ∧ M) -> Calm yields Calm(Violet).

Therefore, Violet feels calm.
