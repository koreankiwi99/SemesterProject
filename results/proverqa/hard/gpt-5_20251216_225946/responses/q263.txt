Question ID: 263
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Every parasite either invades a host or manipulates cellular machinery. India attaches to a host. If Queenie attaches to a host, then she will infect it. Queenie attaches to a host. Queenie does not invade a host. If Queenie has a strong flagellum, then she will dominate her host. Any parasite that dominates its host will reproduce successfully. If Queenie is a virulent parasite, then she either colonizes tissues or dominates her host, but not both. If Queenie infects her host, then she either multiplies rapidly or evades the host's defenses, but not both. All parasites are either able to adapt to their host or survive in its environment, if they reproduce successfully. Queenie does not colonize tissues. Queenie is able to adapt to her host. Every parasite that manipulates cellular machinery of a host either evades the host's defenses or survives in its environment. If Queenie either penetrates cells or secretes toxins (but not both), then she infects her host. Queenie is a virulent parasite.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Queenie multiplies rapidly.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Queenie attaches to a host, so she infects it.
- Queenie is a virulent parasite and does not colonize tissues; thus she dominates her host, so she reproduces successfully.
- Every parasite either invades or manipulates cellular machinery; Queenie does not invade, so she manipulates cellular machinery.
- A parasite that manipulates cellular machinery either evades defenses or survives in its environment (not exclusive).
- If Queenie infects her host, then exactly one of the following holds: she multiplies rapidly or she evades defenses.

From these, we cannot determine whether she evades or multiplies rapidly. Both are consistent with the other facts, so whether she multiplies rapidly is undetermined.

ANSWER: C

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
