Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- The premises never mention “an anemone home,” “protected from predators,” or “helps nourish the anemone,” nor give rules linking these to Everly’s known traits.
- The only related fact is that clownfish that thrive in reefs form symbiotic relationships, but we are not told Everly is a clownfish or that symbiosis entails exactly one of protection or nourishment (and not both).
- Thus, the stated conditional is not entailed by the given information and could be either true or false under models consistent with the facts.

ANSWER: C

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
