Question ID: 269
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Alexander pursues his passion, then he will gain recognition. Alexander is either a person with practical skills or a curious person, but he may not necessarily be both. Alexander thinks creatively. Alexander does not collect specimens. If someone can manage a garden, then they have practical skills. Alexander receives awards. Alexander writes books. If someone seeks medical breakthroughs and has curiosity, then they make discoveries. Alexander conducts experiments. Alexander either studies plants or is dedicated to healing (or both). If Alexander makes discoveries and shares knowledge, then he will gain recognition. If Alexander writes books, then he is either recognized or receives awards (but not both). If Alexander either studies plants or collects specimens (but not both), then he seeks medical breakthroughs. Alexander collaborates with others. Anyone who asks questions has curiosity. A person is either skilled in practical application or has theoretical knowledge, but not necessarily both. Alexander shares knowledge. Anyone who thinks creatively and conducts experiments can be innovative. Clark collaborates with others. If Jakari writes books, then he is either recognized or receives awards (but not both). If Alexander is innovative, then he collaborates with others and has theoretical knowledge.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Alexander is not dedicated to healing.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Alexander writes books and receives awards. From "If Alexander writes books, then he is either recognized or receives awards (but not both)," it follows that Alexander is not recognized.
- From "If Alexander makes discoveries and shares knowledge, then he will gain recognition" and the fact that he is not recognized while he does share knowledge, it follows that he does not make discoveries.
- From "If someone seeks medical breakthroughs and has curiosity, then they make discoveries," and since Alexander does not make discoveries, we conclude that not both (seeks medical breakthroughs and curiosity) can be true. So, either he does not seek medical breakthroughs, or he does not have curiosity (or both).
- Alexander does not collect specimens. From "If Alexander either studies plants or collects specimens (but not both), then he seeks medical breakthroughs," with not collecting specimens, we get: If he studies plants, then he seeks medical breakthroughs.
- From "Alexander either studies plants or is dedicated to healing (or both)," at least one is true. If he studies plants, that implies he seeks medical breakthroughs and thus he must lack curiosity (to avoid discoveries), which is consistent. If he does not study plants, then he must be dedicated to healing. In either case, nothing forces "not dedicated to healing," and being dedicated to healing is entirely consistent with all premises.

Conclusion: We cannot determine that Alexander is not dedicated to healing.
