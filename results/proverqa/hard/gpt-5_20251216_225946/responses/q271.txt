Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Brock does not respect tradition.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Brock appreciates history, so he visits cemeteries and values sacrifices.
- From visiting cemeteries and the rule about cemeteries, Brock either pays respects or honors heroes (but not both).
- Brock shares personal stories, and by the XOR rule (pays respects or shares stories), he does not pay respects.
- Therefore, given the cemetery XOR, Brock honors heroes.
- Brock does not protect others; combined with “protects others or serves his country,” he serves his country.
- Brock loves reading. If he pursued an academic career, he’d have mastery, but he does not have mastery; hence he does not pursue an academic career.
- By the XOR (writes books or pursues academic), he writes history books; and by (teaches or pursues academic), he teaches others.

None of the given rules define or relate “respect tradition” to any of the established predicates (values sacrifices, honors heroes, pays respects, appreciates history, etc.). Therefore, we cannot determine whether Brock respects tradition or not.
