Question ID: 272
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Amiyah does not pioneer medical breakthroughs. Amiyah does not make new discoveries. If Amiyah is an expert or makes new discoveries, then she gains recognition. If Amiyah has sapremia, then she can either receive innovative treatment or contribute to medical research, but not both. Amiyah does not gain recognition. Amiyah attends conferences. Amiyah teaches at a university. If Amiyah works in a lab, then she can either contribute to medical research or teach at a university, but not both. If someone publishes scientific papers and attends conferences, then they can become an expert. Amiyah does not have a rare condition. If Amiyah receives innovative treatment, then she either has a rare condition or pioneers medical breakthroughs (or both). Amiyah either publishes scientific papers or works in a lab, but not both. If Amiyah collects data or analyzes results, then she can publish scientific papers.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Amiyah has sapremia.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Amiyah does not gain recognition” and “If Amiyah is an expert or makes new discoveries, then she gains recognition,” and “Amiyah does not make new discoveries,” we get that Amiyah is not an expert.
- If someone publishes papers and attends conferences, then they become an expert. Amiyah attends conferences, so since she is not an expert, she must not publish papers.
- She either publishes papers or works in a lab, but not both; hence she works in a lab.
- If she works in a lab, then exactly one of “contribute to medical research” or “teach at a university” holds. She teaches at a university, so she does not contribute to medical research.
- If she has sapremia, then exactly one of “receive innovative treatment” or “contribute to medical research” holds. Since she does not contribute to medical research, sapremia would force “receive innovative treatment.”
- If she receives innovative treatment, then she either has a rare condition or pioneers medical breakthroughs. But she has neither (she does not have a rare condition and does not pioneer breakthroughs). Therefore she does not receive innovative treatment.
- Hence the implication from sapremia to receiving treatment is impossible; thus she does not have sapremia.
