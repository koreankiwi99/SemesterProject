Egghead hosts events or throws awesome parties. Egghead plans weddings. Egghead does not attract big crowds. Egghead is a socialite. Egghead either has charisma or has infectious energy, but not both. Anyone who throws awesome parties either has infectious energy or attracts big crowds. If Egghead is a socialite, then he either plans weddings or hosts events, but not both. Egghead has charisma or an outgoing personality. Egghead either has an outgoing personality or an introverted personality, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Egghead has an introverted personality.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Egghead is a socialite (S) and plans weddings (W). From “If socialite then plans weddings or hosts events, but not both,” we get W xor H. Since W is true, H is false.
- From “hosts events or throws awesome parties” and H is false, it follows that Egghead throws awesome parties (P).
- If P, then infectious energy (E) or big crowds (B). Given not B, we deduce E is true.
- From “charisma (C) xor infectious energy (E)” and E is true, C is false.
- From “C or outgoing (O)” and C is false, O is true.
- From “O xor introverted (I)” and O is true, I is false.

Therefore, Egghead does not have an introverted personality; the statement is false.

ANSWER: B

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
