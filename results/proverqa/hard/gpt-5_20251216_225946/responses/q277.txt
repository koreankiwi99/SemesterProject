Question ID: 277
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Dork takes risks. Leyla does not set goals. All progressive individuals have creativity and set goals. Leyla honors her heritage. Leyla does not seek improvement. If someone honors their heritage, then they value customs. Leyla takes risks. Anyone who thinks outside the box is creative. Leyla follows her passion or seeks progress. Rex is determined. If Leyla either embraces innovation or seeks improvement (but not both), then she is progressive. Dork either rejects tradition or embraces innovation, but not both. Leyla is determined. If someone is determined, then they take risks and seek progress. If Leyla prefers modernity and dislikes convention, then she rejects tradition. Leyla either rejects tradition or embraces innovation, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Every human in Rhenish Hesse either appreciates tradition or rejects tradition, but not both, and Leyla appreciates tradition.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “All progressive individuals have creativity and set goals” and “Leyla does not set goals,” it follows that Leyla is not progressive (contrapositive).
- From “If Leyla either embraces innovation or seeks improvement (but not both), then she is progressive” and the fact that she is not progressive, we conclude that she does not satisfy that XOR. Given “Leyla does not seek improvement,” this implies Leyla does not embrace innovation.
- From “Leyla either rejects tradition or embraces innovation, but not both,” and the fact that she does not embrace innovation, we conclude Leyla rejects tradition.
- The statement to evaluate asserts: (i) every human satisfies XOR(appreciates tradition, rejects tradition) and (ii) Leyla appreciates tradition. Together these imply Leyla does not reject tradition, which contradicts the derived fact that Leyla rejects tradition. Therefore, the statement is false.
