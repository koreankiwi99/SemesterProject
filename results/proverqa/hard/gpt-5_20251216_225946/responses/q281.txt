Question ID: 281
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Hadleigh evaluates outcomes. For anyone who appreciates botany and enjoys care giving, they can study horticultural therapy. Hadleigh has curiosity. If someone pursues their passion, then they face challenges and think outside the box. Hadleigh pursues her passion. If someone assesses situations and evaluates outcomes, then they can take calculated risks. If Hadleigh either sets high goals or overcomes obstacles (but not both), then she faces challenges. If Jayla either takes calculated risks or questions conventional wisdom (but not both), then she thinks outside the box. Jayla pursues her passion. If Jayla faces challenges, then she is either persistent or stays motivated, but not both. Anyone who explores new ideas and seeks innovative solutions is thinking outside the box. If Hadleigh has curiosity, then she either assesses situations or solves problems, but not both. Hadleigh does not question conventional wisdom. If Hadleigh either takes calculated risks or questions conventional wisdom (but not both), then she thinks outside the box. Hadleigh stays motivated. Issac evaluates outcomes. If Jayla studies horticultural therapy and has persistence, then she will succeed in research. Hadleigh does not solve problems. If Hadleigh faces challenges, then she is either persistent or stays motivated, but not both. If Hadleigh has experience, then she assesses situations and collaborates with others.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Hadleigh will succeed in research.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Hadleigh has curiosity and “if Hadleigh has curiosity, then she either assesses situations or solves problems, but not both,” plus “Hadleigh does not solve problems,” we conclude Hadleigh assesses situations.
- Given “Hadleigh evaluates outcomes” and “if someone assesses situations and evaluates outcomes, then they can take calculated risks,” Hadleigh can take calculated risks (capability).
- From “Hadleigh pursues her passion” and “if someone pursues their passion, then they face challenges and think outside the box,” Hadleigh faces challenges and thinks outside the box.
- From “if Hadleigh faces challenges, then she is either persistent or stays motivated, but not both,” and “Hadleigh stays motivated,” we infer Hadleigh is not persistent.
- The only rule about succeeding in research is specific to Jayla (“If Jayla studies horticultural therapy and has persistence, then she will succeed in research”). There is no rule connecting Hadleigh to success in research, nor any rule implying she will not succeed.

Therefore, whether Hadleigh will succeed in research cannot be determined from the given information.
