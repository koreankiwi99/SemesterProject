Question ID: 283
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Crew does not know biology. If Crew either rescues amphibians or researches marine life (but not both), then he studies axolotls. If Crew loves aquatic life, then he will study axolotls. Crew does not have a passion for nature. If someone cares for animals and understands ecology, then they can advocate for conservation. Anyone who enjoys scuba diving and appreciates marine life will love aquatic life. For all humans, if they value wildlife and help endangered species, then they care for animals. Crew helps endangered species. If Crew studies axolotls, then he either establishes a sanctuary or advocates for their conservation, but not both. Crew knows biology or understands ecology. Crew values wildlife. Crew has a passion for nature or loves aquatic life.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Crew does not establish a sanctuary.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Crew does not know biology. Given "Crew knows biology or understands ecology," he must understand ecology.
- Crew values wildlife and helps endangered species, so he cares for animals. With understanding ecology, he can advocate for conservation (general).
- Crew does not have a passion for nature, but "has a passion for nature or loves aquatic life" implies he loves aquatic life.
- If he loves aquatic life, then he studies axolotls.
- If he studies axolotls, then exactly one of the following is true: he establishes a sanctuary or he advocates for the axolotls’ conservation (but not both).

No provided information determines which of the two outcomes (establishes a sanctuary vs. advocates for their conservation) actually occurs. Therefore, whether he does not establish a sanctuary cannot be determined.

ANSWER: C

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
