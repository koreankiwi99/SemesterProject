Question ID: 284
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Byron does not have a shiny coat. If Muffin either loses weight or reduces her appetite (but not both), then she improves her appearance. If Muffin looks vibrant or seems playful, then she has a shiny coat. If Muffin either grooms herself or improves her appearance (but not both), then she looks vibrant. For all cats, if they stay hydrated and groom themselves, then they feel healthy. Any cat that plays outside or chases toys will get regular exercise. Holland follows a strict diet. Byron reduces her appetite. Muffin follows a strict diet. If Holland either loses weight or reduces her appetite (but not both), then she improves her appearance. Muffin reduces her appetite. If Byron looks vibrant or seems playful, then she has a shiny coat. For all cats, if a cat follows a strict diet and gets regular exercise, then it will regain its health. If Muffin either sheds her fur or brightens her eyes (but not both), then she improves her appearance. Muffin does not increase her energy. Muffin stays hydrated. Muffin does not have a shiny coat. If Muffin loses weight, then she either increases her energy or gets regular exercise (or both). Byron does not feel healthy. Every cat that stays active either looks vibrant or has good posture (or both). Muffin does not seem playful. Muffin does not feel healthy.

  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If Muffin looks vibrant or seems playful, then she has a shiny coat” and “Muffin does not have a shiny coat,” we get that Muffin is not vibrant and not playful.
- From “If Muffin either grooms herself or improves her appearance (but not both), then she looks vibrant,” its contrapositive gives: not vibrant implies not(groom XOR improve). Thus grooming and improving appearance have the same truth value (both true or both false).
- From “Muffin stays hydrated” and “If they stay hydrated and groom themselves, then they feel healthy,” together with “Muffin does not feel healthy,” it follows that Muffin does not groom herself.
- Therefore, since grooming is false and grooming/improve must match, improving appearance is also false.
- From “If Muffin either loses weight or reduces her appetite (but not both), then she improves her appearance” and improve is false, it follows that it is not exactly one of (loses weight, reduces appetite). Given “Muffin reduces her appetite,” we conclude Muffin also loses weight.
- From “If Muffin loses weight, then she either increases her energy or gets regular exercise,” and “Muffin does not increase her energy,” we conclude Muffin gets regular exercise.
- With “Muffin follows a strict diet” and “If a cat follows a strict diet and gets regular exercise, then it will regain its health,” we conclude Muffin regains her health.
