Question ID: 285
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If someone appreciates elegance, then they value attention to detail and have artistic flair. Elian is not a skilled craftsman. Elian either follows current trends or creates beautiful spaces, but not necessarily both. If Elian loves decorating or understands drapery, then he can be an interior designer. Elian respects classics. Elian enjoys beautiful things. Elian admires refinement. If Elian has artistic flair, then he is either a skilled craftsman or an interior designer (but not both). Elian attends design events. If Elian either stays updated on the latest fashion or attends design events (but not both), then he follows current trends. Marcel either respects classics or stays updated on the latest fashion, but not both. Marcel attends design events. If someone either collects vintage items or adorns spaces luxuriously (but not both), then they appreciate elegance. Marcel is not a skilled craftsman. For all humans, if someone is an interior designer, then they either create beautiful spaces or have exquisite taste (or both). Anyone who admires refinement and enjoys beautiful things appreciates elegance. Elian either respects classics or stays updated on the latest fashion, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Elian has exquisite taste.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “admires refinement” and “enjoys beautiful things,” Elian appreciates elegance.
- Appreciating elegance implies Elian has artistic flair (and values attention to detail).
- Having artistic flair implies Elian is either a skilled craftsman or an interior designer, but not both. Since Elian is not a skilled craftsman, he must be an interior designer.
- Elian respects classics, and given “either respects classics or stays updated (but not both),” he does not stay updated on the latest fashion.
- With “attends design events” and “(stays updated XOR attends design events) → follows current trends,” Elian follows current trends.
- Being an interior designer implies Elian either creates beautiful spaces or has exquisite taste (or both).

We can’t determine which of “creates beautiful spaces” or “has exquisite taste” holds. The given information allows models where Elian only creates beautiful spaces (no exquisite taste) and models where he has exquisite taste. Therefore, whether Elian has exquisite taste is not entailed.

ANSWER: C
