Model Response:
==================================================
- Noel analyzes data and does not read avidly, so the “exactly one of reads/analyzes implies fast learner” condition holds; thus Noel is a fast learner.
- Every fast learner has either a good memory or retains information. Noel does not retain information, so Noel must have a good memory.
- Being a polyglot implies exactly one of good memory or speaks multiple languages. Since Noel has a good memory, she does not speak multiple languages.
- Exactly one of speaks multiple languages or communicates effectively holds; since Noel does not speak multiple languages, she communicates effectively.
- Exactly one of communicates effectively or intelligent holds; since Noel communicates effectively, she is not intelligent.
- Noel is intelligent or adventurous. Since she is not intelligent, she must be adventurous.
