Question ID: 288
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Jasper is not a successful sailor. If Quincy respects the ocean, then he wins sailing competitions and has strong determination. Everyone who either studies tides or anticipates winds (but not both) respects the ocean. If Jasper respects the ocean, then he wins sailing competitions and has strong determination. If Jasper either sets priorities or overcomes obstacles (but not both), then he has strong determination. Quincy does not set goals. Paula does not read sea conditions. If Elodie knows weather patterns or masters navigation skills, then he can win sailing competitions. Jasper does not read sea conditions. Everyone who understands currents either plots their course or anticipates winds (or both). Paula understands currents. Elodie is not a successful sailor. Jasper does not plot his course. Jasper does not study tides. If Jasper studies charts, then he masters navigation skills. If Quincy either knows weather patterns or reads sea conditions (but not both), then he is a successful sailor. Jasper understands currents. All confident individuals who can win competitions also stay focused. If Jasper either knows weather patterns or reads sea conditions (but not both), then he is a successful sailor. Paula does not love challenges. Elodie does not study tides.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jasper has sailing experience and masters navigation skills.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From Jasper understands currents and everyone who understands currents either plots their course or anticipates winds (or both), and Jasper does not plot his course, we deduce Jasper anticipates winds.
- Given Jasper does not study tides and everyone who either studies tides or anticipates winds (but not both) respects the ocean, the XOR condition holds (anticipates winds true, studies tides false), so Jasper respects the ocean.
- If Jasper respects the ocean, then he wins sailing competitions and has strong determination; thus he wins competitions and has strong determination.
- Jasper does not read sea conditions, and if Jasper either knows weather patterns or reads sea conditions (but not both), then he is a successful sailor. Since Jasper is not a successful sailor, the XOR antecedent must be false; hence Jasper does not know weather patterns. (Not directly needed for the target claim.)
- The only given route to “Jasper masters navigation skills” is: if Jasper studies charts, then he masters navigation skills. We have no information that he studies charts; thus we cannot conclude he masters navigation skills.
- “Sailing experience” is never mentioned or linked to any other property; we cannot deduce whether Jasper has it.

Conclusion: We cannot determine that Jasper has sailing experience and masters navigation skills.
