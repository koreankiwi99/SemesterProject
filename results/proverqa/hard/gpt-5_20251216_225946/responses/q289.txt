Cynthia either works hard or is a manager. If Cynthia is influential, then she either builds trust or commands attention (but not both). Anyone who holds leadership positions and has vision can drive innovation. Cynthia builds trust.

Cynthia trusts her instinct. Cynthia solves problems or holds leadership positions.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cynthia protects her interests.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From Influential and Builds trust with XOR: Commands attention is false.
- From Has authority and Trusts instinct with XOR: Thinks carefully is false.
- From (Holds leadership ∧ Vision) → Drives innovation and Not drives innovation with Vision true: Holds leadership is false.
- From Solves problems or Holds leadership and not Holds leadership: Solves problems is true.
- From (Earns respect XOR Commands attention) → Holds leadership, and Commands attention false and Holds leadership false: Earns respect must be false.
- From Works hard or Manager, and if Works hard then (Achieves success or Earns respect). But Achieves success is false, and Earns respect is false; therefore Works hard cannot be true. Hence Manager is true.
- From Manager → (Acts on impulse XOR Thinks carefully) with Thinks carefully false: Acts on impulse is true.
- From Acts on impulse XOR Makes informed decisions: Makes informed decisions is false.
- None of the premises mention or imply “protects her interests,” nor its negation.

Conclusion: The truth value of “Cynthia protects her interests” cannot be determined from the given information.
