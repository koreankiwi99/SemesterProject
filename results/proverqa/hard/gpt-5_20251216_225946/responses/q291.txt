Question ID: 291
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Hope is mentally tough. If Hope has experience or is well-prepared, then she achieves her mountaineering goals. Hope is not physically fit. Hope does not have natural talent. Hope learns quickly or has experience. If Hope sets challenging goals, then she is either physically fit or well-prepared, but not both. Hope seeks adventure or sets challenging goals. Hope does not build resilience. Hope does not seek adventure. Hope pushes beyond her limits. Everyone who pushes beyond their limits either develops coping skills or is strategically grounded (or both). If Hope is either experienced or has natural talent (but not both), then she reaches the summit. Hope faces challenges. Hope either sets goals or reaches the summit. If Hope reaches the summit, then she is either mentally tough or strategically grounded (but not both). Anyone who faces challenges and develops coping skills can build resilience.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Hope achieves her mountaineering goals.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Hope seeks adventure or sets challenging goals” and “Hope does not seek adventure,” we get: Hope sets challenging goals (SCG).
- From “If SCG then either physically fit or well-prepared, but not both,” and “Hope is not physically fit,” we deduce: Hope is well-prepared (WP).
- From “If Hope has experience or is well-prepared, then she achieves her mountaineering goals,” and WP true, it follows: Hope achieves her mountaineering goals.

Consistency checks (do not affect the conclusion):
- From “Hope pushes beyond her limits” and “either develops coping skills or is strategically grounded,” plus “Anyone who faces challenges and develops coping skills can build resilience” and “Hope does not build resilience,” we infer she does not develop coping skills, hence she is strategically grounded.
- With “Hope is mentally tough,” mentally tough XOR strategically grounded is false, so by “If Hope reaches the summit, then (mentally tough XOR strategically grounded),” she does not reach the summit. This does not impact achieving goals via being well-prepared.

Therefore, the statement “Hope achieves her mountaineering goals” is true.
