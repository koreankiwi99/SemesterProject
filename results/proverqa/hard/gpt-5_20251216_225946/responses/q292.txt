Question ID: 292
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Aliyah trusts her instinct. Aliyah has strong intuition. Anyone who speaks confidently or writes clearly can communicate complex ideas. If Aliyah meets deadlines, then she either collaborates well or works independently, but not both. If Aliyah collaborates well, then she has strong intuition and can communicate complex ideas. Aliyah does not work independently. Aliyah either thinks logically or trusts her instinct, but not both. Aliyah does not evaluate data effectively. If Aliyah makes accurate conclusions, then she either thinks logically or evaluates data effectively (but not both). If someone is accurate, then they are either precise in measurements or reliable in findings (or both). For Aliyah, being able to communicate complex ideas and being reliable in findings are mutually exclusive. Everyone who approaches problems systematically either thinks logically or considers multiple perspectives (or both). Aliyah does not have attention to detail. Aliyah is accurate or innovative. Aliyah meets deadlines. If Aliyah is precise in measurements, then she either has attention to detail or makes accurate conclusions (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Aliyah is not innovative.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Aliyah trusts her instinct (T). From “thinks logically or trusts instinct, but not both,” T true implies TL (thinks logically) is false.
- Aliyah meets deadlines and does not work independently, so from the XOR rule she must collaborate well (CW).
- CW implies she can communicate complex ideas (CC). Given CC and “CC and RF are mutually exclusive,” RF (reliable in findings) is false.
- Aliyah does not evaluate data effectively (ED false).
- If she makes accurate conclusions (AC), then TL XOR ED must hold. But TL and ED are both false, so TL XOR ED is false; hence AC must be false (modus tollens).
- If precise in measurements (PM), then ATD XOR AC must hold. But ATD is false and AC is false, so XOR is false; thus PM is false (modus tollens).
- If Accurate (Acc), then PM or RF must be true. Both PM and RF are false, so Acc must be false.
- From “Aliyah is accurate or innovative,” with Acc false, it follows that Aliyah is innovative (INV true).

Therefore, “Aliyah is not innovative” is false.
