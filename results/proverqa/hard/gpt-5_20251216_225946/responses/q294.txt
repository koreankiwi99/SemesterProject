Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Rosalina saves lives or risks her life" and "Rosalina does not save lives," deduce Rosalina risks her life.
- From "Everyone who risks their life is either courageous or serves others" and "Rosalina does not serve others," deduce Rosalina is courageous.
- If Rosalina is courageous, then exactly one of the following is true: she earns the respect of others or she inspires leadership in others (but not both).
- From "Rosalina puts others first" and "Anyone who provides medical aid or puts others first protects the vulnerable," deduce Rosalina protects the vulnerable. This does not determine whether she earns respect or inspires leadership.
