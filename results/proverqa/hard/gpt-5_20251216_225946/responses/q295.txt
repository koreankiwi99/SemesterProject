Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Andy does not earn global recognition.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Andy values efficiency or has a strong work ethic" and "Andy does not value efficiency," conclude Andy has a strong work ethic.
- From strong work ethic ⇒ (innovation XOR leads teams) and "Andy speaks at conferences" with rule "If Andy speaks at conferences, then he leads project teams," conclude Andy leads teams and therefore is not dedicated to innovation.
- From "Andy does not foster collaboration" and "Andy is either an expert or fosters collaboration, but not both," conclude Andy is an expert.
- From "If expert then (mentor XOR pioneer)" and "Andy does not share knowledge" with "Andy guides newcomers" and the rule "If (share XOR guide) then mentors," conclude Andy mentors others and is not pioneering new technology.
- None of the given rules mention or imply anything about earning global recognition, and no rule links speaking at conferences, mentoring, or leading teams to global recognition.

Conclusion: The truth of "Andy does not earn global recognition" cannot be determined from the provided information.
