Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Chosen is fearless.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From Chosen outsmarts predators, and the rule “If Chosen outsmarts predators, then he will gain respect and have charisma,” Chosen has charisma.
- The rule “If Chosen either has charisma or leads the group (but not both), then he inspires others,” together with “Chosen does not inspire others,” means the XOR antecedent must be false. Since Chosen has charisma, this forces that Chosen is also a leader.
- “Chosen either plays with others or leads the group,” and “If a lemur plays with others, then it feels happiness,” combined with “Chosen does not feel happiness,” imply Chosen does not play with others; thus the disjunction is satisfied by being a leader, consistent with the previous step.
- Chosen both finds water and avoids hunters. If Chosen thrived in Madagascar, he would have to have exactly one of those, so we cannot conclude he thrives; nothing else forces thriving.
- No given rule links Chosen to being fearless, and there is no way to deduce either that he is fearless or that he is not.

Conclusion: The truth of “Chosen is fearless” cannot be determined from the information provided.
