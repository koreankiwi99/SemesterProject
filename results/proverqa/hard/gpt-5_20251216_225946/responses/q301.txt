Hamza learns quickly. If Kash holds absolute power, then he will suppress individual freedoms. Charley believes in authority. If someone is ambitious, then they make tough decisions and seek control. If someone has big ideas and thinks critically, then they set high goals. Anyone who learns quickly and adapts to situations works strategically. Hamza has big ideas. Charley adapts to situations.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Hamza does not hold absolute power.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Hamza prefers structure ⇒ Hamza values order.
- Hamza believes in authority and does not prioritize discipline. Given the XOR rule (prioritizes discipline or believes in authority, but not both) ⇒ Hamza has strict views.
- Values order + strict views ⇒ Hamza will impose harsh laws.
- Hamza learns quickly and adapts to situations ⇒ Hamza works strategically.
- Hamza has big ideas and thinks critically ⇒ Hamza sets high goals.
- Sets high goals + works strategically ⇒ Hamza is ambitious.
- Ambitious ⇒ Hamza seeks control.
- Seeks control ⇒ Hamza suppresses individual freedoms and imposes harsh laws.

Regarding absolute power: The only rule about absolute power is specific to Kash (“If Kash holds absolute power, then he will suppress individual freedoms”). There is no rule connecting Hamza’s properties to holding (or not holding) absolute power. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Hamza holds absolute power or not.
