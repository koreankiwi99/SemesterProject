Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Julio is not working primarily for social impact.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Julio gains practical experience and (gains practical experience) XOR (publishes research), so he does not publish research.
- Since he must either publish research or hold patents, he holds patents.
- Holding patents implies developing practical solutions.
- Developing practical solutions XOR pursuing academic research, so he does not pursue academic research.
- Works for profit XOR pursues academic research; with no academic research, he works for profit.
- Works for profit XOR works for social impact; with profit true, social impact is false.

Therefore, the statement "Julio is not working primarily for social impact" is true.
