Question ID: 303
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Noelle does not become an expert. Anyone who has curiosity and collects samples can conduct botanical research. Noelle does not document her findings. If Noelle does not have a green thumb or receives training, then she can tend to plants. If Noelle explores nature, then she either documents her findings or collects samples (or both). For every human, either they have a green thumb or they do not have a green thumb, but not both. If someone tends to plants and cultivates rare species, then they can become an expert. Noelle examines fungi. Noelle has curiosity. Noelle explores nature. Noelle either examines fungi or studies common plants, but not both. If Noelle conducts botanical research, then she either cultivates rare species or studies common plants, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Noelle does not have a green thumb.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Noelle explores nature" and "If Noelle explores nature, then she either documents her findings or collects samples" and "Noelle does not document her findings," we infer Noelle collects samples.
- With "Noelle has curiosity" and "Anyone who has curiosity and collects samples can conduct botanical research," we infer Noelle conducts botanical research.
- From "If Noelle conducts botanical research, then she either cultivates rare species or studies common plants, but not both," and "Noelle either examines fungi or studies common plants, but not both" with "Noelle examines fungi," we get that Noelle does not study common plants; hence she cultivates rare species.
- From "If someone tends to plants and cultivates rare species, then they can become an expert" and "Noelle does not become an expert," and since she cultivates rare species, it follows that she does not tend to plants.
- From "If Noelle does not have a green thumb or receives training, then she can tend to plants," contraposition with "she does not tend to plants" yields that she does have a green thumb (and does not receive training).

Therefore, the statement "Noelle does not have a green thumb" is false.

ANSWER: B
