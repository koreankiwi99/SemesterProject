Question ID: 305
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Arlo understands ecosystems. Arlo appreciates nature. Diana conducts outdoor experiments. If Arlo is passionate about plants, then he is dedicated to research and mentors students. Francis studies genetics. Arlo studies genetics. If a botanist appreciates nature and understands ecosystems, then they can nurture gardens. If Rowen nurtures gardens, then he is passionate about plants and collaborates with experts. Francis understands ecosystems. If Diana loves the outdoors, then he experiments with new techniques and collaborates with experts. If a botanist studies genetics and collects field data, then they can publish groundbreaking work. If Rowen is passionate about plants, then he is dedicated to research and mentors students. Anyone who conducts outdoor experiments will collect field data. If Arlo owns an orchard, then he values biodiversity and collaborates with experts. Rowen does not love the outdoors. If Arlo nurtures gardens, then he is passionate about plants and collaborates with experts. Arlo conducts outdoor experiments.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Arlo contributes to conservation.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Facts: Arlo understands ecosystems, appreciates nature, studies genetics, and conducts outdoor experiments. From conducting outdoor experiments, Arlo collects field data.
- Conditional rules involving Arlo lead to being passionate about plants only if Arlo nurtures gardens; nurturing gardens would follow from being a botanist who appreciates nature and understands ecosystems. There is no information that Arlo is a botanist, so we cannot derive that he nurtures gardens or is passionate about plants from the given rules.
- None of the provided rules or facts mention “contributes to conservation” or link any of Arlo’s established traits (understanding ecosystems, appreciating nature, studying genetics, collecting field data, collaborating, etc.) to “contributes to conservation.”

Conclusion: The statement cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: C

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
