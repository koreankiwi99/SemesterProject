Question ID: 307
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Any being that experiments with DNA or uses unstable compounds can have genetic mutations. Sevyn analyzes data. Sevyn explores planetary environments. Any being that is radiation sensitive or undergoes cell division can have genetic mutations. If Sevyn works in a lab or analyzes data, then she studies genetics. Sevyn either studies genetics or is exposed to a mutagenic serum, but not both. Jimena explores planetary environments. If Sevyn is exposed to a mutagenic serum or has genetic mutations, then she develops extraordinary abilities. If Lauryn works in a lab or analyzes data, then she studies genetics. Malakai analyzes data. Lauryn either studies genetics or is exposed to a mutagenic serum, but not both. If Sevyn craves knowledge, then she seeks new discoveries and conducts field research. A being either conducts field research or experiments with DNA, but these two activities are not necessarily related. Sevyn either explores planetary environments or conducts field research, but these two activities are not necessarily related.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sevyn does not develop extraordinary abilities.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Sevyn analyzes data, so she studies genetics.
- Given the exclusive-or, if she studies genetics then she is not exposed to a mutagenic serum.
- Extraordinary abilities arise if Sevyn is exposed to a mutagenic serum or has genetic mutations. The serum route is ruled out.
- The premises only allow that beings who experiment with DNA (or meet other conditions) can have genetic mutations; this does not entail that Sevyn actually has genetic mutations. We cannot establish that she has them.

Therefore, whether Sevyn develops extraordinary abilities cannot be determined.

ANSWER: C

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
