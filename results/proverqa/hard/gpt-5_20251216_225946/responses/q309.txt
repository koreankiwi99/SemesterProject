Question ID: 309
Difficulty: hard

Context:
For any mythical creature that roams dreamscapes and is omnipotent, they will inspire awe. If Elaine sees beyond the surface or listens deeply, then he can hold wisdom. If Elaine embodies balance, then he either holds wisdom or masters the cosmos, but not both. If Dakari possesses magic, then he can weave illusions. If Dakari understands nature and controls elements, then he masters the cosmos. If Dakari sees beyond the surface or listens deeply, then he can hold wisdom. Dakari does not inspire awe. Dakari sees beyond the surface. Dakari embodies balance. If Dakari shapeshifts his form, then he either navigates realms or controls elements. Dakari understands nature. If Dakari possesses intuition, then he either holds wisdom or speaks the truth, but not both. Every mythical creature has powers or possesses magic. If Dakari embodies balance, then he either holds wisdom or masters the cosmos, but not both. Dakari roams dreamscapes. If Dakari either controls elements or has powers (but not both), then he is omnipotent.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dakari can weave illusions.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From Dakari sees beyond the surface and (S ∨ L) -> W, Dakari holds wisdom (W).
- From Dakari embodies balance and B -> XOR(W, C), with W true, we get C (masters the cosmos) is false.
- From UN ∧ CE -> C and UN true with C false, conclude CE (controls elements) is false.
- From XOR(CE, P) -> O and CE false, we get P -> O.
- Given Dakari roams dreamscapes (R) and does not inspire awe (¬A). Assuming Dakari is a mythical creature, from M ∧ R ∧ O -> A, contrapositive gives M ∧ R ∧ ¬A -> ¬O, so O is false.
- From P -> O and O false, conclude P (has powers) is false.
- From M -> (P ∨ PM) and P false, conclude PM (possesses magic) is true.
- From PM -> I, Dakari can weave illusions.

Conclusion: The statement “Dakari can weave illusions” is true.
