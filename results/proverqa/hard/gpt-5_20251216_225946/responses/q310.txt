  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Melissa develops recipes and does not create menus, so the “creates menus or develops recipes (but not both)” condition holds ⇒ Melissa is a skilled chef.
- If skilled chef, then she either hosts classes or writes cookbooks (but not both). She writes cookbooks, so she does not host classes.
- Given “hosts classes or becomes a culinary influencer (but not both),” not hosting implies Melissa is a culinary influencer.
- Melissa does not create unique recipes and does experiment with spice combinations, so the “unique recipes or experiments (but not both)” condition holds ⇒ she understands flavor profiles.
- Since Melissa is a foodie, she either masters cooking skills or understands flavor profiles (but not both). Thus, she does not master cooking skills.
- Given “masters cooking skills or learns preservation techniques,” and not mastering, she learns preservation techniques.
- If she learns preservation techniques, then she either starts a food business or becomes a culinary influencer (but not both). Since she is already a culinary influencer, she does not start a food business.
