Question ID: 311
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Shmoops senses energy or understands emotions, then it can build trust. If Shmoops either respects boundaries or has empathy (but not both), then it values harmony. Shmoops can understand emotions if Shmoops has compassion. Any being that prioritizes coexistence respects boundaries. If Shmoops either detects vibrations or senses energy (but not both), then it is intuitive. Shmoops does not detect vibrations. If Shmoops either reads body language or shares thoughts (but not both), then it is able to connect with others. Shmoops is not intuitive. If Shmoops has empathy, then it either builds trust or can read minds, but not both. Shmoops connects with others or understands emotions. Shmoops can read minds. Shmoops does not value harmony. If Shmoops forms a telepathic bond, then it shares knowledge. Shmoops prioritizes coexistence. If Shmoops connects with others, then it will form a telepathic bond.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Shmoops shares knowledge.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From prioritizes coexistence -> respects boundaries; given PC, so RB is true.
- XOR(DV, SE) -> I and not I with not DV implies not XOR(DV, SE). With DV false, SE must also be false.
- XOR(RB, E) -> VH, but not VH and RB true means XOR must be false, so E is true.
- E -> XOR(BT, RM) and RM true forces BT false.
- From (SE or UE) -> BT and BT false, we infer not(SE or UE). With SE false, this gives UE false.
- Given CO or UE and UE false, CO is true.
- CO -> TB and TB -> SK, hence SK is true.

ANSWER: A

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
