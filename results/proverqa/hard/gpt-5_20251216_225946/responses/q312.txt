==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Rocco either seeks personal gain or identifies injustice, but not both” and “Rocco does not seek personal gain,” it follows that Rocco identifies injustice.
- Rocco is a philanthropist, and for him philanthropists either develop community programs or support local initiatives (but not both). Given “Rocco supports local initiatives,” we conclude he does not develop community programs.
- From “Rocco develops community programs or builds strategic partnerships” and not developing community programs, we deduce Rocco builds strategic partnerships.
- Given “Rocco advocates for change” and he identifies injustice, by the rule “If someone identifies injustice and advocates for change, then they can fight for social justice,” Rocco fights for social justice.
- From “If someone fights for social justice, then they either raise awareness or mobilize support (or both),” we get that Rocco raises awareness or mobilizes support.
- Another rule says Rocco builds strategic partnerships or mobilizes support (not necessarily both). Since we already know he builds strategic partnerships, this does not force mobilizing support, nor does any rule force raising awareness.
- Therefore, we can only conclude Rocco raises awareness or mobilizes support, but not which one. Hence whether he raises awareness is not determined.
