Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “For any person, if they either embrace change or seek innovation, then they drive progress” and “Fiona does not drive progress,” it follows that Fiona neither embraces change nor seeks innovation.
- From “If someone is either an unconventional thinker or open-minded, then they are a forward thinker” and “Fiona is not a forward thinker,” it follows (by contrapositive) that Fiona is neither an unconventional thinker nor open-minded.
- From “Fiona is either a conventional thinker or an unconventional thinker, but not both,” and the fact that she is not an unconventional thinker, it follows that Fiona is a conventional thinker.

Therefore, “Fiona is not a conventional thinker” is false.
