Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jaziel is a prodigious writer.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Jaziel learns quickly ⇒ he has versatile skills.
- He also has specialized knowledge. If he had wide interests, then (specialized knowledge XOR versatile skills) would have to hold, which is impossible since he has both. So he does not have wide interests.
- From (avid reader XOR wide interests), he must be an avid reader. From (inspiring teacher XOR avid reader), he is not an inspiring teacher.
- Jaziel is not someone who makes an impact. Since (influential OR achieves success) ⇒ makes an impact, he is not influential.
- For every human, (prodigious writer XOR inspiring teacher) ⇒ influential. With Jaziel not being an inspiring teacher, this reduces to (prodigious writer) ⇒ influential. As he is not influential, he cannot be a prodigious writer.

ANSWER: B

Result:

Ground Truth: B
