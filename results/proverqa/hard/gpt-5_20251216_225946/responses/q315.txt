Question ID: 315
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Emmy does not inspire others. If Emmy is dedicated to archaeology, then she can either make groundbreaking discoveries or become a leading expert, but not both. If Emmy advances historical knowledge, then she will gain recognition. Emmy either pursues alternate careers or is dedicated to archaeology, but not both. If Emmy either makes groundbreaking discoveries or uncovers lost artifacts (but not both), then she advances historical knowledge. Anyone who uncovers lost artifacts or deciphers ancient texts can shed new light on history. Emmy does not gain recognition. If Emmy sheds new light on history, then she will inspire others. Emmy does not pursue alternate careers.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Emmy does not become a leading expert.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Emmy does not pursue alternate careers" and "either pursues alternate careers or is dedicated to archaeology, but not both," we get that Emmy is dedicated to archaeology (D).
- From D and "if dedicated, then either makes groundbreaking discoveries or becomes a leading expert, but not both," we get G XOR E.
- From "Emmy does not gain recognition" and "if advances historical knowledge then gains recognition," we get not A (¬A).
- From "if sheds new light then inspires" and "Emmy does not inspire," we get not S (¬S).
- From "if uncovers lost artifacts or deciphers texts then sheds new light," and ¬S, we get ¬U and ¬T. So U is false.
- From ¬A and "if (G XOR U) then A," we get ¬(G XOR U). With U false, this implies ¬G.
- Given G XOR E and ¬G, it follows that E is true.

Therefore, Emmy does become a leading expert, so the statement "Emmy does not become a leading expert" is false.
