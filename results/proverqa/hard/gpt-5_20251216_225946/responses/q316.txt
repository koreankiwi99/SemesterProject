Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Ali has a creative job, and for Ali: creative job -> (corporate xor nonprofit). Given Ali works in a nonprofit, it follows Ali does not work in a corporate environment.
- Ali is either an artist or works in a corporate environment, but not both. Since she is not in corporate, Ali must be an artist.
- For any artist: artist -> (express emotions freely or inspire others) (inclusive). So Ali either expresses emotions freely or inspires others (or both).
- Ali follows tradition, and “follows tradition xor pursues passions” implies she does not pursue her passions.
- Given “pursues passions or finds inner peace,” and she does not pursue passions, Ali must find inner peace.
- “Finds inner peace or inspires others (not necessarily both)” is satisfied by finding inner peace; this does not force “inspires others” to be true or false.
- From being an artist, Ali must have at least one of {expresses emotions freely, inspires others}. Since “inspires others” remains undetermined, “expresses emotions freely” is not entailed.

Conclusion: It cannot be determined whether Ali expresses her emotions freely.
