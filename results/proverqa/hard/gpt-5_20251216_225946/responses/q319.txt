Question ID: 319
Difficulty: hard

Context:

Options:

  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Let C = Isaac is confident; S = Isaac is self-doubting; G = Isaac gains confidence; U = Isaac has a unique style; L = Isaac lacks recognition; D = Isaac deserves acclaim; P = Isaac receives praise.
- Given: ¬G. Also, (D or P) -> G. By contrapositive, ¬G -> (¬D and ¬P). So ¬D and ¬P.
- Given: U. Also, (U and L) -> D. Since ¬D and U, by contrapositive we get ¬L.
- Given: S -> L. With ¬L, by contrapositive we get ¬S.
- Given: Exactly one of C or S is true. Since ¬S, it follows that C is true.
- This does not conflict with ¬G, because being confident does not imply gaining confidence.

Conclusion: Isaac is confident.
