Question ID: 320
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Kayson has adaptability. If Kayson lives in an arid land, then he either has strong coils or specialized scales, but not both. Kayson does not have strong coils. Kayson cannot survive in harsh environments. If Kayson lives in the desert, then he is either camouflaged or has a striking pattern (or both). All snakes that live in the desert have good vision and are camouflaged. If a snake is either an expert hunter or a desert dweller (but not both), then it slides through the sand. Kayson has stealth. All snakes with effortless movement either have remarkable speed or specialized scales (or both). If Kayson has a striking pattern, then he is venomous and has a deadly reputation. Edith lives in an arid land. Kayson does not dominate his territory. If a snake is a skilled predator and has stealth, then it dominates its territory. If a snake is adaptable and camouflaged, then it can survive in harsh environments. Kayson lives in an arid land. Carla is not a fast mover. Kayson is an expert hunter. All snakes with specialized scales are either skilled predators or have a deadly reputation (or both). For all snakes, having venom glands and injecting toxic fluid makes them venomous. Kayson is not a fast mover. All snakes that slide through the sand are fast movers.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kayson is not agile.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Kayson lives in an arid land” and “If Kayson lives in an arid land, then he either has strong coils or specialized scales (but not both)” plus “Kayson does not have strong coils,” we conclude Kayson has specialized scales.
- With specialized scales and “All snakes with specialized scales are either skilled predators or have a deadly reputation (or both),” and given “If a snake is a skilled predator and has stealth, then it dominates its territory” plus “Kayson has stealth” and “Kayson does not dominate his territory,” we infer Kayson is not a skilled predator; therefore he has a deadly reputation.
- Kayson is an expert hunter. From “If a snake is either an expert hunter or a desert dweller (but not both), then it slides through the sand” and “All snakes that slide through the sand are fast movers,” together with “Kayson is not a fast mover,” we get that Kayson does not slide; hence the XOR antecedent is false. Since he is an expert hunter, the XOR is false only if he is also a desert dweller. So Kayson lives in the desert.
- Therefore he is camouflaged (all desert snakes are camouflaged). Combined with adaptability, this would imply he can survive in harsh environments, which contradicts the given “Kayson cannot survive in harsh environments.” This inconsistency does not affect “agile.”
- Nowhere is “agile” defined or linked to fast movement, speed, stealth, or any other given property. Thus we cannot determine whether Kayson is agile or not.
