Question ID: 321
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Candy does not continue to evolve. Candy either processes data quickly or enhances accuracy. Candy does not process data quickly. If Candy stays relevant forever and meets user expectations, then she continues to evolve. Candy receives regular updates. Candy either predicts user needs or handles large capacity, but not necessarily both. If a computer program efficiently manages data and predicts user needs, then it becomes an indispensable tool. If Iker becomes an indispensable tool and receives regular updates, then she stays relevant forever. Skyla does not handle large capacity. If Candy becomes an indispensable tool and receives regular updates, then she stays relevant forever. Candy does not boost research. Skyla does not continue to evolve. Any computer program that streamlines processes will improve productivity. Candy does not handle large capacity. Candy meets user expectations. For all computer programs, if a program is well-designed, then it efficiently manages data and streamlines processes. Any computer program that is refined will enhance accuracy. A computer program that improves productivity and enhances accuracy will boost research.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Candy is well-designed.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Candy either processes data quickly or enhances accuracy" and "Candy does not process data quickly," we infer: Candy enhances accuracy.
- If Candy were well-designed, then by the rule "well-designed -> efficiently manages data and streamlines processes," she would streamline processes, hence "improves productivity."
- "Improves productivity" together with "enhances accuracy" implies "boosts research."
- But we are told "Candy does not boost research." Therefore, assuming Candy is well-designed leads to a contradiction.
- Thus, Candy is not well-designed.

ANSWER: B

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
