Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Gracelyn has not found her artistic voice.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Gracelyn is passionate and not inspired. From “If passionate then inspired or creative (but not both),” she must be creative.
- If creative, then she has either found her artistic voice or is disillusioned, but not both. So Voice XOR Disillusioned.
- Gracelyn is motivated and does not have a clear mind. From “If motivated then finds flow or has a clear mind (but not both),” she must find her flow.
- Anyone who finds their flow can feel fulfilled; thus Gracelyn can feel fulfilled. Together with “If she struggles to create then either found fulfillment or is disillusioned, but not both,” and given she struggles to create, this forces that she is fulfilled and not disillusioned.
- Since she is not disillusioned and is creative, the earlier XOR (Voice XOR Disillusioned) yields that she has found her artistic voice.

Therefore, “Gracelyn has not found her artistic voice” is false.
