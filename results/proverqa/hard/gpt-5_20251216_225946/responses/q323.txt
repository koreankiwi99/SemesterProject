==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
1) From "Ezrah tells stories" and "If Ezrah tells stories, then she speaks passionately and has conviction," conclude: Ezrah speaks passionately and has conviction.
2) Given "If someone conveys complex ideas and speaks passionately, then they can inspire others" and "Ezrah does not inspire others," it follows that Ezrah does not convey complex ideas.
3) From "If Ezrah either communicates effectively or listens actively (but not both), then she can convey complex ideas" and step 2, use contrapositive to get: not(communicates effectively XOR listens actively). Given "Ezrah does not listen actively," this implies Ezrah does not communicate effectively.
4) From "If Ezrah possesses a gift, then she either understands human nature or communicates effectively (or both)," and given Ezrah does not understand human nature and does not communicate effectively, conclude via contrapositive: Ezrah does not possess a gift.
5) From "Ezrah is attuned to others" and "If Ezrah is attuned to others, then she interprets symbols and has intuitive abilities," conclude she interprets symbols and has intuitive abilities.
6) No statements relate "gaining people's trust" to any of the properties above. There is no rule allowing us to infer whether Ezrah gains people's trust or not.
