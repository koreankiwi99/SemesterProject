==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Gustavo does not raise awareness. He stands up for his rights, and anyone who stands up for their rights either challenges authority or raises awareness. Therefore, he challenges authority.
- If he challenges authority, then he either empowers others or inspires change. He does not inspire change, so he empowers others.
- If he either mobilizes crowds or empowers others (but not both), then he is a community organizer. He does not mobilize crowds and he does empower others, so he is a community organizer.
- If he is a community organizer, then he is either a social advocate or a leader, but not both.
- Gustavo either seeks power or speaks truth (but not both), and he does not seek power, so he speaks truth to power. Anyone who speaks truth to power is a social advocate. Hence he is a social advocate.
- Since as a community organizer he must be either a social advocate or a leader but not both, and he is a social advocate, he is not a leader.
- He is a leader or an activist (or both). Since he is not a leader, he must be an activist.

Therefore, the statement “Gustavo is not an activist” is false.
