Question ID: 328
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Paloma is attentive to details, then she understands lighting and visualizes compositions. If someone understands lighting, then they may not necessarily compose framing well, and vice versa. If Quinn has good eyesight, then she is either detail-oriented or culturally sensitive (but not both). Paloma cannot edit images. Jordan does not have artistic talent. If Paloma has good eyesight, then she is either detail-oriented or culturally sensitive (but not both). Paloma either buys quality equipment or has a creative vision. If Paloma either sees beyond appearance or finds unique angles (but not both), then she has a creative vision. If Paloma knows photography techniques and buys quality equipment, then she has a good camera. If Paloma has a creative vision, then she either understands lighting or can edit images, but not both. Quinn cannot edit images. Paloma is detail-oriented. If Paloma travels extensively and has a good camera, then she can become a professional photographer. If Paloma becomes a professional photographer, then she will take stunning photos. Doobie is culturally sensitive. Paloma does not have artistic talent. Paloma knows photography techniques. If Paloma takes stunning photos, then she either has good eyesight or artistic talent (but not both). Anyone who captures intimate moments or tells powerful stories can take stunning photos. Paloma composes framing well. Paloma is culturally sensitive.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Paloma travels extensively.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Paloma is detail-oriented, so she understands lighting (UL) and visualizes compositions.
- Paloma is both detail-oriented and culturally sensitive. From “If Paloma has good eyesight (GE), then detail-oriented XOR culturally sensitive,” we get that GE would force exactly one of those, but both are true. By modus tollens, Paloma does not have good eyesight (¬GE).
- From “If Paloma takes stunning photos (SP), then GE XOR artistic talent (AT),” and given AT is false, SP → GE. Since ¬GE, we conclude ¬SP.
- From “If Paloma travels extensively (TE) and has a good camera (GC), then professional photographer → stunning photos,” we get (TE ∧ GC) → SP. With ¬SP, we infer ¬(TE ∧ GC), i.e., ¬TE ∨ ¬GC.
- To force ¬TE, we would need GC true. GC is true if Paloma knows techniques and buys quality equipment (KPT ∧ BE). She does know techniques, but “Paloma either buys quality equipment or has a creative vision” (inclusive or, since “but not both” is not stated) allows the case where BE is false and creative vision is true, which would leave GC unproven. Creative vision is consistent with all other facts.
- Therefore GC is not guaranteed, and we cannot determine TE from the premises.
