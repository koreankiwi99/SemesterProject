==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From “acts on impulse” and “either acts on impulse or thinks critically, but not both,” conclude he does not think critically.
- Ambitious and “if ambitious, then either prioritizes leisure or enjoys freedom, but not both,” together with “does not enjoy freedom,” imply he prioritizes leisure.
- With “either prioritizes leisure or works tirelessly, but not both,” and prioritizes leisure true, he does not work tirelessly.
- From “has career goals” and “if has career goals, then either has strong motivation or pursues his passion, but not both,” together with “does not have strong motivation,” conclude he pursues his passion.
- From “if pursues his passion, then either dedicated or achieves success, but not both,” and “achieves success” true, conclude he is not dedicated.

None of the given statements link to “becomes an expert in his field.” There is no rule that success, dedication, work ethic, or any other derived fact entails or precludes becoming an expert. Therefore, the statement cannot be determined from the premises.
