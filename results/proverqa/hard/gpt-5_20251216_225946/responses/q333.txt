Question ID: 333
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If someone advances medical knowledge and communicates effectively, then they can inspire others. Jude either appreciates biological complexity or values scientific discovery (or both). Anyone who studies morphogenesis either identifies developmental mechanisms or understands cellular processes (or both). Rosemary either appreciates biological complexity or values scientific discovery (or both). Jude does not make new discoveries. Jude shares ideas or communicates effectively. Jude does not achieve recognition. Anyone who inspires others or makes new discoveries will achieve recognition. Anyone who appreciates biological complexity understands cellular processes or advances medical knowledge (or both). Ryan does not achieve recognition. Ryan either has curiosity or understands cellular processes, but it is possible for Ryan to have both. Jude has curiosity. Jude either has curiosity or understands cellular processes, but it is possible for Jude to have both. Saint has curiosity. Anyone who speaks clearly and listens actively can communicate effectively. Jude does not share ideas.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jude values scientific discovery.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Jude shares ideas or communicates effectively” and “Jude does not share ideas,” we get Jude communicates effectively.
- From “Anyone who inspires others or makes new discoveries will achieve recognition” and “Jude does not achieve recognition,” we infer Jude neither inspires others nor makes new discoveries.
- Using “If someone advances medical knowledge and communicates effectively, then they can inspire others,” together with Jude communicates effectively and does not inspire others, we conclude Jude does not advance medical knowledge.
- If Jude appreciates biological complexity, then he understands cellular processes or advances medical knowledge. Since he does not advance medical knowledge, appreciating biological complexity would imply he understands cellular processes. This is consistent and does not force or rule out “values scientific discovery.”
- Given “Jude either appreciates biological complexity or values scientific discovery (or both),” and no further constraint, we cannot determine whether he values scientific discovery.

ANSWER: C

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
