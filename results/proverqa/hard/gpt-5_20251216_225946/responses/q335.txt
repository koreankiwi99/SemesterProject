Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Bridger does not speak from the heart and does tell profound stories. Given the XOR rule (“If Bridger either speaks from the heart or tells profound stories (but not both), then he has high inspirational value”), Bridger has high inspirational value.
- If Bridger has high inspirational value, then he is either receiving divine messages or is highly intellectually capable, but not both. Since Bridger is highly intellectually capable, it follows (by the XOR) that he is not receiving divine messages.
- The only rule connecting “revered as a prophet” is specific to Jayson: if Jayson receives divine messages or possesses great wisdom, then Jayson is revered as a prophet. There is no analogous rule for Bridger, nor any rule that would make or preclude Bridger being revered as a prophet.

Conclusion: There is insufficient information to determine whether Bridger is revered as a prophet.
