Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Maia does not protect succulents, and she either explores deserts or protects succulents (or both). Therefore, Maia explores deserts.
- If Maia explores deserts, then she gains deeper knowledge and conserves plants. So she conserves plants (and gains deeper knowledge).
- Maia collects specimens. Given the rule that if she collects specimens then she either shares findings or conserves plants (but not both), and we already know she conserves plants, it follows she does not share her findings.
- Maia cultivates succulents, and she either cultivates succulents or understands ecosystems (but not both). Hence she does not understand ecosystems.
- Maia does not contribute to society. From “Any cactus lover who documents plants or supports research can contribute to society,” we can only infer that either Maia is not a cactus lover or she does not document plants/support research. This gives no definitive information about whether she studies cacti.
- No statement defines or entails “studies cacti,” nor can it be derived from the given facts.

Therefore, whether Maia studies cacti cannot be determined from the information provided.
