If Ameer is passionate about research, then he collaborates with others and specializes in a field. If Ameer pursues higher education, then he either becomes an expert or makes meaningful contributions to society (or both).

If Ameer either publishes research or mentors students (but not both), then he can advance knowledge. Ameer does not inspire others.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ameer does not study hard.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Ameer prioritizes the wellbeing of others” and “If someone prioritizes the wellbeing of others, then they have strong ethics,” Ameer has strong ethics.
- From “Anyone who has strong ethics and pursues noble goals will inspire others” and “Ameer does not inspire others,” it follows that Ameer does not pursue noble goals. Therefore, from “Ameer values integrity or pursues noble goals,” Ameer must value integrity.
- With “If Ameer either makes meaningful contributions or pursues noble goals (but not both), then he leads by example,” and since he does not pursue noble goals, this becomes: if Ameer makes meaningful contributions (MC), then he leads by example.
- From “If Ameer studies hard, then he makes meaningful contributions,” studying hard (SH) would imply MC, which would imply he leads by example, which would imply he can advance knowledge. None of this contradicts any given fact.
- There is no rule that forces Ameer to study hard, nor any rule that makes studying hard impossible.

Therefore, whether Ameer studies hard cannot be determined from the information given.
