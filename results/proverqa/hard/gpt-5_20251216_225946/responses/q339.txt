Question ID: 339
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Presley does not try new techniques. If Presley is an innovative artist, then he either creates visually stunning work or applies mathematical principles in his art (or both). Presley takes creative risks. If an artist understands color theory and uses natural light effectively, then they can create visually stunning work. Presley does not pursue creative expression. For Presley, either his work focuses on functionality or it creates visually stunning effects, but these two aspects are mutually exclusive. If an artist is comfortable with taking risks, they will experiment fearlessly. Every artist who experiments fearlessly pushes boundaries. If Presley either tries new techniques or takes creative risks (but not both), then he is comfortable with uncertainty. All artists who push boundaries are innovative artists. For Presley, either his work focuses on functionality or he pursues creative expression, but these two aspects are mutually exclusive.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Presley applies mathematical principles in his art.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Presley does not pursue creative expression” and “Functionality xor Creative Expression,” Presley’s work focuses on functionality.
- From “Functionality xor Visually Stunning,” since functionality is true, Presley’s work is not visually stunning.
- Presley does not try new techniques, but he does take creative risks. Given the “tries new techniques xor takes creative risks → comfortable with uncertainty,” Presley is comfortable with uncertainty. However, there is no rule connecting comfortable with uncertainty to experimenting fearlessly or innovation.
- The chain “comfortable with taking risks → experiments fearlessly → pushes boundaries → innovative” cannot be triggered because we do not have “comfortable with taking risks,” only “takes creative risks,” which is not stated to imply comfort with taking risks.
- If Presley were innovative, then (visually stunning or applies mathematical principles). Since he is not visually stunning, innovation would imply he applies mathematical principles. But we cannot deduce that he is innovative.

Conclusion: Whether Presley applies mathematical principles cannot be determined from the given information.
