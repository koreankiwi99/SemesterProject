==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Dimples exercises outside ⇒ Dimples feels hot.
- Rule: If an elephant avoids sunlight and feels hot, it stays cool. Contrapositive with Dimples not staying cool and feeling hot ⇒ Dimples does not avoid sunlight.
- Rule: Elephants who either avoid sunlight or prefer warm temperatures (but not both) seek shade. Since Dimples does not avoid sunlight, if she preferred warm temperatures, she would seek shade ⇒ would need relaxation. But Dimples does not need relaxation ⇒ she does not prefer warm temperatures.
- Exclusive-or: Either Dimples enjoys cool temperatures or she prefers warm temperatures, but not both. Since she does not prefer warm temperatures, she must enjoy cool temperatures.
