Question ID: 342
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Everyone who values critique either embraces debate or is open-minded (or both). Anyone who considers alternatives and questions assumptions can challenge the status quo. Raphael has extensive knowledge. Raphael does not write influential books. Raphael is either a respected authority or has unconventional views, but not both. Anyone who has extensive knowledge and speaks authoritatively gains recognition. Raphael is either a respected authority or a doubted expert, but not both. Raphael does not embrace debate. Raphael does not gain recognition. If Raphael challenges the status quo, then he either writes influential books or speaks authoritatively (or both). If someone is open-minded and has unconventional views, then they challenge the status quo. Raphael values critique.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Raphael is a doubted expert.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Raphael values critique and does not embrace debate, so by “values critique -> embraces debate or open-minded,” he must be open-minded.
- He does not gain recognition. Given he has extensive knowledge and “extensive knowledge ∧ speaks authoritatively -> gains recognition,” it follows he does not speak authoritatively (otherwise he would gain recognition).
- From “if challenges the status quo -> writes influential books or speaks authoritatively,” and since he neither writes influential books nor speaks authoritatively, he does not challenge the status quo.
- From “open-minded ∧ unconventional views -> challenges the status quo,” and since he is open-minded but does not challenge the status quo, he cannot have unconventional views.
- From “respected authority xor unconventional views,” with unconventional views false, he must be a respected authority.
- From “respected authority xor doubted expert,” with respected authority true, he is not a doubted expert.

Therefore, the statement “Raphael is a doubted expert” is false.
