==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Kenna encourages free expression. Given the exclusive-or with following conventional rules, she does not follow conventional rules.
- Given the exclusive-or between following conventional rules and thinking outside the box, Kenna thinks outside the box.
- Kenna does not appreciate conformity; with the exclusive-or between appreciating conformity and valuing individuality, she values individuality.
- If Kenna collaborates with others or welcomes diverse perspectives (or both), then she creates innovative work. This does not give a necessity about welcoming diverse perspectives on its own.
- Kenna either embraces new ideas or collaborates with others (inclusive). In either case, nothing directly forces whether she welcomes diverse perspectives.
- There is no rule that either compels or forbids Kenna welcoming diverse perspectives. It is consistent for her to welcome them or not welcome them without contradiction to the given facts.
