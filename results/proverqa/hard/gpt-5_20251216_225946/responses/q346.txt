Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Everyone makes plans or sets goals; Araya does not make plans, so she sets goals.
- Anyone who sets goals is motivated; hence Araya is motivated.
- If motivated, then pursuing hobbies XOR stable job; Araya is pursuing hobbies, so she does not have a stable job.
- Araya follows her intuition and enjoys exploration; thus she embraces spontaneity.
- Araya either values practicality or embraces spontaneity, but not both; since she embraces spontaneity, she does not value practicality.
- Araya either values practicality or has a creative passion, but not both; since she does not value practicality, she has a creative passion.
- If Araya has a creative passion or a stable job, then she leads a balanced life; she has a creative passion, so she leads a balanced life.

Therefore, the statement “Araya does not lead a balanced life” is false.
