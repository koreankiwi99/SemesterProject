Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ayleen does not lack expertise in botany.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From Ayleen works outdoors and “works outdoors -> exactly one of studies horticulture or appreciates landscaping,” and given Ayleen appreciates landscaping, we infer Ayleen does not study horticulture.
- The rule “exactly one of loves gardening or studies horticulture -> cares for plants” reduces (since she does not study horticulture) to: if Ayleen loves gardening, then she cares for plants.
- If Ayleen cares for plants, then she is passionate about research and has expertise in botany. Thus, if she loves gardening, she has botany expertise.
- However, we do not know that she loves gardening. We only know “Ayleen enjoys nature or loves gardening,” which doesn’t force loves gardening (she could just enjoy nature).
- Therefore, having botany expertise is not entailed; either option remains consistent with the facts, despite the exclusive choice “has expertise or lacks expertise (but not both).”
