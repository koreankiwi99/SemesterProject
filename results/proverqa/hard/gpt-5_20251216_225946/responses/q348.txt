Question ID: 348
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Saul finds an inspirational figure, then he will either become a success or pay tribute to that figure, but not both. Saul does not continue to create. Saul practices diligently. If someone gains recognition and develops a unique voice, then they will continue to create. If someone explores their own style, they may not necessarily find an inspirational figure, and vice versa. Saul draws from influences. Saul values feedback. If Saul produces original work, then he will earn critical acclaim. Saul does not earn critical acclaim. If Saul either stays true to himself or values feedback (but not both), then he will remain authentic. If Saul diligently practices and stays true to himself, then he will gain recognition. Saul does not remain authentic. If Saul either draws from influences or pays tribute to a figure, then he produces original work. If someone explores their own style, then they will develop a unique voice.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Saul does not become a success.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From “If Saul either draws from influences or pays tribute to a figure, then he produces original work” and “Saul draws from influences,” we get: Saul produces original work.
- From “If Saul produces original work, then he will earn critical acclaim” and “Saul does not earn critical acclaim,” by contraposition, Saul does not produce original work. This contradicts the earlier conclusion, indicating inconsistency in the premises. However, we can still use the implications to deduce specific consequences:
  - If Saul paid tribute, then he would produce original work and thus earn critical acclaim. Since he does not earn critical acclaim, he cannot have paid tribute. So: Saul does not pay tribute.
- From “Saul values feedback” and “If Saul either stays true to himself or values feedback (but not both), then he will remain authentic” together with “Saul does not remain authentic,” it follows that the XOR antecedent must be false. Therefore, Saul also stays true to himself.
- With “Saul practices diligently” and “If Saul diligently practices and stays true to himself, then he will gain recognition,” Saul gains recognition.
- From “If someone gains recognition and develops a unique voice, then they will continue to create” and “Saul does not continue to create,” we infer he does not have a unique voice; hence, by “If someone explores their own style, then they will develop a unique voice,” Saul does not explore his own style.

Now about success:
- “If Saul finds an inspirational figure, then he will either become a success or pay tribute to that figure, but not both.” We already deduced Saul does not pay tribute. Therefore, if he finds an inspirational figure, he would become a success.
- But we have no information that he does (or does not) find an inspirational figure, and statement about exploring style gives no necessary link to finding a figure.

Therefore, whether Saul becomes a success cannot be determined from the given information.
