Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Emmy is famous ⇒ Emmy is a public figure.
- If a public figure, then ruthless XOR sophisticated. Given Emmy is sophisticated ⇒ Emmy is not ruthless.
- Emmy does not help others, but “helps others or volunteers generously” holds ⇒ Emmy volunteers generously ⇒ By “supports or volunteers ⇒ compassionate,” Emmy is compassionate.
- Emmy holds a leadership role ⇒ authority XOR compassionate. Since compassionate is true ⇒ authority is false.
- Emmy is kind XOR has authority; with authority false ⇒ Emmy is kind.
- If Emmy is ruthless XOR kind ⇒ she is complex. We have kind true and ruthless false ⇒ the XOR condition holds ⇒ Emmy is complex.

Therefore, “Emmy is not complex” is false.
