Question ID: 350
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Rebekah is either a dedicated researcher or pursues independent projects, but not both. If Rebekah is a well-funded entomologist, then she either has a mentor or makes breakthroughs (but not both). Rebekah specializes in bees. If Rebekah is successful or has experience, then she makes breakthroughs. If Rebekah is curious, then she can solve complex problems and pursue independent projects. Every innovative entomologist either explores remote areas or develops new theories (or both). Rebekah does not explore remote areas. If Rebekah either investigates ecosystems or pursues independent projects (but not both), then she is innovative. Rebekah studies wasps. If Rebekah either makes breakthroughs or publishes papers (but not both), then she advances her field. All entomologists who advance their field are dedicated researchers and inspire others. Rebekah does not publish papers. If Molly either investigates ecosystems or pursues independent projects (but not both), then she is innovative. Rebekah investigates ecosystems. Any entomologist who either collects rare samples or discovers new species can be successful. Rebekah collaborates with colleagues. If Rebekah studies moths, then she either specializes in bees or studies wasps, but not both. Bryce does not develop new theories. If Rebekah either classifies insects or analyzes wing patterns (but not both), then she studies moths. Rebekah does not develop new theories. An entomologist either inspires others or collaborates with colleagues, but not necessarily both. For any entomologist, examining nocturnal behaviors and analyzing camouflage techniques can lead to innovation. If Rebekah either studies butterflies or studies moths (but not both), then she is successful.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rebekah does not study butterflies.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Every innovative entomologist either explores remote areas or develops new theories" and "Rebekah does not explore remote areas" and "Rebekah does not develop new theories," conclude Rebekah is not innovative.
- From "If Rebekah either investigates ecosystems or pursues independent projects (but not both), then she is innovative" and "Rebekah investigates ecosystems," not innovative implies not(IE XOR PIP), so PIP is true.
- From "Rebekah is either a dedicated researcher or pursues independent projects, but not both," with PIP true, conclude she is not a dedicated researcher.
- From "All entomologists who advance their field are dedicated researchers," conclude she does not advance her field.
- From "If Rebekah either makes breakthroughs or publishes papers (but not both), then she advances her field" and "Rebekah does not publish papers," not advancing implies she does not make breakthroughs.
- From "If Rebekah is successful or has experience, then she makes breakthroughs," not making breakthroughs implies she is not successful.
- From "If Rebekah either studies butterflies or studies moths (but not both), then she is successful," not successful implies not(studies butterflies XOR studies moths); they have the same truth value.
- From "If Rebekah studies moths, then she either specializes in bees or studies wasps, but not both" and given she both specializes in bees and studies wasps, conclude she does not study moths.
- Since butterflies and moths must have the same truth value and moths is false, butterflies is also false.

Therefore, Rebekah does not study butterflies.
