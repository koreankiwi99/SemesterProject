==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Isabela pursues passions and does not overcome obstacles, so (OO ⊕ PP) is true, implying she has ambition.
- Having ambition implies (sets goals ⊕ achieves success). Since she achieves success, she does not set goals.
- From (sets goals ⊕ meets deadlines) and not setting goals, she meets deadlines.
- She does not stay motivated, and (meets deadlines ⊕ faces challenges) → stays motivated. Therefore, not (meets deadlines ⊕ faces challenges). With meets deadlines true, faces challenges must also be true.
- She encounters problems, which implies (helps others ⊕ supports family). Also, supports family → (prioritizes well-being ⊕ values community); but she has both well-being and values community, so not (PWB ⊕ VC), hence she does not support family. Therefore she helps others.
- Facing challenges and helping others implies she is brave.
- Given (brave ⊕ fearful) and brave true, fearful is false.
