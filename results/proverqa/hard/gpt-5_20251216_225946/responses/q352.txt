Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Boden does not bring people joy.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Boden appreciates silence. Given “For Boden, either he appreciates silence or he plays an instrument, but not both,” Boden does not play an instrument.
- Boden has a creative vision, so by the rule, he expresses emotions deeply and writes lyrics.
- If Boden either writes lyrics or creates harmonies (but not both), then he composes music. We know he writes lyrics, but we do not know whether he also creates harmonies. The statement “For any person, they either convey emotions through their art or create harmonies, but not necessarily both,” together with “Boden conveys emotions through his music,” does not tell us whether he creates harmonies; both could be true.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Boden composes music.
- The only given sufficient condition for bringing people joy is: if a person plays an instrument or composes music, then they bring people joy. We know Boden does not play an instrument, and it’s uncertain whether he composes music.

Conclusion: Whether Boden brings people joy is not determined by the given information, so the statement “Boden does not bring people joy” is uncertain.
