Question ID: 353
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Cuddlebug either respects nature or harms nature (but not both), then he is responsible. Devin visits beaches or enjoys hiking. If Devin enjoys hiking, then he either grows up outdoors or appreciates biodiversity, but not both. For Devin, he either conserves wildlife or harms nature, but not both. If Cuddlebug grows up outdoors, then he values the ecosystem and promotes sustainability. For anyone, if they love marine life and promote sustainability, then they conserve wildlife. If Devin either protects habitats or preserves water quality (but not both), then he conserves wildlife. Devin does not appreciate biodiversity. If Devin grows up outdoors, then he values the ecosystem and promotes sustainability. Devin does not explore caves. Cuddlebug does not explore caves. Devin loves marine life. Devin collects rocks. If Devin either explores caves or collects rocks (but not both), then he enjoys hiking.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Devin is not responsible.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Devin does not explore caves and does collect rocks. The XOR rule (explores caves or collects rocks, but not both) triggers, so Devin enjoys hiking.
- Enjoys hiking implies (grows up outdoors XOR appreciates biodiversity). Since Devin does not appreciate biodiversity, he must grow up outdoors.
- Growing up outdoors implies he promotes sustainability; with loving marine life, this implies he conserves wildlife.
- Given (conserves wildlife XOR harms nature), conserving wildlife means he does not harm nature.
- No rule connects Devin’s properties to being responsible. The only responsibility rule is specific to Cuddlebug.

Conclusion: We cannot determine Devin’s responsibility status.

ANSWER: C

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
