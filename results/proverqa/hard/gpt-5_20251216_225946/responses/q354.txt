==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Zain experiences different cultures (E) and values his heritage (V).
- From “Anyone who experiences different cultures and values their heritage can have a unique perspective,” we infer U (unique perspective).
- From “Zain either has a unique perspective or identifies with multiple cultures, but not both,” U implies not M (does not identify with multiple cultures).
- From “either identifies with multiple cultures or has a homogeneous upbringing, but not both,” not M implies H (homogeneous upbringing).
- From “either homogeneous upbringing or fully embraces cultural diversity, but not both,” H implies not F (does not fully embrace cultural diversity).
- From “either strong sense of belonging or fully embraces cultural diversity, but not both,” not F implies Belong (strong sense of belonging).
- From “either strong sense of belonging or struggles with identity, but not both,” Belong implies not Struggle.

Therefore, Zain does not struggle with his identity.
