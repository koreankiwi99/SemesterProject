Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Alfonso does not have advanced skills.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Alfonso pursues continuing education and, by the XOR rule with strong ethics, does not have strong ethics.
- Alfonso does not pursue personal gain; by the XOR with compassionate/personal gain, Alfonso is compassionate.
- With strong morals and not generous, and the XOR rule (strong morals -> selfless or generous, not both), Alfonso is selfless.
- Compassionate implies empathetic XOR selfless; since selfless, Alfonso is not empathetic.
- If motivated to help others, then empathy XOR strong ethics; since Alfonso has neither, he is not motivated to help others.
- From (dedicated to osteopathy OR passionate about healthcare) -> motivated, contrapositive gives not dedicated and not passionate.
- From (strong communicator AND understands anatomy) -> dedicated, contrapositive gives not(strong communicator AND understands anatomy).
- From improves outcomes -> gains trust, and Alfonso does not gain trust, infer he does not improve outcomes.
- Nowhere is “advanced skills” defined or logically linked to any given property. No rule allows us to infer whether he has or lacks advanced skills.

Conclusion: The truth of “Alfonso does not have advanced skills” cannot be determined from the given information.
