Question ID: 359
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Aarav has a good memory and listens attentively, then he can speak many languages. If Aarav holds high office, then he is either respected or admired, but not both. For anyone who speaks many languages and understands cultures, they can communicate well. Aarav does not have local knowledge. If Aarav either speaks confidently or listens attentively (but not both), then he is respected. Anyone who has confidence and has wit can be charismatic. Aarav either values honesty or understands cultures, but no one necessarily possesses both qualities. If Aarav is well-traveled, then he either speaks many languages or has local knowledge, but not both. Aarav does not value honesty. If Cuteness is well-traveled, then he either speaks many languages or has local knowledge, but not both. Aarav is well-traveled. Anyone who serves nobly or negotiates effectively is admired. Aarav serves nobly. Aarav holds high office. Anyone who studies history or lives abroad understands cultures.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Aarav is either charismatic or diplomatic (but not both), then he is respected.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Aarav is well-traveled and does not have local knowledge. From the XOR rule (well-traveled → speaks many languages XOR local knowledge), he must speak many languages.
- Aarav does not value honesty, and from the XOR (values honesty XOR understands cultures), he must understand cultures.
- Speaking many languages and understanding cultures implies he can communicate well (not directly relevant to respect).
- Aarav serves nobly, so he is admired. He also holds high office, which implies exactly one of respected or admired. Since he is admired, he is not respected.
- The antecedent “charismatic XOR diplomatic” is undetermined: there’s only a sufficient rule for being charismatic (confidence and wit), and nothing about being diplomatic. We have no facts establishing either.
- With respected being false, the conditional “if (charismatic XOR diplomatic) then respected” would be false if the antecedent is true, and true if the antecedent is false. Since we can’t determine the antecedent, the overall statement is uncertain.
