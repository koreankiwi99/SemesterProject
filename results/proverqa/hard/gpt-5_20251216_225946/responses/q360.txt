Question ID: 360
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Valeria prioritizes efficiency. Valeria either prioritizes efficiency or values compassion, but not necessarily both. If someone either seeks power or craves wealth (but not both), then they are driven by a desire to pursue personal gain. Valeria is either selfless or selfish, but not both. If Valeria is ambitious, then she either craves wealth or desires recognition, but not both. Valeria either values compassion or may crave wealth, but not necessarily both. Valeria either serves others or seeks power, but not both. If Valeria holds authority, then she either seeks power or takes initiative (or both). Valeria is either driven by a desire to pursue personal gain or acts selflessly, but not both. Valeria serves others.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Valeria is not selfish.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- Valeria serves others, and "serves others or seeks power, but not both" implies she does not seek power.
- If she craves wealth, then (since she does not seek power) the exclusive-or condition "seeks power or craves wealth (but not both)" is satisfied, so she is driven by personal gain.
- Being driven by personal gain and "either driven by personal gain or acts selflessly, but not both" implies she does not act selflessly. With "selfless or selfish, but not both," that makes her selfish. In this case, "Valeria is not selfish" would be false.
- If she does not crave wealth, then from "values compassion or craves wealth (not necessarily both)" she must value compassion. Nothing then forces whether she is driven by personal gain or acts selflessly; either is possible. Hence she could be selfish or not selfish.

Since both possibilities exist, the statement "Valeria is not selfish" cannot be determined from the given information.
