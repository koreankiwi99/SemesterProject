Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Esmeralda participates in therapy.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Esmeralda has strong instincts. From “either strong instincts or adapts (but not both),” she does not adapt to her habitat.
- Esmeralda performs tricks. Since she does not adapt, the “performs tricks XOR adapts” condition holds, so she learns quickly.
- She has keen instincts and learns quickly, so she is experienced.
- She responds to commands and has an affectionate personality, so she establishes a connection with her handler.
- Being experienced implies she either builds trust or establishes a connection; this is already satisfied by establishing a connection. It does not force building trust.
- From gentle nature, she either builds trust or soothes skittish animals. This does not force soothing, since building trust remains possible (and is not ruled out).
- From calm demeanor, Esmeralda must either soothe skittish animals or participate in therapy, but not both (exclusive or).
- We cannot deduce that she soothes skittish animals from the given information; hence we cannot determine whether she participates in therapy (it depends on whether she soothes).
