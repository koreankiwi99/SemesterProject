Question ID: 362
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Dr. Gabrielle does not make groundbreaking discoveries. Gabrielle coordinates fieldwork. Gabrielle dedicates herself to research. If Dr. Gabrielle is a renowned biologist, then she either makes groundbreaking discoveries or protects marine life. If Dr. Gabrielle publishes research or attends conferences, then she becomes an expert in her field. Gabrielle does not establish protected areas. Every biologist who studies animal behavior either analyzes data or publishes research (or both). If Dr. Gabrielle leads projects, then she collaborates with her peers and mentors students. If Dr. Gabrielle either leads projects or coordinates fieldwork, then she is highly motivated. Dr. Gabrielle does not analyze data. Gabrielle does not become an expert in her field. If Dr. Gabrielle dedicates herself to research, then she gains recognition and collaborates with her peers. Every biologist who protects marine life either studies animal behavior or establishes protected areas (or both). Dr. Gabrielle is not highly motivated.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Gabrielle does not contribute to conservation.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Given: She does not become an expert (¬E), and (publishes research OR attends conferences) → E. By contrapositive, ¬E ⇒ ¬publishes and ¬attends (¬PR and ¬AC).
- Given: She does not analyze data (¬AD). From ¬AD and ¬PR, we have ¬(AD or PR).
- Given: If studies animal behavior then (analyzes data OR publishes) (SAB → AD or PR). By contrapositive, ¬(AD or PR) ⇒ ¬SAB.
- Given: She does not establish protected areas (¬EPA).
- Given: If protects marine life then (SAB or EPA) (PML → SAB or EPA). Since ¬SAB and ¬EPA, we have ¬(SAB or EPA), so by contrapositive, ¬PML.

Thus she neither protects marine life nor establishes protected areas. Interpreting conservation as protecting marine life or establishing protected areas, she does not contribute to conservation.

ANSWER: A

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: A
Correct: No
