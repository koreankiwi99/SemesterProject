Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lenora is pain-free.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Lenora chooses natural remedies and, given “either natural remedies or avoids additives (but not both),” she does not avoid additives.
- She buys organic. XOR(buys organic, avoids additives) holds, so she shops healthy.
- If she shops healthy, she reads nutrition labels. Reading labels implies she eats balanced meals.
- Lenora does not get enough sleep.
- If XOR(eats balanced meals, gets enough sleep), then she takes regular exercise. With balanced meals true and enough sleep false, the XOR condition holds, so she takes regular exercise.
- Either Lenora takes regular exercise or she has chronic pain, but not both. Since she exercises, she does not have chronic pain.
- Either Lenora has chronic pain or she is pain-free, but not both. Since she does not have chronic pain, she is pain-free.

ANSWER: A
