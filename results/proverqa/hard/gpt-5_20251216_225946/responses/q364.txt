==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Valeria prioritizes others or puts others first” and “Valeria does not prioritize others,” we get: Valeria puts others first. By “Anyone who … puts others first can act selflessly,” Valeria acts selflessly.
- Valeria stays calm. By “If someone stays calm … and vice versa,” infer she does not think critically. Given “Valeria responds flexibly,” the exclusive-or condition “(thinks critically xor responds flexibly) -> handles emergencies” is satisfied, so Valeria handles emergencies.
- With handles emergencies true and “Valeria does not make quick decisions,” the exclusive-or “(handles emergencies xor makes quick decisions) -> works under pressure” gives: Valeria works under pressure.
- “If Valeria works under pressure, then she either saves lives or cares for others.” Given “Valeria does not save lives,” conclude: Valeria cares for others.
- Now Valeria cares for others and acts selflessly, so by “If Valeria cares for others and acts selflessly, then she will be remembered as a hero,” conclude: Valeria will be remembered as a hero.

Therefore, the statement “Valeria will not be remembered as a hero” is false.
