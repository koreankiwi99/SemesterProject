Step-by-step reasoning:
- If Messiah spoke wittily, then by the rule, he would either tell compelling stories or have charisma.
- Messiah does not have charisma. If he told compelling stories, then he would think creatively, but Messiah does not think creatively. So speaking wittily leads to a contradiction.
- Therefore, by the exclusive-or (infectious laughter or speaks wittily, but not both), Messiah must have infectious laughter.
- Anyone with infectious laughter is outgoing. If Messiah is outgoing, then he hosts social events.
- Anyone who hosts social events (or brings people together) creates joyful experiences. Messiah hosts social events, so he creates joyful experiences.
