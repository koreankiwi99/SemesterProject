Question ID: 366
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Keanu has sharp hooves. All active deer have strong senses and good vision. All deer with powerful muscles and a lightweight build can run quickly. Keanu is calm. Florence is active. If a deer has keen senses, it may not necessarily run quickly, and vice versa. A deer either has a gentle nature or explores the wild, but not both is not necessarily true. All deer that live in the forest have keen senses. Keanu is not playful. Any deer that is surefooted or can leap far can explore the wild. Zayd has sharp hooves. Any deer that has sharp hooves and agile legs can run quickly. If Keanu has large ears or good vision, then he can live in the forest. Keanu has strong senses. Zayd is not playful. Keanu is active. If Keanu is calm, then he is either playful or has a gentle nature, but not both. Zayd has strong senses. If Keanu is fleet, then he is either capable of leaping far or is powerful, but not both. If Keanu has large antlers, then he is either capable of leaping far or has agile legs, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Keanu does not have large antlers.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Keanu is active, so he has strong senses and good vision.
- Good vision implies he can live in the forest; living in the forest implies keen senses.
- Keanu is calm and not playful; with the XOR rule, he must have a gentle nature.
- If Keanu had large antlers, then he would either be able to leap far or have agile legs (but not both).
  - If he can leap far, he can explore the wild. This does not contradict having a gentle nature (the exclusivity is explicitly not enforced).
  - If he has agile legs, combined with sharp hooves he can run quickly; no contradiction arises.
- No rule forces or forbids large antlers.

Therefore, whether Keanu lacks large antlers cannot be determined.

ANSWER: C

Result:

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: C
Correct: No
