==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- If Fallon examines antiquities, then she either analyzes data or draws accurate conclusions, but not both. Given Fallon does not analyze data and does not draw accurate conclusions, she cannot be examining antiquities.
- From "Fallon examines antiquities or interprets her finds correctly," not examining antiquities implies she interprets her finds correctly.
- From "Fallon either explores historical sites or interprets her finds correctly, but not both," interpreting correctly implies she does not explore historical sites.
- From "Fallon either explores historical sites or uncovers ancient artifacts," not exploring historical sites implies she uncovers ancient artifacts.
- If Fallon uncovers ancient artifacts and studies their significance, then she becomes an expert. We have that she uncovers artifacts, but there is no information forcing whether she studies their significance. Therefore, whether she became an expert cannot be determined from the given information.
