Question ID: 371
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Tate does not observe animal behavior. For any person, they either study biodiversity or understand pollinators, but it's possible they do both. If Tate is outdoorsy, then he either values conservation or the ecosystem, but not both. Cora either appreciates ragwort or disapproves of it, but not both. If Tate explores the outdoors, then he understands pollinators and loves wildflowers. Mallory protects wildlife. For Tate, he either studies biodiversity or observes animal behavior, but it's possible he does both. Tate protects wildlife. If someone protects wildlife, then they respect nature. Tate either appreciates ragwort or disapproves of it, but not both. Everyone who respects nature either understands the importance of pollinators or values the ecosystem (or both). If Tate values the ecosystem, then he will appreciate ragwort.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Tate disapproves of ragwort.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Tate does not observe animal behavior. From “For Tate, he either studies biodiversity or observes animal behavior (or both),” it follows Tate studies biodiversity.
- Tate protects wildlife, so he respects nature. Everyone who respects nature either understands pollinators or values the ecosystem (or both). Thus Tate has UP or VEco.
- If Tate values the ecosystem, then he appreciates ragwort (AR). Also, Tate either appreciates ragwort or disapproves of it (DR), but not both.
- If VEco is true, then AR is true and DR is false. If VEco is false, then UP must be true, but UP gives no information about ragwort; either AR or DR could hold (but not both).

Therefore, whether Tate disapproves of ragwort cannot be determined.

ANSWER: C

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
