==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Chanel is well-respected, so she has authority. From authority, she must be either humorous or empathetic (but not both), yet the premises state Chanel is both humorous and empathetic. This creates a contradiction in the premises.
- Chanel’s other attributes (large following, expert knowledge/jargon, not using complex vocabulary, not appearing intellectual) do not relate to credibility.
- The only rule involving “credible” concerns Renata, not Chanel. There is no rule connecting Chanel’s credibility to any of her stated traits.

Conclusion: There is no basis to deduce whether Chanel is or is not credible.
