Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Zain can facilitate international dialogue.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- RC is true. From RC -> (LFH and VLT), we get LFH and VLT.
- EL is true and HA is false. From EL -> (LFH XOR HA), this is consistent and confirms LFH.
- From VLT XOR EGC and VLT true, we get EGC false.
- From FCU XOR EGC and EGC false, we get FCU true.
- HMF is true. From (GUA or HMF) -> SML, we get SML true.
- From SML -> (BA XOR ADC) and ADC is false, we get BA true.
- From BA -> (FID XOR FCU) and FCU true, it follows that FID is false.

Therefore, Zain cannot facilitate international dialogue.

ANSWER: B

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
