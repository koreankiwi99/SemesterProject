==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Hope appreciates nature” and “If Hope appreciates nature, then she values balance and engages in yoga,” we get: Hope values balance and engages in yoga.
- Given “Hope does not live intentionally” and “If (Mindfulness XOR WritesPoetry) then lives intentionally,” we have ¬(Mindfulness XOR WritesPoetry). With “Hope does not write poetry,” this implies Hope does not practice mindfulness.
- From “Hope practices mindfulness or meditates daily,” and ¬Mindfulness, we conclude Hope meditates daily.
- From “Everyone who meditates daily either is calm or finds inner peace,” we get: Hope is calm or finds inner peace.
- From “If Hope is calm, then she takes good photos,” we can only conclude that if she is calm, then she takes good photos; if she is not calm (only finds inner peace), nothing follows about photos.
- There is no rule that forces calm, nor any rule that implies she does not take good photos. Therefore, whether she takes good photos is not determined.
