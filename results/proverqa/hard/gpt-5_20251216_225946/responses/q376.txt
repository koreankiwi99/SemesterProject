Question ID: 376
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Lucille does not have high endurance. Lucille has fast feet. If someone has strategic skills, then they are not necessarily a formidable fighter, and vice versa. Lucille does not have strategic skills. Lucille either trains rigorously or is motivated, but not both. If Lucille has quick reflexes, then she is aggressive. If Lucille either trains rigorously or delivers powerful blows (but not both), then she has high endurance. If Lucille is a professional boxer, then she either builds a strong physique or trains rigorously, but not both. If Lucille either has fast feet or quick reflexes, then she delivers powerful blows. Lucille is motivated.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lucille is not defensive.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Given: Lucille is motivated (M). Also, Lucille either trains rigorously (TR) or is motivated, but not both (TR XOR M). Since M is true, TR must be false.
- Given: Lucille has fast feet (FF). From (FF or quick reflexes) -> delivers powerful blows (POW), FF implies POW is true.
- From (TR XOR POW) -> high endurance (HE). With TR = false and POW = true, XOR is true, so HE is implied true. But we’re also told Lucille does not have high endurance. This creates a contradiction in the premises, but it does not inform anything about being defensive.
- There is no premise that mentions “defensive” or relates it to any established property (aggressive, endurance, etc.). Thus, we cannot determine whether Lucille is not defensive.

ANSWER: C

Result:

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
