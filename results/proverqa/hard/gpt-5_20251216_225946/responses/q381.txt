  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Natalie does not admire masters” and “Natalie either admires masters or appreciates classics,” we get: Natalie appreciates classics.
- If she appreciates classics, then she is a traditional artist and values originality. So: Traditional artist; values originality.
- From “Natalie is inspired by history” and “inspired by history implies either traditional artist or free-spirited artist, but not both,” and since she’s traditional, she is not free-spirited.
- From “Natalie draws from inspiration,” she either has creative expression or innovates her style (or both). If she has creative expression, then she experiments with techniques and produces unique work.
- She follows artistic rules. The statement that a person either innovates their style or follows artistic rules (not necessarily both) adds nothing further since she already follows rules.

No premises mention “gains recognition” or link any derived property to recognition. Thus, the truth of “Natalie does not gain recognition” cannot be determined.
