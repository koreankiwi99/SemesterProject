Model Response:
==================================================
- From Eliana works on large scale projects and the XOR rule, plus Eliana does not have strategic vision, we get Eliana implements new technologies.
- Eliana is passionate, so she organizes the community and mobilizes volunteers.
- Organizing the community and implementing new technologies implies she reduces waste.
- Reducing waste implies she loves nature; loving nature implies she cares for the environment and develops sustainable solutions.
- There is no rule connecting caring for the environment or developing sustainable solutions (or any other given property of Eliana) to supporting conservation efforts, nor any rule denying it.

Therefore, whether Eliana supports conservation efforts cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: C
