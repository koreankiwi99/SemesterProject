==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Sweetsie loves her colony and has a strong stinger.
- By the rule: All bees that love their colony and have a strong stinger will protect their hive. Therefore, Sweetsie protects her hive.
- By the rule: Any bee that protects its hive will sting when threatened. Therefore, Sweetsie stings when threatened.
- There is no rule implying that Sweetsie never stings; the only “never sting” rule pertains to Anderson.
- “Never stings” is incompatible with “stings when threatened,” so both cannot be true. Since we have established that Sweetsie stings when threatened, the exclusive-or statement holds.
