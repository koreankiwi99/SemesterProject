Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Devin loves water, so he enjoys boating.
- If Devin enjoys boating, then he either becomes a fisherman or works on a cruise (but not both). Given Devin does not work on a cruise, he becomes a fisherman.
- Devin has a passion for the ocean, which implies he is either a marine biologist or a fisherman (but not both). Since he is a fisherman, he is not a marine biologist.
- Devin enjoys surfing, so he either has a beach house or lives in a coastal town (but not both). Given he has a beach house, he does not live in a coastal town.
- Devin lives in a coastal town or grew up by the sea. Since he does not live in a coastal town, he grew up by the sea.
- If Devin grew up by the sea, then he is either a marine biologist or a coastal steward (but not both). Since he is not a marine biologist, he must be a coastal steward.

Therefore, the statement "Devin does not become a coastal steward" is false.
