If someone is open-minded, then they are culturally aware and respect traditions. Rafael respects traditions. Aarav respects traditions. Rafael speaks well. Aarav embraces change.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Aarav is multilingual, or he is both culturally aware and an effective diplomat.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Aarav values inclusion and embraces change. From “Anyone who values inclusion or embraces change accepts diversity,” Aarav accepts diversity.
- From “If someone accepts diversity, then they are open-minded,” Aarav is open-minded.
- From “If someone is open-minded, then they are culturally aware and respect traditions,” Aarav is culturally aware.
- The statement requires: multilingual OR (culturally aware AND effective diplomat). We have culturally aware, but “Aarav has intuition or is an effective diplomat” does not guarantee he is an effective diplomat, so the conjunction may be false. We have no information about multilingual.
- Therefore, the disjunction cannot be determined as always true or false from the given facts.
