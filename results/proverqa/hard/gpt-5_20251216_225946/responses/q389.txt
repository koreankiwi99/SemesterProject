Question ID: 389
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Jemma does not empower families. If Jemma either drives social change or advocates for rights (but not both), then she makes a difference. Anyone who fosters connection either leads by example or drives social change (or both). If Jemma either designs neighborhoods or creates communities (but not both), then she fosters connection. Everyone who provides shelter either empowers families or builds homes (or both). If Jemma builds homes, then she either creates communities or inspires others, but not both. Jemma pursues innovation or drives social change. Jemma does not make a difference. Jemma does not support local initiatives. If Jemma works for a non-profit, then she either provides shelter or supports local initiatives (but not both). Jemma does not advocate for rights. Jemma does not lead by example. Jemma works for a non-profit. Jemma designs neighborhoods.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jemma inspires others.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From works for a non-profit and (provide shelter XOR support local initiatives), and given not support local initiatives, Jemma provides shelter.
- Providing shelter implies (empower families OR build homes). Given not empower families, she builds homes.
- Building homes implies (create communities XOR inspire others).
- From not make a difference and (drives social change XOR advocates for rights) -> make a difference, we get not(drives social change XOR advocates for rights). With not advocates for rights, this forces not drives social change.
- If create communities were false, then designs neighborhoods XOR create communities would be true, implying fosters connection, which would force (leads by example OR drives social change). Given not leads by example, that would force drives social change, contradicting not drives social change. Hence create communities must be true.
- Since (create communities XOR inspire others) is true and create communities is true, inspire others must be false.

ANSWER: B

Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
