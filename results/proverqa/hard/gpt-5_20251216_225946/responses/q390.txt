Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Thiago does not document humanitarian issues.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

1) From “Thiago either conducts in-depth research or analyzes statistical data, but not both” and “Thiago does not analyze statistical data,” conclude Thiago conducts in-depth research (DR true).

2) From “Thiago either tells human stories or conducts in-depth research, but not both,” and DR true, conclude Thiago does not tell human stories (HS false).

3) From “Thiago tells human stories or is a photojournalist,” and HS false, conclude Thiago is a photojournalist (PJ true).

4) From “If Thiago is a photojournalist, then he either exposes social injustice or captures real-life stories, but not both,” conclude exactly one of EX or CR is true.

5) From “Everyone who is either an investigative reporter or investigates crimes seeks the truth” and “Thiago does not seek the truth,” conclude Thiago is neither an investigative reporter nor investigates crimes.

6) From “For all humans, if a person documents humanitarian issues and captures real-life stories, then they raise global awareness” and “Thiago does not raise global awareness,” conclude not both “documents humanitarian issues” and “captures real-life stories” can be true: ¬(DH ∧ CR).

7) If CR is the true disjunct from step 4, then ¬DH follows. But if EX is the true disjunct, CR is false and we learn nothing about DH. Since we cannot determine whether CR or EX is true, we cannot determine whether DH is false.

Therefore, whether Thiago does not document humanitarian issues is uncertain.
