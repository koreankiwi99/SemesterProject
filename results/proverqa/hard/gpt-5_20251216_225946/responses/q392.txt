Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Anastasia either protects the environment or appreciates nature (or both).

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Anastasia meditates often” and “If Anastasia meditates often, then she has spiritual connections,” conclude she has spiritual connections. With “Anastasia is either an entomologist or has spiritual connections, but not both,” she is not an entomologist.
- From “Anastasia pursues scientific research” and “If Anastasia pursues scientific research, then she either advocates conservation or supports local communities (but not both),” together with “Anastasia supports local communities,” conclude she does not advocate conservation.
- From “Anastasia lives near water” and “If she lives near water, then she either documents habitats or studies wildlife (or both),” plus “Anastasia does not document habitats,” conclude she studies wildlife.
- From “If she studies wildlife, then she either educates others or advocates conservation (or both)” and we already have she does not advocate conservation, conclude she educates others.
- From “Anastasia either educates others or protects the environment, or both,” and we have she educates others, we cannot deduce she protects the environment.
- No premise mentions “appreciates nature,” so we cannot deduce that either.

Therefore, whether she protects the environment or appreciates nature remains undetermined.
