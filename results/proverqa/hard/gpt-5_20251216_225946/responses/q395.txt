  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Snookums thrives in groups, so she is social. 
- If social, then she either lives with others or has a lone habitat, but not both. Given she does not have a lone habitat, she lives with others.
- If a cat lives with others, then it either shares their affection or forms strong ties (or both). Snookums does not form strong ties, so she shares her affection (with others, not necessarily multiple).
- Snookums dominates a harem, and for her that implies either multiple partners or strong alliances, but not both. Given she forms strong alliances, she does not have multiple partners.
- The only rule mentioning diverse relationships is: if a cat is polyandrous, then it has multiple partners or diverse relationships (or both). We cannot deduce that Snookums is polyandrous: the rule that could lead there applies only to those who share affection with multiple others, and we do not know that Snookums does (we only know she shares affection, not that it’s with multiple others).
- Therefore, nothing in the premises forces diverse relationships to be true or false.

Conclusion: The truth of “Snookums does not have diverse relationships” cannot be determined from the given information.
