==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Kartier either donates to charity or participates in volunteer work, but not both” and “Kartier does not participate in volunteer work,” we get: Kartier donates to charity.
- Donation implies “Kartier is either generous or selfish, but not both.”
- Kartier takes calculated risks. From “If Kartier either takes calculated risks or faces challenges (but not both), then she exhibits resilience” and “Kartier does not exhibit resilience,” the antecedent XOR must be false, so faces challenges must be true.
- From “Kartier either faces challenges or has a positive impact, but not both,” faces challenges true implies positive impact false.
- If appreciated or good reputation then positive impact; given good reputation is false and positive impact is false, appreciated must be false.
- If puts others first and makes a difference then appreciated; since appreciated is false and Kartier puts others first, she must not make a difference.
- If generous or helps others then can make a difference. Kartier does not help others; and since she cannot make a difference, she cannot be generous. Thus generous is false.
- From donation implying XOR(generous, selfish), with generous false, we get selfish true.
- From “Kartier is either selfless or selfish, but not both,” selfish true implies selfless false.

Therefore, the statement “Kartier is selfless” is false.
