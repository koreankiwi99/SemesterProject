Question ID: 397
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Savannah builds client relationships or analyzes trends. Savannah either conveys insights or builds client relationships, but not both. If Aarav either explains data or conveys insights (but not both), then she can communicate complex ideas. Savannah solves problems or earns recognition. Savannah either understands the market or can communicate complex ideas, but not both. Gatlin either improves process efficiency or develops innovative strategies, but not both. Savannah either improves process efficiency or develops innovative strategies, but not both. Savannah has expertise in her field. If Savannah analyzes trends, then she will spot opportunities. Savannah interprets results or conveys insights. If Savannah has expertise in her field, then she either develops innovative strategies or earns recognition (but not both). Anyone who thinks outside the box or solves complex problems can develop innovative strategies. If someone teaches others, then they can communicate complex ideas. Savannah improves process efficiency. If someone has a strong network, then they build client relationships and make informed decisions. If Aarav analyzes trends, then she will spot opportunities. If Delilah is a leading economist, then she makes accurate predictions and earns recognition. Delilah either conveys insights or builds client relationships, but not both. If Savannah either explains data or conveys insights (but not both), then she can communicate complex ideas. Savannah does not spot opportunities. If Gatlin has expertise in her field, then she either develops innovative strategies or earns recognition (but not both). Savannah explains data. Aarav does not spot opportunities. If someone is a leading economist, then they understand the market.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Savannah does not make accurate predictions.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Savannah improves process efficiency; by the XOR with developing innovative strategies, she does not develop innovative strategies.
- Savannah has expertise; by the XOR rule tied to expertise, she must earn recognition (since she does not develop innovative strategies).
- Savannah does not spot opportunities; by contrapositive of “if analyzes trends then spot opportunities,” she does not analyze trends.
- From “builds client relationships or analyzes trends,” she builds client relationships.
- By the XOR “conveys insights or builds client relationships,” she does not convey insights.
- From “interprets results or conveys insights,” she interprets results.
- Savannah explains data, and she does not convey insights; this satisfies the XOR antecedent for the rule that then gives her the ability to communicate complex ideas.
- By the XOR “understands the market or can communicate complex ideas,” since she can communicate complex ideas, she does not understand the market.
- From “if someone is a leading economist then they understand the market,” contrapositive yields that Savannah is not a leading economist.

The only rules about making accurate predictions concern Delilah (if Delilah is a leading economist then she makes accurate predictions). There is no general rule linking Savannah’s properties to making accurate predictions, nor that only leading economists make accurate predictions. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Savannah makes accurate predictions.

ANSWER: C

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
