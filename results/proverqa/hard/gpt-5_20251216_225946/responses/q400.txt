==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Zelda roams freely, and she either roams freely or lives in stables, but not both. Therefore, Zelda does not live in stables.

2) If Zelda either lives in stables or forms a herd (but not both), then she thrives in company. Zelda does not thrive in company, so it is not the case that exactly one of “lives in stables” or “forms a herd” holds. Since she does not live in stables, she also does not form a herd.

3) Zelda does not have companions, and every horse is either solitary or has companions. Hence, Zelda is solitary. Given that for Zelda, “social” or “solitary” but not both, she is not social.

4) If Zelda either forms a herd or forms a strong bond with humans (but not both), then she is social. Since she is not social, it is not the case that exactly one of “forms a herd” or “forms a strong bond” holds. We already have that she does not form a herd, so she also does not form a strong bond with humans.

5) If Zelda either has a gentle nature or an aggressive nature (but not both), then she forms a strong bond with humans. She does not form a strong bond; therefore, it is not the case that exactly one of “gentle” or “aggressive” holds. Given that Zelda has an aggressive nature, it follows she also has a gentle nature.

Conclusion: Zelda does have a gentle nature, so the statement “Zelda does not have a gentle nature” is false.
