Question ID: 403
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Every vulture either consumes remains or eats carrion (or both). If Peyton thrives alone, then she has a strong stomach and is adaptable. All vultures that track carrion have a keen sense of smell. If Peyton flies high, then she either dives steeply or soars effortlessly, but not both. Jonathan either soars effortlessly or tracks carrion, but not both at the same time. Franco dives steeply. Peyton either hunts preys or eats carrion. Peyton either soars effortlessly or tracks carrion, but not both at the same time. Peyton flies high. If Jonathan flies high, then she either dives steeply or soars effortlessly, but not both. All vultures that eat carrion have strong stomachs. Every vulture either scans the open plains or consumes remains, but not necessarily both. Peyton scans the open plains. Peyton dives steeply. Jonathan scans the open plains. If Franco has either a strong stomach or a keen sense of smell (but not both), then she is an effective scavenger. Every vulture either rides the wind or soars effortlessly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Peyton is an effective scavenger.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Peyton flies high” and “If Peyton flies high, then she either dives steeply or soars effortlessly, but not both,” plus “Peyton dives steeply,” we infer Peyton does not soar effortlessly.
- From “Peyton either soars effortlessly or tracks carrion, but not both,” and since she does not soar effortlessly, Peyton tracks carrion.
- No rule links Peyton’s properties (tracking carrion, diving steeply, etc.) to being an effective scavenger. The only statement about being an effective scavenger is specific to Franco: “If Franco has either a strong stomach or a keen sense of smell (but not both), then she is an effective scavenger.”

Therefore, whether Peyton is an effective scavenger cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: C

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
