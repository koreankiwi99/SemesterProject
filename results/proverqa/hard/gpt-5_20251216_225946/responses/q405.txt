==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

1) River gets distracted, and if he gets distracted then he either has a vivid imagination or finds new interests. Given River does not find new interests, he must have a vivid imagination.

2) If River has a vivid imagination, then he excels in either art or music, but not both. So exactly one of {art, music} is true.

3) River is creative, and if creative, then he either writes well or excels in art, but not both. So exactly one of {writes well, excels in art} is true.

4) River does not plan ahead, and he either acts spontaneously or plans ahead, but not both. Therefore he acts spontaneously.

5) River is reflective, and if reflective, then he is either a critical thinker or a spontaneous actor, but not both. Since he is spontaneous, he is not a critical thinker.

6) River either speaks fluently or thinks critically, but not both. Since he is not a critical thinker, he speaks fluently.

7) Writing well AND speaking fluently implies expressing oneself effectively. River cannot express himself effectively, so it is not the case that he both writes well and speaks fluently. Since he speaks fluently, he therefore does not write well.

8) From step 3 (exactly one of writes well, excels in art) and not writing well, it follows that River excels in art.

9) From step 2 (exactly one of excels in art, excels in music) and excels in art, it follows that River does not excel in music.

Conclusion: The statement “River excels in music” is false.
