Question ID: 406
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Alana explores new places. Anyone who is spontaneous and trusts their intuition can learn to embrace uncertainty. If Alana explores new places, then she will take calculated risks. Alana makes her own decisions. Anyone who values independence and embraces uncertainty is free-spirited. If Alana has a creative nature, then she is either guided by reason or trusts her intuition (but not both). Alana is not guided by reason. Alana has a creative nature. Alana appreciates simple things. If someone makes their own decisions and takes calculated risks, then they value independence. If someone has an open mind and tolerates ambiguity, then they can embrace uncertainty. Alana is spontaneous. For all humans, if someone is free-spirited, then they either love adventure or pursue creative passions (or both). Alana either pursues creative passions or appreciates simple things, but these two traits do not necessarily overlap in her life.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Alana loves adventure.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If Alana has a creative nature, then she is either guided by reason or trusts her intuition (but not both),” plus “Alana is not guided by reason” and “Alana has a creative nature,” we infer Alana trusts her intuition.
- From “Alana is spontaneous” and “Anyone who is spontaneous and trusts their intuition can learn to embrace uncertainty,” we get that she can learn to embrace uncertainty (this is weaker than actually embracing uncertainty).
- From “Alana explores new places” and “If Alana explores new places, then she will take calculated risks,” we get she takes calculated risks. With “Alana makes her own decisions” and “If someone makes their own decisions and takes calculated risks, then they value independence,” we infer she values independence.
- To conclude she is free-spirited, we need both values independence and embraces uncertainty. We only have that she can learn to embrace uncertainty, not that she actually embraces it; thus we cannot conclude she is free-spirited.
- Even if she were free-spirited, the rule only yields “loves adventure or pursues creative passions (or both).” We have no basis to exclude the possibility that she does not love adventure (e.g., she could only pursue creative passions). The extra statement about her either pursuing creative passions or appreciating simple things is satisfied by her appreciating simple things and does not establish that she loves adventure.

Therefore, whether Alana loves adventure cannot be determined.
