Question ID: 407

Zane performs publicly. Zane either has stage fright or is entertaining, but not both. Zane either works hard or is talented. If Zane is charismatic, then he is either funny or entertaining, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Zane does not build a loyal following.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Zane is not comfortable on stage, and he performs publicly. From “If performs publicly, then stage fright or comfortable (or both),” we get stage fright true.
- From “stage fright or entertaining, but not both,” stage fright true implies entertaining false.
- Zane is charismatic. From “If charismatic, then funny or entertaining, but not both,” and entertaining false, we get funny true.
- From “If funny, then either gain popularity or build a loyal following, but not both,” we get exactly one of popularity or loyal following is true.
- “If talented, then popularity.” But from “works hard or talented,” we only know at least one is true; we cannot conclude talented is true.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether popularity (and thus not loyal following) holds, because funny only forces exactly one of the two without specifying which, and talent is not entailed.

Conclusion: It is not determined whether Zane builds a loyal following.
