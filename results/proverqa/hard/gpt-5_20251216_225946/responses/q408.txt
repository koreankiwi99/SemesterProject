==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- If Jaxton values science, then he must either love learning or value critical thinking, but not both.
- We are told Jaxton does not love learning and does not value critical thinking. Therefore, the “either-but-not-both” condition cannot be satisfied, so Jaxton does not value science (by contrapositive).
- We are told Jaxton is either passionate about astronomy or values science. Since he does not value science, he must be passionate about astronomy.
- If Jaxton is passionate about astronomy, then he makes groundbreaking discoveries (and inspires others).

Therefore, Jaxton does make groundbreaking discoveries, making the statement “Jaxton does not make groundbreaking discoveries” false.

ANSWER: B
