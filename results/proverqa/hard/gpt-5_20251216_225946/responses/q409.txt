==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From ¬O and (O xor L) -> T, the antecedent reduces to L -> T. Given ¬T, we get ¬L.
- From (M xor I) -> L and ¬L, we get ¬(M xor I). With ¬M, this yields ¬I.
- From (CO ∧ E) -> I, with E and ¬I, we get ¬CO.
- From (F ∨ R) -> CO and ¬CO, we get ¬F and ¬R.
- From C ∨ R and ¬R, we get C.
- From S -> B and ¬B, we get ¬S.
- None of the premises mention or imply anything about being a world-class opera singer (W). Therefore W’s truth value is undetermined.

ANSWER: C
