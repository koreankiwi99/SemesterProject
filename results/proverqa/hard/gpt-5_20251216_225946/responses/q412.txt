Question ID: 412
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Everly is not disciplined. All horses that do cross-country either have good agility or are athletic (or both). If Everly has good coordination, then he has muscle and obeys commands. Everly listens to his rider. Everly does not perform well. Everly has good endurance. Everly competes in events. If Everly has good endurance, then he either excels in show jumping or performs dressage (but not both). If Ramona either has good reflexes or competes in events (but not both), then he has good coordination. If Everly has good breeding and an intelligent nature, then he excels in show jumping. Ramona listens to his rider. Everly either has a quick reaction or has good reflexes (or both). If Everly either has good reflexes or competes in events (but not both), then he has good coordination. If Everly either listens to his rider or obeys commands (but not both), then he is disciplined. If Everly has a good temperament, then he either responds to commands or performs dressage (or both). If Everly either clears fences or gallops long distances (but not both), then he does cross-country. Everly is not athletic. Everly does not have good agility. For all horses, if they have good balance and respond to cues, then they obey commands. Everly does not have muscle. Any horse that is strong or has good stamina performs well. If Everly has good reflexes, then he either does cross-country or performs dressage (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Everly is well-trained.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Everly listens to his rider (given).
- If (listens XOR obeys) then disciplined; Everly is not disciplined. Since he listens, XOR must be false, so he must also obey commands.
- If Everly had good coordination, then he would have muscle and obey commands. Given he does not have muscle, by contrapositive he does not have good coordination.
- Everly is not athletic and does not have good agility. From “if cross-country then (agility or athletic),” by contrapositive Everly does not do cross-country.
- If (good reflexes XOR competes in events) then good coordination. He competes in events, and we have not coordination, so XOR must be false; therefore he has good reflexes.
- From good reflexes implying (cross-country or dressage) and not cross-country, conclude he performs dressage.
- From “(strong or good stamina) -> performs well” and “does not perform well,” conclude he is neither strong nor has good stamina.

None of the premises define “well-trained” or link it directly to properties we’ve derived (listening, obeying commands, discipline, dressage, etc.). Therefore, whether Everly is “well-trained” cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: C

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
