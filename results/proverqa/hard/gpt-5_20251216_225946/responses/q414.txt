==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Melissa reacts emotionally (E) and does not act impulsively (¬I). So E XOR I is true, implying she is easily excited (EE).
- Anyone who has many hobbies or is easily excited can get side-tracked. Since EE, Melissa gets side-tracked (ST).
- Melissa does not overthink details (¬OT). Thus OT XOR ST is true, implying she is distracted (D).
- Melissa is not focused (¬F). So F XOR D is true, which implies she is creative (C).

ANSWER: A
