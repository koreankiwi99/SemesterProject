Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Tristan is reserved and does not prefer solo work. Since "reserved or prefers solo work (but not both) -> avoids confrontation," Tristan avoids confrontation.
- Tristan does not value privacy. Since "avoids confrontation or values privacy (but not both) -> introspective," Tristan is introspective.
- "Introspective or good listening (not necessarily both)" is satisfied by introspective, so we cannot infer good listening.
- "Good listening or persuasive" leaves persuasive uncertain; he may or may not be persuasive. Nothing is given about being charismatic.
- The only route to being a successful lawyer is: "builds trust XOR wins cases -> successful." There is no link provided from being charismatic or persuasive to building trust or winning cases.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude that if Tristan is charismatic or persuasive, then he is a successful lawyer.
