Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Alaina Thompson does not improve patients' lives.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- She funds research (F) and does not develop new treatments (¬D). Since F XOR D holds, she combats serious diseases (C).
- From C -> (advocates A or recognition R) and given she does not gain recognition (¬R), she must advocate for patients’ rights (A).
- A ↔ ¬P, so she does not pioneer a medical breakthrough (¬P).
- She received a noble award (N), and N -> (K XOR P). With ¬P, it follows she is dedicated to cancer research (K).
- K -> (G XOR I): either she makes groundbreaking discoveries (G) or improves patients’ lives (I), but not both.
- Also, (contributes Contrib or G) and ¬Contrib implies G is true.
- With G true and G XOR I, we conclude I is false (she does not improve patients’ lives).

ANSWER: A

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
