Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kahlani prefers mass-produced beer.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Kahlani knows good taste,” she values quality (VQ) and supports local business.
- From “Kahlani runs a brewpub” and “Kahlani does not foster community,” and the rule that all who run a brewpub seek innovation or foster community, she must seek innovation (SI).
- We have the XOR: enjoys craft beer (E) or prefers mass-produced beer (M), but not both.
- If VQ and appreciates uniqueness (AU), then E. Since VQ is true, the contrapositive gives: if not E, then not AU.
- AU is not otherwise forced: RT would imply AU, but we only know “honors culture or respects tradition” (HC ∨ RT), and ED is true; nothing forces RT to be true. No other rule guarantees AU.
- Therefore:
  - If M is true (so E is false), then AU must be false; this is consistent (take HC true, RT false).
  - If E is true, that’s also consistent (AU may hold if RT holds, but RT is not required).

Conclusion: Whether Kahlani prefers mass-produced beer cannot be determined.
