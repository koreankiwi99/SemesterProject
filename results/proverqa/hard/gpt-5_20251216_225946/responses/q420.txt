Difficulty: hard

Context:
Hunter uses bait or knows ictiobus. Hunter is not skilled. If Hunter can read the water, then he is either skilled or experienced, but not both. Hunter does not understand currents. If Hunter knows ictiobus, then he either reads the water or understands currents, but not both. Hunter either catches fish or is successful. Hunter travels rivers or knows ictiobus. Hunter knows the river. Every fisherman is either successful or unsuccessful, but not both. If Hunter is patient, then he is either adventurous or can read the water, but not both. Hunter does not use bait. If Hunter knows the river, then he either has experience or catches fish, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Hunter is an unsuccessful fisherman.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Hunter uses bait or knows ictiobus” and “Hunter does not use bait,” conclude Hunter knows ictiobus.
- Knowing ictiobus and “If he knows ictiobus, then he either reads the water or understands currents, but not both,” together with “Hunter does not understand currents,” implies Hunter reads the water.
- Reading the water and “If he can read the water, then he is either skilled or experienced, but not both,” with “Hunter is not skilled,” implies Hunter is experienced.
- “Hunter knows the river” and “If he knows the river, then he either has experience or catches fish, but not both” with experienced true implies he does not catch fish.
- “Hunter either catches fish or is successful” and not catching fish implies Hunter is successful.

Now, if Hunter is a fisherman, then by “Every fisherman is either successful or unsuccessful, but not both,” being successful means he is not unsuccessful. If he is not a fisherman, then the statement “unsuccessful fisherman” is false anyway.

Therefore, in all cases, “Hunter is an unsuccessful fisherman” is false.
