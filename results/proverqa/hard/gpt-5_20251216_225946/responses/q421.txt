==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Matias avoids blame and “admits fault or avoids blame, but not both” ⇒ Matias does not admit fault.
- Matias makes mistakes and “if he makes mistakes then admits fault or takes responsibility, but not both” ⇒ since he doesn’t admit fault, he takes responsibility.
- “If Matias takes responsibility, then he either has integrity or is accountable, but not both” and Matias is accountable ⇒ Matias does not have integrity.
- “If Matias either respects others or prioritizes self-interest, then he has integrity” and Matias does not respect others ⇒ to avoid integrity, Matias must not prioritize self-interest.
- “Matias either keeps promises or prioritizes self-interest, but not both” ⇒ since he does not prioritize self-interest, he keeps his promises.
- “If Matias keeps his promises, then he either builds a strong reputation or earns the respect of others, but not both” ⇒ gives reputation/respect, no mention of trust.
- Matias values his privacy; “If he seeks recognition or values privacy (but not both), then confident” and Matias is not confident ⇒ he both values privacy and seeks public recognition.
- The only rule relating trust is about Seven, not Matias. No given rule links Matias’s properties to gaining (or not gaining) trust.

Conclusion: There is insufficient information to determine whether Matias gains others’ trust.
