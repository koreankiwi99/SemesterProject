Question ID: 422
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Samantha encounters failure. Samantha is dedicated. Anyone who excels in their craft will build a reputation. If Samantha either sets goals or tracks progress (but not both), then she puts in persistent effort. If Samantha works hard, then she either gets mentorship or acquires expertise (or both) in her field. If Samantha is dedicated, then she is self-taught and learns quickly. Samantha excels in her craft. If Samantha faces challenges, then she develops resilience and puts in persistent effort. If Samantha encounters failure, then she either stays motivated or becomes discouraged (but not both). If Samantha is self-taught, then she can either gain recognition for her skills or acquire expertise in her field, but not both. Samantha faces challenges. If Samantha puts in persistent effort, then she can either acquire expertise in her field or build a reputation for her skills, but not both. Samantha finds solutions or develops resilience. Samantha becomes discouraged.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Samantha does not gain recognition for her skills.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Samantha is dedicated, so she is self-taught (ST) and learns quickly.
- Samantha faces challenges, so she puts in persistent effort (PE).
- Samantha excels in her craft, so she builds a reputation (R).
- From PE, exactly one of expertise (X) or reputation (R) holds. Since R is true, X must be false.
- From ST, exactly one of recognition (GR) or expertise (X) holds. Since X is false, GR must be true.

Thus, Samantha does gain recognition for her skills. The statement “Samantha does not gain recognition for her skills” is false.
