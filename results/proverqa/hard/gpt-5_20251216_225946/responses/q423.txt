Question ID: 423
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Anyone who has curiosity and seeks experience can decide to study abroad. Everyone who values education either seeks experience or explores opportunities. If Aileen studies abroad, then she will love foreign languages. Aileen does not explore opportunities. Aileen either loves foreign languages or appreciates Argentine culture, but not necessarily both. For Aileen, either she stays in her home country or she has curiosity, but not both. Aileen values education. Anyone who has a passport or gets a scholarship can study abroad. Aileen does not stay in her home country. Aileen either appreciates Argentine culture or enjoys dancing (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Aileen does not enjoy dancing.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “either she stays in her home country or she has curiosity, but not both” and “Aileen does not stay in her home country,” we deduce Aileen has curiosity.
- From “Aileen values education” and “everyone who values education either seeks experience or explores opportunities,” together with “Aileen does not explore opportunities,” we deduce Aileen seeks experience.
- Thus Aileen has curiosity and seeks experience, so she can decide to study abroad. This does not imply she actually studies abroad, so we cannot infer she loves foreign languages from that conditional.
- We are given: (i) Aileen loves foreign languages or appreciates Argentine culture (or both), and (ii) Aileen appreciates Argentine culture or enjoys dancing (or both).
- Nothing forces “appreciates Argentine culture” to be false, and nothing forces “enjoys dancing” to be true or false. Both possibilities (enjoys dancing or not) are consistent with the premises.

Therefore, whether Aileen enjoys dancing cannot be determined.
