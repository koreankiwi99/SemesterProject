==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Jase holds authority, and the rule says: if he holds authority, then he prioritizes his own safety or puts others first (but not both). Also, Jase pursues personal gain, and the rule says he either pursues personal gain or puts others first (but not both). Therefore, Jase does not put others first, so by the authority rule he prioritizes his own safety.
- Jase supports others and does not make tough calls. The rule says: if he either makes tough calls or supports others (but not both), then he is in a leadership position. Since exactly one is true, Jase is in a leadership position.
- If Jase is in a leadership position, then he either acts selflessly or prioritizes his own safety (but not both). We already have that he prioritizes his own safety, so he does not act selflessly.
- Jase faces danger, and the rule says: if he faces danger, then he acts selflessly or avoids risks (or both). Since he does not act selflessly, he must avoid risks.
- Jase either avoids risks or is courageous (but not both). Since he avoids risks, he is not courageous.
- Jase is either courageous or cowardly (but not both). Since he is not courageous, he is cowardly.
