Question ID: 426
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Raya formed in ancient times, then she holds historical value. Raya does not have vibrant colors. Every mineral is either found underground or valued by geologists. If Raya forms by pressure, then she has vibrant colors or occurs in layers (or both). If Raya either formed deeply or contains ancient secrets (but not both), then she holds historical value. Raya either holds historical value or has aesthetic appeal, but not both. If Raya either forms slowly or is created under heat (but not both), then she contains ancient secrets. Raya does not remain hidden. Any mineral found underground remains hidden until discovered. Raya either forms by pressure or has aesthetic appeal. Raya did not form deeply. Any mineral that occurs in caves or exists in igneous rocks is formed naturally. Raya does not occur in layers. Every mineral that is valued by geologists either formed naturally or contains ancient secrets. Raya forms under pressure if she is a metamorphic mineral.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Raya is rare, then she has unique properties and leads to groundbreaking discoveries.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Raya does not have vibrant colors and does not occur in layers. If she formed by pressure, she would have vibrant colors or occur in layers; therefore she did not form by pressure. Hence, by the “pressure or aesthetic appeal” disjunction, she has aesthetic appeal. By the XOR with historical value, she therefore does not hold historical value.
- Raya does not remain hidden. Any mineral found underground remains hidden; thus she is not found underground. Since every mineral is either found underground or valued by geologists, she is valued by geologists. Valued minerals either formed naturally or contain ancient secrets. From “not formed deeply” and the rule “XOR(deeply, secrets) implies historical value,” together with “not historical,” we get NOT XOR(deeply, secrets); given “not deeply,” this yields “no ancient secrets.” Therefore, from valued ⇒ (natural or secrets), she formed naturally.
- From “XOR(slowly, heat) implies secrets” and “no secrets,” we get NOT XOR(slowly, heat) (both true or both false). Also, since pressure is false, she is not metamorphic (metamorphic ⇒ pressure).

None of the premises mention or constrain being rare, having unique properties, or leading to groundbreaking discoveries. Thus the statement “If Raya is rare, then she has unique properties and leads to groundbreaking discoveries” is neither entailed nor contradicted by the given information.
