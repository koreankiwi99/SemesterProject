Aiden either follows tradition or values originality, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Aiden creates visually stunning creations.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Aiden has confident body language and connects with others. By the rule, he is naturally charismatic.
- Aiden produces understated pieces. Given the exclusive-or between “emotionally resonant work” and “understated pieces,” Aiden does not produce emotionally resonant work.
- If Aiden were both naturally charismatic and had creative vision, then he would be an inspiring artist. We have no information that Aiden has creative vision, so we cannot conclude he is inspiring.
- Only inspiring artists are guaranteed to produce emotionally resonant work or visually stunning creations. Since we cannot establish that Aiden is inspiring—and we have no rule linking “understated pieces” to “not visually stunning”—we cannot determine whether he creates visually stunning creations.

ANSWER: C

Correct: No
