==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Raul publishes academic works. From “If Raul publishes academic works, then he is either scholarly or teaches at a university (or both)” and “Raul does not teach at a university,” it follows that Raul is scholarly.
- From “If Raul is scholarly, then he can either make groundbreaking discoveries or become a leading authority, but not both,” we get: exactly one of {discoveries, leading authority} holds for Raul.
- To force “makes groundbreaking discoveries,” we would need Raul to be a meticulous researcher together with “Raul does not gain academic recognition,” because “Every meticulous researcher either gains academic recognition or makes groundbreaking discoveries (or both).” However, we cannot establish that Raul is meticulous: “If Raul is passionate about history, then … meticulous” and “If Raul has a curious mind, then … meticulous” have antecedents we cannot prove. Translating ancient texts alone does not imply passion or meticulousness, and the given disjunctions about enjoying reading/passion don’t let us conclude passion.
- No rule links “leading authority” to any other known fact (e.g., academic recognition), so we cannot determine whether the exclusive choice resolves to “leading authority” or “discoveries.”

Conclusion: It cannot be determined whether Raul becomes a leading authority.
