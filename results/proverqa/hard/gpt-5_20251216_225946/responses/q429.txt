Question ID: 429
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Koda is valuable for research because it has a distinct pattern. If Koda either prefers shaded areas or tolerates fertilizers (but not both), then it thrives in a greenhouse. For all orchids, if an orchid has star shaped blooms and grows in tropical climates, then it has a distinct pattern. Koda does not require high humidity. If Koda either requires high humidity or needs filtered light (but not both), then it thrives in a greenhouse. Koda either produces small buds or has unique colors. Koda requires warm temperatures. Koda does not produce small flowers. If Samir either requires high humidity or needs filtered light (but not both), then it thrives in a greenhouse. Any orchid that has a thin stem or requires specialized care is delicate. If Koda is an endangered orchid, then it has either a distinct pattern or large blooms, but not both. Koda is an endangered orchid. Samir is valuable for research because it has a distinct pattern. If Arianna either needs filtered light or requires warm temperatures (but not both), then it will blossom frequently. If Marigold is an endangered orchid, then it has either a distinct pattern or large blooms, but not both. Arianna is not low maintenance. Marigold is an endangered orchid. Samir does not produce small flowers. Koda is not low maintenance. Arianna is either an orchid that thrives in a greenhouse or has unique colors, but not both. Koda is either delicate or has unique colors, but not both. Koda is either an orchid that thrives in a greenhouse or has unique colors, but not both. Koda does not have large blooms. If Koda either needs filtered light or requires warm temperatures (but not both), then it will blossom frequently. Samir does not have large blooms. Arianna requires warm temperatures. If Koda either blossoms frequently or produces small flowers (but not both), then it is low maintenance.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Koda is rare.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- Koda is an endangered orchid, and if endangered, it has either a distinct pattern or large blooms, but not both. Koda does not have large blooms, so Koda has a distinct pattern.
- Koda is not low maintenance. If Koda either blossoms frequently or produces small flowers (but not both), then it is low maintenance. Koda does not produce small flowers, so to avoid being low maintenance, Koda must not blossom frequently.
- Koda requires warm temperatures. If Koda either needs filtered light or requires warm temperatures (but not both), then it blossoms frequently. Since it does not blossom frequently and requires warm temperatures, it must also need filtered light (so the XOR condition is false).
- If Koda either requires high humidity or needs filtered light (but not both), then it thrives in a greenhouse. Koda does not require high humidity and does need filtered light, so it thrives in a greenhouse.
- From “thrives in a greenhouse or has unique colors, but not both,” Koda has unique colors false. From “delicate or has unique colors, but not both,” Koda is delicate. From “either produces small buds or has unique colors,” with unique colors false, Koda produces small buds.

None of the given statements define or relate “rare” to any other property (including being endangered). Therefore, whether Koda is rare cannot be determined from the information provided.

ANSWER: C
