Question ID: 430
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Dennis does not seek unique results. Dennis respects heritage. Dennis pursues mastery. Ada has a strong work ethic. Dennis is passionate about printing. Ada does not seek unique results. Collins invests time and effort. If Dennis is passionate about printing, then he respects heritage and uses traditional techniques. For everyone who mixes inks and uses custom recipes, they can craft ink by hand. Dennis has a strong work ethic. Dennis has high standards. Dennis invests time and effort. If Collins has high standards, then he either pursues mastery or enjoys precision work, but not both. If Ada is passionate about printing, then he respects heritage and uses traditional techniques. For all humans, if they use traditional techniques and pay attention to details, then they produce high-quality work. Everyone who crafts ink by hand either values perfection or pays attention to details (or both). If someone values perfection, then they seek unique results and invest time and effort. If Pablo has a strong work ethic, then he either crafts ink by hand or enjoys precision work, but not both. If Dennis has a strong work ethic, then he either crafts ink by hand or enjoys precision work, but not both. If Dennis has high standards, then he either pursues mastery or enjoys precision work, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dennis produces high-quality work.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Dennis is passionate about printing, so he uses traditional techniques (UTT_D).
2) Dennis has high standards and pursues mastery. From HS_D -> XOR(PM_D, EPW_D), since PM_D is true, EPW_D is false.
3) From SWE_D -> XOR(CIH_D, EPW_D) and EPW_D is false, we get CIH_D is true.
4) From CIH_D -> (VP_D or PAD_D). Also, since Dennis does not seek unique results and VP -> seek unique results, by contraposition Dennis does not value perfection (¬VP_D). Hence PAD_D is true.
5) Using UTT_D and PAD_D, the rule (UTT ∧ PAD -> produces high-quality work) yields that Dennis produces high-quality work.

ANSWER: A

Ground Truth: A
Prediction: A
Correct: Yes
