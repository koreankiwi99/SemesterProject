Question ID: 432
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Elsie is a misinformation spreader. If someone is a reliable informer, then they are trustworthy. Elsie fact-checks her posts. Elsie is responsible if she cites references. If someone shares the truth and respects others' opinions, then they are trustworthy. Elsie either engages her audience or creates quality content. If someone values accuracy, then they create quality content. If Elsie verifies facts or is trustworthy, then she is respected online. Elsie does not have moral integrity. If Elsie is either a credible source or a misinformation spreader (but not both), then she is a reliable informer. If Elsie creates quality content and is respected online, then she has moral integrity. Elsie is not responsible. If someone either fact-checks their posts or cites references (but not both), then they value accuracy.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Elsie is not a credible source.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If Elsie cites references then she is responsible” and “Elsie is not responsible,” infer Elsie does not cite references.
- Given Elsie fact-checks her posts and does not cite references, the exclusive-or condition holds, so she values accuracy; hence she creates quality content.
- With quality content and “If QC and respected online then moral integrity,” and given she does not have moral integrity, conclude she is not respected online.
- From “If she verifies facts or is trustworthy then she is respected online,” and not respected online, infer she is neither trustworthy nor verifies facts.
- From “If reliable informer then trustworthy,” and not trustworthy, infer she is not a reliable informer.
- Given Elsie is a misinformation spreader, the statement “If (credible source XOR misinformation spreader) then reliable informer” simplifies to “If not credible source then reliable informer.” Its contrapositive with not reliable informer yields: Elsie is a credible source.

Therefore, “Elsie is not a credible source” is false.
