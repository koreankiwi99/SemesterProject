Question ID: 433
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Shiloh pursues her personal goals. Shiloh does not have good intentions. Anyone who works hard or learns quickly can gain experience. If someone makes a difference and inspires others, then they can improve their community. Shiloh inspires others. Shiloh either pursues her personal goals or enhances the lives of others, but these two pursuits can be mutually exclusive. Anyone who has experience or is educated can make a difference. Everyone has skills or makes a difference. Anyone who volunteers regularly or improves their community can enhance the lives of others. Everyone either has good intentions or gains knowledge, but these two are not necessarily related. If Shiloh either reads books or attends seminars (but not both), then she gains knowledge. Shiloh is selfless or educated (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Shiloh is selfless.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- We know: Shiloh pursues her personal goals; she does not have good intentions; she inspires others.
- From “Everyone either has good intentions or gains knowledge,” and since Shiloh does not have good intentions, she gains knowledge. This does not imply she is educated.
- The key statement is “Shiloh is selfless or educated (or both).” This guarantees at least one of {selfless, educated} is true, but does not specify which.
- No other given rule links selflessness to any established fact (pursuing personal goals, inspiring others, knowledge, etc.), nor do we have any rule that rules out her being educated.
- Therefore, Shiloh could be educated and not selfless, or selfless (with or without being educated). We cannot determine selflessness definitively.

ANSWER: C

Ground Truth: A
