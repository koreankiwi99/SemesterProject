Question ID: 434
Difficulty: hard

Context:
All dogs are either affectionate or care deeply (or both). If Archie either reads body language or senses emotions (but not both), then he offers support. Archie is intuitive. If a dog senses emotions and is protective, then it stays by its owner's side. Every dog that has empathy provides comfort. All loyal dogs are protective and love unconditionally. If Archie is intuitive, then he is either loyal or has empathy, but not both. Archie does not offer support. Archie either enjoys playtime or is affectionate, but not necessarily both. Archie does not stay by his owner's side. Archie reads body language. All dogs that have energy enjoy playtime. Archie has energy.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Archie does not provide comfort.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Archie reads body language. If exactly one of reading body language or sensing emotions were true, he would offer support. But he does not offer support. Therefore it is not exactly one; since he reads body language, he must also sense emotions.
- Archie is intuitive, which (by the given rule) means exactly one of loyal or having empathy is true.
- If Archie were loyal, then (as a loyal dog) he would be protective; and a dog that senses emotions and is protective stays by its owner’s side. But Archie does not stay by his owner’s side. Hence Archie is not loyal, so he must have empathy.
- Every dog that has empathy provides comfort. Therefore, Archie provides comfort.

Thus, the statement “Archie does not provide comfort” is false.

ANSWER: B
