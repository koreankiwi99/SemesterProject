Question ID: 435
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Jackson stands out, then he is either outgoing or has charisma, but not both. If Jackson has visible scars, then he either stands out or has a distinctive voice, but not both. Katie does not wear distinctive jewelry. Jackson does not wear distinctive jewelry. Jackson does not have bright hair. Jackson is not outgoing. For any person, if they have certain genes and were exposed to x-ray, then they may have unusual marks. Jackson does not have charisma. If Jackson is identifiable, then he has visible tattoos and wears distinctive jewelry. If Jackson often attends public events, then he either has visible tattoos or wears bold clothing (but not both). Jackson has distinct palmar patterns or a rare scar (or both). If someone either has bright hair or has unusual marks (but not both), then they stand out. If Jackson has unusual marks or a rare scar, then he can be easily identifiable.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jackson does not have unique fingerprints.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From: If Jackson stands out, then he is outgoing XOR has charisma. Given Jackson is not outgoing and does not have charisma, conclude Jackson does not stand out.
- From: If Jackson is identifiable, then he has visible tattoos and wears distinctive jewelry. Given he does not wear distinctive jewelry, conclude Jackson is not identifiable.
- We are told: Jackson has distinct palmar patterns or a rare scar (or both). Interpreting “unique fingerprints” as “distinct palmar patterns,” this means he might have unique fingerprints, or he might only have a rare scar; both are possible.
- No other statements force which disjunct holds, and “can be easily identifiable” from unusual marks or rare scar does not force actual identifiability.

Therefore, whether Jackson lacks unique fingerprints cannot be determined.
