Question ID: 436
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Bitsy is either athletic in build or has an agile front end, but not both to the same degree. Bitsy does not have a calm demeanor. Sasha has good breeding. Bitsy is a talented jumper. All horses with good reflexes have either fast reaction time or an agile front end (or both). Bitsy is not well-trained. Bitsy is either a horse with strong instincts or has a gentle nature. If Bitsy has powerful hind legs or an agile front end (or both), then she excels in competition. Bitsy is either an endurance runner or has a gentle nature, but not necessarily both. Bitsy is not responsive to commands. If Bitsy is keen on exercise, then she has strong cardio and is an endurance runner. If Bitsy has good breeding, then she either has powerful hind legs or is well-trained, but not both. Every horse that is an endurance runner either has an athletic build or is responsive to commands (or both). Bitsy has good breeding. If Bitsy is a talented jumper, then she is either a horse with strong instincts or has a calm demeanor (but not both). Sasha is either a horse with strong instincts or has a gentle nature. All horses that have regular exercise and a balanced diet have powerful hind legs. All horses with quick reflexes have good balance and an athletic build. Every horse that forms a strong bond with its rider either performs well under pressure or has a gentle nature (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Bitsy does not excel in competition.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Given: Bitsy has good breeding (GB).
- Rule: If Bitsy has good breeding, then she has either powerful hind legs or is well-trained, but not both (GB -> PH XOR WT).
- Given: Bitsy is not well-trained (¬WT). From PH XOR WT and ¬WT, we deduce PH is true.
- Rule: If Bitsy has powerful hind legs or an agile front end, then she excels in competition ((PH or AF) -> EXC). With PH true, EXC follows.

Conclusion: Bitsy does excel in competition, so the statement "Bitsy does not excel in competition" is false.

ANSWER: B

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
