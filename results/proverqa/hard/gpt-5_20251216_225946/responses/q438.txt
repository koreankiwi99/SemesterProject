Model Response:

- Mae faces criticism ⇒ Mae is nervous (and sensitive).
- Mae speaks in front of a crowd ⇒ exactly one of {confident, nervous}. Since she is nervous, she is not confident.
- Mae does not sing alone and must either perform in public or sing alone ⇒ Mae performs in public.
- Performing in public ⇒ exactly one of {stage fright, confident}. With confident false ⇒ Mae has stage fright.
- Mae has exactly one of {stage fright, charismatic} ⇒ with stage fright true, Mae is not charismatic.
- Mae is not ambitious, and exactly one of {ambitious, selfless} ⇒ Mae is selfless. Passionate and selfless are mutually exclusive ⇒ Mae is not passionate.
- If Mae is successful ⇒ she is hard-working and passionate. But Mae is not hard-working (given) and not passionate, so Mae is not successful.
- If Mae has exactly one of {charismatic, talented} ⇒ she is successful. Since she is not successful, she does not have exactly one of them. With charismatic false, this means talented is also false.
