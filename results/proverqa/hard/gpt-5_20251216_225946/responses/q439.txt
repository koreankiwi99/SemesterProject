Step-by-step reasoning:
- Spencer meets new people and tries new things, so he undergoes a life change.
- Given he undergoes a life change and does not find new purpose, he must experience tragedy.
- Since he experiences tragedy and overcomes challenges, he faces adversity.
- If Spencer faces adversity, then exactly one of inner peace or passion for art holds.
- Spencer remains optimistic and, by the exclusive-or between optimism and inner peace, he does not have inner peace.
