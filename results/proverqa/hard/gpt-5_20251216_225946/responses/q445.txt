Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Grant is not a brilliant artist.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From (thinks out of the box ∨ solves problems differently) → can generate innovative ideas and Grant cannot generate innovative ideas, we get: Grant does not think out of the box and does not solve problems differently.
- Given Grant follows intuition or thinks out of the box, and he does not think out of the box, he follows intuition.
- Grant is either thinks freely or acts spontaneously, but not both; and he acts spontaneously. Hence, he does not think freely.
- From Grant follows rules or thinks freely and he does not think freely, he follows rules.
- From (creates masterpieces ⊕ follows rules) and he follows rules, he does not create masterpieces.
- If someone observes details closely and has creativity, then they can create masterpieces. Grant has creativity but does not create masterpieces, so he does not observe details closely.
- Being a brilliant artist implies (observes details closely ∨ thinks out of the box). For Grant, both are false, so he cannot be a brilliant artist.

Therefore, the statement “Grant is not a brilliant artist” is true.
