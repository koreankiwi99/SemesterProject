Question ID: 446
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Everyone makes sacrifices or faces adversity. Nevaeh does not act with integrity. If someone perseveres under pressure, then they have resilience and remain disciplined. If Nevaeh demonstrates bravery, then she either follows her conscience or perseveres under pressure (but not both). If someone follows their conscience, then they will act with integrity. If Nevaeh faces adversity, then she displays compassion and acts selflessly. Nevaeh does not have resilience. Gael does not have resilience. All humans who have empathy display compassion and understand others. If Nevaeh either makes sacrifices or takes risks (but not both), then she demonstrates bravery. Nevaeh does not take risks. If Gael faces adversity, then she displays compassion and acts selflessly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Nevaeh does not show loyalty.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Nevaeh lacks resilience, and since persevering implies resilience, she does not persevere under pressure.
- If she were brave, she would have to either follow her conscience or persevere (XOR). Not persevering would force “follows conscience,” which implies integrity, contradicting “Nevaeh does not act with integrity.” So she is not brave.
- Since (makes sacrifices XOR takes risks) implies bravery and she is not brave, that XOR is false. Given she does not take risks, she also does not make sacrifices.
- Everyone either makes sacrifices or faces adversity; thus she faces adversity, so she displays compassion and acts selflessly.
- From not acting with integrity and “follows conscience → integrity,” she does not follow her conscience.

No statements link any of these traits to loyalty. Therefore, whether Nevaeh shows loyalty cannot be determined.

ANSWER: C
