- From "If Astrid is well-trained or shows bravery, then she will win battles" and "Astrid will not win battles," we infer: Astrid is not well-trained and not brave.
- From "If Astrid engages in battles, then she either shows bravery or is fearless (or both)," and since she is not brave, we conclude: Astrid is fearless.
