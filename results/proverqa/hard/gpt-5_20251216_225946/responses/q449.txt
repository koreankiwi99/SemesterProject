==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Kevin has a PhD” and “If Kevin has a PhD, then he either collects data alongside rivers or writes books (but not both)” and “Kevin writes books,” we infer Kevin does not collect data alongside rivers.
- Kevin conducts field research. Since he does not collect data alongside rivers, the condition “either conducts field research or collects data alongside rivers (but not both)” holds, so Kevin works outdoors.
- If Kevin works outdoors, then he either studies marine life or has scientific interests (or both).
- Kevin either pursues artistic passions or has scientific interests, but not both; and he pursues artistic passions. Therefore, he does not have scientific interests.
- Hence, from working outdoors implying (studies marine life or has scientific interests) and not having scientific interests, Kevin must study marine life.
- Anyone who studies marine life or loves birds cares about conservation. Since Kevin studies marine life, he cares about conservation.
