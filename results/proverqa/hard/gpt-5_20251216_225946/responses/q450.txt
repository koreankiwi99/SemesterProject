Question ID: 450
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Vance makes sound judgments. Vance is either a thrill seeker or values stability, but not both. If Vance is either impulsive or a thrill seeker (but not both), then he is a forward thinker. Anyone who plans ahead values stability. If Vance is spontaneous, then he is either adaptable or a forward thinker (but not both). Vance is not open to new experiences. Vance does not take risks. Everyone who makes sound judgments either plans ahead or thinks carefully (or both). Vance does not think carefully. If Vance is a forward thinker or open to new experiences, then he will take risks. If Vance is either impulsive or cautious (but not both), then he is innovative. If Vance travels widely or tries new things, then he is a thrill seeker. Vance is cautious.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Vance is innovative.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From makes sound judgments and “sound judgments -> plans ahead or thinks carefully,” and given Vance does not think carefully, we get: plans ahead.
- Plans ahead -> values stability. So values stability is true.
- Given “thrill seeker XOR values stability” and values stability true, thrill seeker is false.
- From “(forward thinker or open to new experiences) -> takes risks” and given Vance does not take risks, we conclude not forward thinker and not open to new experiences.
- From “(impulsive XOR thrill seeker) -> forward thinker” and thrill seeker is false, if impulsive were true then forward thinker would be true, contradicting not forward thinker. Hence impulsive is false.
- Given cautious is true and impulsive is false, (impulsive XOR cautious) is true.
- From “(impulsive XOR cautious) -> innovative,” it follows that Vance is innovative.
