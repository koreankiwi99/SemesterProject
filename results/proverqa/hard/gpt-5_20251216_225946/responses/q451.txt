Question ID: 451
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Lane values privacy. For anyone, valuing privacy and seeking fame are mutually exclusive. If Lane works hard, then he either gains recognition or is admired by his peers (or both). Lane is charismatic. Lane is dedicated. Lane does not achieve success. If Lane is humble, then he is either well-reputed or charismatic, but not both. If Lane is either dishonorable or has integrity, then he will have a good reputation. Lane either acts with honor or is dishonorable. For everyone, being humble and seeking fame are mutually exclusive. If Lane is admired by his peers, then he achieves success. Everyone who is dedicated is either respected or admired by their peers (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lane is loyal.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Lane values privacy, and valuing privacy and seeking fame are mutually exclusive, so Lane does not seek fame.
- If Lane is admired by his peers, then he achieves success. Given Lane does not achieve success, it follows Lane is not admired by his peers.
- Everyone who is dedicated is either respected or admired (or both). Since Lane is dedicated and not admired, Lane must be respected.
- Lane is charismatic. If Lane were humble, the rule says he is either well-reputed or charismatic, but not both; since he is charismatic, that would force not well-reputed. Separately, if Lane is dishonorable or has integrity, he has a good reputation. However, we cannot determine whether he is dishonorable, has integrity, humble, or well-reputed uniquely from the given information.
- Nothing in the premises mentions or entails anything about Lane being loyal, nor about disloyalty.

Conclusion: There is no logical basis to determine whether Lane is loyal.
