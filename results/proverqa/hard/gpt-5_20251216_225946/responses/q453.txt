Question ID: 453
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Puppy requires nurturing. Puppy does not produce nectar. If Puppy either produces nectar or emits fragrance (but not both), then it attracts pollinators. If Puppy sways gently, then it either has vibrant colors or forms a unique shape (or both). Puppy sways gently. Puppy blossoms slowly. Puppy emits fragrance. If Puppy is rarely found or blossoms slowly, then it has delicate petals. Any plant that blossoms in spring or is soft to touch has delicate petals. Puppy thrives in harsh conditions. If Puppy has vibrant colors, then it attracts pollinators and has deep roots. If Puppy requires nurturing, then it is rarely found and needs special care. If Puppy blooms seasonally, then it either grows in clusters or has vibrant colors (or both). Puppy grows in meadows. If Puppy grows in meadows, then it either forms a unique shape or has delicate petals, but not both. All plants with nectar attract pollinators. If Puppy has deep roots, then it either thrives in harsh conditions or is highly adaptable, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Puppy is highly adaptable.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Puppy requires nurturing, so it is rarely found and needs special care. Hence, rarely found is true.
- Puppy blossoms slowly. From “rarely found or blossoms slowly implies delicate petals,” Puppy has delicate petals.
- Puppy grows in meadows, and meadows imply unique shape XOR delicate petals. Since delicate petals is true, unique shape is false.
- Puppy sways gently, which implies vibrant colors or unique shape. With unique shape false, vibrant colors must be true.
- Vibrant colors imply attracts pollinators and deep roots. So deep roots is true.
- Puppy emits fragrance and does not produce nectar, making the XOR condition true; thus it attracts pollinators (consistent).
- Puppy thrives in harsh conditions (given).
- Deep roots imply thrives in harsh conditions XOR highly adaptable. Since thrives in harsh conditions is true, highly adaptable must be false.

Therefore, the statement “Puppy is highly adaptable” is false.
