==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Axel promotes justice” and “Axel values human rights,” and the rule “If they promote justice and value human rights, then they advocate for equality,” we get: Axel advocates for equality.
- From “Axel works in a factory” and “Axel lives in poverty,” and the rule “Anyone who works in a factory or lives in poverty can sympathize with workers,” we only get: Axel can sympathize with workers (ability), not that he actually sympathizes. So we cannot use the rule “Anyone who sympathizes with workers and advocates for equality supports the proletariat.”
- The rule “If Axel fights injustice or seeks equality, then he supports the proletariat” does not trigger, because we have “advocates for equality,” not “seeks equality,” and we have no statement that he fights injustice.
- For socialism: We have two exclusive-ors: (pursues political power) xor (endorses capitalism), and (endorses capitalism) xor (believes in socialism). These imply Axel believes in socialism if and only if he pursues political power. But the only related premise is “If someone has charisma and seeks influence, then they can pursue political power.” That yields only “can pursue,” not that Axel actually pursues political power. Thus we cannot determine whether he believes in socialism.
- Since we cannot firmly establish both “believes in socialism” and “supports the proletariat,” we cannot conclude that Axel joins the Bolshevik party.
