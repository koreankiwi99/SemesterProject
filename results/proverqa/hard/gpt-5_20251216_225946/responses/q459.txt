Question ID: 459
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Delilah cannot communicate complex ideas. Delilah masters algorithms if she can crack complex codes. For Delilah, either she has deep knowledge of computer systems or she can communicate complex ideas, but not necessarily both. Delilah protects sensitive data. Delilah does not develop secure protocols. If someone understands encryption and studies code patterns, then they can excel in cryptography. If Delilah works on high-profile projects, then she either has deep knowledge of computer systems or master algorithms (but not both). Anyone who excels in cryptography either identifies system vulnerabilities or develops secure protocols (or both). If Delilah passes a hacking competition, then she either wins national awards or excels in cryptography (or both). Delilah understands encryption. Delilah studies code patterns. Delilah has a proven track record. Delilah has strong problem-solving skills. If Delilah protects sensitive data, then she is either a skilled cybersecurity expert or masters algorithms (or both). If Delilah has strong problem-solving skills, then she works on high-profile projects and has a proven track record.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Delilah does not create unbreakable passwords.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Delilah understands encryption and studies code patterns, so she excels in cryptography.
- Anyone who excels in cryptography either identifies system vulnerabilities or develops secure protocols. Since Delilah does not develop secure protocols, she must identify system vulnerabilities.
- Strong problem-solving skills imply she works on high-profile projects (and has a proven track record). Working on high-profile projects implies exactly one of: deep knowledge of computer systems or mastering algorithms.
- Delilah cannot communicate complex ideas, and we’re told she has either deep knowledge of computer systems or can communicate complex ideas. Therefore, she must have deep knowledge of computer systems. By the exclusive-or from high-profile projects, she does not master algorithms.
- Protecting sensitive data implies she is either a skilled cybersecurity expert or masters algorithms. Since she does not master algorithms, she is a skilled cybersecurity expert.

None of the given statements relate to whether Delilah creates unbreakable passwords. There is no rule linking her skills or activities to creating (or not creating) unbreakable passwords. Thus the truth of the statement cannot be determined from the premises.

ANSWER: C

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: C
Correct: Yes
