Question ID: 460
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Mohammad studies diseases, then he will work on cures. Mohammad works on cures if he has medical training. Mohammad develops practical skills. If Mohammad either reduces suffering or enhances wellbeing (but not both), then he improves human lives. If someone works on cures, then they improve human lives. Mohammad explores nature or studies diseases. Hallie does not explore nature. For Mohammad, either he develops practical skills or pursues knowledge, but not both. Mohammad does not explore nature. If Mohammad has passion, then he either pursues knowledge or makes discoveries.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Mohammad contributes to science and improves human lives.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Mohammad explores nature or studies diseases” and “Mohammad does not explore nature,” we infer Mohammad studies diseases.
- If he studies diseases, then he works on cures. So Mohammad works on cures.
- If someone works on cures, then they improve human lives. Therefore, Mohammad improves human lives.
- We know Mohammad develops practical skills, and given the exclusive-or with pursuing knowledge, he does not pursue knowledge.
- There is no given rule that lets us conclude Mohammad “contributes to science.” The closest link would be pursuing knowledge or making discoveries, but we cannot infer either (pursuing knowledge is false; making discoveries is not entailed, and passion is unknown).

Conclusion: “Improves human lives” is true, but “contributes to science” is not determined. The conjunction is therefore uncertain.

ANSWER: C
