==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Abraham conducts research and does not become an expert. From “if he conducts research and learns from curators, then he becomes an expert,” it follows he does not learn from curators.
- He does not appreciate artifacts. Since attending museum exhibits implies learning from curators or appreciating artifacts, he does not attend museum exhibits.
- He reads history books, and (reads XOR attends) implies he visits historical sites. Hence, he visits historical sites.
- If he visits historical sites, then exactly one of protects heritage or desecrates landmarks holds. He ignores rules, which implies he desecrates landmarks; thus, protects heritage is false.
- He preserves artifacts, and this implies exactly one of exploits historical sites or respects cultural sites. Given he does not respect cultural sites, he exploits historical sites.
- Exploiting historical sites implies cultural vandal or protects heritage (or both). Since protects heritage is false, he is a cultural vandal.
- Being an archaeologist implies exactly one of cultural vandal or treasure preserver. With cultural vandal true, treasure preserver is false.
- Exactly one of treasure preserver or treasure looter is true. With treasure preserver false, treasure looter is true.
