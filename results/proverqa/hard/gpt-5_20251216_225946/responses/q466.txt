Anyone who practices mindfulness or has inner peace can handle stress. Anyone who pursues hobbies or has free time can feel fulfilled. Salvador does not have a loving family. For Salvador, developing expertise in a field and pursuing hobbies are mutually exclusive, in that they do not typically happen at the same time. Ariya does not achieve success.

For all humans, if they either live happily or have a loving family, then they have inner peace. Salvador cannot handle stress. If Salvador sets goals, then he finds motivation and pursues hobbies.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Salvador is passionate about cars, then he will develop expertise and gain recognition.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Salvador is talented and dedicates effort; thus he does not work hard (from the XOR rule on talent).
- Salvador is productive; by the XOR with free time, he does not have free time.
- Salvador does not eat a balanced diet; since everyone has either a balanced diet or good health, he must have good health.
- Salvador cannot handle stress. Given that mindfulness or inner peace implies handling stress, he has neither mindfulness nor inner peace. From inner peace being implied by living happily or having a loving family, and since he lacks a loving family, he does not live happily.
- With good health, “fulfilled and good health” would imply living happily; since he does not live happily, he is not fulfilled. Hence, from “hobbies or free time implies fulfilled,” he has neither hobbies nor free time.
- For Salvador, expertise and hobbies are mutually exclusive (cannot both be true). Since he has no hobbies, this does not determine whether he develops expertise.
- The only given sufficient condition for expertise is “reads manuals XOR takes courses,” which we do not know. There is no information about “recognition,” nor any link from being passionate about cars to expertise or recognition.

Conclusion: The statement “If Salvador is passionate about cars, then he will develop expertise and gain recognition” is not supported nor contradicted by the premises.
