==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Anyone who either achieves legendary status or gains worldwide recognition is revered by their peers” and “Jaxx is not revered by his peers,” we get that Jaxx is neither legendary nor recognized worldwide.
- Given “If Jaxx inspires others and has visionary ideas, then he achieves legendary status” and “Jaxx has visionary ideas,” the fact that he is not legendary implies Jaxx does not inspire others.
- From “If Jaxx lives in a fantasy world and has a unique ability, then he inspires others,” together with “Jaxx lives in a fantasy world” and “Jaxx does not inspire others,” it follows (by contrapositive) that Jaxx does not have a unique ability.
- In this context, “special powers” aligns with having a “unique ability.” Therefore, Jaxx does not possess special powers.
