Question ID: 470
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Either Colin is meticulous or careless, but not both. Colin is either rash or meticulous, but not both. Anyone who considers details and weighs consequences is likely to think cautiously. Colin either thinks cautiously or acts impulsively, but not both. Anyone who plans ahead or weighs outcomes evaluates risks. Everyone assesses situations or evaluates risks. Colin either follows his intuition or assesses situations, but not both. Colin does not consider his options. Colin is either impulsive or rash, but not both. If someone either considers their options or evaluates the risks, then they think cautiously. Colin follows his intuition. If Colin achieves success, then he is meticulous and pays attention.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Colin is not careless.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Colin follows his intuition (FI). From FI xor assesses situations (AS), AS is false.
- Everyone assesses situations or evaluates risks (ER). Since AS is false for Colin, ER is true.
- If considers options (CO) or ER, then thinks cautiously (TC). With ER true (and CO false), TC is true.
- From TC xor acts impulsively (AI), AI is false.

Now consider meticulous (M), careless (C), rash (R), impulsive (IMP):
- R xor M and IMP xor R together imply IMP ≡ M (they have the same truth value).
- M xor C implies C is the negation of M.

Two consistent cases remain:
1) R false → IMP true → M true → C false.
2) R true → IMP false → M false → C true.

Both cases satisfy all statements, so whether Colin is careless cannot be determined.

ANSWER: C

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
