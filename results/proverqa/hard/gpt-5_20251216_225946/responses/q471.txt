Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cohen is not dedicated.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Cohen does not speak out against injustice and does not advocate for human rights. From "If someone seeks justice then they speak out or advocate," by contrapositive, Cohen does not seek justice.
- Cohen does not report fairly. From "If someone pursues truth then they seek justice or report fairly," by contrapositive, Cohen does not pursue truth.
- From "Cohen either pursues truth or values integrity," and since he does not pursue truth, Cohen values integrity.
- From "Cohen is either driven to succeed or values integrity, but not both," and since he values integrity, he is not driven to succeed.
- From "If Cohen is either ambitious or driven to succeed (but not both), then he is highly motivated," and given he is not highly motivated, we infer not (ambitious XOR driven). Since driven is false, ambitious must also be false.
- From "Cohen is ambitious or dedicated," and since ambitious is false, dedicated must be true.

Therefore, the statement "Cohen is not dedicated" is false.
