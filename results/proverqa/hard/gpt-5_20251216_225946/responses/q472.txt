Question ID: 472
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Sky does not have natural talent. If Sky is an artist, then she either tells a story or evokes emotion, but not both. Sky evokes emotion. If Sky either expresses emotion or connects with the audience (but not both), then she builds a connection. Sky does not achieve success. If someone performs with elegance and connects with the audience, then they inspire others. If Sky has passion, then she tells a story and speaks from her heart. If Sky inspires others, then she will achieve success. Sky cannot touch the hearts of others. For all humans, if they are trained in ballet or have natural talent, then they perform with elegance. Sky is an artist. Anyone who either tells a story or builds a connection can touch the hearts of others. Sky expresses emotion.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sky is not trained in ballet.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From Sky is an artist and “artist -> (tells a story XOR evokes emotion)” and Sky evokes emotion, we get Sky does not tell a story.
- From “(tells a story OR builds a connection) -> touches hearts” and Sky cannot touch hearts, we infer not(tells a story OR builds a connection). Since she does not tell a story, she also does not build a connection.
- From “(expresses emotion XOR connects with the audience) -> builds a connection” and we have not(builds a connection), by contrapositive the XOR is false. Given Sky expresses emotion, it follows she does connect with the audience.
- From “(performs with elegance AND connects with the audience) -> inspires -> success” and Sky does not achieve success, with connects-with-audience true we get she does not perform with elegance.
- From “for all humans, (trained in ballet OR natural talent) -> performs with elegance,” by contrapositive not(elegance) implies neither trained in ballet nor natural talent. We already have no natural talent, so we conclude Sky is not trained in ballet.

Therefore, the statement “Sky is not trained in ballet” is true.
