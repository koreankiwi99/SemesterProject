Question ID: 479
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Santiago either designs infrastructure or connects isolated areas (but not both), then he builds bridges. If someone volunteers, then they strengthen social bonds. Sam empowers local residents. If Sam improves lives, then he either enhances public services or unites communities (or both). If Sam builds bridges, then he can either foster economic growth or unite communities, but not both. Sam has engineering skills. If Sam cares about others, then he connects isolated areas and strives for innovation. Sam strives for innovation. Sam cares about others. If Sam values his community, then he will connect isolated areas. If Sam overcomes obstacles, then he either unites communities or strengthens social bonds (or both). Sam either has engineering skills or designs infrastructure, but not both. Shmoopie succeeds in projects. Gracie has engineering skills. If Sam either designs infrastructure or connects isolated areas (but not both), then he builds bridges. Santiago empowers local residents. If Gracie builds bridges, then he can either foster economic growth or unite communities, but not both. If Sam succeeds in projects, then he either strengthens social bonds or empowers local residents, but not both. If Gracie cares about others, then he connects isolated areas and strives for innovation. Sam overcomes obstacles. Santiago cares about others. Sam succeeds in projects.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sam fosters economic growth.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Sam has engineering skills (E). From “Sam either has engineering skills or designs infrastructure, but not both,” E implies Sam does not design infrastructure (¬DI).
- Sam cares about others, so he connects isolated areas (CIA) and strives for innovation.
- Since DI is false and CIA is true, the condition “DI XOR CIA” holds; thus Sam builds bridges (BB).
- Sam succeeds in projects (SP) and “SP -> (strengthens social bonds XOR empowers local residents).” Given “Sam empowers local residents,” we get ELR true, so strengthens social bonds (ESB) must be false.
- Sam overcomes obstacles (OO) and “OO -> (unites communities or strengthens social bonds).” With ESB false, unites communities (UC) must be true.
- From BB and “BB -> (fosters economic growth XOR unites communities),” and with UC true, it follows that fosters economic growth (FEG) is false.

ANSWER: B

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: B
Correct: Yes
