==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- If someone achieves their goals, then they are confident and have strong convictions. Kelly does not have strong convictions, so by contrapositive, Kelly does not achieve her goals.
- If Kelly is dedicated and works hard, then she achieves her goals. Kelly works hard; since she does not achieve her goals, by contrapositive, Kelly is not dedicated.
- Kelly either wins cases or loses arguments, but not both. Kelly loses arguments, so she does not win cases.
- If Kelly is either confident in her speech or passionate, then she wins her cases. Since she does not win cases, by contrapositive, she is neither confident in her speech nor passionate.
- Therefore, Kelly is neither dedicated nor passionate. The only given condition that would make Kelly successful is: if she is either dedicated or passionate (but not both). That antecedent is false here, so we cannot conclude she is successful. No other rule establishes her success or failure.

Conclusion: The truth of “Kelly is successful” cannot be determined from the given information.
