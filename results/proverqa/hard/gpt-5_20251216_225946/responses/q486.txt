For Jade, either enjoying spontaneity or seeking new experiences (but not both) implies being free-spirited. Anyone who is a skilled cartographer either charts new paths or explores unseen areas (or both). Jade craves challenge. If someone appreciates precision, then they value routine and take care of details. If Jade is a seasoned sailor, then she is either an excellent navigator or a master cartographer, but not both.

  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Anyone who craves challenge or desires change will seek new experiences” and Jade craves challenge, Jade seeks new experiences.
- Given “For Jade, either enjoying spontaneity or seeking new experiences (but not both) implies being free-spirited” and Jade is not free-spirited, we get not(S XOR seeking new experiences), so enjoying spontaneity iff seeking new experiences. Since she seeks new experiences, she enjoys spontaneity.
- From “she either enjoys spontaneity or prefers order, but not both,” and enjoying spontaneity is true, Jade does not prefer order.
- If someone values routine, then they prefer order. Since Jade does not prefer order, she does not value routine.
- “Jade either values routine or is adventurous, but not both.” Since she does not value routine, she is adventurous.
- If Jade loves the ocean, then she is a seasoned sailor; given she loves the ocean, she is a seasoned sailor.
- If she is a seasoned sailor, then she is either an excellent navigator or a master cartographer, but not both. She is not a master cartographer, so she is an excellent navigator.
- If Jade is adventurous, then she charts new paths. So she charts new paths.
- If Jade is an excellent navigator, then she either leads expeditions or charts new paths, but not both. Since she charts new paths, she does not lead expeditions.

Therefore, the statement “Jade leads expeditions” is false.
