Question ID: 488
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Anyone who listens actively or shares stories can forge meaningful connections. Santana does not try new food. Anahi speaks multiple languages. Everyone values kindness or has empathy. If Davina is open-minded, then she either shares personal stories or forges meaningful connections (but not both). Anahi either receives warm hospitality or travels alone, but not both. Anahi does not foster global understanding. Anyone who is sociable or has empathy can build bridges between people. Anahi enjoys solitude. If Anahi either prioritizes community or enjoys solitude (but not both), then she is sociable. Anahi does not love adventure. If someone has empathy and speaks multiple languages, then they can foster global understanding. Anahi cannot build bridges between people. If Anahi either travels alone or explores cities (but not both), then she values independence. Anahi does not try new food. If Anahi has travel stories and documents experiences, then she can explore cities. If Anahi either has no fixed address or keeps to herself (but not both), then she tends to travel alone. If Anahi explores cities or tries new food, then she loves adventure. Anahi either values independence or prioritizes community, but not both. If Anahi is open-minded, then she either shares personal stories or forges meaningful connections (but not both). Santana does not love adventure. Anahi is open-minded. Anahi does not share personal stories.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Anahi is not culturally curious.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Anahi is open-minded and does not share personal stories, so by the XOR rule she forges meaningful connections.
- From “sociable or has empathy -> can build bridges” and “Anahi cannot build bridges,” it follows Anahi is not sociable and does not have empathy.
- From “everyone values kindness or has empathy,” with no empathy, Anahi values kindness.
- From “explores cities or tries new food -> loves adventure” and “Anahi does not love adventure,” she neither explores cities nor tries new food.
- With enjoys solitude true and “if XOR(prioritizes community, enjoys solitude) then sociable,” and since she is not sociable, the XOR must be false; thus prioritizes community is true.
- From XOR(values independence, prioritizes community), values independence is false. Then using “if XOR(travels alone, explores cities) then values independence” and not explores cities, we get “if travels alone then values independence,” so not values independence implies not travels alone; hence she receives warm hospitality.

No rule defines or links “culturally curious” to any given traits. Therefore, whether Anahi is (not) culturally curious cannot be determined from the premises.
