Question ID: 489
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Simba feels invincible. If Simba either learns from mistakes or listens to others (but not both), then he values wisdom. Yummers feels invincible. Simba does not develop caution. Simba either follows the advice of his elders or exhibits impulsive behavior, but not both. Simba seeks adventure. Simba respects experience. If Simba avoids reckless behavior, then he values wisdom. Rhys respects experience. Every lion who feels invincible either asserts dominance or has confidence (or both). Every lion who takes risks either develops caution or learns from mistakes (or both). For all lions, if they have confidence and seek adventure, then they take risks. If Simba values wisdom and respects experience, then he follows the advice of his elders. Any lion that respects tradition or values prudence follows the advice of their elders. Simba does not listen to others. Simba does not assert dominance.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Simba will not face danger.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Simba feels invincible” and “Every lion who feels invincible either asserts dominance or has confidence,” together with “Simba does not assert dominance,” we infer Simba has confidence.
- With “Simba seeks adventure” and “If they have confidence and seek adventure, then they take risks,” Simba takes risks.
- From “Every lion who takes risks either develops caution or learns from mistakes” and “Simba does not develop caution,” Simba learns from mistakes.
- Since Simba learns from mistakes and does not listen to others, the XOR condition holds, so he values wisdom. With “Simba respects experience,” he follows the advice of his elders (and thus is not impulsive), but there is no rule linking this to not taking risks.
- Therefore, Simba does take risks, i.e., he faces danger. So “Simba will not face danger” is false.

ANSWER: B

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: C
Prediction: B
Correct: No
