Question ID: 490
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Anyone who puts others first or works tirelessly has selfless dedication. All people with a generous spirit share credit and value collaboration. Faye has a generous spirit. Girlfriend values collaboration. Faye is not a renowned expert. Meredith either has selfless dedication or hunts for recognition, but not both. Girlfriend makes breakthroughs. Anyone who craves fame will hunt for recognition. Meredith makes breakthroughs. Lewis does not attribute success. Meredith has a generous spirit. If Lewis either shares credit or attributes success (but not both), then she remains humble. Meredith does not attribute success. Lewis either remains humble or receives awards, but not necessarily both. Anyone who seeks validation will hunt for recognition. If Lewis is either a renowned expert or has selfless dedication (but not both), then she leaves a lasting legacy. If Meredith is modest, then she either shares credit or deflects accolades, but not both. Meredith values collaboration. If Meredith makes breakthroughs, then she either receives awards or craves fame (or both). Meredith either remains humble or receives awards, but not necessarily both. Faye either has selfless dedication or hunts for recognition, but not both. If Meredith either shares credit or attributes success (but not both), then she remains humble.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Meredith does not leave a lasting legacy.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Meredith has a generous spirit, so she shares credit and values collaboration.
- Meredith does not attribute success. Since she shares credit and does not attribute success, the XOR condition (shares credit or attributes success, but not both) holds, so Meredith remains humble.
- Meredith makes breakthroughs, so she either receives awards or craves fame (or both). If she craves fame, she hunts for recognition; by the XOR rule, she then would not have selfless dedication. If she does not crave fame, we still cannot fix whether she has selfless dedication or hunts for recognition.
- No given rule connects any of Meredith’s properties to “leaves a lasting legacy.” The only legacy rule is specific to Lewis.

Therefore, whether Meredith leaves a lasting legacy cannot be determined from the information.
