Question ID: 491
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Cason does not prosper in harsh environments. If a plant has a waxy coating and stores water, then it thrives in arid conditions. Cason tolerates shade. Any plant that exudes gel either prospers in harsh environments or thrives in arid conditions (or both). If Cason either develops roots or blooms in water (but not both), then it can survive extremes. If Cason is an endangered plant, then it either grows rapidly or survives extremes, but not both. For Cason, either it requires constant watering or produces soothing gel, but not both. Cason either exudes gel or blooms in water, but not both. Cason either has healing properties or thrives in arid conditions, but not both. If Cason has adaptive leaves, then it can survive extremes. If Cason either has healing properties or produces soothing gel (but not both), then it is medicinal. Cason needs sunlight. If Cason needs sunlight, then it either requires constant watering or tolerates shade, but not both. Cason grows rapidly. Cason is an endangered plant. Cason does not develop roots.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cason is not resilient.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Endangered → (Grows Rapidly XOR Survives Extremes). Given Cason is endangered and grows rapidly, it must not survive extremes.
- If it bloomed in water (with not developing roots), then it would survive extremes; since it does not survive extremes, it cannot bloom in water. Hence, by the XOR, it exudes gel.
- Exuding gel implies prosper in harsh environments or thrive in arid conditions. But Cason does not prosper in harsh environments, so it must thrive in arid conditions. This does not affect the earlier conclusion about surviving extremes.
- No other rule forces surviving extremes (e.g., adaptive leaves is not given).

Therefore, Cason does not survive extremes, i.e., is not resilient.

ANSWER: A

Ground Truth: C
Prediction: A
Correct: No
