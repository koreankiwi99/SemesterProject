Question ID: 494
Difficulty: hard

Context:
If Elisabeth owns a big plot of land and needs extra help, then he will employ workers. Raul is an experienced farmer. If Raul manages a large plantation, then he either harvests efficiently or uses sustainable practices, but not both. Raul works independently. If Raul dedicates time to his farm, then he either grows high-quality beans or supports local projects. Elisabeth needs extra help. If Asher either employs workers or mechanizes tasks (but not both), then he manages a large plantation. If Raul is a successful farmer, then he either employs many workers or manages large plantations, but not both. If Raul owns a big plot of land and needs extra help, then he will employ workers. If Asher manages a large plantation, then he either harvests efficiently or uses sustainable practices, but not both. Kieran owns a big plot of land. If Raul is an experienced farmer, then he either grows high-quality beans or harvests efficiently, but not both. If Raul either employs workers or mechanizes tasks (but not both), then he manages a large plantation. Raul needs extra help. Raul either works independently or shares knowledge with others, but not both. Raul owns a big plot of land. Raul uses sustainable practices. Raul does not mechanize tasks. Asher uses sustainable practices.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Raul can improve the community.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Raul owns a big plot and needs extra help, so he employs workers.
- He does not mechanize tasks; since he either employs workers or mechanizes tasks (but not both) implies he manages a large plantation, he does manage a large plantation.
- Managing a large plantation forces exactly one of harvesting efficiently or using sustainable practices; given he uses sustainable practices, he does not harvest efficiently.
- Being experienced implies exactly one of growing high-quality beans or harvesting efficiently; since he does not harvest efficiently, he grows high-quality beans.
- He works independently and (independently XOR shares knowledge) holds, so he does not share knowledge.
- “Improving the community” would correspond to supporting local projects or sharing knowledge. Sharing knowledge is false. Supporting local projects is not entailed by any rule (and even if he dedicates time to his farm, the rule allows high-quality beans instead of supporting local projects, which we already have).

Therefore, whether Raul improves the community cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: C
