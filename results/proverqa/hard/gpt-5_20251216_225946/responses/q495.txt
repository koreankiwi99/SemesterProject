Question ID: 495
Difficulty: hard

Context:
All penguins who either guard their nest or are protective are defending their family. If Pancake has a mate, then he is either loyal or protective, but not both. If Pancake dives deep, then he either finds food or hunts efficiently, but not both. Any penguin that builds a nest or raises its young can care for its chicks. Pancake keeps vigilant. All penguins who either guard their nest or keep vigilant will safeguard their territory. Pancake hunts efficiently. Pancake either raises his young or migrates seasonally, but not at the same time. Pancake migrates seasonally. Pancake is devoted. Pancake has a mate. Pancake builds a nest. If Pancake cares for his chicks and defends his family, then he can find food. If Pancake is either loving or devoted (but not both), then he is loyal. Pancake dives deep. Pancake does not safeguard his territory.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Pancake is not loving.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Pancake migrates and “raises young XOR migrates” ⇒ raises young is false.
- Pancake builds a nest ⇒ cares for chicks is true.
- Pancake dives deep and hunts efficiently, with “finds food XOR hunts efficiently” ⇒ finds food is false.
- If he cares for chicks and defends family then he finds food. Since he does not find food and he does care for chicks, he must not defend his family.
- “(Guards nest or protective) ⇒ defends family”; contrapositive gives not protective and not guarding nest.
- Has a mate ⇒ “loyal XOR protective”; with protective false ⇒ loyal is true.
- Pancake is devoted. The rule “(loving XOR devoted) ⇒ loyal” does not determine loving, because loyal is already true from another source and both loving true and loving false remain consistent with all constraints.

Therefore, whether Pancake is loving cannot be determined.

ANSWER: C

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: B
Prediction: C
Correct: No
