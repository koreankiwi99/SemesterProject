Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Cullen is a skilled baker, then he can either own a successful bakery or earn a reputable title, but not both.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From works in the culinary industry and not understanding customer tastes, Cullen must be a successful chef.
- As a successful chef who does not focus on presentation, he must value quality ingredients. Given he doesn’t pay attention to details, he must be passionate about cooking.
- He has creativity and cannot make delicious desserts; using the rule about experimenting leading to desserts, he does not enjoy experimenting, so he creates unique recipes.
- He wins cooking awards, which implies he is highly acclaimed; this contradicts the given claim that he is not highly acclaimed. Using contrapositive on that “highly acclaimed” rule also yields that he does not earn a reputable title, creating further inconsistency.

Key point for the queried statement:
- There is no information connecting “skilled baker” to owning a successful bakery or to earning a reputable title.
- We have no established fact that Cullen owns a successful bakery.
- Whether he earns a reputable title is itself inconsistent/undetermined in the premises.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of the conditional “If Cullen is a skilled baker, then he can either own a successful bakery or earn a reputable title, but not both.”
