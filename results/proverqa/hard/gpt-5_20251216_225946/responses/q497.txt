  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Lexie practices gratitude, so she stays positive. She also learns from failure.
- If Lexie faced challenges, she would have exactly one of “learns from failure” or “stays positive.” Since she has both, she does not face challenges.
- From “achieves success or faces challenges implies motivated” and Lexie is not motivated, we get that Lexie does not achieve success and does not face challenges.
- Lexie develops skills. If someone is creative and develops skills, they achieve success. Since Lexie does not achieve success, she is not creative.
- From “if Lexie has talent or gains recognition then she becomes iconic” and Lexie does not become iconic, we get she does not gain recognition (and not talented).
- From “if Lexie produces unique art or expresses herself freely then she gains recognition” and she does not gain recognition, we get she neither produces unique art nor expresses herself freely.
- If someone gets inspiration from nature, then they are either creative or produce unique art. Lexie is neither creative nor producing unique art, so she cannot have gotten inspiration from nature.
