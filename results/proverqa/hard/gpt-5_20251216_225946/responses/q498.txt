Question ID: 498
Difficulty: hard

Context:
Saul does not achieve his goals. Saul is not receiving support. Saul does not set realistic goals. If Saul either regains confidence or builds self-esteem (but not both), then he overcomes adversity. If Saul meets challenges, then he either becomes discouraged or finds new strength, but not both. If Saul either uses assistive devices or requires medical attention (but not both), then he is disabled. If someone requires medical attention and has a strong will, then they can achieve goals. Anyone who achieves success will build their self-esteem. If Saul faces obstacles, then he either loses motivation or finds new strength, but not both. Saul uses assistive devices. Saul does not overcome adversity. If someone suffers injuries, then they face obstacles and develop resilience. Saul has a strong will. Saul either builds self-esteem or sets realistic goals, but not both. If Saul finds new strength, then he either regains confidence or rediscovers purpose, but not both. Saul rediscovers his purpose. If someone recognizes their ability and makes progress, then they can regain confidence. If Saul is disabled, then he is either receiving support or suffering injuries (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Saul does not lose motivation.

Options:
  A) True
  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Saul does not achieve his goals” and “Saul has a strong will,” using (If requires medical attention and has a strong will, then can achieve goals), we infer he does not require medical attention. So RMA is false.
- Given “Saul uses assistive devices” and RMA false, the XOR in (uses assistive devices xor requires medical attention) holds, so Saul is disabled.
- If disabled, then (receiving support xor suffering injuries). Since Saul is not receiving support, he must be suffering injuries.
- Suffering injuries implies he faces obstacles.
- From “Saul either builds self-esteem or sets realistic goals, but not both” and “Saul does not set realistic goals,” we get he builds self-esteem.
- From “Saul does not overcome adversity” and (if regains confidence xor builds self-esteem then overcomes adversity), we get not (regains confidence xor builds self-esteem). With BSE true, this forces regains confidence to be true as well.
- With regains confidence true and “Saul rediscovers his purpose,” the XOR in (if finds new strength then regains confidence xor rediscovers purpose) cannot hold; by contrapositive, Saul does not find new strength.
- Facing obstacles implies (loses motivation xor finds new strength). Since he does not find new strength, he must lose motivation.

Therefore, the statement “Saul does not lose motivation” is false.
