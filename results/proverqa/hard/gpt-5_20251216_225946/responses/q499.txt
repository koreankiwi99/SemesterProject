  B) False
  C) Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "If Ashlynn develops resilience, then she achieves success" and "Ashlynn does not achieve success," we infer Ashlynn does not develop resilience.
- Ashlynn experiences failure. From "If she experiences failure, then she learns from mistakes or faces life challenges, but not both" and "Ashlynn avoids risks" together with "Either learns from mistakes or avoids risks, but not both," we get she does not learn from mistakes. Hence, given failure, she must face life challenges.
- If she faces life challenges, then she either develops resilience or has a supportive family. Since she does not develop resilience, she must have a supportive family.
- If she has a supportive family, then she becomes dependent or independent (or both). So dependent or independent must hold.
- From "Ashlynn either lacks motivation or struggles with decisions" and "Ashlynn does not struggle with decisions," she lacks motivation. Also given she has low self-esteem.
- If she becomes dependent, then she either lacks motivation or has low self-esteem, but not both. Since both are true, she cannot be dependent. Therefore, dependent is false.
- With supportive family true and dependent false, independent must be true.

Therefore, the statement "Ashlynn does not become independent" is false.
