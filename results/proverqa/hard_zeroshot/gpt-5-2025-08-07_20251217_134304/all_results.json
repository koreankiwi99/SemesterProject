From (Prioritizes safety P \u2227 Tng) \u21d2 RE and \u00acRE, we get \u00ac(P \u2227 Tng); with Tng true, this yields \u00acP.\n- Since P \u2228 Brave (B) and \u00acP, Gary is brave (B).

Therefore, Tate studies biodiversity.\n- Tate protects wildlife, and anyone who protects wildlife respects nature. So Tate respects nature.\n- Everyone who respects nature either understands the importance of pollinators or values the ecosystem (or both). Thus, Tate either understands the importance of pollinators or values the ecosystem.\n- If Tate values the ecosystem, then he appreciates ragwort.\n- Tate either appreciates ragwort or disapproves of it, but not both.\n\nCase analysis:\n- If Tate values the ecosystem, he appreciates ragwort, so he does not disapprove.\n- If Tate does not value the ecosystem (satisfying respect for nature via understanding the importance of pollinators), there is no rule determining his ragwort stance; he could either appreciate or disapprove, but not both.\n\nTherefore, whether Tate disapproves of ragwort cannot be determined from the premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain"

Since Saul does not overcome adversity and builds self-esteem, the XOR must be false, so Saul also regains confidence.\n- Given \u201cSaul rediscovers his purpose,\u201d and \u201cIf Saul finds new strength, then XOR(regains confidence, rediscovers purpose),\u201d having both regains confidence and rediscovers purpose true forces: Saul does not find new strength.\n- Saul has a strong will. If he required medical attention and had a strong will, then he would achieve goals; but he does not achieve his goals, so he does not require medical attention.\n- Saul uses assistive devices and does not require medical attention, so XOR(uses devices, requires medical attention) holds, implying Saul is disabled.\n- If disabled, then XOR(receiving support, suffering injuries). Since he is not receiving support, he must be suffering injuries.\n- Suffering injuries implies he faces obstacles. If he faces obstacles, then XOR(loses motivation, finds new strength). With \u201cdoes not find new strength,\u201d it follows that he loses motivation.\n\nTherefore, the statement \u201cSaul does not lose motivation\u201d is false.\n\nANSWER: False"
