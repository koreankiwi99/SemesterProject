==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Legend has a good temperament, and “fast or good temperament, but not both” implies Legend is not fast.
- From “Legend is either a champion or fast,” and not fast, it follows that Legend is a champion.
- “If Legend has strong muscles or an athletic build, then competitive,” but Legend is not competitive, so he has neither strong muscles nor an athletic build.
- All large breed horses have strong muscles; since Legend lacks strong muscles, he is not a large breed.
- “Well-trained or racing background, but not both,” and Legend is well-trained, so he does not have a racing background.
- If Legend has a unique color, then he is either large breed or has a racing background (but not both). Since he is neither large breed nor has a racing background, he cannot have a unique color.
- As a champion, Legend must have either a unique color or a distinctive marking. Since he does not have a unique color, he must have a distinctive marking.
