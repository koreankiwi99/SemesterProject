==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Jace does not live in the present and (enjoys moments or values experiences) -> lives in the present, we get that Jace does not enjoy moments and does not value experiences.
- If Jace appreciates nature -> tries new things and loves learning; given Jace does not try new things and does not love learning, Jace does not appreciate nature.
- From (appreciates nature xor finds inner peace) -> enjoys moments and not enjoys moments, we get not(appreciates nature xor finds inner peace). With not appreciates nature, this implies Jace does not find inner peace. Given Jace pursues happiness or finds inner peace, Jace pursues happiness.
- Jace pursues his passion and grows personally. From "If Jace pursues his passion then (grows personally xor lives a fulfilling life)," we conclude Jace does not live a fulfilling life.
- From "If (cultivates friendships xor pursues happiness) then lives a fulfilling life," since Jace pursues happiness and does not live a fulfilling life, the antecedent must be false; hence Jace cultivates friendships is true.
- Jace is a good listener and asks meaningful questions; from "If Jace shares stories then (good listener xor asks meaningful questions)," Jace does not share stories.

No rule connects "enjoys life" to "inspires others." Since we know Jace does not live a fulfilling life, the consequent "inspires others xor lives a fulfilling life" reduces to "inspires others." There is no basis to conclude that if Jace enjoys life then he inspires others, nor to conclude the opposite. It’s consistent that Jace enjoys life without inspiring others, and also consistent that he does not enjoy life (making the implication vacuously true).

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
