==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Izabella works in a family business and either builds a strong network or develops unique skills, but not both. If she built a strong network, she would advance her career; but she does not advance her career. Hence she does not build a strong network and thus develops unique skills.
- Izabella either pursues excellence or stays humble, and she does not pursue excellence, so she stays humble.
- She either earns recognition or stays humble, but not both; since she stays humble, she does not earn recognition.
- If she committed to quality, she would earn recognition; since she does not earn recognition, she does not commit to quality.
- Anyone who creates acclaimed wines either commits to quality or respects tradition; but she does not respect tradition and does not commit to quality, so she does not create acclaimed wines.
- If she studied winemaking (or had viticulture experience), she would create acclaimed wines. Since she does not create acclaimed wines, she neither has viticulture experience nor studies winemaking.

Therefore, Izabella does not study winemaking.
