Makenna builds muscle. If Oaklyn has a gray coat, then she either has refined features or possesses a calm temperament, but not both. All horses that mature slowly have endurance and develop strength. If Oaklyn is athletic, then she can either win competitions or inspire others, but not both. If Oaklyn either gallops freely or shows elegance (but not both), then she inspires others. All horses with refined movement have elegance. Oaklyn is not agile. If Oaklyn has discipline, then she is either agile or well-trained, but not both. Oaklyn does not have refined features. Oaklyn grows strong or matures slowly. Every horse that possesses a calm temperament either has elegance or displays grace (or both). If Oaklyn either grows tall or builds muscle (but not both), then she matures slowly. Oaklyn does not grow tall. Oaklyn has discipline. Oaklyn does not display grace.

Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Oaklyn does not win competitions.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From gray coat and “gray coat -> (refined features xor calm temperament)” plus “not refined features,” we get calm temperament.
- Calm temperament implies (elegance or grace). With “not grace,” we get elegance.
- Elegance implies inspires others, so inspires others is true.
- Discipline and “discipline -> (agile xor well-trained)” with “not agile” implies well-trained.
- Well-trained implies athletic.
- Athletic implies (win competitions xor inspire others). Since inspires others is true, win competitions must be false.

ANSWER: True
