Question ID: 4
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Dayana has a PhD in biology. If Landen has a passion for reptiles, then he will study caimans. Landen protects endangered species. Barrett either works with local communities or ventures into remote locations, but not both. Landen does not work with local communities. Vihaan either ventures into remote locations or earns global recognition, but not both. Landen either works with local communities or ventures into remote locations, but not both. Landen has experience with wildlife rescue. If Dayana has a PhD in biology, then he either documents animal behavior or has experience with wildlife rescue, but not both. Landen either ventures into remote locations or earns global recognition, but not both. Landen has a PhD in biology. If Landen has a PhD in biology, then he either documents animal behavior or has experience with wildlife rescue, but not both. Barrett protects endangered species. Anyone who discovers new species and publishes research papers can earn global recognition. If Landen has field experience, then he either ventures into remote locations or specializes in reptile biology, but not both. If Landen studies caimans, then he can either gain the respect of the indigenous community or contribute to caiman conservation, but not both. Landen, as a wildlife explorer, either documents animal behavior or has a passion for reptiles, but not necessarily both. If Landen protects endangered species, then he can either gain the respect of the indigenous community or earn global recognition, but not both. If Landen loves animals, then he has a passion for reptiles.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Landen contributes to caiman conservation.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Landen does not work with local communities, and he must either work with local communities or venture into remote locations (but not both). Therefore, he ventures into remote locations.
- He either ventures into remote locations or earns global recognition (but not both). Since he ventures, he does not earn global recognition.
- Landen has a PhD and either documents behavior or has wildlife rescue experience (but not both). Given he has wildlife rescue experience, he does not document behavior.
- As a wildlife explorer, he either documents behavior or has a passion for reptiles (not necessarily both). Since he does not document behavior, he has a passion for reptiles.
- Passion for reptiles implies he studies caimans.
- If he studies caimans, then he either gains the respect of the indigenous community or contributes to caiman conservation (but not both).
- Landen protects endangered species, which implies he either gains indigenous respect or earns global recognition (but not both). Since he does not earn global recognition, he gains indigenous respect.
- Therefore, by the caiman-studies condition, gaining respect excludes contributing to caiman conservation.

ANSWER: False

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
