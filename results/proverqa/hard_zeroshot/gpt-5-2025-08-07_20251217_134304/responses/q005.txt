Question ID: 5
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Lennon has feathers. If Lennon either eats pollen or sips sap (but not both), then he collects nectar. Lennon does not locate food. Lennon does not avoid predators. Any insect that finds shelter either avoids predators or locates food (or both). If Lennon has feathers, then he spreads seeds and flies efficiently. If Lennon hibernates during winter, then he migrates seasonally. Louisa does not avoid predators. Lennon finds shelter or migrates seasonally. If Karim has feathers, then he spreads seeds and flies efficiently. Lennon either collects nectar or spreads seeds, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lennon does not pollinate flowers.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Lennon has feathers” and “If Lennon has feathers, then he spreads seeds and flies efficiently,” Lennon spreads seeds.
- From “Lennon either collects nectar or spreads seeds, but not both,” and the above, Lennon does not collect nectar.
- Using contrapositive on “If Lennon either eats pollen or sips sap (but not both), then he collects nectar,” since he does not collect nectar, it is not the case that exactly one of eating pollen or sipping sap holds (he either does both or neither).
- There is no given rule linking any of these properties to “pollinates flowers.”

Therefore, whether Lennon pollinates flowers cannot be determined from the provided information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
