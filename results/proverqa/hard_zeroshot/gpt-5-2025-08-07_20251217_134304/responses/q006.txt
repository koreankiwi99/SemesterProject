Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jimmy advocates for equality.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Jimmy values integrity, he leads his community. Then by the rule (lead community -> champions environmental causes or supports human rights), and given Jimmy organizes rallies and does not inspire others, supports human rights must be false (otherwise supports human rights ∧ organizes rallies -> inspires). Hence Jimmy champions environmental causes.
- Jimmy is not respected. From (conservative or values tradition -> respected) and contrapositive, he is neither conservative nor valuing tradition. With the XOR (conservative, progressive), Jimmy must be progressive.
- Progressive implies either fights for social justice or advocates for equality (or both). We have no information forcing fights for social justice to be false, nor any rule deriving advocates for equality directly.

Thus we cannot determine whether Jimmy advocates for equality.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
