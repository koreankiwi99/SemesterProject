Question ID: 7
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Wyatt values accuracy or is a perfectionist. Wyatt strives for precision. Anyone who examines data or seeks truth can evaluate evidence. Anyone who concentrates hard or evaluates thoroughly thinks carefully. If Wyatt either seeks patterns or analyzes data (but not both), then he evaluates evidence. If Wyatt acts on instinct, then he is careless. Wyatt does not value accuracy. Chloe values accuracy or is a perfectionist. Wyatt does not attack problems. If Queen either seeks patterns or analyzes data (but not both), then he evaluates evidence. Wyatt does not follow rules. Anyone who attacks problems or considers details thinks carefully. Queen does not attack problems. Wyatt does not analyze data. Wyatt either follows rules or is spontaneous. If someone strives for precision, then they consider details and evaluate evidence. Wyatt seeks patterns. If Wyatt is spontaneous, then he is either impulsive or thinks carefully (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Wyatt is either a perfectionist or careless, but not both.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Wyatt values accuracy or is a perfectionist" and "Wyatt does not value accuracy," it follows that Wyatt is a perfectionist.
- Wyatt seeks patterns and does not analyze data, satisfying the exclusive-or condition, so he evaluates evidence.
- From "Wyatt strives for precision," he considers details and evaluates evidence; thus, he thinks carefully (since considering details implies thinking carefully).
- Wyatt does not follow rules and must be spontaneous; from spontaneity, he is either impulsive or thinks carefully (but not both). Since he thinks carefully, he is not impulsive.
- The only link to being careless is: if Wyatt acts on instinct, then he is careless. We have no information that he acts on instinct, nor any rule implying he is not careless.

Conclusion:
- Wyatt is definitely a perfectionist.
- Whether he is careless is not determined.

Therefore, the statement "Wyatt is either a perfectionist or careless, but not both" (exclusive or) is uncertain, because one side (perfectionist) is true, but the other (careless) is undetermined.
