Question ID: 8
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Vincent is trustworthy or has expertise. Vincent examines evidence or thinks critically (or both). Hugh examines evidence or thinks critically (or both). If Vincent has expertise, then he works diligently and solves complex cases. Vincent has keen insight. Anyone who evaluates clues or makes connections can think critically. If someone has keen insight, then they analyze data and understand motives. If Vincent follows clues, then he will uncover the truth. If Vincent investigates crime, then he either examines evidence or analyzes data (but not both). Vincent investigates crime. If someone solves complex cases and thinks critically, then they can uncover the truth. If Vincent either identifies patterns or connects clues (but not both), then he is able to analyze data. Vincent did not find justice. If someone uncovers the truth, then they can find justice. Vincent values integrity or is trustworthy. If Vincent is reliable, then he either has expertise or has experience, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Vincent is not skilled.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We know:
- Vincent has keen insight, so he analyzes data (AD) and understands motives.
- Vincent investigates crime, and IC -> (examines evidence (EE) XOR analyzes data (AD)). Since AD is true, EE must be false.
- Given “Vincent examines evidence or thinks critically (TC)”, with EE false, TC must be true.
- Vincent did not find justice (¬FJ), and UT -> FJ, so ¬UT (he did not uncover the truth).
- From (solves complex cases (SCC) ∧ TC) -> UT and ¬UT with TC true, we conclude ¬SCC.
- If Vincent had expertise (E), then SCC would be true; since ¬SCC, we infer ¬E. From “trustworthy or has expertise,” we get trustworthy true.

Nothing in the premises defines or links “skilled” to any of these properties. We cannot determine whether Vincent is skilled or not.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
