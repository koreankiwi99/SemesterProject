Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Muffin is nocturnal.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We know:
- Muffin enjoys exploring, so she is playful.
- Muffin either has a good memory or is curious, and she does not have a good memory, so she is curious.
- Muffin has territory, which by the rule would imply family bonds, but we are also told she does not have family bonds. This is a direct contradiction in the data, but it does not relate to nocturnality.

The only statement involving nocturnality is: If Muffin is nocturnal, then she is either social or solitary, but not both. There is no rule that concludes Muffin is nocturnal, nor any rule that concludes she is not nocturnal. We also cannot derive both social and solitary to refute nocturnality, nor can we derive one of them in a way that would imply nocturnality.

Thus, whether Muffin is nocturnal cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
