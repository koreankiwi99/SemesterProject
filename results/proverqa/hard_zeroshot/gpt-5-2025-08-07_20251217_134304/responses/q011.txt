Question ID: 11
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Dr. Marlon reads often. Dr. Marlon follows his experience or trusts his instinct. Dr. Marlon does not follow his experience. Dr. Marlon is not analytical. If Dr. Marlon either learns quickly or has good memory, then he is analytical. If Dr. Marlon has good memory, then he is either rational or intuitive, but not both. Dr. Marlon learns quickly if he reads often. If Dr. Marlon values insight, then he both listens carefully and trusts his instinct. Anyone who trusts their instinct is intuitive. Everyone is rational or emotional (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Marlon's patients are emotional.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Dr. Marlon reads often" and "Dr. Marlon learns quickly if he reads often," we get that he learns quickly.
- Given "If Dr. Marlon either learns quickly or has good memory, then he is analytical," this implies he is analytical.
- But we are also told "Dr. Marlon is not analytical," which creates a contradiction in the premises.
- From "Dr. Marlon follows his experience or trusts his instinct" and "Dr. Marlon does not follow his experience," we infer he trusts his instinct; thus, by "Anyone who trusts their instinct is intuitive," he is intuitive.
- The only statement about people generally is "Everyone is rational or emotional (or both)." This applies to patients too, but it does not entail that they are emotional (they could be rational only).
- There is no specific information about Dr. Marlon’s patients that would let us conclude they are emotional.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
