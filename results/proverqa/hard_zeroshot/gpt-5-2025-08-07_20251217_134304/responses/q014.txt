Question ID: 14
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Makai either collects data or conducts laboratory tests. Soldier can solve complex problems. If Makai can solve complex problems, then he will pursue innovative research and study brain function. Makai does not read scientific papers. If Makai either reads scientific papers or explores new theories (but not both), then he pursues innovative research. If someone works in a lab, then they conduct laboratory tests. If Matias analyzes molecules or conducts laboratory tests, then he is a biochemist. If Makai is a biochemist, then he either modulates adenosine receptors or studies brain function, but not both. Makai does not collect data. If Makai analyzes molecules or conducts laboratory tests, then he is a biochemist. Matias does not read scientific papers. Makai analyzes molecules. Makai can solve complex problems. If Soldier either reads scientific papers or explores new theories (but not both), then he pursues innovative research. Lilly analyzes molecules. Makai explores new theories. If Makai pursues medical breakthroughs, then he either modulates adenosine receptors or develops new treatments (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Makai can regulate sleep patterns.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Makai either collects data or conducts laboratory tests” and “Makai does not collect data,” Makai conducts laboratory tests.
- From “If Makai analyzes molecules or conducts laboratory tests, then he is a biochemist” and the facts that he analyzes molecules and conducts tests, Makai is a biochemist.
- From “If Makai can solve complex problems, then he will pursue innovative research and study brain function,” and given he can solve complex problems, Makai studies brain function and pursues innovative research.
- From “If Makai is a biochemist, then he either modulates adenosine receptors or studies brain function, but not both,” and since he studies brain function, he does not modulate adenosine receptors.

There is no stated link between either “modulates adenosine receptors” or “studies brain function” and “can regulate sleep patterns.” Therefore, whether Makai can regulate sleep patterns cannot be determined from the given premises.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
