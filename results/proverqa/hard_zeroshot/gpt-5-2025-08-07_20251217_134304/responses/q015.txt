Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Marlowe does not have a PhD.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Marlowe works hard" and "Anyone who sets high goals or works hard is ambitious," we get Ambitious(Marlowe).
- Given "(Ambitious(M) ∧ PursuesAltCred(M)) → EarnRecognition(M)" and "Marlowe does not earn recognition," it follows that PursuesAltCred(Marlowe) is false.
- From "If Marlowe does not have a PhD, then he will pursue alternate credentials," the contrapositive yields: If not PursuesAltCred(M), then Marlowe has a PhD.
- Therefore, Marlowe has a PhD, so "Marlowe does not have a PhD" is false.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
