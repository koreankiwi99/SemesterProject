Context:
If Selah has thecodont teeth, then she is a formidable predator. Selah has a serpent body. If Selah has wings and a serpent body, then she can rule the ocean. If Selah rules the ocean, then she either has sharp claws or thecodont teeth, but not both. For Selah, if she respects nature, then she does not necessarily possess ancient magic, and if she possesses ancient magic, then she does not necessarily respect nature. Selah has a powerful tail. Selah respects nature. Emelia respects nature. Kelly has a serpent body. Kali maintains ecological balance. Selah maintains ecological balance. Any mythical creature that protects the environment is a mythical guardian. If Emelia is a mythical guardian, then she either has sharp claws or a powerful tail, but not both. If Selah maintains ecological balance, then she either is a mythical guardian or possesses ancient magic (or both). Selah has wings. If Selah is a mythical guardian, then she either has sharp claws or a powerful tail, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Selah is not a formidable predator.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Selah has wings and a serpent body, so she rules the ocean.
- Ruling the ocean implies exactly one of: sharp claws or thecodont teeth.
- If she has thecodont teeth, then she is a formidable predator.
- She has a powerful tail. If she is a mythical guardian, then she cannot also have sharp claws (guardian ⇒ claws XOR tail). Given she has a tail, this would force “no claws,” hence (from ruling-ocean XOR) she must have thecodont teeth, making her a formidable predator.
- From maintaining ecological balance, we know only that she is a mythical guardian or has ancient magic (or both). This does not force that she is a mythical guardian.
- Therefore two consistent possibilities remain: she is a guardian (then formidable), or she is not a guardian and could have sharp claws instead of teeth (then not necessarily formidable).

Hence we cannot determine that she is not a formidable predator.
