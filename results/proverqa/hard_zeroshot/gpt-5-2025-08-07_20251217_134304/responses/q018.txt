Question ID: 18
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
For all frogs, they either hunt at night or need high humidity, but not necessarily both. Every frog either survives in water or has adapted to its environment. If Cairo lives in a rainforest, then he either has adapted to his environment or thrives in his ecosystem, but not both. Cairo basks in sunlight. Any frog that needs high humidity or lives among plants can live in a rainforest. Cairo either basks in sunlight or survives in water, but not both. Cairo rests during the day. Every frog either rests during the day or hunts at night, but not necessarily both. Cairo does not live among plants. If Cairo either breathes moist air or has permeable skin (but not both), then he needs high humidity.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cairo thrives in his ecosystem.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Cairo basks in sunlight” and “Cairo either basks in sunlight or survives in water, but not both,” we get that Cairo does not survive in water.
- If Cairo is a frog, then from “Every frog either survives in water or has adapted,” and since he does not survive in water, Cairo has adapted.
- If Cairo lives in a rainforest, then he either has adapted or thrives, but not both. Since he has adapted, if he lives in a rainforest he does not thrive.
- Does Cairo live in a rainforest? For frogs, “needs high humidity or lives among plants → can live in a rainforest.” Cairo does not live among plants, and we cannot deduce that he needs high humidity (we only know “hunts at night or needs high humidity,” and nothing rules out hunting; the moist-air/permeable-skin condition is unknown). Therefore, living in a rainforest is not entailed.
- Hence two consistent possibilities remain: (a) he lives in a rainforest, in which case he does not thrive; (b) he does not live in a rainforest, in which case nothing fixes whether he thrives.

Therefore, whether Cairo thrives in his ecosystem is not determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
