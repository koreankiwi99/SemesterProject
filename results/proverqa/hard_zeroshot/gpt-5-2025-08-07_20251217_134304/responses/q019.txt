Question ID: 19
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Anyone who explores the world either seeks wisdom or pursues knowledge (or both). Stone does not understand the world. If someone values serenity and finds inner peace, then they can live in harmony. If Stone pursues knowledge, then he understands the world. Stone is spiritual or adventurous (or both). Stone either conserves resources or advances technology, but not both. Stone does not appreciate beauty. If Stone practices mindfulness, then he either seeks balance or values serenity, but not both. Stone seeks balance or lives in harmony. Everyone who respects the environment either conserves resources or protects wildlife (or both). For Stone, valuing serenity and pursuing knowledge are mutually exclusive. Anyone who loves nature and is spiritual can find inner peace. Everyone who either lives in harmony or appreciates beauty is someone who respects their environment. Stone loves nature. Stone does not protect wildlife. Stone advances technology.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Stone is not adventurous.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Stone advances technology” and “Stone either conserves resources or advances technology, but not both,” we get not conserves resources.
- Given “Stone does not protect wildlife” and “If respects environment then conserves resources or protects wildlife,” we infer Stone does not respect the environment.
- From “If lives in harmony or appreciates beauty then respects environment,” with not respecting environment and “Stone does not appreciate beauty,” we deduce Stone does not live in harmony.
- From “Stone seeks balance or lives in harmony,” we get Stone seeks balance.
- From “If Stone pursues knowledge then he understands the world” and “Stone does not understand the world,” we get Stone does not pursue knowledge.
- From “Stone is spiritual or adventurous (or both),” at least one of spiritual or adventurous holds.
- If Stone is spiritual, then with “Stone loves nature,” he finds inner peace, which (together with not living in harmony) forces not valuing serenity; adventurousness remains unconstrained and can be false.
- If Stone is not spiritual, then by “spiritual or adventurous,” he must be adventurous.

Thus there are consistent scenarios where Stone is adventurous and where he is not. The truth of “Stone is not adventurous” cannot be determined.
