Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Adeline is intelligent.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Adeline does not shape opinions (¬O). From Influence → Shapes (F → O), we get ¬F. From Recognition → Influence (R → F), we get ¬R. From Success → Recognition (S → R), we get ¬S.
- Given Success or Expertise (S ∨ E) and ¬S, we conclude E (has expertise).
- Adeline sets goals (G), and Goals → Works hard (G → W), so W.
- Dedicated → (Expertise XOR Works hard), which entails Dedicated → ¬(E ∧ W). Since E and W are both true, by modus tollens we get ¬D (not dedicated).
- Intelligent or Dedicated (I ∨ D) with ¬D implies I (intelligent).

Therefore, Adeline is intelligent.
