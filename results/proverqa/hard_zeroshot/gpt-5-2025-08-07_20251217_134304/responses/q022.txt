Question ID: 22
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Micah either follows his instincts or thinks critically, but not both. Micah survives harsh conditions. Micah values independence. Micah either has formal education or experiences frontier life, but not both. If Micah survives harsh conditions, then he is either able to adapt quickly or think critically (but not both). Micah is resourceful. If Micah learns from experience or adapts quickly, then he is self-taught. Micah does not learn from experience. If Micah values independence, then he lives off the grid and is resourceful. Micah follows his instincts. If Micah lives off the grid, then he either has formal education or is self-taught, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Micah grew up in the wilderness or experienced frontier life (or both), then he developed survival skills.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "values independence" -> "lives off the grid" and given he values independence, Micah lives off the grid.
- From "follows his instincts" and the XOR with "thinks critically," Micah does not think critically.
- From "survives harsh conditions" -> (adapts quickly XOR thinks critically), and since he does not think critically, he adapts quickly.
- From (learns from experience OR adapts quickly) -> self-taught, and he does not learn from experience but does adapt quickly, so he is self-taught.
- From "lives off the grid" -> (formal education XOR self-taught), and being self-taught implies not formally educated.
- From (formal education XOR frontier life), not formally educated implies he experienced frontier life.

Thus, the antecedent (grew up in the wilderness OR experienced frontier life) is true because he experienced frontier life. However, the statement’s consequent ("developed survival skills") is not defined or entailed by any given predicate (e.g., resourceful, adapts quickly, survives harsh conditions), and no rule links these to "developed survival skills." Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of the consequent, and hence the implication’s truth value is undetermined.
