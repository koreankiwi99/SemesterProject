Question ID: 24
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Everyone who expresses themselves emotionally through their craft either performs publicly or composes original pieces (or both). If Noelle is musically gifted, then she will compose original pieces. For all humans, if someone is a piano prodigy, then they either read music fluently or improvise easily (or both). Noelle either composes original pieces or improvises easily, but not necessarily both. Noelle has perfect pitch. If Noelle appreciates harmony, then she is musically gifted. If Noelle has perfect pitch, then she either plays by ear or is classically trained, but not both. Those who create beautiful music are musically gifted. Jaime either plays by ear or is a piano prodigy, but not both. If Aisha is musically gifted, then she will compose original pieces. If Aisha has perfect pitch, then she either plays by ear or is classically trained, but not both. Noelle can play by ear if she learns music quickly. Aisha has perfect pitch. Noelle is classically trained. Noelle creates beautiful music. Noelle either plays by ear or is a piano prodigy, but not both. Valentina either composes original pieces or improvises easily, but not necessarily both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Noelle does not read music fluently.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Noelle’s perfect pitch and “PP -> (plays by ear XOR classically trained)” plus “Noelle is classically trained,” we infer she does not play by ear.
- From “Noelle (plays by ear XOR is a piano prodigy),” not playing by ear implies Noelle is a piano prodigy.
- From “piano prodigy -> (reads music fluently OR improvises easily),” Noelle must either read music fluently or improvise easily (or both).
- From “creates beautiful music -> musically gifted” and “musically gifted -> composes,” Noelle composes original pieces, which does not constrain whether she reads music or improvises.
- There is no rule linking classically trained to reading music fluently, nor any rule excluding reading music fluently.

Thus, whether Noelle reads music fluently cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
