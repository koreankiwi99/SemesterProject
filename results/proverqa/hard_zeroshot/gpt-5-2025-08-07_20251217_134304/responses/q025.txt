Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Ramon sets high goals (H). From "Everyone who sets high goals either dedicates time or practices often" and "Ramon does not dedicate time," we infer Ramon practices often (P).
- Ramon thinks critically, so he has a strategic mind (SM).
- With SM, "either win major tournaments or become a legend, but not both" holds: exactly one of W or L is true.
- We know "Ramon analyzes games or studies opponents" (A_g ∨ S_o). Also, P is true. If S_o is true, then S_o ∧ P -> W, which forces W true and thus L false.
- However, the premises do not force S_o to be true; S_o could be false and A_g true, in which case W is not entailed, and SM allows L to be true instead.

Therefore, whether Ramon becomes a legend is not determined by the premises.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:

Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
