==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We know:
- Mina has low self-esteem, and by XOR she does not feel confident.
- We deduced several attributes (values comfort, good style, not dresses well, etc.), but none relate to feeling beautiful.

There is no premise linking low self-esteem, confidence, fashionableness, or style to whether Mina feels beautiful. Since “feels beautiful” is never mentioned nor entailed by any rule, we cannot determine its truth value.

ANSWER: Uncertain
