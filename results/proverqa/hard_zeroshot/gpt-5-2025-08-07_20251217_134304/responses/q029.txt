Context:
Maxine collaborates with peers or publishes research (or both). Iris values learning or is passionate about research. Iris does not publish research. Iris collaborates with peers or publishes research (or both). Iris does not seek self-improvement. If Iris is passionate about research, then she shares knowledge with others and collaborates with peers. If Daisy is passionate about research, then she shares knowledge with others and collaborates with peers. Iris studies Earth's geological processes. If Iris studies Earth's geological processes, then she can either discover new minerals or contribute to scientific knowledge, but not both. If Iris either contributes to scientific knowledge or pursues academic degrees (but not both), then she advances human understanding. If Iris either solves complex problems or analyzes data (but not both), then she is passionate about research. Iris does not value personal growth. Iris either advances human understanding or shares knowledge with others, but not both. If Iris is curious, then she either advances human understanding or has practical skills (but not both). Iris pursues academic degrees. Flora does not seek self-improvement. If Iris either values learning or seeks self-improvement (but not both), then she values personal growth.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Iris discovers new minerals.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Iris does not seek self-improvement (¬SSI). From (VL ⊕ SSI) → VPG and ¬VPG, we get ¬VL. Given VL ∨ PaR, this forces PaR true.
- PaR → SK ∧ CP, so SK is true. Also, ¬Pub and (CP ∨ Pub) imply CP true (consistent).
- From AHU ⊕ SK and SK true, we get ¬AHU.
- EGP is true, so DN ⊕ CK. AD is true. If CK were false, then (CK ⊕ AD) would be true, implying AHU, contradicting ¬AHU. Hence CK is true, and by DN ⊕ CK, DN is false.

Therefore, Iris does not discover new minerals.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
