Question ID: 30
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Raelynn prioritizes stability. Raelynn does not take risks. Raelynn is curious. If someone either pushes boundaries or works with traditional techniques (but not both), then they are innovative. If Raelynn is innovative or takes risks, then she will achieve success. If Raelynn has a creative vision, then she will either achieve success or build a strong network, but not both. If Raelynn is curious, then she either thinks outside the box or pushes boundaries, but not both. If Major experiments with materials, then she creates innovative products. Raelynn does not think outside the box. Raelynn either experiments with materials or works with traditional techniques, but not both. Major does not take risks. Raelynn either prioritizes stability or can achieve success, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Raelynn creates innovative products.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Raelynn either prioritizes stability or can achieve success, but not both” and “Raelynn prioritizes stability,” we get Raelynn does not achieve success.
- From “If Raelynn is innovative or takes risks, then she will achieve success” and the above, Raelynn is neither innovative nor a risk-taker.
- From “If Raelynn is curious, then she either thinks outside the box or pushes boundaries, but not both” and “Raelynn does not think outside the box,” we get Raelynn pushes boundaries.
- The rule “If someone either pushes boundaries or works with traditional techniques (but not both), then they are innovative” together with Raelynn not being innovative implies it is not an exclusive-or; since she pushes boundaries, she must also work with traditional techniques.
- From “Raelynn either experiments with materials or works with traditional techniques, but not both” and her working with traditional techniques, she does not experiment with materials.

There is no rule connecting Raelynn’s attributes to “creates innovative products.” The only such rule given applies specifically to Major. Thus, we cannot determine whether Raelynn creates innovative products.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
