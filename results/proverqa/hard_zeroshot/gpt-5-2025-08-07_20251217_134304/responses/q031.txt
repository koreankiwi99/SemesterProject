Context:
Frankie does not rest in his burrow. If an armadillo thrives in groups, then it is a social animal. Every armadillo that has unique friends either explores in groups or roams alone (or both). Any armadillo that lacks pack mates or wanders freely can roam alone. If Frankie lives in the desert, then he forms symbiotic relationships with other creatures and has protective instincts. If Frankie either travels with others or forages with family (but not both), then he tends to explore in groups. If Frankie lives in a colony, then he is either a social animal or forms symbiotic relationships with other creatures, but not both. If Frankie is searching for food, he does not necessarily have protective instincts, and vice versa. Armadillos that explore in groups value companionship. If Frankie prefers to spend nights alone and enjoys quiet spaces, then he sleeps soundly. Frankie either has unique friends or prefers to spend nights alone, but not both. Frankie does not value companionship. Any armadillo that coexists with insects or has an adaptive shell can form symbiotic relationships. All armadillos that find shaded areas stay hydrated and sleep soundly. Frankie lives in a colony. All curious armadillos dig complex burrows and have protective instincts. Frankie is searching for food. If Frankie rests in his burrow or sleeps soundly, then he will stay healthy. Frankie does not stay healthy. If Frankie roams alone, then he is not a social animal, and if Frankie is a social animal, then he does not necessarily roam alone. Frankie enjoys quiet spaces.
