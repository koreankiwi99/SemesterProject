Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Andy is not respected.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Andy is an experienced gamer and a strategic thinker; given the XOR rule for experienced gamers, he is not a dedicated leader.
- Andy thinks critically, so he adapts to changes. He does not master new skills. By the XOR rule (masters vs. adapts), he is a quick learner.
- He is also a team player and an active participant.

No statements or rules link any of these properties to being respected or not respected, and there is no explicit mention of Andy being respected or not respected. Therefore, the truth of “Andy is not respected” cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
