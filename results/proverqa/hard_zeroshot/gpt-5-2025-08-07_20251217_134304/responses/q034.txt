==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “either prioritizes tasks or handles multiple projects” and “does not handle multiple projects,” Chana prioritizes tasks.
- From “either works under pressure or is organized, but not both” and “does not work under pressure,” Chana is organized.
- Organized → manages time; with prioritizing tasks → meets deadlines → has a strong work ethic.
- Chana is a key team member, and “key team member → (excellent troubleshooter XOR highly motivated).” Given “not highly motivated,” Chana is an excellent troubleshooter.
- Excellent troubleshooters are respected experts and have a strong work ethic (consistent with above).

None of the premises mention in-depth data analysis abilities or connect them to any derived traits. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Chana lacks such abilities.

ANSWER: Uncertain
