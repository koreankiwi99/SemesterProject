If Dean either mentors students or inspires others (but not both), then he makes an impact. If Dean contributes to society, then he either receives awards or gains recognition (but not both). Dean either has expertise or works hard. Dean gains recognition. Dean does not publish research. Anyone who publishes research or is a respected scientist can inspire others. Dean does not work hard. If Dean is a passionate conservationist, then he is both an active volunteer and public speaker.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dean is not an expert ornithologist.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From contributes to society and gains recognition, and the rule C -> (A XOR G), Dean does not receive awards (A is false). Hence, from D ∨ A, Dean holds degrees (D true).
- From E ∨ H and not H, Dean has expertise (E true). From (I ∧ E) -> A and A false, I must be false (no impact).
- From (M ⊕ S) -> I with I false, ¬(M ⊕ S). Given M is false, this implies S is false (no inspiration).
- From (P ∨ RS) -> S and S false, we get ¬P and ¬RS (not respected scientist).
- From (EO ⊕ PC) -> RS and RS false, ¬(EO ⊕ PC) (EO and PC have the same truth value).
- From PC -> (V ∧ PS) and not V, by contrapositive PC is false. With ¬(EO ⊕ PC) and PC false, EO must also be false.

Therefore, Dean is not an expert ornithologist.
