Question ID: 36
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Murphy either writes efficient code or designs intuitive interfaces (but not both), then he is a good software developer. Murphy reads technical books. If Murphy is passionate about coding, then he is a good software developer and enjoys problem solving. Anyone who reads technical books and participates in hackathons is dedicated to learning. If Murphy is dedicated to learning, then he will build innovative products. Murphy joins online forums. For Murphy, either networking with peers or attending tech conferences (but not both) are ways to advance in his career. Murphy networks with his peers. Murphy enjoys problem solving. If Murphy builds innovative products, then he either values user feedback or is passionate about coding (or both). If Murphy either attends tech conferences or joins online forums (but not both), then he participates in hackathons. Murphy either codes regularly or attends tech conferences. Murphy does not value user feedback. If Murphy engages in self-study, then he either participates in hackathons or contributes to open source projects (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Murphy creates fast software.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “either networking with peers or attending tech conferences (but not both)” and “Murphy networks with his peers,” we infer he does not attend tech conferences.
- He joins online forums; with not attending conferences, the XOR condition (attend conferences or join forums, but not both) holds, so he participates in hackathons.
- He reads technical books and participates in hackathons, so he is dedicated to learning; thus he builds innovative products.
- Building innovative products implies valuing user feedback or being passionate about coding; since he does not value user feedback, he is passionate about coding, hence a good software developer and enjoys problem solving (consistent with the given).

None of the premises relate “creates fast software” to any stated property (such as writing efficient code). There is no information allowing us to conclude it is true or false.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
