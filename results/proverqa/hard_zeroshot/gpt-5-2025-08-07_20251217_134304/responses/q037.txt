Question ID: 37
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Buster does not respond to calls. All dogs that listen to commands and behave properly are well-trained. Buster is either obedient or playful, but not necessarily both. Buster follows routines. Buster is either playful or loving (or both). If Buster either responds to calls or follows routines (but not both), then he listens to commands. All well-trained dogs are obedient and have good manners. Buster behaves properly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Buster is loving.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- R is false (does not respond). F is true (follows routines). Since exactly one of R, F is true, the XOR condition holds, so L is true (listens to commands).
- With L true and BP true (behaves properly), (L ∧ BP) → WT gives WT true (well-trained).
- From WT → (O ∧ GM), O is true (obedient).
- From “either obedient or playful (not necessarily both)”, O ∨ P is satisfied by O; this does not force P.
- From “either playful or loving (or both)”, P ∨ Lo must hold. Since P is unconstrained (could be true or false), Lo is not determined: if P is false, Lo must be true; if P is true, Lo may be either.

Therefore, whether Buster is loving cannot be deduced.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
