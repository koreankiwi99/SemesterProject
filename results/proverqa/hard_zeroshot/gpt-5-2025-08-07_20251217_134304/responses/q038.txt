Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Schmoopy either sniffs out clues or follows trails (but not both), then she is able to discover hidden passages. Schmoopy does not find hidden food. If Schmoopy loves climbing and enjoys solving puzzles, then she is adventurous. Schmoopy does not fit in tight spaces. If Schmoopy has keen senses, then she either navigates mazes or digs burrows (but not both). If Schmoopy is adventurous, then she can either discover hidden passages or find hidden food, but not both. If Schmoopy has a small size, then she either lives in a mansion or fits in tight spaces (or both). If Schmoopy either navigates mazes or jumps obstacles (but not both), then she loves climbing. Schmoopy either enjoys shadows or fears darkness. Schmoopy does not jump obstacles. Schmoopy has a small size. Schmoopy is either curious or fearful of darkness, but not both. If Schmoopy lives in a mansion, then she either navigates mazes or runs quickly, but not both. If Schmoopy is nocturnal, then she is either fearful of darkness or has good vision, but not both. Schmoopy does not enjoy shadows. Schmoopy enjoys solving puzzles. Schmoopy does not run quickly. For any mouse, if it explores new areas and tries new things, then it is adventurous.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Schmoopy does not explore hidden rooms.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From small size (SS) and not fitting in tight spaces (~FTS), the rule SS -> (LIM ∨ FTS) gives LIM (lives in a mansion).
- From LIM and not running quickly (~RQ), with LIM -> (NM XOR RQ), we get NM (navigates mazes).
- From NM and not jumping obstacles (~JO), with (NM XOR JO) -> LC, we get LC (loves climbing).
- With LC and enjoys solving puzzles (ESP), LC ∧ ESP -> ADV gives ADV (adventurous).
- From ADV and not finding hidden food (~FHF), with ADV -> (DHP XOR FHF), we get DHP (can discover hidden passages).

There is no premise connecting “explore hidden rooms” to any of the derived properties (including discovering hidden passages). Therefore, the truth of “Schmoopy does not explore hidden rooms” cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
