Question ID: 39
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If someone follows clues and reveals evidence, then they can solve cases. If Esther either studies witness statements or analyzes forensic data, then she will crack the case. Esther does not crack the case. Norah either examines crime scenes or gathers evidence (or both). Esther either examines crime scenes or gathers evidence (or both). Esther does not solve cases. If Esther searches for clues or looks for patterns, then she will examine crime scenes. If Dax investigates carefully, then she will reveal evidence. Esther does not study witness statements. If Norah investigates carefully, then she will uncover the truth. If Esther investigates carefully, then she will reveal evidence. Esther reads reports or analyzes forensic data. If Esther either examines crime scenes or analyzes forensic data (but not both), then she follows clues. Esther does not gather evidence.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Esther did not uncover the truth.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From (SW ∨ AFD) -> CC and ¬CC, we get ¬(SW ∨ AFD), hence ¬SW and ¬AFD. With RR ∨ AFD, this implies RR.
- From EC ∨ GE and ¬GE, we get EC.
- From (EC xor AFD) -> FC and (EC true, AFD false), we get FC.
- From (FC ∧ RE) -> SC, with FC true and ¬SC, we get ¬RE.
- From IC -> RE and ¬RE, we get ¬IC.

There is no rule linking Esther’s actions to “uncovering the truth.” The only “uncover the truth” rule pertains to Norah (Norah IC -> UT). Thus we cannot determine whether Esther uncovered the truth.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
