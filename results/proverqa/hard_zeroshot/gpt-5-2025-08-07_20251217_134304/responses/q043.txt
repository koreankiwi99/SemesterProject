Question ID: 43
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Spencer achieves success or takes risks, then he will gain recognition. If someone is dedicated to their work and develops skills, then they can be an excellent craftsman. Anyone who practices self-care or manages emotions can maintain focus. If Spencer craves recognition, then he strives for perfection and innovates recipes. Spencer does not value excellence. Anyone who handles stress prioritizes tasks or manages emotions (or both). Anyone who is self-aware or has good habits can manage their emotions. Spencer does not practice self-care. Spencer values excellence or is an excellent craftsman. If Spencer is an excellent craftsman, then he either sets high standards or strives for perfection, but not both. Spencer cannot maintain focus. Anyone who sets high standards or pays attention to details can achieve success. Spencer either handles stress or works under pressure. Spencer does not prioritize tasks. Spencer does not take risks. Spencer is either passionate about cooking or works under pressure, but these two traits do not necessarily coexist. Spencer does not gain recognition.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Spencer demands quality and strives for perfection.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Anyone who practices self-care or manages emotions can maintain focus” and “Spencer cannot maintain focus,” we get that Spencer neither practices self-care nor manages emotions.
- From “Anyone who handles stress prioritizes tasks or manages emotions” plus Spencer not prioritizing tasks and not managing emotions, Spencer does not handle stress. Given “Spencer either handles stress or works under pressure,” he must work under pressure.
- From “If Spencer achieves success or takes risks, then he will gain recognition” and “Spencer does not gain recognition,” we infer Spencer neither achieves success nor takes risks.
- From “Anyone who sets high standards or pays attention to details can achieve success” and Spencer does not achieve success, we conclude Spencer neither sets high standards nor pays attention to details.
- From “Spencer does not value excellence” and “Spencer values excellence or is an excellent craftsman,” Spencer is an excellent craftsman.
- From “If Spencer is an excellent craftsman, then he either sets high standards or strives for perfection, but not both,” and Spencer does not set high standards, it follows that Spencer strives for perfection.

Thus, Spencer strives for perfection but does not set high standards (i.e., does not demand quality). The conjunction “demands quality and strives for perfection” is therefore false.

ANSWER: False
