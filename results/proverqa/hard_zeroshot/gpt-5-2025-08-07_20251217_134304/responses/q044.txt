==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From the rules: Genevieve faces setbacks. If one faces setbacks, then they act on impulse or find new solutions. Also, if someone is able to overcome challenges, it’s because they either seek community help or find new solutions. But Genevieve is unable to overcome challenges and does not seek community help, so she does not find new solutions. Hence, given the earlier implication, she acts on impulse.
- She anticipates problems, so she has backup plans. She does not make safe investments, and given the exclusive-or condition (safe investments xor backup plans) implies avoids risks. By another exclusive-or, that means she is not resilient in adversity.
- She is a creative problem solver, which implies strong work ethic and successful business owner.
- None of the provided facts or rules mention baking or passion for baking, nor do they imply its negation.

Therefore, whether Genevieve is passionate about baking cannot be determined from the given information.
