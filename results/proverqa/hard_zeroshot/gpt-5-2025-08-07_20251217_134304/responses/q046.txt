Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Memphis values independence and embraces spontaneity. If he had a free spirit, he would have exactly one of these, so he cannot have a free spirit.
- If having many homes XOR traveling frequently implies a free spirit, then not having a free spirit implies not (many homes XOR traveling frequently) — so either both are true or both are false.
- If Memphis had many homes, he would be adventurous and thus take risks, contradicting that he does not take risks. Therefore, he does not have many homes. Hence, traveling frequently is also false.
- Since Memphis is either a settled artist or travels frequently, and he does not travel frequently, he must be a settled artist.
- Memphis is either a nomadic artist or a settled artist, but not both. Since he is settled, he is not a nomadic artist.
