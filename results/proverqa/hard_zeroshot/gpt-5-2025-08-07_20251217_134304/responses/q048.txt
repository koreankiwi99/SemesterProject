Context:
If Orlando either reads widely or pursues knowledge (but not both), then he makes new connections. Orlando pursues knowledge or conducts meaningful research. Orlando does not advance industries. Everyone learns from others or pursues knowledge. Orlando develops new technologies. If Orlando works in a team, then he is either collaborative or follows instructions (but not both). Orlando does not achieve success. Orlando does not have an open mind. If Orlando is collaborative or has an open mind, then he can achieve success. Anyone who makes breakthrough discoveries either gains recognition or advances industries (or both). If Orlando makes new connections, then he is collaborative and thinks creatively. Orlando does not read widely. Orlando does not gain recognition. Anyone who conducts meaningful research or develops new technologies can improve people's lives. If someone sets clear goals and works with focus, then they can conduct meaningful research.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Orlando is an innovative scientist.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If Orlando is collaborative or has an open mind, then he can achieve success” and “Orlando does not achieve success,” we infer (by contrapositive) that Orlando is not collaborative and does not have an open mind.
- From “If Orlando makes new connections, then he is collaborative,” and the above, we infer Orlando does not make new connections.
- From “If Orlando either reads widely or pursues knowledge (but not both), then he makes new connections” and the fact he does not make new connections, we get that it is not the case that exactly one of reading widely and pursuing knowledge holds. Given he does not read widely, it follows he also does not pursue knowledge.
- From “Orlando pursues knowledge or conducts meaningful research,” we deduce he conducts meaningful research.
- It is given that Orlando develops new technologies. Hence he conducts meaningful research and develops new technologies, and thus can improve people’s lives.
- From “Anyone who makes breakthrough discoveries either gains recognition or advances industries,” together with “Orlando does not gain recognition” and “Orlando does not advance industries,” we infer he does not make breakthrough discoveries.

Nothing in the premises defines or entails the predicate “innovative scientist,” nor does anything contradict it outright. While Orlando does meaningful research and develops new technologies, the term “innovative scientist” is not formally specified and cannot be logically concluded.
