Question ID: 51
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Makenzie either maps landforms or explores wilderness (but not both), then she seeks adventure. Makenzie cannot uncover secrets. Makenzie does not further her understanding. Makenzie does not contribute to science. Makenzie either explores wilderness or analyzes rocks, but not both. If Makenzie either collects fossil samples or advances knowledge (but not both), then she contributes to science. Anyone who loves nature and enjoys fieldwork can study geology. Anyone who charts new terrain or maps landforms can uncover secrets. If someone either collects fossil samples or analyzes rocks (but not both), then they further understanding. Makenzie does not chart new terrain. Makenzie does not seek adventure. Makenzie enjoys fieldwork. Makenzie loves nature.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Makenzie studies geology, then she can either make groundbreaking discoveries or inspire scientists, but not both.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Makenzie enjoys fieldwork" and "Makenzie loves nature," we get that she can study geology (can, not does).
- From "Makenzie cannot uncover secrets" and "Anyone who charts new terrain or maps landforms can uncover secrets," we infer she neither charts new terrain nor maps landforms.
- Then "(maps landforms XOR explores wilderness) -> seeks adventure" with "not maps" and "not seeks" implies she does not explore wilderness.
- From "explores wilderness XOR analyzes rocks," we deduce she analyzes rocks.
- From "(collects fossil samples XOR analyzes rocks) -> further understanding" and "not further understanding," we infer she collects fossil samples.
- From "(collects fossil samples XOR advances knowledge) -> contributes to science" and "not contributes to science," we infer she advances knowledge.
- None of the premises mention making groundbreaking discoveries or inspiring scientists, nor do they entail that she studies geology (only that she can).

Conclusion:
- We cannot determine whether Makenzie studies geology.
- Even if she did, there is no information about making groundbreaking discoveries or inspiring scientists.
- Therefore, the truth of the conditional "If Makenzie studies geology, then she can either make groundbreaking discoveries or inspire scientists, but not both" cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain
