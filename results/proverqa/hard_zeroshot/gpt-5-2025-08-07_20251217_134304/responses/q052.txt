Norah is either a novice adventurer or an experienced climber, but not both. Norah does not explore remote areas. If Norah is a thrill seeker, then she leads private expeditions. If someone either explores remote areas or attempts record breaks (but not both), then they are a thrill seeker.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Norah is not an inexperienced climber.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Norah attempts record breaks (RB) and does not explore remote areas (¬ER). So exactly one of {ER, RB} holds.
- By the rule: if someone either explores remote areas or attempts record breaks (but not both), then they are a thrill seeker → Norah is a thrill seeker (TS).
- If Norah is a thrill seeker, then she leads private expeditions (L). Hence L is true.
- From L XOR professional guide (PG), PG is false.
- From PG XOR novice adventurer (NA), NA is true.
- From NA XOR experienced climber (EC), EC is false.
- From EC XOR inexperienced climber (IC), IC is true.

Therefore, Norah is an inexperienced climber, so the statement “Norah is not an inexperienced climber” is false.

ANSWER: False
