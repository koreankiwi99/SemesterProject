Question ID: 53
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Ares is a champion. If Ares has noble bloodlines, then he either has an attractive appearance or excellent jumping skills (or both). If Ares is confident, then he either performs well in competitions or builds strong bonds with Rachel, but not both. If a horse has noble bloodlines, it is not necessarily confident, and if a horse is confident, it does not necessarily have noble bloodlines. Ares either has speed or agility, but not both. If Ares either has a shiny coat or a flowing mane (but not both), then he has an attractive appearance. Ares has a good temper. Ares does not have excellent jumping skills. If Ares is a champion, then he either has an attractive appearance or has speed (but not both). Ares responds to commands. If Ares builds strong bonds with Rachel, then he either has a good temper or responds to commands, but not both. Ares does not have agility.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ares performs well in competitions.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From not agility and (speed XOR agility), Ares has speed.
- From champion and (attractive appearance XOR speed), since speed is true, attractive appearance is false.
- From (noble bloodlines -> attractive appearance or jumping) and both attractive appearance and jumping are false, noble bloodlines must be false.
- From good temper and responds to commands, and (builds bonds -> good temper XOR responds), builds strong bonds must be false.
- From (confident -> performs well XOR builds bonds) and builds bonds false, if confident then performs well. But we have no information that Ares is confident.

Thus, whether Ares performs well in competitions cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
