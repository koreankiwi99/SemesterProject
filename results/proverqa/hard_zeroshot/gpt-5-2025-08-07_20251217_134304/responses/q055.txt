Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Wyatt's relationship is not spontaneous.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Wyatt values loneliness and, by XOR with building lasting connections, he does not build lasting connections.
- Wyatt does not follow a routine, so by XOR he is open-minded.
- Wyatt does not appreciate moments; by XOR with trying new things, he tries new things.
- Wyatt travels frequently; by XOR between trying new things and exploring new places, he does not explore new places.
- If Wyatt achieved success, he would have to pursue his passion or build lasting connections; since he does neither, he did not achieve success. From “takes risks → achieves success,” he does not take risks.

No statements define or relate “spontaneous” (or “relationship spontaneity”) to any of the given predicates. Therefore, the truth of “Wyatt’s relationship is not spontaneous” cannot be determined from the provided information.
