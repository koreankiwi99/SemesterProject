Question ID: 58
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Marie pursues higher education. Marie builds consensus. If Marie promotes peace, then she will either face resistance or inspire others, but not both. Anyone who leads by example either inspires others or empowers the youth. Marie takes a risk. If Marie takes a risk, then she will either spark controversy or promote peace, but not both. For anyone, sparking controversy and building consensus are mutually exclusive. Marie either empowers the youth or pursues higher education, but not both. Marie works independently. Marie challenges the status quo. If Marie either challenges the status quo or fosters community (but not both), then she leads by example. Marie either works independently or fosters community, but not both. If someone believes in non-violence and engages in dialogue, then they promote peace.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Marie faces resistance.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Marie either empowers the youth or pursues higher education, but not both" and "Marie pursues higher education," we get E is false.
- From "Marie either works independently or fosters community, but not both" and "Marie works independently," we get F is false.
- Since "Marie challenges the status quo" and XOR(challenges, fosters) holds, she "leads by example."
- Leading by example implies "inspires others or empowers the youth"; with E false, "inspires others" (I) is true.
- "Marie takes a risk" implies exactly one of "sparks controversy" (S) or "promotes peace" (P). But "sparking controversy and building consensus are mutually exclusive," and she builds consensus, so S is false; hence P is true.
- If she promotes peace, then exactly one of "faces resistance" (R) or "inspires others" (I) is true. Since I is true, R must be false.

ANSWER: False

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
