Question ID: 61
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Goldie is artistic, then she either writes stories or creates poetry (or both). Anyone who draws well or has good taste is artistic. Goldie is a charismatic performer. If someone is inspiring, then they either have a good imagination or have creativity (but both is allowed in the input logic expression). For all people, if someone is a charismatic performer, then they either have creativity or have irrepressible energy (or both). Goldie has good taste. For a person, being a good communicator and expressing themselves effectively can make them inspiring. Goldie does not create poetry. If someone either writes stories or composes music (but not both), then they have a good imagination. Goldie is passionate. Goldie does not compose music. If someone is passionate, then they are inspiring and think outside the box.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Goldie does not have irrepressible energy.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Goldie’s good taste, she is artistic. Since she is artistic and does not create poetry, she must write stories.
- She does not compose music. Given she writes stories XOR composes music implies good imagination, she has a good imagination.
- Goldie is passionate, so she is inspiring (and thinks outside the box). Inspiring implies she has either good imagination or creativity; this is satisfied by her good imagination, so creativity is not forced.
- Goldie is a charismatic performer, which implies she has creativity or irrepressible energy (or both). We cannot determine which, and nothing rules out irrepressible energy.

Therefore, whether Goldie lacks irrepressible energy cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
