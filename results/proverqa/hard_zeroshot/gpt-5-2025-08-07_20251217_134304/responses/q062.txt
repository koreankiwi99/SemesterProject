Context:
If Alice displays courage, then she earns respect and receives high honor. For all humans, if someone is a war hero, then they either receive high honor or inspire others (or both). Alice serves her country or is a war hero. Ila does not help others. Alice does not exemplify integrity. If Kaiden receives high honor, then she demonstrates bravery and shows selflessness. If Alice receives high honor, then she demonstrates bravery and shows selflessness. Alice does not help others. If Alice either shows selflessness or helps others (but not both), then she exemplifies integrity. If Alice shows courage or risks her life, then she is a war hero. Kaiden upholds justice. Ila does not exemplify integrity. All people who enlist in the military either serve their country or defend freedom. If Ila either shows selflessness or helps others (but not both), then she exemplifies integrity. Alice upholds justice. Anyone who follows orders or risks their own life serves their country. Alice enlists in the military. Anyone who risks their life either shows selflessness or earns recognition. If someone upholds justice, then they defend freedom.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Alice inspires others.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From ¬Helps(Alice) and the XOR rule “If Alice either shows selflessness or helps others (but not both), then she exemplifies integrity,” we get Selfless(Alice) -> Integrity(Alice). Given ¬Integrity(Alice), conclude ¬Selfless(Alice).
- From HighHonor(Alice) -> Selfless(Alice), conclude ¬HighHonor(Alice).
- From Courage(Alice) -> HighHonor(Alice), conclude ¬Courage(Alice).

- We have Serves(Alice) ∨ WarHero(Alice). It is not determined which holds.
- If WarHero(Alice), then (HighHonor ∨ Inspires); with ¬HighHonor, this would force Inspires(Alice).
- If ¬WarHero(Alice), no premise implies Inspires(Alice).

Both cases are consistent with the premises, so whether Alice inspires others cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
