==================================================
- Edith either is inspired or pursues her passions, and she does not pursue her passions, so she is inspired.
- Inspired implies either thinking outside the box (TOB) or valuing creativity (VC).
- If Edith performs well XOR achieves success, then she feels fulfilled. She does not feel fulfilled, so not(XOR). Since she does not perform well, she also does not achieve success.
- Edith takes risks. If someone takes risks and thinks outside the box, they achieve success. Since she does not achieve success and does take risks, she does not think outside the box.
- From being inspired and not TOB, Edith must value creativity.
