Question ID: 64
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Alden listens actively. Anyone who has influence or commands respect holds power. Alden possesses experience. Anyone who makes key decisions or influences others has authority. Alden faces consequences. Alden has strong opinions. Alden either listens actively or speaks persuasively, but not both. If someone has authority, then they hold power. Anyone who takes leadership or earns respect has authority. If Alden holds power, then he either upholds justice or faces consequences, but not both. Superman does not hold a high office. For anyone who possesses experience and has strong opinions, they can make key decisions.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Alden does not uphold justice.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We know:
- Alden faces consequences.
- If Alden holds power, then exactly one of (upholds justice, faces consequences) is true (exclusive or).
- If someone has authority, then they hold power.
- Anyone who makes key decisions or influences others has authority.
- Alden possesses experience and has strong opinions, which implies he can make key decisions.

The crucial step is whether “can make key decisions” entails “makes key decisions.” The given rule for authority requires actually making key decisions (or influencing others). From the information provided, we only know Alden can make key decisions, not that he does. Without establishing that Alden has authority (and thus holds power), we cannot trigger the exclusive-or condition about justice versus consequences.

Since Alden’s facing consequences alone does not imply he lacks power nor that he fails to uphold justice (unless we know he holds power), we cannot conclude that Alden does not uphold justice.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
