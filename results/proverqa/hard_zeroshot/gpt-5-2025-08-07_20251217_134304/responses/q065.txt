Question ID: 65
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Israel shares wisdom or inspires others. Israel makes sacrifices or leads by example. Israel has experience. For Israel, he either leads by example or seeks personal gain, but not both. Israel lives a long life. Israel serves others. If Israel lives a long life, then he can either leave a lasting legacy or pass on his knowledge to others, but not both. All humans who have experience and command respect hold power. Anyone who possesses wisdom and commands loyalty can hold power. If someone leads by example, then they leave a lasting legacy and inspire others. Anyone who shows bravery or upholds honor can inspire others. Israel does not uphold honor. If Israel holds power, then he either serves others or seeks personal gain, but not both. Israel shows bravery.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Israel passes on his knowledge to others.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Israel shows bravery” and “Anyone who shows bravery or upholds honor can inspire others,” Israel inspires others (I true).
- Israel lives a long life (LL true), and “If LL then either leave a lasting legacy or pass on knowledge, but not both” gives exactly one of A (legacy) or P (pass knowledge).
- If Israel leads by example (L), then by “L -> A and I,” A is true, so by the LL-exclusive-or, P is false.
- If Israel does not lead by example, then from “L xor seeks personal gain (G),” G is true. With LL’s exclusive-or, choosing P true and A false is consistent. This forces not L (by contrapositive of L -> A), and requires that Israel not hold power to satisfy “If HP then SO xor G,” but nothing given forces HP to be true.
- No provided rule lets us deduce that Israel must hold power (we lack “commands respect” or “commands loyalty” and “possesses wisdom” facts), so both scenarios (P true or P false) are consistent with all statements.

Therefore, whether Israel passes on his knowledge to others cannot be determined.
