==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Amirah is a food blogger and does not host cooking shows. From "If Amirah is a food blogger, then she either develops new recipes or hosts cooking shows, but not both," we get that she develops new recipes (DR).
- Amirah does not teach cooking classes. From "If Amirah either teaches cooking classes or develops new recipes (but not both), then she writes cookbooks," DR implies she writes cookbooks (WC).
- From "For Amirah, she either writes cookbooks or works as a chef, but not both," WC implies she does not work as a chef (not C).
- Amirah enjoys experimenting with food, so she is a talented cook (T).
- From "If Amirah is a talented cook, then she either works as a chef or runs her own restaurant, but not both," and not C, we get she runs her own restaurant (R).
- From "If Amirah runs her own restaurant and is a successful chef, then she receives food awards" and the fact that she does not receive food awards, we conclude she is not a successful chef (not SS).
- From "If Amirah is either passionate about cooking or skilled at cooking (but not both), then she is a successful chef" and not passionate, the antecedent becomes: if skilled (S) then successful chef (SS). Since not SS, it follows not S.

Therefore, Amirah is not skilled at cooking.
