Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Ayan renounces violence, then he desires forgiveness and seeks redemption. Koen either seeks redemption or fights oppression, but not both. Ayan is either capable of violence or has compassion, but not both. Brooks has power. Brooks has influence. For all people, if they have influence and fight oppression, then they uphold justice. For Ayan, either embracing peace is an option or seeking redemption is an option, but they can't coexist. Ayan has power. If Rosalie is either murderous or protective (but not both), then he is notorious. Koen is not protective. Ayan either seeks redemption or fights oppression, but not both. Koen is either capable of taking lives or has compassion, but not both. Ayan has influence. Ayan is embracing peace. If Ayan has power, then he is either capable of taking lives or upholds justice, but not both. If Ayan lacks empathy or has aggression, then he can be murderous. Ayan is either capable of taking lives or has compassion, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ayan is not notorious.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Ayan is embracing peace” and the exclusive-or with “seeking redemption,” Ayan is not seeking redemption.
- From the exclusive-or “Ayan either seeks redemption or fights oppression,” Ayan fights oppression.
- With Ayan’s influence and the universal rule (influence ∧ fights oppression → upholds justice), Ayan upholds justice.
- Given Ayan has power and the exclusive-or (capable of taking lives XOR upholds justice), Ayan is not capable of taking lives.
- From the exclusive-or (capable of taking lives XOR compassion), Ayan has compassion.

No rule connects these facts to Ayan’s notoriety; the only notoriety rule concerns Rosalie specifically. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Ayan is or isn’t notorious.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
