Question ID: 70
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Juan either plants trees or preserves ecosystems. If Tony works in forestry, then he either manages wildlife or harvests timber (or both). If Juan either splits wood or cuts firewood (but not both), then he harvests timber. If Nola preserves an ecosystem, then he either manages wildlife or maintains soil health, but not both. If Juan masters the bucksaw technique, then he either uses a chainsaw or harvests timber, but not both. Nola does not fell trees efficiently. For any person, either they conserve water or protect animal habitats, but not both, is not true, instead they can do both. Anyone who reduces their carbon footprint or conserves water can preserve an ecosystem. Juan works in forestry. Juan does not trim his shrubs. If Juan cuts wood and makes smooth cuts, then he uses a chainsaw. Nola does not trim his shrubs. Stinky works in forestry. Juan does not protect animal habitats. Stinky either uses a chainsaw or prunes plants, but not both. If Stinky is an experienced logger, then he either masters the bucksaw technique or fells trees efficiently (or both). Stinky does not reduce his carbon footprint. If Nola masters the bucksaw technique, then he either uses a chainsaw or harvests timber, but not both. Juan either uses a chainsaw or prunes plants, but not both. If Juan preserves an ecosystem, then he either manages wildlife or maintains soil health, but not both. Juan maintains soil health. Anyone who trims shrubs or prunes plants keeps their landscaping in order. If Juan works in forestry, then he either manages wildlife or harvests timber (or both). Juan does not fell trees efficiently. Juan does not reduce his carbon footprint. If Juan is an experienced logger, then he either masters the bucksaw technique or fells trees efficiently (or both). Tony does not protect animal habitats. Stinky maintains soil health. Juan does not keep his landscaping in order.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Juan is an experienced logger.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Anyone who trims shrubs or prunes plants keeps their landscaping in order” and “Juan does not keep his landscaping in order,” we get ¬(trims shrubs ∨ prunes plants). Given “Juan does not trim his shrubs,” this implies Juan does not prune plants.
- From “Juan either uses a chainsaw or prunes plants, but not both,” and ¬(prunes plants), we infer Juan uses a chainsaw.
- Case 1: Assume Juan preserves an ecosystem (PE).
  - Given PE and “If Juan preserves an ecosystem, then he either manages wildlife or maintains soil health, but not both,” together with “Juan maintains soil health,” we get ¬(manages wildlife).
  - From “Juan works in forestry → manages wildlife or harvests timber,” we get harvests timber.
  - With chainsaw true and “If Juan masters the bucksaw technique then chainsaw XOR harvests timber,” we infer ¬(masters bucksaw).
  - Given “If Juan is an experienced logger then masters bucksaw or fells trees efficiently” and “Juan does not fell trees efficiently,” we conclude Juan is not an experienced logger.
- Case 2: Assume Juan does not preserve an ecosystem.
  - Then from “Juan either plants trees or preserves ecosystems,” Juan can plant trees instead; no conflict.
  - If Juan were an experienced logger, then (since he does not fell trees efficiently) he must master the bucksaw. With chainsaw true and the XOR rule, this forces ¬(harvests timber), which is consistent if he manages wildlife (satisfying the forestry rule). No contradictions arise, so Juan could be an experienced logger.

Since one consistent scenario makes him not experienced and another makes him experienced, the truth of “Juan is an experienced logger” cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
