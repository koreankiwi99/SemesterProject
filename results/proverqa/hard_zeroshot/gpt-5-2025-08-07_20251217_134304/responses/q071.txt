Question ID: 71
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Westyn either has a stable weight or has a weak immune system, but not both. Scott is healthy. If Scott ages gracefully, then he is either healthy or has a weak immune system, but not both. If Scott has a genetic mutation, then he either has high adaptability or is more resilient (but not both). Bryant does not have a rare trait. Bryant is more resilient. Scott does not develop slowly. If someone either has a rare trait or a unique genetic profile, then they are genetically diverse. If Bryant ages gracefully, then he is either healthy or has a weak immune system, but not both. If Reign has a genetic mutation, then he either has high adaptability or is more resilient (but not both). Bryant does not develop slowly. Scott does not have a stable weight. Scott either ages gracefully or has complex DNA, but not both. Anyone who has complex DNA and is genetically diverse develops slowly. Scott either has a stable weight or has a weak immune system, but not both. Bryant thrives under pressure. If Reign either has a genetic mutation or a chromosomal abnormality (but not both), then he has a unique genetic profile. If Scott lives a healthy lifestyle, then he will age gracefully. Scott thrives under pressure. If Scott either has a genetic mutation or a chromosomal abnormality (but not both), then he has a unique genetic profile. Scott is more resilient. Scott either stays fit or has a weak immune system. Scott does not have a rare trait. If Scott experiences environmental stress, then he either has high adaptability or has strong coping mechanisms (but not both). Reign either ages gracefully or has complex DNA, but not both. Anyone who thrives under pressure has high adaptability.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Scott has a chromosomal abnormality.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We know:
- Scott does not have a stable weight and has (stable weight XOR weak immune system) → Scott has a weak immune system.
- Scott is healthy. If he ages gracefully, then healthy XOR weak immune system; since both healthy and weak immune system hold, Scott cannot be aging gracefully. From (ages gracefully XOR complex DNA), Scott has complex DNA.
- Scott thrives under pressure → he has high adaptability. Also, Scott is more resilient.
- If Scott had a genetic mutation, then (high adaptability XOR more resilient). Since he has both, Scott cannot have a genetic mutation.
- Anyone with complex DNA and genetically diverse develops slowly. Scott does not develop slowly, so he is not genetically diverse.
- If (rare trait or unique genetic profile) then genetically diverse. Scott does not have a rare trait and is not genetically diverse, so he cannot have a unique genetic profile.
- If (genetic mutation XOR chromosomal abnormality) then unique genetic profile. Since he does not have a unique genetic profile, (genetic mutation XOR chromosomal abnormality) is false. We already have not genetic mutation, hence not chromosomal abnormality.

Therefore, the statement “Scott has a chromosomal abnormality” is false.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
