Question ID: 72
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Bennett optimizes systems, then he either advances artificial intelligence or enhances computing capabilities, but not both. If someone improves software, then they enhance computing capabilities. Bennett studies multiprocessing. If Bennett studies multiprocessing, then he either develops efficient operating systems or pioneers breakthrough technologies, but not both. If Francesca studies multiprocessing, then he either develops efficient operating systems or pioneers breakthrough technologies, but not both. Bennett does not think critically. If Bennett collaborates with experts, then he either solves complex problems or creates novel solutions (but not both). Anyone who understands algorithms and designs system architecture can develop efficient operating systems. Bennett analyzes data. If Bennett either solves complex problems or analyzes data (but not both), then he thinks critically. If Bennett can solve complex problems, then he leads innovative projects and optimizes systems. Bennett either develops efficient operating systems or improves software. Bennett advances artificial intelligence. If Francesca can solve complex problems, then he leads innovative projects and optimizes systems.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Bennett pioneers breakthrough technologies.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Bennett analyzes data (AD) and “if S xor AD then thinks critically (T).” Given Bennett does not think critically (¬T), AD must not be in an exclusive-or with S. Since AD is true, this forces S (solves complex problems) to be true.
- From S -> optimizes systems (O). So O is true.
- From O -> (advances AI xor enhances computing) and given advances AI is true, we get enhances computing (C) is false.
- If improves software then C; since C is false, Bennett does not improve software.
- Given “develops efficient OS (E) or improves software” and not improves software, E must be true.
- From studying multiprocessing implies (E xor pioneers breakthrough technologies (P)), with E true, P must be false.

Therefore, Bennett does not pioneer breakthrough technologies.

ANSWER: False

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
