Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We have:
- Lovie does not earn respect.
- If someone heals their community, they earn respect; and if Lovie fosters peace, she heals her community. Therefore Lovie does not heal her community, and thus does not foster peace.
- Since Lovie either preaches understanding or fosters peace, and she does not foster peace, she preaches understanding.
- If someone values tolerance, they foster peace. Since Lovie does not foster peace, she does not value tolerance.

We also have:
- Lovie defends minorities.
- If Lovie defends minorities xor supports human rights, then she advocates for freedom. Lovie does not advocate for freedom, so the xor antecedent must be false. Given she defends minorities, she must also support human rights.
- Lovie supports human rights or promotes social justice (but this “or” is not exclusive). Thus promoting social justice is optional; it may be true or false.

From the universal rule: if someone opposes extremism or values tolerance, then they promote social justice. We have that Lovie does not value tolerance. Therefore, if she opposes extremism, she would promote social justice. But promoting social justice is not determined (it could be true or false, and having both supports human rights and promotes social justice is allowed here). Hence whether Lovie opposes extremism cannot be concluded.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:
