Question ID: 74
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Twinkle is either agile or achieves high jumps, but not necessarily both. Twinkle follows rules. If a horse is patient and respects its rider, then it can stand still. If Twinkle performs dressage, then she is either disciplined or has good posture (but not both). If Twinkle is strong, then she is either agile or trustworthy (but not both). Twinkle has strength. Twinkle remains calm. Twinkle does not achieve high jumps. Twinkle either obeys commands or is disciplined. All horses that have good manners either obey commands or follow rules. Twinkle has good manners. If Twinkle has good reflexes, then she is either agile or has endurance (but not both). If Twinkle is disciplined, then she either remains calm or stands still (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Twinkle is well-trained or trustworthy, then she is useful for dressage.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Twinkle is either agile or achieves high jumps (but not necessarily both)” and “Twinkle does not achieve high jumps,” we infer Twinkle is agile.
- From “If Twinkle is strong, then she is either agile or trustworthy (but not both)” and “Twinkle has strength” plus agile, we infer Twinkle is not trustworthy.
- There are no premises relating “well-trained” or “useful for dressage” to any given properties.
- Thus, the antecedent “well-trained or trustworthy” could be true (if well-trained) or false (if not well-trained), and the consequent is unconstrained. The implication is neither entailed nor refuted by the information.

ANSWER: Uncertain
