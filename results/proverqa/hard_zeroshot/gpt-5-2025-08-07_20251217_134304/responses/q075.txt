==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Emelia is meticulous” and “Anyone who is meticulous will attend to details,” Emelia attends to details.
- From “If someone meets deadlines, then they prioritize their work” and “Emelia does not prioritize her work,” Emelia does not meet deadlines (modus tollens).
- From “Emelia either manages tasks or meets deadlines, but not both,” and not meeting deadlines, Emelia manages tasks.
- From “If they attend to details and manage tasks, then they perform their job precisely,” Emelia performs her job precisely.
- From “If Emelia performs her job precisely, then she saves lives and coordinates efficiently,” Emelia saves lives.
- From “If Emelia handles pressure well, then she either earns respect from others or saves lives, but not both,” and she handles pressure well, having saved lives means she does not earn respect (exclusive or).

Therefore, the statement “Emelia earns respect from others” is false.
