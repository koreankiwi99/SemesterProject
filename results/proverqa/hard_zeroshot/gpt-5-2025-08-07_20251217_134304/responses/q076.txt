If Angie understands ecosystems or values underground discovery, then she can make groundbreaking findings. If Eddie either hikes outdoors or enjoys sunny days (but not both), then she prefers open areas. Eddie hikes outdoors. Huggalump is a geologist. Angie cannot make groundbreaking findings. Angie does not enjoy sunny days. Anyone who enjoys caving or likes small rooms is comfortable in enclosed spaces. If someone has claustrophobia and likes wide spaces, then they avoid tunnels.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Angie is either fearful of enclosed spaces or comfortable in enclosed spaces, but not both.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Anyone who enjoys caving or likes small rooms is comfortable in enclosed spaces" and "Angie likes small rooms," it follows that Angie is comfortable in enclosed spaces.
- The statement to assess involves an exclusive-or (XOR): Angie is either fearful of enclosed spaces or comfortable in enclosed spaces, but not both.
- The only rule related to fear/claustrophobia is: "If someone has claustrophobia and likes wide spaces, then they avoid tunnels." We have no information that Angie has claustrophobia or likes wide spaces; we cannot infer she is fearful. Also, avoid tunnels does not imply claustrophobia (the implication is one-way).
- No rule states that being comfortable in enclosed spaces excludes being fearful, nor do we have any rule allowing us to conclude Angie is not fearful.

Conclusion: We know Angie is comfortable, but we cannot determine her fearfulness. Therefore, the XOR claim cannot be confirmed.
