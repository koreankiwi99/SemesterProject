  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Niklaus works outdoors. Given: If he works outdoors, then he runs a ranch or grows groundnuts. Also given: Niklaus does not grow groundnuts. Therefore, he runs a ranch.
- Anyone who runs a ranch owns animals. So Niklaus owns animals.
- Niklaus either plants seeds or manages a farm, and he does not plant seeds. Therefore, he manages a farm.
- None of the rules link “nutritious crops” to any other predicate. The only explicit crop he does not grow is groundnuts.
- There is no rule stating that managing a farm or running a ranch precludes growing crops, nor that growing crops requires planting seeds by himself.
- Thus, it is not determined whether he grows any nutritious crops.

ANSWER: Uncertain
