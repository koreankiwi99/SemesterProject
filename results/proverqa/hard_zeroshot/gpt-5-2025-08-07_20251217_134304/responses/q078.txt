Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Aurelio has good intuition” and “If GI then self-aware xor reflective” plus “Aurelio does not reflect on his actions,” we deduce Aurelio is self-aware.
- From “If self-aware then listens to his body xor takes care of his emotions” and “Aurelio does not take care of his emotions,” we deduce he listens to his body.
- From “Aurelio pursues wellbeing” and “Everyone who pursues wellbeing either engages in physical activity or maintains balance” with “Aurelio does not maintain balance,” we deduce he engages in physical activity.
- Given “physical activity xor manages stress,” we deduce he does not manage stress.
- From “mindfulness or manages stress” and not managing stress, we deduce Aurelio practices mindfulness; thus he follows an alkaline diet and stays hydrated.
- None of the premises defines or links “prioritizes his health” to any of the given predicates (pursues wellbeing, mindfulness, hydration, etc.) in a logically explicit way.

Conclusion: The truth of “Aurelio does not prioritize his health” cannot be determined from the given information.
