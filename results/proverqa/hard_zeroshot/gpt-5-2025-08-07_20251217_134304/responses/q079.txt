==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Aries embraces paradoxes, so by the XOR rule with avoiding complexity, he does not avoid complexity. Hence, by the XOR rule with pursuing knowledge, Aries pursues knowledge.
- From pursuing knowledge, Aries has either discursive thinking or develops critical thinking (but not both), though which one is not determined.
- Aries challenges conventional wisdom, and with the given fact that he influences public opinion, the XOR rule implies he does not leave a lasting impact.
- However, the predicate “gains influence” appears only in a rule about Myla and is not linked to “influences public opinion” or any property of Aries.
- There is no rule or fact that asserts or denies that Aries gains influence.

ANSWER: Uncertain
