==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Given: Ayden does not experience shame, and if Ayden loses influence then he experiences shame. By contrapositive, Ayden does not lose influence.
- If Ayden were reckless, then he would either attract attention or lose trust, but not both. Since Ayden does not attract attention, reckless(Ayden) would imply Ayden loses trust.
- Losing trust implies damaging reputation, which implies facing consequences. For Ayden, facing consequences implies either becoming isolated or losing influence. Since Ayden does not lose influence, he would become isolated.
- Ayden engages in controversy; combined with becoming isolated, that implies he struggles with guilt.
- This does not contradict any given facts (the strong support system statement is non-deterministic: “may not”).
- Therefore, Ayden being reckless is consistent with the facts. There is no rule that forces Ayden to be reckless or not reckless.

Conclusion: We cannot determine that Ayden is not reckless.
