Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Brandon is a reckless driver.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Brandon drives regularly,” we get: Brandon follows traffic rules and is a defensive driver.
- Exactly one of cautious or reckless is true.
- Exactly one of experienced or teaches road safety is true.
- If Brandon is experienced, then exactly one of defensive or cautious is true. Since he is defensive, cautious must be false, hence reckless is true.
- If Brandon is not experienced, then he teaches road safety. In this case, nothing forces cautious to be false; cautious could be true, making reckless false.
- “Knows vehicle mechanics and enjoys mentoring -> can be a driving instructor” does not assert that he is a driving instructor, so we cannot use the instructor rule (together with professional racer) to force “teaches road safety” to be false.

Both outcomes (reckless true or reckless false) are consistent with the information. Therefore, the truth of “Brandon is a reckless driver” is not determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:

Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
