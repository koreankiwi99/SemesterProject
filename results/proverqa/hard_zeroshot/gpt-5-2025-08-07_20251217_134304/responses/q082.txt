Question ID: 82
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Moshe either achieves success or faces major setbacks, but not both. Everyone either conquers challenges or learns from failure. Moshe does not reach new heights. Moshe either finds inner peace or builds resilience, but not necessarily both. If Moshe either sets high goals or pursues excellence (but not both), then he pushes past his limits. If Moshe pushes past his limits, then he either overcomes fears or builds resilience (but not both). Everyone who conquers challenges either reaches new heights or finds inner peace (or both). Moshe does not overcome his fears. If Moshe either connects with nature or practices mindfulness (but not both), then he finds inner peace. Moshe does not set high goals. Anyone who sets ambitious targets or believes in themselves aspires to greatness. If Moshe sets challenging targets, then he will push past his limits. Moshe does not face major setbacks. If Moshe either sets goals or embraces risks (but not both), then he conquers challenges. Moshe does not learn from failure.

Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Moshe aspires to greatness and inspires others along the way.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Moshe either achieves success or faces major setbacks, but not both" and "Moshe does not face major setbacks," we conclude Moshe achieves success.
- From "Everyone either conquers challenges or learns from failure" and "Moshe does not learn from failure," we conclude Moshe conquers challenges.
- From "Everyone who conquers challenges either reaches new heights or finds inner peace (or both)" and "Moshe does not reach new heights," we conclude Moshe finds inner peace.
- The only rule about "aspires to greatness" is: "Anyone who sets ambitious targets or believes in themselves aspires to greatness." We have no information that Moshe sets ambitious targets or believes in himself.
- There is no information at all about "inspires others."

Thus, whether Moshe aspires to greatness and inspires others cannot be determined from the given premises.
