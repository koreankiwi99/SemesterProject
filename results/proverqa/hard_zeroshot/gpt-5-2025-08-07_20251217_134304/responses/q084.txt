Adele does not focus on details. Emerson copies others. If Adele appreciates functionality, then he either focuses on details or prioritizes practicality (but not both). If Emerson appreciates functionality, then he either focuses on details or prioritizes practicality (but not both). Emerson does not recognize beauty in things. Emerson does not focus on details. If Emerson either pursues elegance or appreciates proportion (but not both), then he recognizes beauty in things. If Emerson either values aesthetics or pursues elegance (but not both), then he admires symmetry. Emerson either follows trends or is a respected architect, but not both. Joziah does not appreciate proportion. Emerson does not appreciate proportion. Emerson avoids experiments. If Emerson has cultural sensitivity, then he values historical context and creates timeless designs. If Emerson either values aesthetics or creates timeless designs (but not both), then he appreciates functionality. If Leila either values aesthetics or creates timeless designs (but not both), then he appreciates functionality. For all humans, if someone is a respected architect, then they either create timeless designs or blend tradition with innovation (or both). Emerson does not admire symmetry. If Leila lacks originality, then he either copies others or avoids experiments (but not both). If Leila either pursues elegance or appreciates proportion (but not both), then he recognizes beauty in things. If Joziah follows trends, then he will lack originality. If Emerson lacks originality, then he either copies others or avoids experiments (but not both). If Emerson follows trends, then he will lack originality.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Emerson does not blend tradition with innovation.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Emerson copies others and avoids experiments. If he lacked originality, then exactly one of these would be true; since both are true, Emerson does not lack originality.
- If Emerson followed trends, he would lack originality. Therefore, he does not follow trends.
- Emerson either follows trends or is a respected architect, but not both. Since he does not follow trends, he is a respected architect.
- Emerson does not focus on details and does not prioritize practicality. If he appreciated functionality, then exactly one of those would be true; therefore he does not appreciate functionality.
- If exactly one of valuing aesthetics or creating timeless designs held, he would appreciate functionality; since he does not, those two have the same truth value.
- Emerson does not admire symmetry; thus he does not have exactly one of valuing aesthetics or pursuing elegance. Combined with Emerson not recognizing beauty and not appreciating proportion, this yields: not pursuing elegance, not valuing aesthetics, and thus not creating timeless designs.
- As a respected architect, he must either create timeless designs or blend tradition with innovation (or both). Since he does not create timeless designs, he must blend tradition with innovation.

Therefore, the statement "Emerson does not blend tradition with innovation" is false.
