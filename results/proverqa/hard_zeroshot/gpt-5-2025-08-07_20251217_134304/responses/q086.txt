==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Forest lives in the rainforest and, by the given XOR rule, must be either carnivorous or venomous. Since Forest does not have venom, Forest is carnivorous.
- If Forest is a carnivorous snake, then he is either stealthy or camouflaged (but not both). Given Forest is not camouflaged, he is stealthy.
- Any snake that has stealth or is agile is adaptable. Therefore, Forest is adaptable (he has stealth).
- If Forest is adaptable, then he can survive in harsh environments. Hence, Forest can survive in harsh environments.

ANSWER: True
