Context:
Ariana hides in vegetation. All frogs that live in damp environments either hide in vegetation or burrow into soil. Cairo inhabits forests. If Cairo is a small-sized frog, then he lives on land and eats insects. Cairo does not jump a long distance. Ariana is agile. If Cairo is agile, then he either swims efficiently or jumps a long distance (but not both). Cairo burrows into soil or hibernates underground. Cairo hides in vegetation. If Cairo either breathes air or inhabits forests (but not both), then he lives on land. Cairo is agile. If Cairo has webbed feet, then he either hibernates underground or breathes air, but not both. All frogs that swim efficiently have webbed feet. If Cairo either has powerful legs or uses stream current (but not both), then he can swim efficiently. Cairo lives in a damp environment. If Ariana is agile, then he either swims efficiently or jumps a long distance (but not both). Either Cairo lives on land or lives in water, but not both. If Cairo is small, then he hibernates underground and eats insects. If Galilea has webbed feet, then he either hibernates underground or breathes air, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cairo lives in water.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Cairo is agile and does not jump a long distance. From “agile -> exactly one of (swims efficiently, jumps long),” Cairo must swim efficiently.
- Swimming efficiently implies webbed feet, which implies exactly one of (hibernates underground, breathes air).
- Case 1: If Cairo breathes air is false, then he hibernates underground. With “inhabits forests,” the condition “XOR(breathes air, inhabits forests) -> lives on land” is met, so he lives on land, hence not in water.
- Case 2: If Cairo breathes air is true, then he does not hibernate underground, and “burrows into soil or hibernates underground” forces burrow into soil. The land/water status is not determined by any rule; with “exactly one of (land, water),” he could live in water.

Both possibilities (in water or on land) are consistent with the premises. Therefore, whether Cairo lives in water cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
