Question ID: 88
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
For all camels, if they have a dry mouth and feel weak, then they are thirsty. If Goobers carries a heavy load, then he either stumbles frequently or feels exhausted (or both). Goobers does not reach water. Goobers does not have strong legs. If a camel stumbles frequently, then it loses balance and gets injured. For every camel, it is either thirsty or well-hydrated, but not both. If Goobers feels exhausted, then he either rests in the shade or walks briskly, but not both. Every camel that crosses the desert is either thirsty or finds an oasis. Goobers does not lose balance. Goobers gets injured. Goobers carries a heavy load. Goobers either rests in the shade or traverses dunes, but not both at the same time. All camels that have owners are able to carry loads and traverse dunes. If Goobers traverses dunes, then he either crosses the desert or reaches water. Goobers walks briskly. All camels that find an oasis have strong legs and endurance. Blossom does not lose balance.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Goobers is well-hydrated.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If a camel stumbles frequently, then it loses balance and gets injured” and “Goobers does not lose balance,” we get that Goobers does not stumble frequently.
- Given “Goobers carries a heavy load” and “If Goobers carries a heavy load, then he either stumbles frequently or feels exhausted,” with not stumbling, Goobers must feel exhausted.
- “If Goobers feels exhausted, then he either rests in the shade or walks briskly, but not both,” and “Goobers walks briskly” imply he does not rest in the shade.
- “Goobers either rests in the shade or traverses dunes, but not both” then implies he traverses dunes.
- “If Goobers traverses dunes, then he either crosses the desert or reaches water,” and “Goobers does not reach water” imply he crosses the desert.
- “Every camel that crosses the desert is either thirsty or finds an oasis,” and “All camels that find an oasis have strong legs...” with “Goobers does not have strong legs” imply Goobers did not find an oasis, hence he is thirsty.
- Since every camel is either thirsty or well-hydrated, but not both, Goobers is not well-hydrated.
