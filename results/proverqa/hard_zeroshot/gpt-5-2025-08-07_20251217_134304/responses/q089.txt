==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Wesson prioritizes his family life” and “works tirelessly or prioritizes family life, but not both,” we get T (works tirelessly) = false.
- From “well-respected or works tirelessly,” with T false, we get W (well-respected) = true.
- From “If well-respected then selfless acts xor helps unconditionally,” and “does not help unconditionally,” we get S (selfless acts) = true.
- From “If noble then hero xor selfless acts,” with S true, we get H (hero) = false.
- From “If recognized by governments or respected by peers, then hero,” and H = false (contrapositive), we get not recognized by governments and not respected by peers.

Therefore, Wesson is not respected by peers.
