Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Atharv sets goals (G) and does not make progress (¬P). From “G -> (P or H)”, this forces H (works hard).
- With H and “H -> (S xor E)” and given ¬E, we get S (achieves success).
- Atharv takes risks (R) and does not become influential (¬I). From “R -> (GR xor I)”, we get GR (gains recognition).
- Now S and GR are both true. From “US -> (S xor GR)”, if US were true, it would contradict S ∧ GR. Hence ¬US (does not develop unique skills).
- From “FP -> (US ∧ J)”, in particular FP -> US. Since ¬US, we conclude ¬FP (does not follow his passion).

ANSWER: False
