Model Response:

- From “Jenna either pursues a career or has hobbies, but not both” and “Jenna does not pursue a career,” conclude Jenna has hobbies.
- From “If Jenna has hobbies, then she either joins clubs or volunteers regularly (but not both)” and “Jenna volunteers regularly,” conclude she does not join clubs.
- From “Jenna does not read books” and “Jenna reads books or attends parties,” conclude she attends parties.
- From “If Jenna either attends parties or joins clubs (but not both), then she is socially active,” and since attends parties and does not join clubs, conclude she is socially active.
- From “Jenna either has a private space or is socially active, but not both,” and socially active, conclude she does not have a private space.

None of the premises mention art or the ability to focus on it, nor do they link focusing on art to any derived property (e.g., private space, social activity). Therefore, the claim about focusing on her art cannot be determined from the given information.
