Rio builds prototypes. Rio either prioritizes leisure or works diligently, but not both. Rio is passionate. If Rio holds patents, then he either builds prototypes or creates useful innovations, but not both. Either Rio is applauded by others or he is ridiculed by others, but not both. If Rio is passionate, then he thinks creatively and makes groundbreaking discoveries. If Rio either makes groundbreaking discoveries or creates useful innovations (but not both), then he is applauded by others. Rio holds patents. Rio does not prioritize leisure.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rio is ridiculed by others.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Rio is passionate (P), so he thinks creatively (T) and makes groundbreaking discoveries (G).
- Rio holds patents (H). Given H -> (builds prototypes (B) XOR creates innovations (I)), and B is true, it follows that I is false.
- Since G is true and I is false, (G XOR I) holds, so he is applauded (A).
- Given A XOR R, A true implies R false.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
