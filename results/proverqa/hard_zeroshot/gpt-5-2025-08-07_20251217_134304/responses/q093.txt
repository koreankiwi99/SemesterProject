  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Beckham embraces innovation, and “values tradition XOR embraces innovation,” so Beckham does not value tradition.
- From “if preserves heritage then values tradition,” contrapositive gives: not values tradition ⇒ not preserves heritage.
- Beckham uses original techniques. From “if restores antiques AND uses original techniques then preserves heritage,” and not preserves heritage, it follows Beckham does not restore antiques.
- Beckham stitches cloth and dyes fabrics. From “if uses leather then exactly one of dyes/stitches,” having both implies Beckham does not use leather.
- He restores furniture; thus “uses leather or works with wood.” Since not leather, he works with wood.
- “Works with wood XOR makes modern furniture” gives: not makes modern furniture.
- “Skilled upholsterer XOR makes modern furniture” then implies: skilled upholsterer.
- From “if skilled upholsterer then restores antiques or creates works of art,” and not restores antiques, it follows: Beckham creates works of art.

Therefore, the statement “Beckham does not create works of art” is false.
