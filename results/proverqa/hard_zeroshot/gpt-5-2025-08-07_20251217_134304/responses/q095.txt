Maci does not produce beautiful designs. If Maci learns from others, then she has worked under a mentor.

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "If Maci pays attention to details or has good taste, then she will produce beautiful designs" and "Maci does not produce beautiful designs," we can use the contrapositive to infer that Maci does not pay attention to details and does not have good taste.
- The queried statement uses different terms: "values precision" and "cares about her appearance," which are not explicitly defined or equated in the premises to "pays attention to details" or "has good taste."
- Without a stated equivalence between these terms, we cannot conclude the truth of the queried disjunction from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
