Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Hope makes a groundbreaking discovery.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “works independently or collaborates, but not both” and “does not work independently,” conclude she collaborates (C).
- From “if valuable contributions then thinks critically and collaborates” and “does not think critically,” conclude not valuable contributions (¬V).
- From “if innovative ideas then valuable contributions,” conclude not innovative ideas (¬N).
- From “not excel academically” and “(excel xor alternative careers) implies innovative ideas,” this reduces to “if alternative careers then innovative ideas.” With ¬N, conclude not alternative careers (¬A).
- From “alternative careers xor dedicated scientist,” with ¬A, conclude dedicated scientist (D).
- From “if dedicated scientist then groundbreaking discovery or inspires others” and “does not inspire others,” conclude groundbreaking discovery (G).

Therefore, Hope makes a groundbreaking discovery.
