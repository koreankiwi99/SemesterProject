==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
From “Jaxton eats nutritious food” and “If Jaxton eats nutritious food, then he maintains good health,” Jaxton maintains good health. Given “Jaxton is either maintaining good health or has anemia, but not both,” he therefore does not have anemia.

From “Jaxton sets goals” and “Jaxton works hard,” he has ambition; thus he prioritizes self-care and engages in regular exercise. The statement allowing “regular exercise or needs a special diet (not mutually exclusive)” does not establish that he needs a special diet.

No premise links good health, lack of anemia, or any other given condition to “requires medical treatment.” Whether he requires medical treatment is not determined by the information provided.

ANSWER: Uncertain
