Question ID: 100
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Josue knows phrases. All parrots either make noise or learn to speak. All parrots that can sing have vocal cords. Josue will understand the context of his speech if he responds intelligently. All parrots that either know phrases or understand the context of their speech are communicative. Every parrot that either whistles tunes or repeats words (but not both) can mimic sounds. If Josue either has a large vocabulary or entertains crowds (but not both), then he is charismatic. Josue does not make noise. If a parrot can make humans laugh, then it will entertain crowds. Every parrot has feathers or has vocal cords. Josue does not have feathers. Josue does not have a large vocabulary. Josue is not charismatic. Josue is either talkative or mute, but not both. A parrot can either mimic sounds or understand the context of its speech, but not necessarily both. If a parrot has vocal cords and is communicative, then it can make humans laugh. If Josue learns to speak, then he is either mute or can mimic sounds. All parrots that express emotions are communicative.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Josue is not talkative.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Assume Josue is a parrot. Then:
   - From "Every parrot has feathers or has vocal cords" and "Josue does not have feathers," Josue must have vocal cords.
   - From "All parrots either make noise or learn to speak" and "Josue does not make noise," Josue must learn to speak.
   - From "Josue knows phrases" and "All parrots that either know phrases or understand the context of their speech are communicative," Josue is communicative.
   - From "If a parrot has vocal cords and is communicative, then it can make humans laugh" and "If a parrot can make humans laugh, then it will entertain crowds," Josue entertains crowds.
   - From "Josue does not have a large vocabulary" and "If Josue either has a large vocabulary or entertains crowds (but not both), then he is charismatic," the XOR condition holds (false XOR true), so Josue would be charismatic.
   - This contradicts "Josue is not charismatic."
   - Therefore, Josue is not a parrot.

2. Without Josue being a parrot, none of the parrot-specific rules apply. We have:
   - Josue does not make noise.
   - Josue is either talkative or mute, but not both.
   - No rule connects talkative or mute to making noise (for non-parrots), nor do we have any rule that otherwise determines which of talkative or mute holds.

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Josue is talkative or not from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
