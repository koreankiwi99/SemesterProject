Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From CT and rule “CT -> (Explore xor EK)” with Explore true, we get EK false.
- From “(IK ∨ H) -> EK” and EK false, we get IK false and H false (H also given).
- From “(DevTh ∨ CE) -> IK” and IK false, we get DevTh false and CE false (CE also given).
- From Cur true and “(Cur ∧ Adv) -> DevTh” with DevTh false, we deduce Adv false.
- From “(C xor M) -> Adv” and Adv false with M false, we get C false.
- From “C ∨ Pubs” and C false, we get Pubs true.
- From “Pubs -> (MB xor Lead)” and Lead false, we get MB true.
- From “(MB ∧ Win) -> IR” and IR false, with MB true, we deduce Win false.
- From StudyMicro true and “StudyMicro -> (CSA ∨ Win)” with Win false, we conclude CSA true.

ANSWER: True

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
