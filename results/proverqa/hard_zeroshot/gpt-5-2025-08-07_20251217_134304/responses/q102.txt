Question ID: 102
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Julissa either tracks seed dispersal or analyzes bloom patterns, but not both. Jose either investigates root systems or tracks seed dispersal, but not both. Jaziel either investigates root systems or tracks seed dispersal, but not both. For Jaziel, he either classifies foliage or documents habitats, but not both. If Jaziel has a green thumb, then he analyzes bloom patterns and collects plant samples. Elena classifies foliage. If Jaziel explores remote regions, then he either identifies unique specimens or studies tropical flora. Julissa does not examine fungal growth. Jaziel is either specialized in rare plants or a general plant researcher, but not both. If Jose either examines fungal growth or analyzes bloom patterns (but not both), then he studies tropical flora. Every botanist who studies plant migration either researches plant adaptation or tracks seed dispersal (or both). Jaziel classifies foliage. If Jaziel has vast knowledge, then he excels in experimentation and specializes in rare plants. Jaziel either documents habitats or investigates root systems, but not both. Jaziel does not examine fungal growth. Jaziel either tracks seed dispersal or analyzes bloom patterns, but not both. Jose either documents habitats or investigates root systems, but not both. If Jaziel either examines fungal growth or analyzes bloom patterns (but not both), then he studies tropical flora. Any botanist who studies tropical flora or discovers new species is specialized in rare plants.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jaziel is a general plant researcher.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Jaziel classifies foliage, and (classifies foliage XOR documents habitats) ⇒ not documents habitats.
- From (documents habitats XOR investigates root systems) and not documents habitats ⇒ investigates root systems.
- From (investigates root systems XOR tracks seed dispersal) ⇒ not tracks seed dispersal.
- From (tracks seed dispersal XOR analyzes bloom patterns) and not tracks seed dispersal ⇒ analyzes bloom patterns.
- Jaziel does not examine fungal growth, so (examines fungal growth XOR analyzes bloom patterns) holds ⇒ by the given conditional, he studies tropical flora.
- Anyone who studies tropical flora is specialized in rare plants. Hence Jaziel is specialized in rare plants.
- Given (specialized in rare plants XOR general plant researcher), Jaziel cannot be a general plant researcher.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
