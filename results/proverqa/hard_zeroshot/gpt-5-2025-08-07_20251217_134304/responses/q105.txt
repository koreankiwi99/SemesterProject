Question ID: 105
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If a farmer works hard, then they value quality and are dedicated to their work. Anders does not use crop rotation. Every dedicated farmer either improves their crops or is experienced (or both). For all farmers, either they diversify their farm or improve their crops, but not necessarily both. Ronan either manages pests or increases crop yields. Ronan does not use crop rotation. Any farmer who uses quality seeds or optimizes soil conditions can increase crop yields. Every farmer monitors soil or manages pests. Ronan rotates fields. If Ronan is experienced, then he can either increase crop yields or develop new techniques, but not both. If Alyssa is experienced, then he can either increase crop yields or develop new techniques, but not both. If Bo either rotates fields or uses crop rotation (but not both), then he is dedicated. Ronan either uses sustainable methods or manages pests, but not both. If Ronan either rotates fields or uses crop rotation (but not both), then he is dedicated. Ronan diversifies his farm. Ronan uses sustainable methods. Bo diversifies his farm.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ronan does not develop new techniques.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Ronan uses sustainable methods and “uses sustainable methods or manages pests, but not both” holds, so he does not manage pests.
- From “Ronan either manages pests or increases crop yields,” and since he does not manage pests, Ronan increases crop yields.
- Ronan rotates fields and does not use crop rotation; given the “either ... but not both” condition, Ronan is dedicated.
- Dedicated implies (improves crops or experienced). This leaves two possibilities: Ronan is experienced or he just improves crops.
- If Ronan is experienced, then by the XOR rule (“either increase yields or develop new techniques, but not both”), since he increases yields, he would not develop new techniques.
- However, we cannot deduce that Ronan is experienced (he could satisfy dedication by improving crops instead). If he is not experienced, nothing given forbids him from developing new techniques.

Therefore, whether Ronan does not develop new techniques cannot be determined from the information provided.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:

Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
