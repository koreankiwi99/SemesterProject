Tessa either enjoys outdoor activities or has participated in parades. If Kiddo has a good temperament, then she either wins competitions or is majestic (or both). Kiddo either works on a farm or competes in shows, but not both. Vada works on a farm. Kiddo works on a farm. Kiddo does not enjoy outdoor activities. Kiddo has a good temperament.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kiddo does not participate in wassailing.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Kiddo works on a farm; by the XOR rule, she does not compete in shows.
- Kiddo does not enjoy outdoor activities; by the rule (enjoys outdoor activities or participated in parades), she has participated in parades.
- Kiddo has a good temperament; hence she either wins competitions or is majestic.
- If Kiddo is majestic, then by the rule (majestic -> competes in shows XOR participates in wassailing), and since she does not compete in shows, she must participate in wassailing.
- If Kiddo is not majestic, then she must win competitions, but nothing else constrains her participation in wassailing; it could be either true or false (subject only to the exclusivity that exactly one of participates/does-not-participate holds).

Thus, there are models where Kiddo participates in wassailing and models where she does not. The statement cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
