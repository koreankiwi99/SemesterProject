Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Alana is free-spirited.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Alana enjoys flexibility and does not embrace improvisation, so from flexibility → (values structure or embraces improvisation), she must value structure. Given values structure xor prioritizes creativity, she does not prioritize creativity.
- Being detail-oriented implies perfectionist xor prioritizes creativity; since she doesn’t prioritize creativity, she is a perfectionist.
- If perfectionist, then values planning xor goes with instinct; since she goes with her instinct, she does not value planning.
- Values planning xor spontaneous; since she does not value planning, she is spontaneous.
- Enjoys traveling implies adventurous xor spontaneous; since she is spontaneous, she is not adventurous.
- Artistic is given true. With adventurous false and artistic true, (adventurous xor artistic) holds, triggering free-spirited.

Therefore, Alana is free-spirited.
