If Iyla pursues her passion, then she either gains recognition or improves people's lives (or both). Iyla conducts experiments. A renowned alchemist excels in experiments.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Iyla does not develop innovative remedies.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Discovers(Iyla) and the rule (If Iyla discovers new properties and shares, then she becomes an expert) together with Iyla does not become an expert, we infer Iyla does not share her findings.
- Given she conducts experiments and must XOR share or keep private, she keeps her notes private. By the XOR with publishing, she does not publish.
- From the disjunctions, she therefore gains recognition and makes new findings.
- From (If Iyla excels then success) and Iyla does not achieve success, she does not excel.
- None of the given rules connect “developing innovative remedies” to any established predicates (discovering properties, findings, recognition, success, expertise, sharing, publishing, etc.). There is no statement that entails or contradicts “Iyla does not develop innovative remedies.”

Therefore, the truth of the statement cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
