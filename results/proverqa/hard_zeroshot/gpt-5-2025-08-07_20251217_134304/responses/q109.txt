Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Wyatt is not creative.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Wyatt is reclusive, and reclusive implies friends XOR family. Given Wyatt has friends, he does not have a family.
- Since Wyatt has a family or lives alone, and he does not have a family, he lives alone.
- Wyatt avoids crowds and appreciates quiet; thus he likes being alone.
- From the XOR between liking being alone and enjoying socializing, he does not enjoy socializing.
- If Wyatt lives alone, then values solitude XOR enjoys socializing; since he does not enjoy socializing, he values solitude.
- Whoever values solitude prefers privacy. So Wyatt prefers privacy.
- No premises relate Wyatt’s traits to creativity, and the only creativity-related rule concerns Ryatt, not Wyatt.

Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine whether Wyatt is not creative.
