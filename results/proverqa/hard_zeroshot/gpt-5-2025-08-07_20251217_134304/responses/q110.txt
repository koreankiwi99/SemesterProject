Question ID: 110
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Queenie has flagella, then she either releases waste products or produces toxins, but not both. If Queenie has a cell wall, then she can evade the immune system. Queenie colonizes intestines. If Queenie invades tissues, then she will produce toxins. Any parasite that breaks down food and colonizes intestines will release waste products. Queenie has flagella. Queenie disrupts digestion. If Queenie either produces toxins or adapts to environments (but not both), then she can evade the immune system. If Cora either produces toxins or adapts to environments (but not both), then she can evade the immune system. If Queenie can evade the immune system, then she can either multiply rapidly or dominate the gut microbiome, but not both. A parasite may either cause chronic disease or multiply rapidly, but not necessarily both. Queenie adapts to environments. If Queenie either disrupts digestion or infests her host (but not both), then she causes chronic disease. Cora adapts to environments. Queenie breaks down food. Leo has flagella. Queenie does not infest her host. Cora disrupts digestion.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Queenie is able to dominate the gut microbiome.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From flagella: Queenie has flagella, so exactly one of releases waste products or produces toxins is true.
- From being a parasite that breaks down food and colonizes intestines: she releases waste products; thus she does not produce toxins (by the exclusive-or above).
- Queenie adapts to environments. Since she does not produce toxins and does adapt, the exclusive-or condition for evading the immune system holds, so she can evade the immune system.
- If she can evade the immune system, then exactly one of multiply rapidly or dominate the gut microbiome holds.
- We also know she disrupts digestion and does not infest her host, so she causes chronic disease; however, this does not determine whether she dominates the gut microbiome or instead multiplies rapidly.

Therefore, whether Queenie dominates the gut microbiome cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
