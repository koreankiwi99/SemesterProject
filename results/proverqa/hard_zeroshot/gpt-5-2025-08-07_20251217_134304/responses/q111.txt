Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Kaia does not seek material wealth, and given the exclusive-or with showing devotion, Kaia shows devotion; thus she is blessed. None of this involves praying for rain.
- From Kaia honoring her family: if she did not respect her ancestors, the XOR rule would make her value her culture, which would imply appreciating heritage and thus feeling connected—contradicting the given that she does not feel connected. Therefore, she must respect her ancestors as well, and the XOR antecedent fails; we do not conclude she values her culture.
- No rule links Kaia praying for rain to any of her known attributes. The only statement about praying for rain concerns Carly.

Therefore, whether Kaia prays for rain is not determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
