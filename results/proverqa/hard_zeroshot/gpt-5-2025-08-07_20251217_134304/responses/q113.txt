Question ID: 113
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
All chemical engineers who solve complex problems both enhance water treatment processes and improve public health. Luv does not advance industrial processes. Luv does not conduct academic research. Luv solves complex problems. Veronica does not conduct academic research. Anyone who can purify contaminated water will enhance water treatment processes. A chemical engineer either designs ecofriendly products or conducts academic research, but not necessarily both. Any chemical engineer who creates demulsifying agents or improves environmental sustainability can reduce pollution. If Luv studies emulsions or experiments with chemicals, then she can create demulsifying agents. Koen either creates demulsifying agents or enhances water treatment processes. Veronica solves complex problems. Luv either designs ecofriendly products or reduces pollution, but not necessarily both. If Luv develops innovative techniques, then she can either improve environmental sustainability or advance industrial processes, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Luv does not develop innovative techniques.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We know:
- Luv does not advance industrial processes.
- If Luv develops innovative techniques, then exactly one of {improves environmental sustainability, advances industrial processes} holds.
- Given she does not advance industrial processes, developing innovative techniques would imply she improves environmental sustainability.

This creates no contradiction with any other given facts (e.g., about research, designing ecofriendly products, or reducing pollution), nor is there any rule that forces or forbids her developing innovative techniques. Therefore, whether Luv develops innovative techniques cannot be determined from the information provided.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
