==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Simba is bold and does not seek adventure, so by (BN(S) ∨ SA(S)) -> EDP(S), Simba explores dangerous paths.
- Simba reacts fast and stays alert, so by (RF ∧ SW) -> QR, Simba has quick reflexes.
- From CA(S) ∨ LF(S) and ¬CA(S), we infer LF(S).
- With QR(S) and LF(S), by (QR ∧ LF) -> SAd(S), Simba survives adversity; then SAd(S) -> GW(S), so Simba gains wisdom.
- Given VDU(S) and VDU(S) -> XOR(HT(S), GW(S)), and GW(S) is true, we get ¬HT(S).
- From EDP(S) and EDP(S) -> XOR(LVL(S), HT(S)), with HT(S) false, we conclude LVL(S) is true.

Thus, Simba does learn valuable lessons. The statement "Simba does not learn valuable lessons" is false.

ANSWER: False
