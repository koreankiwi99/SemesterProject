Step-by-step reasoning:

- From “prioritizes others or thinks of herself, but not both,” conclude she does not think of herself (B false).
- From “puts others first or she is community-oriented, but she cannot be both,” and equating “puts others first” with “prioritizes others,” conclude she is not community-oriented (C false).
- From “community-oriented or self-centered, but not both,” with C false, conclude she is self-centered (D true).
