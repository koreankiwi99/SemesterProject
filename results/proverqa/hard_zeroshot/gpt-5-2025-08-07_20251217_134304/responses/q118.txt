Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Jade does not map terrain. Alyssa does not map terrain. If Faith loves the outdoors, then she examines fossils and classifies minerals. Alyssa enjoys hiking. Alyssa does not appreciate nature. Faith does not gain recognition. If Twinkle enjoys hiking, then she either appreciates nature or loves the outdoors (but not both). Anyone who analyzes rock formations either studies geology or uncovers the secrets of the Earth (or both). Alyssa does not gain recognition. If Alyssa values exploration, then she loves the outdoors. If Alyssa studies geology, then she can either make breakthroughs or gain recognition, but not both. If Alyssa enjoys hiking, then she either appreciates nature or loves the outdoors (but not both). If Faith studies geology, then she can either make breakthroughs or gain recognition, but not both. Jade does not uncover the secrets of the Earth. If Alyssa loves the outdoors, then she examines fossils and classifies minerals. If Alyssa either finds fault lines or reads seismic data (but not both), then she studies geology. If Jade either examines fossils or maps terrain (but not both), then she analyzes rock formations. Jade enjoys hiking. If Twinkle collects rocks, then she will classify minerals. Alyssa does not uncover the secrets of the Earth. Faith does not collect rocks. If Alyssa either examines fossils or maps terrain (but not both), then she analyzes rock formations.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Alyssa makes breakthroughs.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Alyssa enjoys hiking, and if she enjoys hiking then she either appreciates nature or loves the outdoors (but not both). Given Alyssa does not appreciate nature, she loves the outdoors.
- If Alyssa loves the outdoors, then she examines fossils and classifies minerals. So she examines fossils.
- Alyssa does not map terrain. Therefore, exactly one of {examines fossils, maps terrain} is true, triggering: if exactly one holds, she analyzes rock formations.
- Anyone who analyzes rock formations either studies geology or uncovers the secrets of the Earth (or both). Alyssa does not uncover the secrets of the Earth, so she studies geology.
- If Alyssa studies geology, then she either makes breakthroughs or gains recognition (but not both). Alyssa does not gain recognition, so she makes breakthroughs.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
