Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Elsa is insecure, then she is either manipulative or lonely, but not both.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Elsa’s high status and not looking down on others, she must act with empathy (exclusive-or rule). Hence she does not crave validation (exclusive-or with empathy).
- Elsa builds real connections; thus she does not fear rejection (exclusive-or rule).
- Since she needs approval and does not fear rejection, the XOR condition triggers that she hides her true self. From hiding her true self and not craving validation, she must value authenticity. Given authenticity is mutually exclusive with seeking attention, Elsa does not seek attention.
- None of the given rules relate Elsa’s insecurity to being manipulative or lonely, and we have no information about whether Elsa is insecure, manipulative, or lonely.
- Therefore, the truth of “If Elsa is insecure, then she is either manipulative or lonely, but not both” cannot be determined from the premises.

ANSWER: Uncertain
