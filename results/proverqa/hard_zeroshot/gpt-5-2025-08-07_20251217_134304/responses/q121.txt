For every human, if they are either a perfectionist or cautious, then they are exacting. Anyone who keeps track of things or has a system can be organized. Callen is thorough. Anyone who prioritizes tasks or manages their time can achieve their goals. Callen values accuracy. Callen is not vigilant. Callen does not meet deadlines.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Callen is efficient.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Callen being thorough and not vigilant, and the rule “If Callen is thorough, then she is either vigilant or cautious, but not both,” we infer Callen is cautious.
- From “if a human is a perfectionist or cautious, then they are exacting,” we infer Callen is exacting.
- From “all exacting individuals value accuracy and strive for improvement,” we infer Callen strives for improvement, which contradicts the given statement that she does not strive for improvement. So the premises are inconsistent.
- No rules connect “efficient” with any of the provided attributes (organized, meeting deadlines, diligence, detail-oriented, etc.) in a way that would let us conclude either that Callen is efficient or that she is not.

Therefore, the truth of “Callen is efficient” cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain
