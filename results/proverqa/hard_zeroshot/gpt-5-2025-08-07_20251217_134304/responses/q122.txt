Question ID: 122
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Taytum eats insects. If Taytum has either aquatic adaptation or terrestrial adaptation (but not both), then she thrives. If Maximo is resilient, then she explores her environments and regenerates quickly. All thriving frogs are resilient. If Duke explores her environment and eats insects, then she is balanced. Taytum either lives in ponds or hibernates seasonally. Inaya either has terrestrial adaptation or hibernates seasonally, but not both. If Taytum has webbed feet, then she either migrates long distances or hibernates seasonally, but not both. If Taytum has strong skin, then she jumps far and explores her environments. If Taytum is resilient, then she explores her environments and regenerates quickly. Taytum does not migrate long distances. Taytum has webbed feet. Taytum either has terrestrial adaptation or hibernates seasonally, but not both. If Taytum explores her environment and eats insects, then she is balanced. Taytum is not balanced. Taytum regenerates quickly. If Taytum has gills or has lungs, then she can thrive.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Taytum has an aquatic adaptation.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Webbed feet -> (migrates XOR hibernates). Given Taytum does not migrate, she hibernates.
- Terrestrial adaptation XOR hibernation; since she hibernates, she does not have terrestrial adaptation.
- If she explores her environment and eats insects -> balanced. She eats insects but is not balanced, so she does not explore.
- Resilient -> explores and regenerates. Since she does not explore, she is not resilient.
- Thriving -> resilient, so she does not thrive.
- (Aquatic adaptation XOR terrestrial adaptation) -> thrives. Since she does not thrive, not (aquatic XOR terrestrial). With terrestrial false, aquatic must also be false.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
