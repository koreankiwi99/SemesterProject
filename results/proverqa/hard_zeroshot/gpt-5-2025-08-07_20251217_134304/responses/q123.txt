Question ID: 123
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Rosalina either obeys authority or is loyal to the state. Rosalina does not command respect. Rosalina is either loyal to the state or disloyal to the state, but not both. If Rosalina either questions policy or proposes reform (but not both), then she challenges the status quo. If Rosalina has strategic vision, then she either takes calculated risks or makes key decisions, but not both. For everyone, either they gain influence or they build strong relationships, but not necessarily both. Rosalina either gains influence or makes key decisions. Rosalina follows rules or obeys authority. If Haley either commands respect or makes key decisions (but not both), then she holds power. Rosalina influences others. Rosalina either challenges the status quo or obeys authority, but not both. If Rosalina either commands respect or makes key decisions (but not both), then she holds power. If Rosalina holds power, then she influences others and challenges the status quo. Rosalina builds strong relationships.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rosalina is disloyal to the state.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Rosalina either challenges the status quo or obeys authority, but not both,” we have CS(R) xor OA(R).
- From “Rosalina either obeys authority or is loyal to the state,” if OA(R) is false then LS(R) must be true. Hence CS(R) -> LS(R).
- From “If Rosalina either commands respect or makes key decisions (but not both), then she holds power,” and CR(R) is false, we get MKD(R) -> HP(R).
- From “If Rosalina holds power, then she influences others and challenges the status quo,” we get HP(R) -> CS(R). Thus MKD(R) -> CS(R) -> LS(R), so if MKD(R) is true, then DLS(R) is false.
- However, “Rosalina either gains influence or makes key decisions” allows MKD(R) to be false (taking GI(R) instead). In that case, OA(R) could be true, and then LS(R) could be either true or false; if LS(R) is false, by exclusivity with disloyalty, DLS(R) would be true.

Both DLS(R) true and DLS(R) false are consistent with the premises. Therefore, the statement cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
