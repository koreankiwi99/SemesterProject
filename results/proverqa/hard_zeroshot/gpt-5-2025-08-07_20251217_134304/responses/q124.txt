Options:

  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We know:
- Aila meets new people, so she rediscovers her passion and explores new interests.
- Given “Aila either rediscovers her passion or faces a personal crisis, but not both,” Aila does not face a personal crisis.
- Aila undergoes significant change, which implies she either loses a loved one or faces a personal crisis (but not both). Since she does not face a personal crisis, she must lose a loved one.
- Aila does not need time to heal, and “If (loses loved one XOR feels grief) then needs time to heal.” By contrapositive, not(needs time to heal) implies not(loses loved one XOR feels grief). Since she does lose a loved one, this forces that she also feels grief (so the XOR is false).

Thus Aila loses a loved one and feels grief. However, there is no rule defining “experiences tragedy” or linking it to losing a loved one or feeling grief. Without an explicit definition, we cannot conclude that “experiences tragedy” holds.
