Question ID: 125
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Augustine works hard, then he is either making breakthroughs or publishing papers (but not both). If Augustine exemplifies excellence, then he will win awards. If Augustine either conducts research or collects data (but not both), then he seeks knowledge. Augustine is either a famous scientist or an unknown scientist, but not both. Augustine does not explore ideas. Augustine gains respect. If Augustine wins awards, then he either earns recognition or gains respect (but not both). If Augustine conducts research, then he is either an unknown scientist or makes a breakthrough (or both). If Augustine works alone and avoids media, then he is an unknown scientist. Augustine solves puzzles. Augustine does not inspire others. Augustine does not analyze results. If Augustine is curious, then he either seeks knowledge or solves puzzles (but not both). Augustine earns recognition. Everyone explores ideas or is curious. Anyone who makes a breakthrough or wins awards inspires others. If someone monitors experiments, then they collect data. Augustine either analyzes results or collects data, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Augustine is a famous scientist.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “either analyzes results or collects data, but not both” and “does not analyze results,” Augustine collects data.
- Augustine does not explore ideas; since everyone explores ideas or is curious, Augustine is curious.
- If curious, then seeks knowledge or solves puzzles, but not both. Given he solves puzzles, he does not seek knowledge.
- If (conducts research XOR collects data) then seeks knowledge. Since he does not seek knowledge and he collects data, he must also conduct research (so the XOR is false).
- If he conducts research, then he is unknown or makes a breakthrough. He does not inspire others, and anyone who makes a breakthrough or wins awards inspires others; therefore he neither makes a breakthrough nor wins awards. Hence, he must be an unknown scientist.
- Since he is either a famous scientist or an unknown scientist, but not both, being unknown implies he is not famous.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
