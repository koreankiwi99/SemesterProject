Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Nathalia is not fearless.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Nathalia goes hiking and does not practice camping. By the XOR rule (hiking or camping but not both) she has outdoor hobbies. Since she does not appreciate scenic views, from the outdoor hobbies rule she must love nature.
- Nathalia values humility, and for her, achieving success and valuing humility are mutually exclusive. Therefore, she does not achieve success.
- From “If she pushes limits XOR develops skills then she achieves success” and not achieving success, we get not (pushes XOR develops). Given she does not push her limits, it follows she does not develop her skills.
- She enjoys challenges. Using the contrapositive of “If enjoys challenges and seeks thrills then develops skills,” not developing skills implies she does not seek thrills.
- From “takes risks or seeks thrills” and not seeking thrills, she takes risks. Then, “if timid or takes risks then adventurous” gives that she is adventurous. None of this determines whether she is timid.
- Nathalia is either fearless or timid, but not both. The information above does not resolve which of the two she is. Hence, we cannot conclude that she is not fearless.
