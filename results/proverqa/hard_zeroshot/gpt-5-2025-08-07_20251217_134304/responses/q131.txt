Question ID: 131
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Cupcake has golden eyes. If Cupcake is a solitary snake, then she lives in the rainforest. Cupcake is wild. Cupcake either has deadly precision or strikes quickly. Cupcake is not large. Cupcake is not carnivorous. If Cupcake is a wild snake and harmless, then she is not fierce. If Cupcake is aggressive, then she is venomous and dominates her territory. Cupcake has sharp fangs. If Cupcake has black scales, then she either has a coiled body or is large. If Cupcake lives in the rainforest, then she is either fierce or has deadly precision, but not both. For every snake, it is either venomous or non-venomous, but not both. Cupcake does not strike quickly. All snakes that have sharp teeth and attack preys are fierce. All snakes that have a coiled body and sharp fangs are carnivorous. If Cupcake has golden eyes, then she is either a snake that lives in the rainforest or a snake with black scales, but not both. Every snake is either harmless or venomous.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cupcake is non-venomous.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Cupcake either has deadly precision or strikes quickly" and "Cupcake does not strike quickly," conclude Cupcake has deadly precision.
- From "All snakes that have a coiled body and sharp fangs are carnivorous" and "Cupcake is not carnivorous" with "Cupcake has sharp fangs," infer Cupcake does not have a coiled body.
- From "If Cupcake has black scales, then she either has a coiled body or is large," together with "Cupcake is not large" and "Cupcake does not have a coiled body," infer Cupcake does not have black scales.
- From "If Cupcake has golden eyes, then she is either a snake that lives in the rainforest or a snake with black scales, but not both" and "Cupcake has golden eyes," plus "not black scales," conclude Cupcake lives in the rainforest.
- From "If Cupcake lives in the rainforest, then she is either fierce or has deadly precision, but not both," and we know she has deadly precision, conclude Cupcake is not fierce.

None of the given rules imply whether Cupcake is venomous or non-venomous. The axioms state every snake is either venomous or non-venomous (but not both), and either harmless or venomous, but no rule ties her established properties (rainforest, deadly precision, not fierce, not carnivorous) to venomous or non-venomous. Therefore, her venom status cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
