Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ensley is a nature lover.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Ensley is an entrepreneur and does not support sustainability. From "If entrepreneur, then environmentally conscious XOR supports sustainability," this forces environmentally conscious (EC) to be true.
2) Ensley is a local business owner. From "If local business owner, then environmentally conscious XOR lives in the suburbs," with EC true, it follows she does not live in the suburbs (S is false).
3) From "(urban dweller XOR suburbs) -> community oriented" and S is false, this reduces to "urban dweller -> community oriented." Since Ensley is not community oriented, she is not an urban dweller (UD is false).
4) From "either urban dweller or rural resident" and UD false, Ensley is a rural resident (RR true).
5) From "city enthusiast XOR rural resident" and RR true, Ensley is not a city enthusiast (CE false).
6) From "nature lover XOR city enthusiast" and CE false, Ensley is a nature lover (NL true).

Therefore, the statement is true.
