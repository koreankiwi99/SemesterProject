Question ID: 137
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Coraline is a botanist, then she either focuses on flora or explores deserts, but not both. Coraline either publishes research papers or develops new technologies, but not both. If someone explores deserts, then they do not necessarily study cacti, and if someone studies cacti, then they do not necessarily explore deserts. Coraline either works independently or collaborates with colleagues, but not both. Coraline teaches students or publishes research papers. Coraline is a botanist. If Coraline studies cacti, then she can either develop new technologies or inspire new generations, but not both. Coraline either collaborates with colleagues or publishes research papers, but not both. Coraline does not work independently. Coraline focuses on flora.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Coraline does not inspire new generations.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Botanist and (flora XOR deserts) and given Coraline focuses on flora, she does not explore deserts (E = false).
- Works independently XOR collaborates, and given not independent, she collaborates (C = true).
- Collaborates XOR publishes implies she does not publish (P = false).
- Publishes XOR develops implies she develops new technologies (D = true).
- Teaches OR publishes and not publishing implies she teaches (T = true).
- If she studies cacti (S), then (develops XOR inspires). Since D = true, S would force inspires (I) to be false. But S itself is unconstrained by the given information (the “not necessarily” statements provide no definite implication).

Therefore, if S is true, I is false; if S is false, I could be either true or false. We cannot determine whether she inspires new generations.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
