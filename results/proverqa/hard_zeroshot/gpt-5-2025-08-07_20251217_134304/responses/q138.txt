Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Koa shares local knowledge.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Koa studies abroad, and if (studies abroad XOR immerses) then he would broaden perspective. Given he does not broaden, XOR must be false; since he studies abroad, he must also immerse. So Koa immerses himself in a foreign culture.
- If he immerses, then he appreciates indigenous history or values native traditions. Given he does not value native traditions, he must appreciate indigenous history.
- If he appreciates indigenous history, then he respects local culture or supports local artisans. From collecting ethnic artifacts and patronizing local businesses (with the XOR rule), he cannot support local artisans. Thus he must respect local culture.
- If he respects local culture, then he either masters traditional crafts or shares local knowledge (or both).
- We cannot rule out mastering traditional crafts, because the rule about mastering crafts only implies he can become a community leader, not that he does; and we are told only that he does not become one. Hence we cannot exclude mastering crafts.

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Koa shares local knowledge.
