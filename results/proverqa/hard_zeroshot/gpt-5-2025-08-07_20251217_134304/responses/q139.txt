==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
From Griffin seeks knowledge and the rule that seekers of knowledge either read widely or ask questions, combined with Griffin does not read widely, we infer Griffin asks questions.

Given Griffin asks questions and enjoys learning, he is curious. If someone is curious, they seek new experiences; hence Griffin seeks new experiences. Therefore, by the rule for Griffin, he will travel extensively.

Griffin either follows traditions or explores cultures, but not both, and he does not follow traditions; thus he explores cultures. If Griffin explores cultures, then he either samples local spirits or creates unique blends (or both). Since Griffin does not create unique blends, he must sample local spirits.

Having both travels extensively and samples local spirits, the rule specific to Griffin implies he becomes a master distiller.
