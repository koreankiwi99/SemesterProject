Question ID: 142
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Kyro explores cosmology. Kyro does not achieve breakthroughs. If Nash pursues interdimensional travel, then he will visit a parallel dimension. Amelia does not make history. If someone embraces curiosity and paves new paths, then they can achieve breakthroughs. Kyro either explores cosmology or studies physics, but not both. Kyro does not gain recognition. Kyro studies physics or pursues interdimensional travel. If Kyro pursues interdimensional travel, then he will visit a parallel dimension. If Kyro visits a parallel dimension, then he will either revolutionize our understanding of the universe or open up new possibilities, but not both. Anyone who thinks outside the box or dreams big can pave new paths. All people who read widely and ask questions will embrace curiosity. Anyone who opens up new possibilities either gains recognition or inspires innovation (or both). Kyro does not push boundaries. Kyro does not make history. Anyone who thinks outside the box will open up new possibilities. Anyone who thinks creatively or makes discoveries will push boundaries. Anyone who inspires innovation either makes history or paves new paths (or both). If Kyro either embraces curiosity or seeks answers (but not both), then he makes discoveries. If Kyro solves complex equations or conducts experiments, then he studies physics. Kyro seeks answers.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kyro revolutionizes our understanding of the universe.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Kyro explores cosmology, and “EC or SP, but not both” implies he does not study physics. Given “SP or PIT,” Kyro must pursue interdimensional travel, hence he visits a parallel dimension.
- From visiting a parallel dimension, exactly one of: Kyro revolutionizes our understanding (ROU) or opens up new possibilities (OUP) holds.
- Kyro seeks answers. If he did not embrace curiosity, then by the XOR rule he would make discoveries, which by “discoveries -> push boundaries” would contradict “Kyro does not push boundaries.” Therefore, Kyro embraces curiosity.
- If OUP were true, then OUP -> (gains recognition or inspires innovation). Since Kyro does not gain recognition, he must inspire innovation, which implies (makes history or paves new paths). Since Kyro does not make history, he must pave new paths. With embraces curiosity and paves new paths, Kyro would achieve breakthroughs, contradicting “Kyro does not achieve breakthroughs.” Hence OUP is false.
- Therefore, by the XOR from visiting a parallel dimension, ROU must be true.

ANSWER: True
