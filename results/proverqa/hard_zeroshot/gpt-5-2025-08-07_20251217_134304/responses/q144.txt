Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Selah sources locally, so by the universal rule she prioritizes sustainability; hence she cares for her community and minimizes waste.
- It is also stated that Selah advocates for social causes, and caring for the community and advocating are mutually exclusive for Selah, creating a contradiction about whether she cares for her community. This does not affect whether she builds a successful business.
- The only rule that yields “Selah builds a successful business” is: if Selah is passionate about cooking, then she creates unique recipes and builds a successful business.
- Although Selah does create unique recipes, that does not imply she is passionate about cooking. We only have “Selah enjoys food or is passionate about cooking,” and we cannot eliminate the “enjoys food” disjunct.
- No other rule derives or denies that Selah is passionate about cooking. Therefore, we cannot determine whether she builds a successful business.

ANSWER: Uncertain
