Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Margot is not determined.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From (Adaptable or Experience) and Not Experience, Margot is Adaptable.
- If Adaptable then (Stays Calm xor Acts Quickly). Given she stays calm, she does not act quickly.
- From Faces Challenges, Margot thinks critically (and learns lessons).
- Thus, (Thinks Critically xor Acts Quickly) holds, so Margot has Resourcefulness.
- Margot avoids uncertainty, and (Resilient xor Avoids Uncertainty) implies she is not Resilient.
- From (Overcome Challenges or Seek Adventures) -> Resilient and Not Resilient, we get Not Overcome Challenges.
- From (Determined and Resourceful) -> Overcome Challenges, with Resourceful true and Not Overcome Challenges, we infer Not Determined.

ANSWER: True
