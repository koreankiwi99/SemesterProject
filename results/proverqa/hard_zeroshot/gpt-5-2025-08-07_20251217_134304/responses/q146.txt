==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Madeleine is attentive and the rule “If Madeleine is attentive, then she either has good memory or is intuitive (but not both)”, plus “Madeleine is not intuitive”, we infer Madeleine has good memory.
- From “Madeleine either retains knowledge or lacks focus, but not both” and “Madeleine lacks focus”, we infer she does not retain knowledge.
- From “Madeleine cares for others” and “If someone cares for others, then they show empathy”, we infer Madeleine shows empathy. With “Madeleine either understands others or shows empathy, but not both”, we get that she does not understand others.
- From “Everyone either uses language to communicate or understands others” and Madeleine does not understand others, we infer she uses language to communicate.
- The only rule linking to cognitive skills is “If someone is erudite, then they possess cognitive skills,” and we have no information that Madeleine is erudite. Thus, whether she possesses cognitive skills is not determined.

Therefore, the conjunction “Madeleine possesses cognitive skills and uses language to communicate” is not established as true or false.
