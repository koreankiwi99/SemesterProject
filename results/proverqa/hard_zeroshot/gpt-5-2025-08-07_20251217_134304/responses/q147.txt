Question ID: 147
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Ashton is resourceful. Anyone who has good instincts or attacks problems can think creatively. If Ashton is resourceful, then he is either adaptable or experienced (but not both). If Ashton is adaptable, then he either works well under pressure or thinks creatively (but not both). Ashton attacks problems. Ashton either respects nature or is innovative, but not both. Ashton either respects nature or embraces challenges, but not both. For Ashton, being able to stay calm and working well under pressure are mutually exclusive. Ashton does not stay calm. Ashton has good instincts. For anyone, embracing challenges and having experience leads to overcoming obstacles. Ashton cannot overcome obstacles.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ashton does not enable exploration.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We know:
- Good instincts or attacking problems implies thinking creatively; Ashton has both, so he thinks creatively.
- Resourceful implies exactly one of adaptable or experienced.
- If adaptable, then exactly one of (works well under pressure, thinks creatively); since he thinks creatively, if adaptable then he does not work well under pressure.
- Respects nature XOR innovative, and respects nature XOR embraces challenges.
- Embracing challenges AND experienced implies overcoming obstacles; Ashton cannot overcome obstacles, so not(embraces challenges AND experienced).

Case analysis:
- If experienced, then to avoid overcoming obstacles, he must not embrace challenges; thus respects nature true and innovative false.
- If adaptable (not experienced), embraces challenges may be either true or false (and respects nature/innovative adjust via XORs).

Nothing in the premises defines or links “enable exploration” to any other property. Therefore, whether Ashton “does not enable exploration” cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
