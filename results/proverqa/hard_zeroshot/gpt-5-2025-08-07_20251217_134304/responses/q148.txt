Context:
If Emmy has refined taste, then she is either a food critic or a culinary innovator, but not both. If Emmy studies wine and knows vintages, then she can be a sommelier. Kenneth is a discerning diner. Emmy does not appreciate fine wine. If Emmy either experiments with ingredients or understands flavors (but not both), then she creates masterpieces. If someone masters cooking techniques and sources high-quality ingredients, then they are a culinary expert. Emmy pioneers new recipes. Anyone who pioneers new recipes is a culinary innovator. Anyone who is a sommelier or has wine knowledge appreciates fine wine. Emmy is a discerning diner. If Emmy is either a culinary expert or a food critique (but not both), then she understands flavors. Joel does not create masterpieces. If Emmy is a discerning diner, then she is either a sommelier or has refined taste, but not both. Emmy does not experiment with ingredients. Emmy does not create masterpieces.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Emmy appreciates cultural heritage.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Anyone who is a sommelier or has wine knowledge appreciates fine wine” and “Emmy does not appreciate fine wine,” Emmy is neither a sommelier nor has wine knowledge.
- Since “Emmy is a discerning diner” and thus “either a sommelier or has refined taste, but not both,” she must have refined taste.
- “Emmy pioneers new recipes” and “Anyone who pioneers new recipes is a culinary innovator” imply Emmy is a culinary innovator. Given refined taste implies “either food critic or culinary innovator, but not both,” she is not a food critic.
- From “Emmy does not experiment with ingredients,” the rule “(experiments XOR understands flavors) -> creates masterpieces,” and “Emmy does not create masterpieces,” it follows she does not understand flavors.
- Therefore the condition “(culinary expert XOR food critic) -> understands flavors” is not met; with food critic false, this implies she is not a culinary expert.

None of the given statements relate to appreciating cultural heritage, so whether Emmy appreciates cultural heritage cannot be determined.
