Context:
If Kiaan is a conservationist, then she is either a veterinarian or works with animals, but not both. Mckenzie either has a scientific background or is an ecologist, but not both. For every human, either they are an elephant handler or they are not an elephant handler, but not both. If Emberly protects the environment, then she is either a conservationist or an ecologist, but not both. Mckenzie protects the environment. Mckenzie has a scientific background. Xiomara protects the environment. If Mckenzie heals animals, then she is a veterinarian. If Mckenzie works with animals, then she is an elephant handler. If Mckenzie protects the environment, then she is either a conservationist or an ecologist, but not both. If Mckenzie is a conservationist, then she is either a veterinarian or works with animals, but not both. If Xiomara studies wildlife or understands animal behavior, then she can be a zoologist. If Kiaan is a zoologist, then she is either a veterinarian or an animal researcher, but not both. If Mckenzie loves nature, then she is an ecologist. If someone either cares for pets or trains horses (but not both), then they work with animals. If Emberly works with animals, then she is an elephant handler. If Mckenzie studies wildlife or understands animal behavior, then she can be a zoologist. If Mckenzie is a zoologist, then she is either a veterinarian or an animal researcher, but not both. Mckenzie is an animal researcher. Mckenzie understands animal behavior. Emberly understands animal behavior.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Mckenzie handles elephants.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Mckenzie has a scientific background, and by the exclusive-or (scientific background XOR ecologist), she is not an ecologist.
- Since Mckenzie protects the environment and (conservationist XOR ecologist), she must be a conservationist.
- As a conservationist, she is (veterinarian XOR works with animals).
- Mckenzie understands animal behavior, so she can be a zoologist; using this as zoologist, and with the rule (zoologist -> veterinarian XOR animal researcher) plus the fact that she is an animal researcher, it follows she is not a veterinarian.
- Therefore, from (veterinarian XOR works with animals), she works with animals.
- If Mckenzie works with animals, then she is an elephant handler.

So, Mckenzie handles elephants.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
