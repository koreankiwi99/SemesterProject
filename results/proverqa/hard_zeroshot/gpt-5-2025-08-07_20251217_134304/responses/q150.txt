Question ID: 150
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Monroe listens actively. Monroe is either diplomatic or impulsive, but not both. If Monroe builds trust, then he understands cultures and thinks critically. Monroe does not think critically. Monroe negotiates effectively. Anyone who is diplomatic or builds trust can resolve conflicts. Monroe does not have emotional intelligence. Monroe does not find common ground. Everyone who listens actively either builds strong relationships or finds common ground (or both). If Monroe has leadership skills, then he either resolves conflicts or negotiates effectively, but not both. Monroe either speaks multiple languages or has emotional intelligence, but not both. Monroe remains calm. If Monroe remains calm and communicates clearly, then he has leadership skills.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Monroe is not impulsive.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "If Monroe builds trust, then he understands cultures and thinks critically" and "Monroe does not think critically," conclude Monroe does not build trust.
- From "Anyone who is diplomatic or builds trust can resolve conflicts" and not building trust, if Monroe is diplomatic then he resolves conflicts.
- From "Monroe negotiates effectively" and "If Monroe has leadership skills, then he either resolves conflicts or negotiates effectively, but not both": if he has leadership skills, then he cannot both resolve conflicts and negotiate effectively.
- "If Monroe remains calm and communicates clearly, then he has leadership skills." We know he remains calm, but we do not know whether he communicates clearly; thus leadership skills are uncertain.
- "Monroe is either diplomatic or impulsive, but not both." We cannot determine which, because:
  - A consistent scenario exists where Monroe is diplomatic (thus not impulsive), does resolve conflicts, and lacks leadership skills (by not communicating clearly).
  - A consistent scenario exists where Monroe is impulsive (thus not diplomatic). If he also has leadership skills (by communicating clearly), then he must not resolve conflicts, which is consistent with not being diplomatic and not building trust.

Because both cases are consistent with all given statements, whether Monroe is not impulsive cannot be determined.
