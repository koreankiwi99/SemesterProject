Question ID: 151
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Mia is highly respected, then she is either an expert in her field or charismatic, but not both. Mia is not charismatic. Anyone who has expertise in their field either serves clients well or adeptly navigates complex markets (or both). If someone has high integrity, then they build trust and achieve success. Mia either manages risk or serves clients, but not necessarily both. If Mia is either of high integrity or highly skilled (but not both), then she is highly respected. Mia builds trust. Mia communicates effectively with her clients. Mia does not achieve success. Everyone either navigates complex financial markets or communicates effectively with their clients, but not both is not a requirement. Mia manages risk.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Mia is not highly skilled.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If someone has high integrity, then they build trust and achieve success” and “Mia does not achieve success,” we get ¬HI (Mia is not of high integrity) by modus tollens.
- The condition “If Mia is either of high integrity or highly skilled (but not both), then she is highly respected” becomes HS → HR given ¬HI.
- If HS is true, then HR is true. With HR and ¬C, we get E (expert), and E implies S ∨ N. This is consistent with all other facts (including ¬A), so HS could be true.
- If HS is false, no rule forces HR or E, and all given facts remain consistent. So HS could also be false.

Since both HS and ¬HS are possible, we cannot determine that Mia is not highly skilled.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
