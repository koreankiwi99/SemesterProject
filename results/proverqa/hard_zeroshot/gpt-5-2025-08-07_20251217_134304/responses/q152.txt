Question ID: 152
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Sylvia studies electromagnetic waves and conducts innovative experiments, then she will make groundbreaking discoveries. Sylvia understands wave theory. If Sylvia explores new ideas, then she either collaborates with others or advances her field. If someone collects data and understands wave theory, then they can analyze signal patterns. Sylvia does not advance her field. Sylvia explores new ideas or conducts innovative experiments. Sylvia builds on existing research. If Sylvia has a PhD, then she either analyzes signal patterns or specializes in acoustics, but not both. Sylvia collects data. If someone has curiosity, then they explore new ideas and solve complex problems. If Sylvia either analyzes signal patterns or studies electromagnetic waves (but not both), then she pioneers new technologies. For Sylvia, pioneering new technologies and building on existing research are mutually exclusive. Sylvia does not collaborate with others.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sylvia will make groundbreaking discoveries.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If Sylvia explores new ideas, then she either collaborates with others or advances her field,” together with “Sylvia does not collaborate with others” and “Sylvia does not advance her field,” we get that Sylvia does not explore new ideas.
- Given “Sylvia explores new ideas or conducts innovative experiments,” this implies she conducts innovative experiments.
- From “Sylvia collects data” and “Sylvia understands wave theory,” and the rule “If someone collects data and understands wave theory, then they can analyze signal patterns,” we get she analyzes signal patterns.
- “Pioneering new technologies and building on existing research are mutually exclusive,” and “Sylvia builds on existing research,” imply she does not pioneer new technologies.
- From “If Sylvia either analyzes signal patterns or studies electromagnetic waves (but not both), then she pioneers new technologies,” and the fact she does not pioneer new technologies, we conclude it is not the case that exactly one of {analyzes, studies EM waves} holds. Since she does analyze, she must also study electromagnetic waves.
- Now she both studies electromagnetic waves and conducts innovative experiments, so by “If Sylvia studies electromagnetic waves and conducts innovative experiments, then she will make groundbreaking discoveries,” she will make groundbreaking discoveries.
