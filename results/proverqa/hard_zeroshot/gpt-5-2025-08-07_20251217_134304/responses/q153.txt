Question ID: 153
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Evelyn either loves unconditionally or cherishes memories, but not both. Evelyn has a positive outlook. Evelyn either finds inner peace or experiences hardship, but not both. If Evelyn has a positive outlook, then she either appreciates beauty or enjoys life, but not both. Anyone who values connections or puts others first can love unconditionally. Evelyn either pursues happiness or finds inner peace, but not both. Evelyn cherishes memories. Evelyn appreciates beauty. For all humans, if they experience hardship or love unconditionally (or both), then they develop resilience. Everyone enjoys life or pursues happiness.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Evelyn does not develop resilience.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Evelyn cherishes memories (C). From “Loves unconditionally XOR cherishes memories,” C implies not L.
- Positive outlook implies “Appreciates beauty XOR enjoys life.” Given appreciates beauty (A), enjoys life (J) is false.
- Everyone enjoys life or pursues happiness; since J is false, pursues happiness (PH) is true.
- From “Pursues happiness XOR finds inner peace,” PH true implies not finds inner peace (not F).
- From “Finds inner peace XOR experiences hardship,” not F implies experiences hardship (H) is true.
- From “If experiences hardship or loves unconditionally, then develops resilience,” H true implies develops resilience (R) is true.

Therefore, the claim that Evelyn does not develop resilience is false.

ANSWER: False
