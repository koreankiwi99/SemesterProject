- From "designs interiors or builds structures, but not both," not designing interiors implies builds structures.
- If he builds structures, then he understands physics.
- As an architect, he must satisfy exactly one of (understands physics, appreciates mathematics). Since he understands physics, he does not appreciate mathematics.
- From "appreciates mathematics or values artistic expression (or both)," and not appreciating mathematics, it follows that he values artistic expression.
