Question ID: 157
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Anyone who reads widely and thinks critically can have innovative thoughts. Rosalia is creative. Anyone who keeps detailed notes or measures carefully can value precision. Rosalia is attentive. Rosalia does not rely on intuition. Rosalia conducts experiments. For Rosalia, she is either logical or relies on intuition, but not both. Rosalia does not publish research. If Rosalia can solve complex problems, then she is either creative or logical (but not both). If Rosalia is attentive, then she is either detail-oriented or can appreciate beauty, but not both. If Rosalia loves nature or has a calm mind, then she is likely to make groundbreaking discoveries. Rosalia does not have keen observation. Rosalia does not think outside the box. If Rosalia either makes groundbreaking discoveries or publishes research (but not both), then she has innovative thoughts. If someone conducts experiments, then they value precision. Anyone who has keen observation or loves nature can appreciate beauty. If Rosalia either thinks outside the box or has innovative thoughts (but not both), then she can solve complex problems.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rosalia has a calm mind.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From not relying on intuition and “logical XOR intuition,” Rosalia is logical.
- With both creative and logical true, “if solves complex problems then creative XOR logical” implies she cannot solve complex problems.
- From “(thinks outside the box XOR innovative) → solves complex problems” and not thinking outside the box, she is not innovative.
- From “(makes groundbreaking discoveries XOR publishes) → innovative” and not publishing, she does not make groundbreaking discoveries.
- From “(loves nature OR calm mind) → makes groundbreaking discoveries” and not making groundbreaking discoveries, she neither loves nature nor has a calm mind.

Therefore, Rosalia does not have a calm mind.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
