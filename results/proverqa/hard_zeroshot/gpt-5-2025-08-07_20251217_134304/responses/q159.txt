Context:
Thomas either makes a social impact or pursues personal gain, but not both. If Thomas contributes to wildlife conservation, then he either has ecological knowledge or takes community action, but not both. If someone possesses expertise and shares knowledge, then they can educate others. If Thomas either lives in the savannah or works with animals (but not both), then he protects the environment. Thomas supports conservation or pursues academic research. Thomas pursues personal gain. Thomas either pursues academic research or educates others, but not both. Everyone who protects the environment loves nature. If Thomas either takes community action or educates others (but not both), then he makes a social impact. If Thomas studies the elands or lives in the savannah (or both), then he contributes to wildlife conservation. Thomas does not love nature. If Thomas either tracks wildlife or explores rural areas (but not both), then he lives in the savannah. Thomas does not understand animal behavior. Thomas values biodiversity or has ecological knowledge. If Thomas has ecological knowledge, then he understands animal behavior. Thomas does not work with animals. Thomas does not support conservation.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Thomas studies the elands.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Thomas pursues personal gain, and since SocialImpact XOR Gain, he does not make a social impact.
- From (CommunityAction XOR Educates) -> SocialImpact and SocialImpact is false, we get not-XOR, i.e., CommunityAction and Educates are either both true or both false.
- SupportsConservation is false, but SupportsConservation or AcademicResearch holds, so AcademicResearch is true. From AcademicResearch XOR Educates, Educates is false. Hence CommunityAction is also false.
- Not LovesNature and (ProtectsEnvironment -> LovesNature) give Not ProtectsEnvironment. From (Savannah XOR WorksWithAnimals) -> ProtectsEnvironment and Not WorksWithAnimals, we get Not Savannah.
- Not UnderstandAnimalBehavior and (EcologicalKnowledge -> UnderstandAnimalBehavior) give Not EcologicalKnowledge.
- From Contributes -> (EcologicalKnowledge XOR CommunityAction) and both are false, Contributes is false.
- From (StudiesElands or Savannah) -> Contributes, with Contributes false and Savannah false, we conclude Not StudiesElands.

Therefore, the statement "Thomas studies the elands." is false.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
