Question ID: 160
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Every parasitic organism either manipulates its environment or is adaptable. If Queenie dominates her host, then she either manipulates her environment or responds to stimuli. If Queenie is adaptable, then she either thrives in her host or feeds efficiently, but not both. If Queenie is resilient, then she reproduces rapidly and forms complex relationships. Queenie does not evade detection. Queenie is resilient. Every parasitic organism that reproduces rapidly either evades detection or feeds efficiently (or both). Queenie dominates her host. Queenie responds to stimuli. Queenie forms complex relationships.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Queenie multiplies rapidly.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Given: Queenie is resilient.
- Rule: If Queenie is resilient, then she reproduces rapidly and forms complex relationships.
- Therefore, Queenie reproduces (multiplies) rapidly.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: True
Correct: No
