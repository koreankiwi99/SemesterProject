Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Theo values precision, then he achieves success. Theo either pursues creativity or revolutionizes industries. If Theo improves lives, then he deserves awards. Theo takes risks. If Theo is curious, then he either thinks outside the box or takes risks (but not both). If Theo gains recognition, then he improves lives. If Theo is ambitious, then he is either detail-oriented or values precision, but not both. Theo is either detail-oriented and values precision, or he is curious, but not both. Theo does not deserve awards. If someone pursues creativity, then they think outside the box. Theo does not achieve success.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Theo is not innovative.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If Theo values precision then he achieves success” and “Theo does not achieve success,” infer Theo does not value precision.
- From “Either (detail-oriented and values precision) or curious, but not both,” and not valuing precision, infer Theo is curious.
- From “If curious then either thinks outside the box or takes risks, but not both,” and “Theo takes risks,” infer Theo does not think outside the box.
- From “If someone pursues creativity then they think outside the box,” and not thinking outside the box, infer Theo does not pursue creativity.
- From “Theo either pursues creativity or revolutionizes industries,” and not pursuing creativity, infer Theo revolutionizes industries.
- From “If Theo improves lives then he deserves awards,” and “Theo does not deserve awards,” infer Theo does not improve lives; hence he does not gain recognition (since gains recognition implies improves lives).

“Innovative” is never defined in the premises, and no rule links it to any of the derived properties (e.g., revolutionizing industries, thinking outside the box, etc.). Therefore, the truth of “Theo is not innovative” cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain
