  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Sweetie either makes a good companion or requires intensive care, but not both” and “Sweetie requires intensive care,” conclude she does not make a good companion.
- From “If high-strung or has good breeding, then she makes a good companion,” contraposition yields not high-strung and not good breeding.
- From “either calm and patient or high-strung, but not both” and not high-strung, conclude calm and patient.
- From “Sweetie has a trusting nature” and “If trusting nature then strong instincts and naturally calm,” conclude naturally calm (and strong instincts).
- Given “well-trained” and “naturally calm,” the rule “If experienced mount then either well-trained or naturally calm, but not both” forces not experienced mount.
- From “either ridden by a skilled rider or an experienced mount, but not both” and not experienced mount, conclude she is ridden by a skilled rider.

However, no premise links “ridden by a skilled rider” with “not ridden by a novice rider,” and nothing forbids both rider types in the absence of an explicit exclusivity statement. Therefore, the claim “Sweetie is not ridden by a novice rider” is not entailed.
