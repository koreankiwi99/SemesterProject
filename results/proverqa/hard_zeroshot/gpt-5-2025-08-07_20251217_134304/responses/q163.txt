Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Enoch pays attention to detail.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We want to know if Enoch pays attention to detail (D(E)).

Given:
- (W(E) XOR I(E)) -> B(E) and ¬B(E). Therefore, ¬(W(E) XOR I(E)), so W(E) and I(E) have the same truth value: either both true or both false.
- M(E) ∨ I(E). This leaves two consistent possibilities: (I and W both true) or (I and W both false with M true). Neither case entails D(E).
- The only rule involving D is: SP(x) -> (I(x) ∨ D(x)). We cannot infer SP(E) because SP(E) requires A(E) ∧ Pn(E) and we have no information about Enoch’s patient nature. Even if SP(E) held, it would only give I(E) ∨ D(E), not D(E) specifically.

Thus, D(E) cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
