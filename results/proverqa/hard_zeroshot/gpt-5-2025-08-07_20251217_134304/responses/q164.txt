Context:
If Kennedi rejects inbreeding, then she either prioritizes inclusivity or embraces cultural exchange (but not both). If Caroline either respects all backgrounds or values social mixing (but not both), then she prioritizes inclusivity. Caroline seeks change. Caroline does not seek a global perspective. Caroline will marry outside her family if she rejects tradition. If Lakelyn values diversity and seeks global connections, then she is likely to marry outside her family. If Caroline seeks change, then she either values open-mindedness or prioritizes inclusivity (or both). If Reece either seeks a global perspective or fosters social connections (but not both), then she rejects inbreeding. If Caroline rejects inbreeding, then she either prioritizes inclusivity or embraces cultural exchange (but not both). If Caroline values diversity and seeks global connections, then she is likely to marry outside her family. Reece appreciates culture or values diversity. If Caroline either seeks a global perspective or fosters social connections (but not both), then she rejects inbreeding. Caroline appreciates culture or values diversity. If Caroline desires personal growth, then she seeks global connections and embraces new experiences. Lakelyn does not seek a global perspective. For all humans, if they marry outside their family, then they reduce genetic disorders and improve their health prospects. Caroline either embraces cultural exchange or seeks global connections. Caroline does not appreciate culture. Caroline improves her health prospects. Caroline fosters social connections. Caroline does not value open-mindedness.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Caroline reduces genetic disorders.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From Caroline seeks change and does not value open-mindedness, we infer she prioritizes inclusivity.
- From Caroline fosters social connections and does not seek a global perspective, the exclusive-or rule gives that she rejects inbreeding.
- From rejecting inbreeding and the exclusive-or (prioritizes inclusivity or embraces cultural exchange), together with prioritizing inclusivity, we infer she does not embrace cultural exchange.
- From (embraces cultural exchange or seeks global connections) and not embracing cultural exchange, we infer she seeks global connections.
- From (appreciates culture or values diversity) and not appreciating culture, we infer she values diversity.
- From valuing diversity and seeking global connections, we only get that she is likely to marry outside her family, not that she certainly will.
- The only given rule that yields “reduces genetic disorders” is: if one marries outside their family, then they reduce genetic disorders. We do not know for certain that Caroline marries outside her family. Her improved health prospects do not imply that she married outside her family.

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Caroline reduces genetic disorders.
