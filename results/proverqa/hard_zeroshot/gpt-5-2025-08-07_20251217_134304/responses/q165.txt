==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Jon experiences a health scare” and “Everyone who experiences a health scare either seeks medical attention or has a medical condition (or both)” plus “Jon does not seek medical attention,” we conclude Jon has a medical condition.
- Given “If Jon has a medical condition, then he will either change his lifestyle or learn methods to prevent future episodes, but not both,” and the fact “Jon changes his lifestyle,” it follows (by exclusivity) that Jon does not learn methods to prevent future episodes.
- Therefore, the consequent “either quit singing or learn methods to prevent future episodes, but not both” reduces to “quit singing” (since the “learn methods” option is excluded).
- There is no premise connecting laryngospasm to quitting singing. The only rule about quitting singing requires fearing public performance, which is not established.
- Hence, whether Jon would quit singing if he experienced laryngospasm cannot be determined from the given information.
