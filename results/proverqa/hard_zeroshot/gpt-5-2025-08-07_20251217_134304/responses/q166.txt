==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Rocco works with his local community” and “Rocco either works with his local community or exposes corruption, but not both,” we get ¬ExposesCorruption(Rocco).
- Rocco is outspoken and “If Rocco is outspoken, then he either supports human rights or stands up for others, but not both,” plus “Rocco does not support human rights,” implies StandsUpForOthers(Rocco).
- “Rocco either raises awareness or speaks against discrimination” and “Rocco does not raise awareness” implies SpeaksAgainstDiscrimination(Rocco).
- “If Rocco either speaks against discrimination or exposes corruption (but not both), then he challenges unfair systems,” with D true and E false gives ChallengesUnfairSystems(Rocco).
- “Anyone who stands up for others and challenges unfair systems fights for equality” yields FightsForEquality(Rocco).

There is no rule connecting Rocco’s properties to “values social justice,” and the only statement involving “values social justice” concerns Kylie. Therefore, whether Rocco values social justice cannot be determined.
