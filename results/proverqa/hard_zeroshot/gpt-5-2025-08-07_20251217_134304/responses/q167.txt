Kevin protects marine life or studies the ocean. Vida either explores terrestrial ecosystems or studies the ocean, but not both. Kevin either investigates ecosystems or pursues space research. Kevin conducts research. If Kevin has a backpack or enjoys hiking, then he can explore terrestrial ecosystems. Kevin is a professor. If someone educates students, then they do not necessarily inspire others, and vice versa. If Kevin has passion, then he can either inspire others or develop innovative solutions, but not both. Kevin does not investigate ecosystems. Kevin either explores terrestrial ecosystems or studies the ocean, but not both. If Kevin studies the ocean, then he can either discover new species or inspire others, but not both. If Kevin is a professor, then he either conducts research or educates students, but not both. Kevin either pursues space research or explores terrestrial ecosystems, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kevin discovers new species.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Kevin does not investigate ecosystems. From "Kevin either investigates ecosystems or pursues space research," this forces Kevin pursues space research.
- From "Kevin either pursues space research or explores terrestrial ecosystems, but not both," Kevin does not explore terrestrial ecosystems.
- From "Kevin either explores terrestrial ecosystems or studies the ocean, but not both," Kevin studies the ocean.
- Given "If Kevin studies the ocean, then he can either discover new species or inspire others, but not both," we only know he has the capability to do one of these, not which one actually occurs.
- No other statements force him to discover new species or prohibit inspiring others.

Therefore, whether Kevin discovers new species cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
