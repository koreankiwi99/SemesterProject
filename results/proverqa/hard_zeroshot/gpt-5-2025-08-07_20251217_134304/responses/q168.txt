Question ID: 168
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Eugene is curious, then he collects seeds. Rachel does not nurture plants. If Eugene travels extensively, then he either enjoys hiking or discovers rare species (or both). Eugene does not participate in ecological projects. If someone loves gardening and has a greenhouse, then they can work outdoors. If Ian works outdoors, then he either enjoys hiking or appreciates nature (but not both). If Eugene values serenity, then he either cultivates beauty or loves gardening (or both). If Ian travels extensively, then he either enjoys hiking or discovers rare species (or both). Eugene does not nurture plants. Leonidas does not discover rare species. Eugene does not discover rare species. Rachel does not read botany books. Anyone who admires flora or grows their own plants can love gardening. If Rachel either reads botany books or visits gardens (but not both), then he collects seeds. If Eugene either joins botany clubs or attends arboretums (but not both), then he dedicates time to botany. Rachel does not participate in ecological projects. Eugene values serenity. Everyone who either dedicates time to botany or participates in ecological projects (but not both) appreciates nature. Eugene does not read botany books. Eugene does not cultivate beauty. Ian travels extensively. Eugene travels extensively. Rachel does not cultivate beauty. If Eugene works outdoors, then he either enjoys hiking or appreciates nature (but not both). Eugene visits gardens. For all humans, if they either collect seeds or have a greenhouse (but not both), then they nurture plants. If Eugene either reads botany books or visits gardens (but not both), then he collects seeds.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Eugene does not develop expertise in plants.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
We need to see whether “develop expertise in plants” is entailed or contradicted by the given predicates. That predicate never appears in the premises, nor is it defined in terms of any provided predicates (e.g., dedicates time to botany, participates in ecological projects, reads botany books, etc.).

From the premises we can derive several facts about Eugene:
- RB(E) is false and VG(E) is true, so by the XOR rule Eugene collects seeds (CS(E)).
- With CS(E) and the rule XOR(CS, GH) -> NP plus not NP(E), we get GH(E) is true (contraposition).
- VS(E) is true and not CB(E), so LG(E) is true.
- LG(E) and GH(E) imply WO(E).
- TE(E) and not DR(E) imply EH(E). Then WO(E) -> (EH xor AN) forces AN(E) false.
- With PEP(E) false and the rule (DTB xor PEP) -> AN, this reduces to DTB(E) -> AN(E); since AN(E) is false, we get not DTB(E).

None of this specifies or logically equates to “develop expertise in plants.” Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of the queried statement from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
