Question ID: 169
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Avah either advances her field or becomes a public figure, but not both. If Avah either reads academic papers or attends conferences (but not both), then she is a researcher. Avah has strong attention to detail. For all humans, if someone is a skilled forensic scientist, then they can solve complex cases and earn professional recognition. If Yareli makes key discoveries, then she will earn professional recognition. Avah has a PhD. If someone works diligently and makes key discoveries, then they will gain expertise. Avah thinks critically. Ariana pursues new fields. Yareli has strong attention to detail. Anyone who has sharp insight or develops new techniques can earn professional recognition. If Avah has a PhD, then she is either a researcher or a skilled forensic scientist, but not both. If Lily has a PhD, then she is either a researcher or a skilled forensic scientist, but not both. If someone conducts experiments and interprets results, then they can publish papers. Avah pursues new fields. If Avah analyzes evidence, then she is either a skilled forensic scientist or can crack codes. Avah works diligently. Avah either gains expertise in forensic chemistry or pursues new fields, but not both. Yareli becomes a public figure. Avah shares knowledge or publishes papers. Lily either gains expertise in forensic chemistry or pursues new fields, but not both. Avah becomes a public figure. Ariana either advances her field or becomes a public figure, but not both. Yareli thinks critically. For all humans, if someone is a researcher and publishes papers, then they advance their field. All individuals who have strong attention to detail think critically and interpret results. Avah conducts experiments. Ariana has a PhD.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Avah cannot solve complex cases.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Avah becomes a public figure and must be either advancing her field or a public figure, but not both. Therefore, Avah does not advance her field.
- Avah has strong attention to detail, so she interprets results. She also conducts experiments. Thus, she (can) publishes papers.
- If someone is a researcher and publishes papers, they advance their field. Since Avah does not advance her field, she cannot be a researcher.
- Given Avah has a PhD and must be either a researcher or a skilled forensic scientist (but not both), she must be a skilled forensic scientist.
- Skilled forensic scientists can solve complex cases. Hence Avah can solve complex cases.

Therefore, the claim “Avah cannot solve complex cases” is false.

ANSWER: False

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
