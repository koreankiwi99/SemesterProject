==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From (G(K) ⊕ A(K)) → S(K) and ¬S(K), we get ¬(G(K) ⊕ A(K)). With ¬G(K), this implies ¬A(K).
- From (C(K) ∨ O(K)) → R(K) and ¬R(K), we get ¬O(K) (and ¬C(K)).
- From U → O and ¬O(K), we get ¬U(K).
- From Ac → (U ∨ L), together with ¬U(K) and ¬L(K), we get ¬Ac(K).
- Thus Ac(K) and A(K) are both false, so ¬(Ac(K) ⊕ A(K)). From M(K) → (Ac(K) ⊕ A(K)), we conclude ¬M(K).

Therefore, Kyler is not charming.
