Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lucian does not work hard.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Lucian is disciplined and the XOR rule (disciplined -> wins competitions XOR leads teams), and given Lucian leads teams, conclude Lucian does not win competitions.
- From Lucian does not set goals and (sets goals OR stays focused), conclude Lucian stays focused.
- Given the rule (stays focused XOR makes strategic moves) -> wins and Lucian does not win, the XOR antecedent must be false. Since he stays focused, conclude he also makes strategic moves.
- The only statements involving “works hard” are:
  - Everyone either has natural talent or works hard (or both).
  - Lucian either has natural talent or achieves success (or both).
- We cannot deduce that Lucian achieves success, nor that he lacks natural talent. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether he works hard or not.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
