Context:

Uriah creates eco-friendly spaces. Uriah designs innovative buildings. Amaris creates eco-friendly spaces. Uriah does not protect endangered species. Uriah does not support conservation. If Uriah designs innovative buildings, then he uses local materials and advocates for climate action. For everyone, if they either make green choices or conserve water, then they value sustainability. All who embrace global citizenship build resilient communities and advocate for climate action. If Yehuda cares about wildlife, then he either supports conservation or protects endangered species, but not both. If Uriah is an architect, then he either makes green choices or prioritizes human health, but not both. If Uriah conserves water, then he either creates eco-friendly spaces or advocates for climate action (but not both). Uriah does not respect nature. Either Uriah is environmentally conscious or environmentally negligent, but not both. Uriah does not use renewable energy. Amaris does not support conservation. If Uriah builds structures, then he either values sustainability or prioritizes public health, but not both. Meilani designs innovative buildings. If Uriah has good design skills, then he either builds lasting structures or conserves water. Uriah prioritizes public health or is environmentally negligent. If Uriah is either environmentally negligent or cares about wildlife (but not both), then he makes green choices. If Uriah cares about wildlife, then he either supports conservation or protects endangered species, but not both. If Uriah values sustainability, then he either uses renewable energy or reduces waste, but not both. If Meilani values sustainability, then he either uses renewable energy or reduces waste, but not both. If Amaris is either environmentally negligent or cares about wildlife (but not both), then he makes green choices.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Uriah is not environmentally conscious.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “reduces waste -> respect nature” and “Uriah does not respect nature,” we get Uriah does not reduce waste.
- Given “Uriah does not use renewable energy,” both renewable energy and reducing waste are false. From “If Uriah values sustainability, then exactly one of (uses renewable energy, reduces waste),” contrapositive gives Uriah does not value sustainability.
- From “If (makes green choices or conserves water) then values sustainability,” contrapositive gives Uriah neither makes green choices nor conserves water.
- From “If Uriah cares about wildlife then exactly one of (supports conservation, protects endangered species)” and given Uriah does not support conservation and does not protect endangered species, contrapositive gives Uriah does not care about wildlife.
- From “If (Uriah is environmentally negligent XOR cares about wildlife) then he makes green choices,” and since he does not make green choices, contrapositive gives not (environmentally negligent XOR cares about wildlife). With “does not care about wildlife,” this implies Uriah is not environmentally negligent.
- From “Either Uriah is environmentally conscious or environmentally negligent, but not both,” and not environmentally negligent, we conclude Uriah is environmentally conscious.

Therefore, the statement “Uriah is not environmentally conscious” is false.
