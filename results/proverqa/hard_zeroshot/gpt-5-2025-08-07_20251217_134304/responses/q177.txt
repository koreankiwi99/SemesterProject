Question ID: 177
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Queenie either controls her growth or limits her consumption (but not both), then she will regulate her feeding. Queenie multiplies quickly. Queenie does not control her growth. Darling monitors her environment. Queenie monitors her environment. Queenie either coexists with her raccoon host or is harmful to her raccoon host, but not both. Queenie thrives in the dark. If Queenie thrives in the dark, then she responds to changes and multiplies quickly. If Queenie senses her host's status and adapts her behavior, then she will limit her consumption. Queenie adapts her behavior. Sophie adapts her behavior. Bumpkin is either harmful to her raccoon host or beneficial to her raccoon host, but not both. Every parasite that lives in a host either evades the immune system or responds to changes in its environment (or both). If Queenie regulates her feeding, then she will coexist with her host. Darling thrives in the dark. Queenie is either harmful to her raccoon host or beneficial to her raccoon host, but not both. If Sophie regulates her feeding, then she will coexist with her host. All parasites that evade the immune system regulate their feeding and feed on nutrients. Bumpkin either coexists with her raccoon host or is harmful to her raccoon host, but not both. If a parasite monitors its environment and responds to changes, then it can sense its host's status. Darling multiplies quickly. If a parasite either destroys tissues or disrupts digestion (but not both), then it is harmful to its host.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Queenie is beneficial to her raccoon host.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Queenie thrives in the dark, so she responds to changes (and multiplies quickly).
- Queenie monitors her environment; for parasites, monitoring + responding implies sensing host status. Treating Queenie as a parasite with a raccoon host, she senses her host’s status.
- Queenie adapts her behavior; sensing status + adapting behavior implies she limits her consumption.
- She does not control her growth; having limits-consumption and not controlling growth satisfies the XOR condition, so she regulates her feeding.
- If she regulates her feeding, she coexists with her host.
- Coexists XOR harmful implies she is not harmful.
- Harmful XOR beneficial then forces beneficial.

Therefore, Queenie is beneficial to her raccoon host.

ANSWER: True
