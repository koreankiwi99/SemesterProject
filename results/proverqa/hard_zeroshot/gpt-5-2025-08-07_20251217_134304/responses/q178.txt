Context:
Brendan either makes groundbreaking discoveries or works independently, but not both. Pandabear sets high goals. Brendan teaches students. Victoria manages time effectively. Brendan receives invitations. If someone is a renowned botanist and collaborates with experts, then they advance scientific knowledge. If someone publishes papers and receives invitations, then they attend conferences. If Brendan either studies unique species or cultivates rare flowers (but not both), then he is a renowned botanist. Brendan works independently if he values freedom. Brendan publishes papers. If Victoria is a professor, then he either teaches students or shares research findings, but not both. Anyone who sets high goals and manages time effectively can work independently. If Brendan is either a renowned botanist or passionate about plants (but not both), then he makes groundbreaking discoveries. Brendan is a professor. Brendan sets high goals. If Brendan either shares research findings or attends conferences (but not both), then he collaborates with experts. If Brendan has original ideas, then he collaborates with experts and values feedback. Patrick teaches students. Brendan does not advance scientific knowledge. Pandabear is a professor. Patrick does not advance scientific knowledge. If Brendan either studies rare species or contributes to innovation (but not both), then he makes groundbreaking discoveries. If Brendan is a professor, then he either teaches students or shares research findings, but not both. Brendan manages time effectively.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Brendan is passionate about plants.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Brendan publishes papers and receives invitations, so he attends conferences.
- Brendan is a professor and teaches students, so by the XOR rule (professor → teaches XOR shares), he does not share research findings.
- Since he attends conferences and does not share, the XOR rule (shares XOR attends → collaborates) gives that he collaborates with experts.
- If a renowned botanist collaborates, they advance scientific knowledge; but Brendan does not advance scientific knowledge. Since he collaborates, he cannot be a renowned botanist.
- Brendan sets high goals and manages time effectively, so he works independently.
- By the XOR (groundbreaking discoveries XOR works independently), he does not make groundbreaking discoveries.
- The rule (renowned botanist XOR passionate about plants → groundbreaking discoveries) simplifies (since he is not a renowned botanist) to: if he is passionate about plants, then he makes groundbreaking discoveries. But he does not make groundbreaking discoveries, so he is not passionate about plants.

ANSWER: False

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
