Context:
If Lachlan either exercises regularly or eats nutritious food (but not both), then he has good health. Treasure is either in good health or works under stress, but not both. Lachlan has a balanced lifestyle. If Lachlan's research subjects either practice good hygiene or avoid unhealthy habits (but not both), then they have normal Bartholin gland function. Kalani has a balanced lifestyle. If Lachlan's research subjects either regulate their hormones or maintain their fertility (but not both), then they have a healthy reproductive system. If someone has a balanced lifestyle and eats nutritious food, then they can maintain their fertility. Treasure strives for perfection. Lachlan is either in good health or works under stress, but not both. All individuals who set high goals strive for perfection and often work under stress. Lachlan sets high goals. Anyone with a healthy reproductive system has normal Bartholin gland function. Lachlan does not regulate his hormones. For every human, either they have a Bartholin gland disorder or they have normal Bartholin gland function, but not both. Lachlan's research subjects either practice good hygiene or have a healthy reproductive system. Lachlan exercises regularly. Kalani exercises regularly. Lachlan strives for perfection.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lachlan's research subjects have a Bartholin gland disorder.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We need to determine whether Lachlan’s research subjects (S) must have a Bartholin gland disorder (BGD).

Key facts about S:
- If S practice good hygiene XOR avoid unhealthy habits, then S have normal Bartholin gland function (NBGF).
- If S regulate hormones XOR maintain fertility, then S have a healthy reproductive system (HRS).
- Anyone with HRS has NBGF.
- For every human, exactly one of BGD or NBGF holds (exclusive).
- S either practice good hygiene or have HRS (no “but not both” given, so treat as inclusive OR).

From “S either practice good hygiene or have HRS”:
- If S have HRS, then NBGF (thus not BGD).
- If S only practice good hygiene, we still cannot conclude NBGF unless the XOR with “avoid unhealthy habits” holds; we have no information about whether S avoid unhealthy habits.
- We also lack information that would force the hormone/fertility XOR antecedent for HRS.

Therefore, we cannot deduce that S necessarily have BGD, nor can we deduce they necessarily have NBGF in all cases. The statement is not determined by the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
