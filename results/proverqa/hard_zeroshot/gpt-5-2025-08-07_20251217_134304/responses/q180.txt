Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Wyatt is a skilled stonemason.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Wyatt meets deadlines and avoids details, so he rushes through tasks. By the “precise XOR rush” rule, he is not precise. From “lacks practice OR precise,” he therefore lacks practice.
- From “(recognition OR acclaim) -> proficiency” and Wyatt not proficient plus not gaining acclaim, we get he does not earn recognition.
- From “(strong foundations OR quality work) -> recognition” and no recognition, he does not produce quality work (also consistent with not having strong foundations).
- With experience and “(experience ∧ attention to details) -> quality work,” and no quality work, he does not pay attention to details. By the “attention to details XOR mistakes” rule, he makes mistakes.
- Lacks practice and makes mistakes imply he is an inexperienced stonemason.
- Given “skilled XOR inexperienced,” being inexperienced means he is not skilled.

ANSWER: False

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
