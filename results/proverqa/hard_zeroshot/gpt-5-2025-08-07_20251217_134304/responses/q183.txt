Question ID: 183
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Caden has a vision, then he either sets goals or creates plans, but not both. If Caden either sets goals or tracks progress (but not both), then he stays motivated. Caden does not make an impact. Caden suffers setbacks. Ainhoa suffers setbacks. If Clay has ambition, then he either creates plans or takes action, but not both. If Ainhoa either sets goals or tracks progress (but not both), then he stays motivated. If Clay suffers setbacks, then he either refuses to give up or stays motivated, but not both. Clay pursues his passion. Caden takes action. Caden pursues his passion. If Caden suffers setbacks, then he either refuses to give up or stays motivated, but not both. If Caden has ambition, then he either creates plans or takes action, but not both. Clay takes action. Anyone who has support or learns from failure can stay motivated. If someone believes in themselves, then they work hard and set goals. Caden does not track progress. If Caden either identifies problems or evaluates risks (but not both), then he creates plans. Everyone who pursues their passion either makes an impact or has a vision (or both). Ainhoa has ambition. Caden has ambition. Brinley does not face adversity.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Caden can overcome challenges.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Caden has ambition and takes action; from the XOR rule (ambition → creates plans XOR takes action), he does not create plans.
- Caden pursues his passion, and everyone who pursues their passion either makes an impact or has a vision. Since Caden does not make an impact, he must have a vision.
- Having a vision implies Caden sets goals XOR creates plans. Since he does not create plans, he sets goals.
- Caden does not track progress. With sets goals XOR tracks progress, he stays motivated.
- From suffering setbacks, the XOR rule gives refuses to give up XOR stays motivated. Since he stays motivated, he does not refuse to give up.
- There is no rule linking stays motivated or any other derived facts to “can overcome challenges.” The phrase “can overcome challenges” is not defined or entailed by the given statements.

Therefore, the truth of “Caden can overcome challenges” cannot be determined from the provided information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
