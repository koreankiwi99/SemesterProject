Question ID: 184
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Jameson performs experiments and is detail-oriented, then he can make groundbreaking discoveries. If Jameson works in a laboratory, then he uses a microscope. Jameson is either detail-oriented or careless, but not both. Anyone who contributes to science is accomplished. Jameson does not advance knowledge. Jameson uses a microscope or studies microorganisms. Estella does not make groundbreaking discoveries. If Jameson examines cells or analyzes samples, then he studies microorganisms. If someone either examines samples or analyzes images (but not both), then they make observations. Estella conducts research. Jameson thinks creatively. Anyone who analyzes results either draws conclusions or performs experiments (or both). Everyone who conducts research either performs experiments or collects data (or both). If Jameson examines evidence, then he either identifies patterns or develops theories. Gabriel thinks creatively. Everyone who studies microorganisms either contributes to science or develops new techniques (or both). Jameson is not accomplished. Collin does not develop new techniques. Anyone who makes observations either identifies patterns or advances knowledge. For anyone who uses a microscope and collects data, it is the case that they make observations. Jameson does not make groundbreaking discoveries. Jameson either thinks creatively or identifies patterns, but not both. Gabriel either thinks creatively or identifies patterns, but not both. Jameson conducts research. Jameson does not develop new techniques.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jameson is not careless.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Anyone who contributes to science is accomplished” and “Jameson is not accomplished,” we infer Jameson does not contribute to science.
- From “Everyone who studies microorganisms either contributes to science or develops new techniques” and “Jameson does not develop new techniques,” it follows Jameson does not study microorganisms.
- Given “Jameson uses a microscope or studies microorganisms,” he must use a microscope.
- “Anyone who makes observations either identifies patterns or advances knowledge,” but Jameson neither identifies patterns (since he thinks creatively and the XOR rule forbids both) nor advances knowledge. Hence Jameson does not make observations.
- From “uses a microscope and collects data → make observations,” and since he uses a microscope but does not make observations, he does not collect data.
- From “conducts research → performs experiments or collects data,” and not collecting data, he performs experiments.

None of these facts determine whether he is detail-oriented or careless. The only rule linking detail-oriented says if he performs experiments and is detail-oriented, then he can make groundbreaking discoveries, which does not contradict the fact that he does not make them. Given the XOR “detail-oriented or careless,” both options remain consistent with the premises.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
