Question ID: 185
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Anyone who sets targets has a goal. Kaison does not achieve his goals. Kaison overcomes obstacles. Julius overcomes obstacles. If Kaison has ambition, then he either works hard or is disciplined (but not both). If Kaison is either determined or talented (but not both), then he is successful. Kaison sets targets. If Kaison has a goal, then he either dedicates time or stays focused (but not both). Julius stays focused. If someone faces challenges and seeks improvement, then they have a goal. Eliza does not achieve his goals. If Mami is either determined or talented (but not both), then he is successful. If someone is successful and overcomes obstacles, then they achieve their goals. If Kaison practices regularly, then he is both talented and stays confident. Kaison does not improve his skills. Kaison stays focused. Kaison either works hard or is talented (or both). If Kaison either dedicates time or works hard (but not both), then he improves his skills.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kaison is not determined.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From Kaison sets targets -> Kaison has a goal. With has a goal and Kaison stays focused, and the rule that goal implies exactly one of dedicates time or stays focused, we get: Kaison does not dedicate time.
- From XOR(dedicates time, works hard) -> improves skills, and not dedicate time, this reduces to: works hard -> improves skills. Given Kaison does not improve his skills, we conclude: Kaison does not work hard.
- From works hard or talented (or both), and not works hard, we conclude: Kaison is talented.
- The rule XOR(determined, talented) -> successful, with talented true, reduces to: if not determined then successful.
- With successful and overcomes obstacles -> achieves goals, and Kaison overcomes obstacles, we get: if not determined then achieves goals.
- But Kaison does not achieve his goals. Therefore, not(not determined), so Kaison is determined.

Thus, the statement "Kaison is not determined" is false.

ANSWER: False
