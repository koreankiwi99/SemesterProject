Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Haisley is uninspired.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From the rule (take risks or think outside the box) ⇒ drive progress and the facts that Haisley does not drive progress and does not think outside the box, we infer she also does not take risks.
- If Haisley were innovative, then she would have experience or take risks, but not both. Given she has neither experience nor takes risks, she cannot be innovative.
- If Haisley is passionate, then she is creative or innovative. Since she is not innovative, passion would imply creative. However, we only know Haisley is passionate or a diligent worker (or both), not which.
- If she is a diligent worker, she produces quality work, which (given she’s not highly skilled) would imply exquisite taste—but that does not determine whether she is creative.
- We have that Haisley is either creative or uninspired, but not both. Since we cannot determine whether she is creative, we cannot determine whether she is uninspired.
