Question ID: 189
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Connor leads research teams. Connor collaborates with peers. If Connor collaborates with peers, then he teaches at a university and mentors students. Connor publishes academic papers or is recognized as a leading expert. If Connor has extensive experience, then he either teaches at a university or publishes academic papers, but not both. Connor does not study fossils. Connor will mentor students if he leads research teams. Connor specializes in theropod dinosaurs if he focuses on ancient species. Every paleontologist either has extensive experience or studies fossils.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Connor makes groundbreaking discoveries, or he specializes in theropod dinosaurs and is recognized as a leading expert.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From collaborates with peers and the given implication, Connor teaches at a university (T) and mentors students (M). From leading research teams, he also mentors students; consistent with M.
- From publishes papers or recognized as a leading expert, we have P ∨ L.
- If Connor has extensive experience (E), then T XOR P. Since T is true, under E this implies ¬P, and then from P ∨ L we get L. But E itself is not established.
- He does not study fossils. The statement about paleontologists (every paleontologist has E or studies fossils) does not apply unless Connor is a paleontologist, which is not given.
- Specializes in theropod dinosaurs (S) only if he focuses on ancient species; no evidence he does, so S is not entailed.
- Nothing connects these facts to “makes groundbreaking discoveries” (G), so G is unconstrained.

It is consistent with the premises that G is false, S is false, and L is false (e.g., let P be true and E be false), making the disjunction false. It is also consistent that the disjunction is true (e.g., if G is true). Therefore, the statement’s truth cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
