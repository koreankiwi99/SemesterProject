==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Aiden does not speak publicly and takes leadership roles, so by the XOR rule he is confident.
- Confident -> outgoing and emotional depth.
- Outgoing -> public influence and passionate about social causes.
- With public influence, he is either an inspiring leader or charismatic (but not both). Given he is an inspiring leader, he is not charismatic.
- No rule links “inspiring leader” or any other derived trait to “inspires others,” nor is there any rule negating it.

Therefore, whether Aiden inspires others cannot be determined from the given information.
