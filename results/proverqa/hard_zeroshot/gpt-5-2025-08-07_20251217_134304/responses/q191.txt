Question ID: 191
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If a parasite adapts to change and finds optimal nutrients, then it can reproduce successfully. Queenie has flagella. Queenie either reproduces successfully or produces enzymes, but not both. Queenie competes for resources. If Queenie colonizes a host, then she either absorbs nutrients or regulates nutrient flow, but not both. Queenie dominates her environment. Queenie either forms symbiotic relationships with her host or evades the host's defenses, but not both. Queenie forms symbiotic relationships with her host. If Queenie has flagella and competes for resources, then she can regulate nutrient flow. Every parasite that inhabits an intestine either produces enzymes or feeds on nutrients. If a parasite dominates its environment, then it reproduces successfully.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Queenie will thrive in the host.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Queenie dominates her environment” and “If a parasite dominates its environment, then it reproduces successfully,” Queenie reproduces successfully.
- By the exclusive-or with enzymes, she therefore does not produce enzymes.
- From “has flagella” and “competes for resources,” she can regulate nutrient flow.
- She forms symbiotic relationships with her host (and thus does not evade host defenses).

However, “thrive in the host” is not defined or entailed by any given rule. We are not explicitly told she colonizes a host, nor that reproducing successfully implies thriving specifically in the host. Therefore, the statement cannot be determined from the premises.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
