- With a high-pitched bark, Puppy must be either rare due to a unique physical trait or large, but not both. Given Puppy is large, she is not rare due to a unique physical trait.
- Puppy barks in harmony, so she has a musical bark.
- Puppy turns heads and does not captivate audiences, so she must have distinct features.
