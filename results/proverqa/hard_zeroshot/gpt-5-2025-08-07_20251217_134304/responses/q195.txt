Question ID: 195
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Taylor does not have social interaction. Jaxton does not build endurance. If Taylor either builds endurance or increases speed (but not both), then he trains regularly. If Jaxton either builds endurance or increases speed (but not both), then he trains regularly. Taylor stays healthy. Every horse either gets proper exercise or receives proper care, but these are not mutually exclusive. If Derek receives proper care, then he can either compete successfully or provide therapy comfort, but not both. If a horse trains regularly and stays healthy, then it can compete successfully. Jaxton either performs tasks or competes successfully. Abigail gains strength or increases speed. Jaxton gains strength or increases speed. Jaxton does not have social interaction. Jaxton stays healthy. Every horse either gets proper exercise or has social interaction, but these are not mutually exclusive. Jaxton does not gain strength. If Jaxton either follows a routine or has discipline (but not both), then he trains regularly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jaxton provides therapy comfort.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Jaxton does not gain strength, and Jaxton gains strength or increases speed ⇒ Jaxton increases speed.
- Jaxton does not build endurance, and he increases speed ⇒ the “either builds endurance or increases speed (but not both)” condition holds ⇒ Jaxton trains regularly.
- Jaxton trains regularly and stays healthy ⇒ Jaxton competes successfully.
- The rule involving therapy comfort only applies to Derek (if Derek receives proper care, then either competes successfully or provides therapy comfort, but not both). There is no analogous rule for Jaxton, nor any rule linking Jaxton’s status to providing therapy comfort.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether Jaxton provides therapy comfort.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
