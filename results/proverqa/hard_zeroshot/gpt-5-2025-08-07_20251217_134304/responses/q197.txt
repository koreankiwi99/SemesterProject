If Frankie can navigate the nucleus, then he can either repair DNA or assist transcription, but not both. Frankie can manipulate molecules. Frankie either regulates protein or assists transcription. Frankie either has supernatural powers or has microscopic size, but not both. If Frankie lives in a cell, then he understands biochemistry and knows genetics. Frankie can navigate the nucleus. If Kendall can navigate the nucleus, then he can either repair DNA or assist transcription, but not both. Kendall lives in a fantasy world. If Ximena lives in a fantasy world, then he either has supernatural powers or can fly, but not both. Kendall can fly. Frankie lives in a fantasy world. If Frankie knows genetics, then he will assist in transcription. Frankie can fly. If Frankie has microscopic size, then he lives in a cell and can manipulate molecules.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Frankie can repair DNA.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Frankie lives in a fantasy world and can fly. From the exclusive rule (fantasy world -> supernatural powers XOR flying), this implies he does not have supernatural powers.
- From the exclusive rule (supernatural powers XOR microscopic size), since he lacks supernatural powers, he must have microscopic size.
- Microscopic size implies he lives in a cell; living in a cell implies he knows genetics.
- Knowing genetics implies he assists in transcription.
- Frankie can navigate the nucleus; the rule for nucleus navigation says he either repairs DNA or assists transcription, but not both. Since he assists transcription, he does not repair DNA.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
