Question ID: 198
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Gary makes tactical decisions. Gary cannot handle critical situations. If Gary leads others effectively, then he either makes tactical decisions or communicates clearly, but not both. Anyone who thinks quickly and stays calm under pressure can handle critical situations. Gary gains experience or has training. If Gary takes risks, then he either acts impulsively or follows his instincts (but not both). Gary thinks quickly. Gary either performs heroic actions or takes risks. Anyone who prioritizes their own safety and has proper training can respond to emergencies effectively. Anyone who responds to emergencies either stays calm under pressure or leads others effectively (or both). Gary does not gain experience. Gary does not act impulsively. If Gary is brave, then he will perform heroic actions and earn accolades. Gary either prioritizes his own safety or is brave, but Gary may not necessarily do both. Gary does not follow his instincts. Gary communicates clearly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Gary does not earn accolades.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Gary makes tactical decisions (T) and communicates clearly (C). If he led effectively (L), then exactly one of T or C would be true. Since both T and C are true, L would imply a falsehood, so Gary does not lead effectively (¬L).
- Gary does not act impulsively (¬A) and does not follow his instincts (¬F). If he took risks (R), he would have to do exactly one of A or F, which is impossible. Hence, he does not take risks (¬R).
- He either performs heroic actions (H) or takes risks (R). With ¬R, he must perform heroic actions (H).
- Anyone who responds to emergencies (RE) either stays calm or leads (RE ⇒ Calm ∨ L). With ¬L, RE ⇒ Calm. Thinking quickly (Q) and being calm implies handling critical situations (Q ∧ Calm ⇒ HCS). Thus RE ⇒ HCS. But Gary cannot handle critical situations (¬HCS), so he does not respond to emergencies (¬RE).
- Gary has training (Tng) because he either gains experience or has training, and he does not gain experience (¬GE ⇒ Tng). From (Prioritizes safety P ∧ Tng) ⇒ RE and ¬RE, we get ¬(P ∧ Tng); with Tng true, this yields ¬P.
- Since P ∨ Brave (B) and ¬P, Gary is brave (B). If Gary is brave, then he performs heroic actions and earns accolades (B ⇒ H ∧ EA). Therefore, Gary earns accolades (EA).

Hence, the statement “Gary does not earn accolades” is false.

ANSWER: False

Result:

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
