Question ID: 199
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Stefan asks questions, then he explores opportunities and values experience. Stefan visits a foreign land. Stefan travels abroad. For all humans, if they either have curiosity or ask questions, then they seek knowledge. Stefan listens to podcasts. Anyone who reads widely or meets new people loves learning. If Stefan visits a foreign land, then he either becomes thoughtful or develops cultural appreciation, but not both. If Stefan either listens to podcasts or reads widely (but not both), then he has curiosity. If Stefan travels abroad, then he either immerses himself in the culture or becomes thoughtful (or both). Stefan does not value experience. Stefan does not seek knowledge. If Stefan loves learning, then he develops cultural appreciation and appreciates diversity. For all humans, if they immerse themselves in a culture, then they gain a new perspective.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Stefan does not gain a new perspective.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
From “(Curiosity or asks questions) -> seeks knowledge” and given Stefan does not seek knowledge, contraposition implies Stefan neither has curiosity nor asks questions.

Given “(listens to podcasts XOR reads widely) -> curiosity” and Stefan listens to podcasts but does not have curiosity, the XOR must be false; thus Stefan also reads widely.

Reading widely implies he loves learning, which implies he develops cultural appreciation. From “visits a foreign land -> (thoughtful XOR develops cultural appreciation),” developing cultural appreciation forces “thoughtful” to be false.

From “travels abroad -> (immerses in culture or thoughtful)” and “thoughtful” being false, Stefan must immerse in culture. Anyone who immerses in a culture gains a new perspective. Therefore, Stefan gains a new perspective.

Hence, “Stefan does not gain a new perspective” is false.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
