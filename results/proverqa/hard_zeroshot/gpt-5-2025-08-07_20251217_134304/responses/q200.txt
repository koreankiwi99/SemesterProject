Context:
Anastasia studies ecology. If Anastasia is an entomologist, then she either cares for the environment or advocates for sustainability, but not both. If someone embraces self-reflection and nurtures their curiosity, then they can pursue personal growth. Bryson either has an artistic side or is an entomologist, but not both. If Anastasia has curiosity, then she contributes to science and thinks critically. Anastasia does not educate others. If someone either values simplicity or seeks elegance (but not both), then they appreciate beauty. Anyone who practices mindfulness will pursue personal growth. Bryson nurtures her curiosity. Anastasia either has an artistic side or is an entomologist, but not both. Anastasia does not have an artistic side. Anastasia embraces self-reflection. Anastasia nurtures her curiosity. If Anastasia studies ecology, then she either advocates for sustainability or educates others (or both). If Jones studies ecology, then she either advocates for sustainability or educates others (or both). Anastasia either pursues personal growth or contributes to science, or both.

  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Anastasia studies ecology” and “If Anastasia studies ecology, then she either advocates for sustainability or educates others (or both)” plus “Anastasia does not educate others,” we conclude Anastasia advocates for sustainability.
- From “Anastasia either has an artistic side or is an entomologist, but not both” and “Anastasia does not have an artistic side,” we conclude Anastasia is an entomologist. Then, by “If Anastasia is an entomologist, then she either cares for the environment or advocates for sustainability, but not both,” and since she advocates for sustainability, she does not care for the environment. None of this implies appreciating beauty or contributing to science.
- From “Anastasia embraces self-reflection” and “Anastasia nurtures her curiosity,” and the rule linking these to personal growth, we infer she pursues personal growth.
- The disjunction “Anastasia either pursues personal growth or contributes to science, or both” is satisfied by her pursuing personal growth, but it does not force that she contributes to science.
- The only rule that would imply contributing to science is “If Anastasia has curiosity, then she contributes to science,” but we are not given that she has curiosity (only that she nurtures it), and no rule equates nurturing curiosity with having curiosity.
- There is no information implying she appreciates beauty (which would require the simplicity/elegance condition).

Therefore, we cannot determine that she must either appreciate beauty or contribute to science.
