Question ID: 201
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
All lemurs that have agility and live in forests can climb trees. Sevyn does not thrive in his habitat. If Sevyn either explores the forest or forages for food (but not both), then he thrives in his habitat. Cookie does not thrive in his habitat. Cookie either takes dust baths or grooms each other, but not both. Sevyn does not ensure their survival. Sevyn plays with his troop. For all lemurs, if they explore the forest and lead the troop, then they ensure the troop's survival. Cookie does not have good health. If Sevyn climbs trees, then he either plays with his troop or grooms each other, but not both. If Lyric climbs trees, then he either plays with his troop or grooms each other, but not both. Sevyn either takes dust baths or grooms each other, but not both. Every lemur either climbs trees or forages for food. Sevyn prioritizes cleanliness. Lyric prioritizes cleanliness. For any lemur, if they prioritize cleanliness and take dust baths, then they have good health. Sevyn does not have good health. If Sevyn either leaps through trees or ventures off trail (but not both), then he explores the forest.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sevyn does not lead the troop.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Sevyn prioritizes cleanliness and does not have good health. From the rule (cleanliness AND dust baths) -> good health, contrapositive gives: not good health -> not (cleanliness AND dust baths). Since Sevyn does prioritize cleanliness, he must not take dust baths. By the XOR rule (dust baths or grooms, but not both), Sevyn grooms.
- Sevyn also plays with his troop. If he climbed trees, then (plays XOR grooms) would have to hold; but both are true, so he does not climb trees.
- Every lemur either climbs or forages; since Sevyn does not climb, he forages.
- Given: If Sevyn (explores XOR forages) then he thrives. Sevyn does not thrive, so not XOR(explores, forages). With foraging true, this implies he also explores.
- For all lemurs: if they explore and lead, then they ensure the troop’s survival. We are told Sevyn does not ensure survival, so not (explores and leads). Since Sevyn explores, it follows that he does not lead the troop.

ANSWER: True

Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
