Question ID: 203
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Lillian is a litterer, then she either damages soil or pollutes water, but not both. Everyone who either disposes waste or damages soil (but not both) harms the ecosystem. Lillian does not dispose waste. Lillian throws trash. Lillian does not harm wildlife. If Lillian neglects nature, then she is either a litterer or ignores rules, but not both. Lillian does not neglect her responsibility. If someone pollutes water and causes environmental harm, then they harm wildlife. Anyone who throws trash is a litterer. Lillian is either a conservationist or an environmental harm doer, but not both. Lillian does not ignore warnings. Whenever someone harms the ecosystem, they either ignore warnings or neglect their responsibility (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lillian is not a conservationist.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Lillian throws trash, so she is a litterer.
- As a litterer, she either damages soil or pollutes water, but not both.
- If someone (disposes waste XOR damages soil), they harm the ecosystem. Lillian does not dispose waste, so if she damaged soil she would harm the ecosystem.
- If someone harms the ecosystem, they either ignore warnings or neglect their responsibility. Lillian does neither, so she does not harm the ecosystem. Therefore she does not damage soil, hence she must pollute water.
- If someone pollutes water and causes environmental harm, they harm wildlife. Lillian does not harm wildlife, so she does not cause environmental harm.
- Lillian is either a conservationist or an environmental harm doer, but not both. Since she is not an environmental harm doer, she is a conservationist.

Therefore, the statement “Lillian is not a conservationist” is false.

ANSWER: False

Result:

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
