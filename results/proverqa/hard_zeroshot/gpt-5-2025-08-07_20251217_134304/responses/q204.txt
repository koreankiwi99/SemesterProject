Question ID: 204
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Noel sees details. If Noel is reflective, then he either cherishes memories or values moments in life, but not both. Everyone who seeks new experiences either lives in the present or embraces change (or both). Noel either appreciates the impermanence of things or resists the impermanence of things, but not both. Noel seeks new experiences. Noel is adaptable. If Noel practices mindfulness, then he either connects with others or finds beauty everywhere (but not both). Noel does not take risks. Carly does not take risks. If someone lives in the present, then they value moments in life and find beauty everywhere. Noel is creative. Anyone who values moments in life appreciates the impermanence of things. Noel does not love nature. Anyone who sees details or loves nature can find beauty everywhere. If Noel has curiosity, then he is both reflective and lives in the present. If Noel is creative, then he either tries new things or takes risks, but not both. If Noel tries new things, then he is either adaptable or open to change, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Noel resists the impermanence of things.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From creativity and not taking risks, Noel must try new things. From trying new things and being adaptable, he is not open to change (but this says nothing about embracing change).
- Noel seeks new experiences, so he either lives in the present or embraces change (or both). We are not given which holds.
- If he lives in the present, then he values moments in life, which implies he appreciates impermanence. Given the XOR with resisting impermanence, that would make resisting false.
- However, it is also consistent that he does not live in the present but instead embraces change; in that case we have no rule forcing him to value moments in life or appreciate impermanence, so resisting impermanence could be true.
- No other rules determine whether he lives in the present or values moments in life, nor do they otherwise fix appreciating vs. resisting impermanence.

Therefore, whether Noel resists the impermanence of things is not determined by the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain
