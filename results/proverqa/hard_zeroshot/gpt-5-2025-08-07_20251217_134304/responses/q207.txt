Options:

  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Jase values teamwork and “Jase either values teamwork or is a strategic thinker, but not both” implies Jase is not a strategic thinker.
- Jase has a strong work ethic and “WE -> exactly one of (strategic thinker, leadership)” with ST false implies Jase demonstrates leadership.
- From “If Jase demonstrates leadership or shows dedication, then he can become a senior officer,” we only get that he can become a senior officer, not that he is one.
- Jase pursues personal interests and “exactly one of (pursues personal interests, makes sacrifices)” implies he does not make sacrifices; this doesn’t affect senior officer status.
- The only rule that yields “Jase earns respect” is “If Jase is a senior officer, then he earns respect.” We cannot conclude he is a senior officer.

Therefore, whether Jase earns respect is not determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
