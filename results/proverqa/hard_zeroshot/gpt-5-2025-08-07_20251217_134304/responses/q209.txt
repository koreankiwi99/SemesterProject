Question ID: 209
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Timothy either acts quickly or is brave. Timothy takes risks. If Timothy takes risks and stays calm, then he is a hero. For anyone who faces challenges and exercises self-control, they can stay calm. Timothy does not think cautiously. Timothy remains focused. Everyone who works under pressure either exercises self-control or thinks cautiously (or both). If Timothy remains focused, then he will work under pressure. Timothy does not make decisive moves. If Timothy either acts quickly or makes decisive moves (but not both), then he handles emergencies. If Timothy practices mindfulness, then he either exercises self-control or has emotional balance, but not both. Timothy does not handle emergencies. Timothy faces challenges.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Timothy is not skilled.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We translate the statements into logical relations:

- Focus → WorkUnderPressure; Focus is true ⇒ WorkUnderPressure is true.
- WorkUnderPressure → (SelfControl ∨ ThinkCautiously); given ¬ThinkCautiously ⇒ SelfControl is true.
- (FacesChallenges ∧ SelfControl) → Calm; FacesChallenges is true ⇒ Calm is true.
- (TakesRisks ∧ Calm) → Hero; TakesRisks is true ⇒ Hero is true.
- (ActsQuickly ⊕ DecisiveMoves) → HandlesEmergencies; DecisiveMoves is false, so ActsQuickly → HandlesEmergencies. Given ¬HandlesEmergencies, ActsQuickly must be false.
- From (ActsQuickly ∨ Brave) and ¬ActsQuickly ⇒ Brave is true.

All of this is consistent. There is no premise relating “skilled” (or “not skilled”) to any of these properties. Therefore, whether Timothy is not skilled cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
