Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Asa cannot create innovative technologies. Karsyn serves his local community. If Asa understands thermal stability, then he can design heat-resistant materials. Avery is not creative. If Asa has expertise, then he either publishes papers or conducts research (or both). If Asa has an excellent academic record and strong curiosity, then he will pursue a PhD. If Asa examines material behavior, then he analyzes composite properties. Francesca conducts research or works in industry. Asa has an excellent academic record. Whoever conducts research contributes to society. Anyone who analyzes composite properties or studies material interactions can improve material efficiency. Asa conducts research or works in industry. Avery cannot create innovative technologies. If Karsyn has an excellent academic record and strong curiosity, then he will pursue a PhD. Asa either contributes to society or serves his local community, but not both. If Francesca attends university, then he is either curious or creative (but not both). Asa serves his local community. If Asa either analyzes composite properties or designs heat-resistant materials (but not both), then he can create innovative technologies. If someone has expertise, then they solve real problems and contribute to society. If Francesca either analyzes composite properties or designs heat-resistant materials (but not both), then he can create innovative technologies. If Asa pursues a PhD, then he either improves material efficiency or works in industry, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Asa understands thermal stability.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Asa serves his local community and, by the exclusive-or statement, does not contribute to society.
- Therefore he does not conduct research (since research implies contributing to society) and thus works in industry. He also does not have expertise (since expertise implies contributing to society).
- From “Asa cannot create innovative technologies” and “If (exactly one of ACP or DHRM) then he can create innovative technologies,” we conclude that the XOR condition is false; hence ACP and DHRM have the same truth value (both true or both false).
- No given rule forces ACP or DHRM to be true or false. Thus DHRM is undetermined.
- Since “If Asa understands thermal stability then he can design heat-resistant materials,” without knowing DHRM we cannot infer whether he understands thermal stability; and we also cannot conclude its negation.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
