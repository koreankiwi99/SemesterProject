Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Meadow does not become an environmental activist.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Meadow enjoys fresh mountains, and Meadow either enjoys fresh mountains or breathes toxic air, but not both. Therefore, Meadow does not breathe toxic air.
- Meadow sees polluted rivers. Since exactly one of “breathes toxic air” and “sees polluted rivers” holds, the condition for “If Meadow either breathes toxic air or sees polluted rivers (but not both), then she grows up in an industry town” is met; thus Meadow grows up in an industry town.
- We also know Meadow either witnesses destruction or lives near polluted areas. This does not determine which one holds.
- Meadow becomes an environmental activist if she lives near polluted areas or cares about the environment. We have no information that she cares about the environment, and we cannot conclude she lives near polluted areas (only that either that or witnessing destruction holds).
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether Meadow becomes an environmental activist.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
