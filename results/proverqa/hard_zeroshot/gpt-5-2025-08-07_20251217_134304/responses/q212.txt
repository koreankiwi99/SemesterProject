Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From (Preserves cultural heritage OR Celebrates local history) -> Supports artistic expression, and Malik does not support artistic expression, we can infer Malik neither preserves cultural heritage nor celebrates local history.
- The statement "Anyone who represents their community or tells local stories can preserve cultural heritage" is modal ("can"), so we cannot conclude from Malik not preserving that he does not represent his community or tell local stories.
- Even if we pursued stricter implications, none of the given premises relate to "enhancing the beauty of his community."
- Therefore, there is no basis to conclude whether Malik enhances the beauty of his community.

ANSWER: Uncertain
