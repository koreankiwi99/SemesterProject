Question ID: 213
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Mekhi faces adversity, then he will show resilience and find a way to overcome it. Trenton either experiences failure or avoids risks. If Landen learns from his mistakes, then he will achieve success. Musa does not gain recognition. If Trenton faces adversity, then he will either become stronger or stay motivated, but not both. Landen does not gain recognition. If Landen experiences failure, then he will either learn from his mistakes or stay motivated, but not both. Musa pursues his passions or achieves success. Musa becomes stronger. If Mekhi sets goals and achieves success, then he will gain recognition. Musa sets goals. Mekhi becomes stronger. Musa does not avoid risks. If Musa learns from his mistakes, then he will achieve success. If Musa sets goals and achieves success, then he will gain recognition. If Musa faces adversity, then he will either become stronger or stay motivated, but not both. If Musa experiences failure, then he will either learn from his mistakes or stay motivated, but not both. Musa either experiences failure or avoids risks. Musa either has determination or stays motivated.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Musa does not find a way to overcome.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Musa either experiences failure or avoids risks" and "Musa does not avoid risks," Musa experiences failure.
- From "If Musa experiences failure, then he will either learn from his mistakes or stay motivated, but not both," we get: learns-from-mistakes XOR stays-motivated.
- Musa sets goals, and "If Musa sets goals and achieves success, then he will gain recognition," but "Musa does not gain recognition." Therefore, Musa does not achieve success.
- From "If Musa learns from his mistakes, then he will achieve success," and since he does not achieve success, Musa does not learn from his mistakes (modus tollens). Hence from the XOR, Musa stays motivated.
- Given "Musa becomes stronger" is also true, Musa is both stronger and stays motivated.
- From "If Musa faces adversity, then he will either become stronger or stay motivated, but not both," having both true implies Musa does not face adversity.
- There is no rule connecting Musa to "finding a way to overcome"; that clause only appears for Mekhi. Not facing adversity also does not entail anything about "finding a way to overcome."

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Musa finds a way to overcome.
