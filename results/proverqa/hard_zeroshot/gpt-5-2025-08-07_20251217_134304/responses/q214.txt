Question ID: 214
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Anyone who outperforms others or gets recognition inspires others. If someone has endurance or has quick reflexes, then they perform well. Jamari cannot lead his team successfully. Everyone either has endurance or has good speed, but not both is not necessarily true. Martin either excels under pressure or has strong technique, but not both. Jamari has quick reflexes. For all humans, if someone is a good footballer, then they either have good speed or have good agility (or both). Jamari has strategic skills. If Jamari either trains regularly or eats nutritious food (but not both), then he has endurance. Megan has quick reflexes. Jamari does not inspire others. Aya does not inspire others. If Jamari has good agility and strong technique, then he will outperform others. If Martin has good agility and strong technique, then he will outperform others. Jamari either excels under pressure or has strong technique, but not both. Jamari does not excel under pressure. If someone has strategic skills and performs well, then they can lead their team successfully. Megan cannot lead his team successfully. Martin does not excel under pressure.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jamari is a good footballer.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Jamari has quick reflexes and rule (endurance or quick reflexes -> perform well), Jamari performs well.
- From Jamari has strategic skills and rule (strategic skills and performs well -> can lead team), we would conclude Jamari can lead his team. But it is given that Jamari cannot lead his team, so the premises are inconsistent on this point.
- Jamari does not excel under pressure and has the XOR (excels under pressure or strong technique), so Jamari has strong technique.
- If Jamari has good agility and strong technique, then he outperforms and thus inspires others. Since Jamari does not inspire others, Jamari does not have good agility.
- Good footballer -> (good speed or good agility). Given Jamari does not have good agility, if he were a good footballer he would have good speed. However, we have no rule to infer that Jamari is a good footballer from other properties, nor can we rule it out (he could have good speed). The universal “everyone has endurance or good speed” does not determine which Jamari has.

Conclusion: Whether Jamari is a good footballer cannot be determined from the information.

ANSWER: Uncertain
