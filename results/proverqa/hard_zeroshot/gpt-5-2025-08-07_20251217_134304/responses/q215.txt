Question ID: 215
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Samantha either reads widely or attends seminars (but not both), then she has formal education. If someone works under a mentor, then they gain practical experience. Samantha either gains practical experience or reads widely, but not both. If Samantha overcomes adversity, then she either has natural talent or learns quickly. Samantha puts in diligent effort or has a hard work ethic. Everyone who is self-taught either reads widely or learns through apprenticeship (or both). Charli either gains practical experience or reads widely, but not both. Samantha does not put in diligent effort. Samantha works under a mentor. Samantha attends seminars. If Samantha achieves recognition, then she has either natural talent or a hard work ethic (but not both). Charli works under a mentor. Aries achieves recognition. If Samantha has either formal education or natural talent (but not both), then she is successful. Samantha achieves recognition.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Samantha is not successful.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Samantha works under a mentor, so she gains practical experience (WM -> PE; WM true ⇒ PE true).
- Given PE XOR RW and PE true, Samantha does not read widely (RW false).
- With attends seminars true and reads widely false, RW XOR AS holds, so she has formal education (FE true).
- She achieves recognition, so exactly one of natural talent or hard work ethic holds (NT XOR HWE).
- She does not put in diligent effort, and “diligent effort or hard work ethic” is true; thus HWE true, hence NT false.
- With FE true and NT false, (FE XOR NT) is true, so she is successful.

Therefore, the statement “Samantha is not successful” is false.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
