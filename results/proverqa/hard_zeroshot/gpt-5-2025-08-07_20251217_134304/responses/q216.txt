Context:
Colten either works independently or lends a helping hand, but not both. All mechanically inclined people fix broken things and enjoy problem-solving. Colten either fixes broken things or reads manuals, but not necessarily both. Colten is either intelligent or kind-hearted (or both). Colten either works independently or follows directions, but not both. Colten listens carefully. Everyone who lends a helping hand either fixes broken things or has common sense (or both). A person either has common sense or is intelligent, but not necessarily both. Colten reads manuals. Anyone who listens carefully or asks questions can follow directions.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Colten is kind-hearted.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Colten listens carefully" and "Anyone who listens carefully or asks questions can follow directions," Colten follows directions (D).
- From "Colten either works independently or follows directions, but not both," D implies not W (works independently).
- From "Colten either works independently or lends a helping hand, but not both," not W implies H (lends a helping hand).
- From "Everyone who lends a helping hand either fixes broken things or has common sense," H implies F or C.
- From "Colten reads manuals," R is true; and "Colten either fixes broken things or reads manuals" is satisfied regardless of F.
- The only statements involving kind-hearted (K) are "Colten is either intelligent or kind-hearted (or both)" and "A person either has common sense or is intelligent (or both)." These allow:
  - A model where I is true and K is false, satisfying all premises.
  - A model where K is true (with or without I), also satisfying all premises.
- Therefore, K is not entailed nor contradicted by the premises.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
