Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Alvaro does not overcome challenges.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Alvaro has ambition," we get: works diligently and values experience.
- Given "learns quickly or works diligently, but not both," and works diligently is true, learns quickly is false.
- "Sets targets" is true. Since learns quickly is false, "sets targets XOR learns quickly" is true, so "stays motivated" is true.
- "Faces adversity" is true. With "faces adversity -> (stays motivated XOR pursues goals)" and stays motivated true, pursues goals is false.
- "Pursues goals or has passion" and pursues goals false implies has passion true.
- "Has passion -> (achieve success XOR inspire others)," with achieve success true, implies inspires others false.
- "Pushes limits or inspires others" with inspires others false gives pushes limits true.

No statement defines or links "overcome challenges" to any of these predicates. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Alvaro does or does not overcome challenges.
