Context:
If Heaven runs a small business, then she either supports environmental causes or fosters local economies (but not both). Heaven either builds a strong community or creates successful products, but not both. If Heaven empowers others, then she either fosters local economies or promotes innovation (or both). Heaven either takes calculated risks or has good instincts, but not necessarily both. If Fiona is passionate about nature, then she will discover natural remedies and create successful products. Anders runs a small business. If Heaven works hard, then she will create successful products. Heaven does not drive social change. Mackenzie either takes calculated risks or has good instincts, but not necessarily both. Fiona either follows tradition or thinks outside the box, but not both. If Heaven either values sustainability or is passionate about nature, then she will find innovative solutions. If Fiona runs a small business, then she either supports environmental causes or fosters local economies (but not both). Heaven follows tradition. Mackenzie does not support environmental causes. Heaven runs a small business. Heaven either follows tradition or thinks outside the box, but not both. Mackenzie does not find innovative solutions. If someone loves plants and studies ecology, then they are passionate about nature. If Mackenzie values sustainability, then she has good instincts and thinks outside the box. If Heaven either builds a strong community or fosters local economies (but not both), then she drives social change. If Heaven either helps others or mentors people (but not both), then she is able to build a strong community. Heaven does not support environmental causes. If Heaven values sustainability, then she has good instincts and thinks outside the box. Heaven takes calculated risks. Heaven does not find innovative solutions. Anders takes calculated risks.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Heaven discovers natural remedies.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Heaven runs a small business and does not support environmental causes. By the XOR rule, she must foster local economies.
- If XOR(builds strong community, fosters local economies) then drives social change. Since she does not drive social change and fosters local economies is true, she must also build a strong community.
- By XOR(builds strong community, creates successful products), she does not create successful products. Hence, from “If works hard then creates successful products,” she does not work hard.
- From follows tradition and XOR(follows tradition, thinks outside the box), she does not think outside the box. Thus, from “If values sustainability then good instincts and thinks outside the box,” she does not value sustainability.
- From (values sustainability or passionate about nature) implies finds innovative solutions, and she does not find innovative solutions, infer she is not passionate about nature (and not values sustainability).

There is no rule linking Heaven’s properties to discovering natural remedies; the only rule that entails discovering natural remedies is specific to Fiona. Therefore, whether Heaven discovers natural remedies cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
