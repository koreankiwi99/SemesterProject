Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Matias is resilient.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- It is explicitly stated that Matias is not able to overcome obstacles.
- The only rule that could make him able to overcome obstacles requires that he learns from mistakes XOR analyzes errors. We know he does not analyze errors, and from the premises we cannot deduce that he learns from mistakes (only that he faces setbacks, which implies learns from mistakes or works hard, but not necessarily learns from mistakes).
- Therefore, we cannot derive that he is able to overcome obstacles, and the explicit statement says he is not.
- Interpreting “resilient” as being able to overcome obstacles, the statement that Matias is resilient is false.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: False
Correct: No
