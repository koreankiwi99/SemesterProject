Question ID: 222
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Dr. Archie studies plant properties, then he will develop new treatments. Any botanist who explores remote areas or analyzes botanical data will study plant properties. If a botanist reads scientific literature and conducts experiments, then they can analyze botanical data. Dr. Archie does not publish research findings. Dr. Archie does not collect plant samples. If Dr. Archie either makes new discoveries or develops new treatments (but not both), then he leads in his field. Archie mentors students. Every botanist either collects plant samples or analyzes botanical data, but not necessarily both. Any botanist who loves nature will understand plant life. If Dr. Archie conducts experiments and tests hypotheses, then he can develop new treatments. Dr. Archie is either a leader in his field or mentors students, but not necessarily both. Dr. Archie either understands plant life or publishes research findings, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Archie has specialized knowledge.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Dr. Archie does not publish research findings” and “Dr. Archie either understands plant life or publishes research findings, but not both,” we infer that Dr. Archie understands plant life.
- No premise defines or links “has specialized knowledge” to any stated property (e.g., understanding plant life, developing new treatments, being a leader, etc.).
- Therefore, while Archie understands plant life, we cannot conclude that he “has specialized knowledge” as the term is not defined or entailed by the given statements.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
