Shay works hard or is skilled. If someone has a lot of imaginations, then they enjoy creating things and think outside the box. If Shay is detail-oriented, then she either takes pride in her work or enjoys creating things (but not both). Shay values quality or is skilled. If Shay strives for excellence, then she either has perfectionism or seeks feedback (but not both). Shay seeks feedback. Shay remains anonymous. Shay strives for excellence. Shay has a lot of imaginations. Shay has perfectionism if she sets high standards. Shay is detail-oriented. Either Shay is a famous artist or she remains anonymous, but not both. If someone values quality, then they either take pride in their work or have perfectionism.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Shay's work is not viral.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From strives for excellence and seeks feedback plus the XOR rule: seeks feedback is true, so perfectionism is false.
- From has a lot of imaginations: enjoys creating things and thinks outside the box are true.
- From detail-oriented and the XOR rule with enjoys creating things: takes pride in work is false.
- From if values quality then (pride or perfectionism): since both pride and perfectionism are false, values quality must be false.
- From (values quality or skilled): skilled is true.
- From remains anonymous and the XOR with famous artist: famous artist is false.

Nothing in the premises mentions “viral” or links anonymity or fame to virality. Therefore, whether Shay’s work is viral cannot be determined.
