Question ID: 225
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If someone engages in yoga and gets enough sleep, then they feel rejuvenated. Carly has clarity. Everyone who reduces stress either finds balance or increases calmness (or both). If Carly lives longer, then she does not necessarily age gracefully, and if Carly ages gracefully, then she does not necessarily live longer. Carly does not stay positive. Everyone who exercises regularly either improves their mood or boosts their energy (or both). Carly does not feel rejuvenated. Everyone either has clarity or finds balance, but it's not always both at the same time. Carly stays hydrated. If Carly either reduces stress or improves her mood (but not both), then she stays positive. If Carly either gets enough sleep or stays hydrated (but not both), then she ages gracefully. Carly does not boost her energy. Carly engages in yoga. Carly does not increase calmness. Carly either exercises regularly or has good health.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Carly does not eat alkaline-rich foods.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From (yoga ∧ enough sleep) -> rejuvenated and given yoga true and rejuvenated false, Carly does not get enough sleep.
- Given hydrated true and (sleep ⊕ hydrated) -> ages gracefully, Carly ages gracefully.
- From (reduces stress ⊕ improves mood) -> stays positive and stays positive is false, reduces stress and improves mood have the same truth value (both true or both false).
- With exercises regularly -> (improves mood ∨ boosts energy) and boosts energy false, if she exercises regularly then she improves mood; otherwise she has good health. No contradiction arises.
- Nowhere in the premises mentions eating alkaline-rich foods or links it to any given predicates.

Therefore, the truth of “Carly does not eat alkaline-rich foods” cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
