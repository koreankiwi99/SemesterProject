Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Amanda is not disciplined. If Amanda is persistent, then she is both open-minded and a problem solver. Amanda is motivated. If Amanda is an experienced designer, then she either solves real-world problems or has attention to detail, but not both. If Greta is motivated, then she is either disciplined or persistent (but not both). Anyone who has good taste or solves real-world problems can be an innovative designer. Amanda is an experienced designer. If Amanda is motivated, then she is either disciplined or persistent (but not both). Amanda does not think critically. If Amanda has strong foundations, then she is either strategic or solves real-world problems (but not both). If someone sets high standards, then they work diligently and have attention to detail. If Amanda experiments with materials, then she is an innovative designer. Every innovative designer either thinks outside the box or develops unique products (or both). Anyone who has visionary ideas thinks outside the box. Noah is an experienced designer. Amanda does not value precision. All problem solvers are creative and think outside the box. For all people, if they either think critically or have attention to detail, then they value precision. Amanda does not develop unique products. Amanda is open-minded.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Amanda is not practical.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Amanda is motivated” and “If Amanda is motivated, then she is either disciplined or persistent (but not both)” with “Amanda is not disciplined,” we infer Amanda is persistent.
- Persistent implies she is open-minded and a problem solver. All problem solvers think outside the box.
- Amanda is an experienced designer, and such implies (solves real-world problems) XOR (attention to detail). From “If (think critically or attention to detail) then value precision” and “Amanda does not value precision,” we get not attention to detail; thus she solves real-world problems.
- No rule relates being practical to any given predicates (problem solver, solves real-world problems, etc.). Hence, we cannot determine whether Amanda is practical or not.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
