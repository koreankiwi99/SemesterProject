Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Kaylani does not explore culture. If James lives happily and has good relationships, then he can achieve his life goals. James does not meditate regularly. James has good health. James does not appreciate wildlife. James either engages in sports or reads books. If James sets life goals, then he either reads books or pursues hobbies. For all humans, if someone feels calm and has good health, then they can live happily. James has good relationships. Kaylani does not appreciate wildlife. If James engages in sports, then he either meditates regularly or practices mindfulness, but not both. James does not value knowledge. If James either connects with nature or appreciates wildlife (but not both), then he feels calm. James does not achieve his life goals. James does not explore culture. If a person reads books, then they value knowledge and explore culture. James either practices mindfulness or embarks on long journeys, but not necessarily both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? James does not find inner peace.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We need to interpret “find inner peace” as “feels calm,” since “feels calm” is the only relevant mental-state predicate given.

From the premises:
- If reads books → values knowledge and explores culture. Given James does not value knowledge, contrapositive yields James does not read books.
- James either engages in sports or reads books. Since he does not read books, he engages in sports.
- If James engages in sports, then he either meditates regularly or practices mindfulness, but not both. Given he does not meditate regularly, he must practice mindfulness.

There is a rule to derive calm: If James either connects with nature or appreciates wildlife (but not both), then he feels calm. We know James does not appreciate wildlife, but we have no information about whether he connects with nature. Thus we cannot conclude he feels calm. No other premise links mindfulness or any other fact to calm.

Nothing implies that he does not feel calm either. Therefore, whether James finds inner peace (feels calm) cannot be determined.
