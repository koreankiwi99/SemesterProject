Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Boone is a skilled soap maker.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Boone creates unique items” and “If Boone either mass-produces goods or creates unique items (but not both), then he is a custom maker,” together with “Boone is not a custom maker,” we infer that the XOR condition is false; since Boone does create unique items, this implies Boone also mass-produces goods.
- Given “Boone is either a craftsman or mass-produces goods, but not both,” and we have mass-produces goods, Boone is not a craftsman.
- From “If Boone either follows traditional methods or values handcrafting (but not both), then he is a craftsman” and Boone is not a craftsman, the XOR antecedent is false. Since Boone does not value handcrafting, this implies he does not follow traditional methods; by the given XOR between following traditional methods and using natural ingredients, Boone uses natural ingredients.
- None of these facts establish that Boone makes soap at all, nor that he is “skilled.” The only link to soaps is conditional on Boone being a meticulous artist, which is not established.
