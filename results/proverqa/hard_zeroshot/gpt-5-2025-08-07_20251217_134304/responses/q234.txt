Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Addilynn is either creative or business-savvy (but not both), then she is successful.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From partners with companies and not exporting (XOR rule 1), Addilynn enters global markets.
- From not developing new products and entering global markets (XOR rule 2), she expands into new markets.
- From embracing challenges and being open-minded, she thinks outside the box.
- With imagination and thinking outside the box, she is creative.
- From not investing in a startup and expanding into new markets (XOR rule 3), she takes risks.
- Given “business-savvy XOR takes risks” and that she takes risks, she is not business-savvy.

Thus, she is creative and not business-savvy, so the antecedent “creative XOR business-savvy” is true. There is no information connecting these facts to being successful, so we cannot conclude the consequent.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
