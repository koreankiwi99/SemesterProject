Question ID: 235
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Esme does not uncover new insights. Esme does not analyze rock formations. If Esme either studies xenoliths or studies volcanoes (but not both), then she gains recognition. Sergio creates maps. If Esme researches the Earth's history, then she either investigates magma or studies volcanoes (or both). Esme either collects samples or creates maps, but not both. Arthur does not analyze rock formations. Esme either analyzes rock formations or studies volcanoes, but not both. If a geologist either surveys terrain or measures strata (but not both), then they conduct fieldwork. Every geologist either examines fossils or conducts fieldwork. If Esme either collects samples or publishes research (but not both), then she advances knowledge. Esme does not explore remote areas. If Esme gains recognition, then she publishes research and conducts fieldwork. If a geologist mentors students and develops new methods, then they can gain recognition. Esme creates maps. Every geologist who advances knowledge either explores remote areas or uncovers new insights (or both). If Esme either examines minerals or models Earth processes (but not both), then she publishes research. Esme does not examine fossils.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Esme does not study xenoliths.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Esme does not analyze rock formations” and “Esme either analyzes rock formations or studies volcanoes, but not both,” it follows that Esme studies volcanoes.
- From “Esme creates maps” and “Esme either collects samples or creates maps, but not both,” it follows that Esme does not collect samples.
- Assume for contradiction that Esme does not study xenoliths. Since she studies volcanoes, the exclusive-or condition “studies xenoliths or studies volcanoes (but not both)” holds, so she gains recognition. Then she publishes research. With “does not collect samples,” the exclusive-or in “collects samples or publishes research (but not both)” reduces to publishing research, so she advances knowledge.
- For geologists, “any who advance knowledge either explore remote areas or uncover new insights.” But Esme does not explore remote areas and does not uncover new insights. Contradiction.
- Therefore, Esme must study xenoliths.

ANSWER: False

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
