Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Thatcher either forges ahead or bounces back (but not both), then he overcomes adversity. If Jesse either faces criticism or grows from a situation, then he becomes resilient. Samir does not perform well under challenging circumstances. For Samir, either staying calm or acting on instinct is sufficient, but not necessarily both. If Thatcher either avoids conflict or seeks resolution (but not both), then he can handle pressure. Samir seeks resolution. If Samir faces failure, then he either finds new strength or grows from it (or both). Samir either avoids conflict or overcomes adversity, but not both. Brittany does not admit fault. For Thatcher, either staying calm or acting on instinct is sufficient, but not necessarily both. Thatcher acts on instinct. Anyone who faces criticism or admits fault can develop mental toughness. If Samir either forges ahead or bounces back (but not both), then he overcomes adversity. If Samir takes a risk, then he either learns from it or bounces back, but not both. Samir forges ahead. If Samir either faces criticism or grows from a situation, then he becomes resilient. Samir acts on instinct. Jesse forges ahead. Everyone who either stays calm or can handle pressure is able to perform well under challenging circumstances. If Samir either avoids conflict or seeks resolution (but not both), then he can handle pressure. Samir does not admit fault. Samir takes a risk. Jesse takes a risk. Samir does not develop mental toughness. For all humans, if someone makes a mistake, then they either learn from it or grow from it (or both). Thatcher does not develop mental toughness. Thatcher seeks resolution. Samir does not become resilient.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Samir does not make a mistake.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Everyone who either stays calm or can handle pressure is able to perform well under challenging circumstances and Samir does not perform well under challenging circumstances, infer not(stays calm or can handle pressure). Hence, Samir does not stay calm and cannot handle pressure.
- Given Samir seeks resolution and If Samir either avoids conflict or seeks resolution (but not both), then he can handle pressure, the lack of handling pressure implies not XOR, so Samir avoids conflict is also true.
- From Samir either avoids conflict or overcomes adversity, but not both and avoids conflict true, conclude Samir does not overcome adversity.
- From Samir forges ahead and If Samir either forges ahead or bounces back (but not both), then he overcomes adversity together with not overcoming adversity, we get not(FA xor BB). Since FA is true, BB must be true.
- From Samir takes a risk and If Samir takes a risk, then he either learns from it or bounces back, but not both, and BB true, conclude learns-from-it is false.
- From If Samir either faces criticism or grows from a situation, then he becomes resilient and Samir does not become resilient, infer neither faces criticism nor grows (i.e., grows is false).
- From For all humans, if someone makes a mistake, then they either learn from it or grow from it (or both) and we have both learn false and grow false for Samir, by contrapositive conclude Samir does not make a mistake.
