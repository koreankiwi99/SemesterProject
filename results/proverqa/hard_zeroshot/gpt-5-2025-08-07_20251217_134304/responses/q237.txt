Context:
Eren does not follow orders. If Marco is either a fearless leader or inspires others (but not both), then he leads by example. Eren inspires others. Raiden does not follow orders. If someone is a young soldier, then they follow orders and respect their superiors. If Eren is a warrior, then he is either a determined fighter or a self-serving traitor, but not both. If Eren is either a fearless leader or inspires others (but not both), then he leads by example. If Eren abandons friends and prioritizes himself, then he can be a cowardly deserter. If Eren has strong convictions, then he is a fearless leader. Eren either compromises his values or stands by his principles, but he does not do both. Eren does not lead by example. If Daisy is a young soldier, then he is either a fearless leader or a determined fighter, but not both. Eren does not compromise his values. Raiden does not join the military. If Marco joins the military, then he either faces adversity or serves with honor. Raiden does not compromise his values. Daisy does not put others first. If Daisy faces adversity, then he either stands by his principles or is a cowardly deserter (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Eren is either a determined fighter or a cowardly deserter, but not both.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- We know Eren inspires others.
- From “If Eren is either a fearless leader or inspires others (but not both), then he leads by example” and “Eren does not lead by example,” by contrapositive, it is not the case that exactly one of (fearless leader, inspires others) holds. Since Eren does inspire others, he must also be a fearless leader.
- From “Eren either compromises his values or stands by his principles, but not both” and “Eren does not compromise his values,” we get that Eren stands by his principles.
- There are no rules linking fearless leader, inspires others, or stands by principles to being a determined fighter or a cowardly deserter.
- The only rules that could yield determined fighter or cowardly deserter for Eren require additional conditions: being a warrior (to get determined fighter XOR self-serving traitor) or abandoning friends and prioritizing himself (to get cowardly deserter). We have no information that those conditions hold.

Therefore, we cannot determine whether Eren is a determined fighter, a cowardly deserter, exactly one, or neither.
