Question ID: 238
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
For all botanists, if they investigate plant reproduction and explore self-fertilization, then they can study autogamy. Atharv collects plant samples. Dante investigates plant reproduction. Alec develops new theories. Atharv develops new theories. If Dr. Alec studies autogamy, then he will make groundbreaking discoveries and contribute to agriculture. If Dr. Atharv analyzes plant mechanisms, then he will explore self-fertilization. Dr. June either publishes research or makes groundbreaking discoveries. If Dr. Atharv collects plant samples, then he either develops new theories or earns academic recognition, but not both. If Dr. Atharv studies autogamy, then he will make groundbreaking discoveries and contribute to agriculture. If Dr. Atharv conducts fieldwork, then he either publishes research or earns academic recognition. Dr. Atharv conducts fieldwork. Atharv investigates plant reproduction. Dr. Atharv analyzes plant mechanisms. Dr. June analyzes plant mechanisms. If Dr. June analyzes plant mechanisms, then he will explore self-fertilization. Alec collects plant samples.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Atharv contributes to agriculture.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Dr. Atharv analyzes plant mechanisms" and the rule "If Dr. Atharv analyzes plant mechanisms, then he will explore self-fertilization," we get that Dr. Atharv explores self-fertilization.
- From "Atharv investigates plant reproduction," we know he investigates plant reproduction.
- The universal rule says: for all botanists, if they investigate plant reproduction and explore self-fertilization, then they can study autogamy. Even if this applies to Atharv, it only yields that he can study autogamy, not that he actually studies it.
- The statement that would imply contributing to agriculture is: "If Dr. Atharv studies autogamy, then he will make groundbreaking discoveries and contribute to agriculture." We do not have that he studies autogamy, only that he can (at best).
- Other given facts (e.g., collecting samples, developing theories, conducting fieldwork leading to publishing) do not entail contributing to agriculture.

Conclusion: We cannot deduce that Dr. Atharv contributes to agriculture; nor can we deny it. It remains undetermined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
