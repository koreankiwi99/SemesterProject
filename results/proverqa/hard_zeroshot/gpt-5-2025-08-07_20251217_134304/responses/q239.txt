Context:
Elsie does not embrace uncertainty. Elsie does not face adversity. Eva values self-improvement. If Wynter loses direction in life, then she will find a new purpose. If someone faces challenges and stays curious, then they take risks. If Eva pursues her passion, then she discovers resilience and has a setback. If Elsie pursues her passion, then she discovers resilience and has a setback. Eva does not embrace uncertainty. Eva reflects on her actions. If someone takes risks and reflects on their actions, then they gain wisdom. If Neil overcomes obstacles, then she either learns from her mistakes or gains wisdom (or both). If someone meets a dead end, then they have experienced failure. Wynter did not lose direction in life. Neil is adventurous. If Eva achieves success, then she either develops patience or gains wisdom (but not both). Eva is adventurous. Elsie values self-improvement. Anyone who is adventurous either takes risks or embraces uncertainty (or both). If Eva values self-improvement, then she pursues her passion and has mentorship. If Wynter values self-improvement, then she pursues her passion and has mentorship.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Eva had a setback or experienced failure, then she can find a new purpose.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Eva values self-improvement” and “If Eva values self-improvement, then she pursues her passion and has mentorship,” Eva pursues her passion.
- From “If Eva pursues her passion, then she discovers resilience and has a setback,” Eva had a setback. Thus the antecedent (“Eva had a setback or experienced failure”) is satisfied.
- We have no rule linking Eva’s setback or failure to “find a new purpose.” The only “find a new purpose” rule applies to Wynter if she loses direction, which is not relevant to Eva.
- Therefore, whether Eva can find a new purpose does not follow from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
