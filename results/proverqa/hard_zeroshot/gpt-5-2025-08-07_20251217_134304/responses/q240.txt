If Penny either spots high-quality stone or extracts precise cuts (but not both), then she masters stonework. Penny understands geology or knows masonry. Penny does not create lasting structures. Penny has engineering skills. Penny is attentive to detail. Penny works independently. If someone understands geology and extracts precise cuts, then they can create lasting structures. If Aliza is an experienced quarryman, then she either spots high-quality stone or earns the respect of her colleagues (or both). If Aliza is attentive to detail, then she is a skilled craftswoman. Penny either works with rock or is an experienced quarryman. Ocean either knows masonry or has engineering skills, but not both. Penny either knows masonry or has engineering skills, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Penny earns the respect of her colleagues.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Penny is attentive to detail, she is a skilled craftswoman. For skilled craftswoman, she must either work independently or be an experienced quarryman, but not both. Given she works independently, she is not an experienced quarryman.
- From “either works with rock or is an experienced quarryman” and not experienced quarryman, Penny works with rock.
- From “knows masonry or has engineering skills, but not both” and Penny has engineering skills, she does not know masonry. From “understands geology or knows masonry,” she understands geology.
- From “if understands geology and extracts precise cuts then creates lasting structures” and “does not create lasting structures,” Penny does not extract precise cuts.
- From “if spots high-quality stone xor extracts precise cuts then masters stonework” and “does not master stonework,” she does not satisfy the xor; combined with not extracting precise cuts, she also does not spot high-quality stone.
- No rule connects Penny to earning respect; the only respect-related rule is specific to Aliza. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Penny earns the respect of her colleagues.
