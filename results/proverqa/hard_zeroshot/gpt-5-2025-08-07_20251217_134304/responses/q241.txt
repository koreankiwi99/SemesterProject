Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Michelle is creative.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Michelle is artistic” and “If Michelle is artistic, then she either captures imaginations or inspires children,” together with “Michelle paints vibrantly,” “Anyone who captures imaginations either tells stories or sparks curiosity,” “Michelle does not spark curiosity,” and “If someone tells stories and paints vibrantly, then they can connect with others,” plus “Michelle cannot connect with others,” we infer Michelle does not capture imaginations; hence she must inspire children.

- From “Michelle is not able to express herself” and “Everyone who either thinks outside the box or brings joy to adults is able to express themselves,” we get that Michelle neither thinks outside the box nor brings joy to adults.

- From “Michelle embraces uncertainty” and the XOR rule “(embraces uncertainty XOR thinks outside the box) -> able to find unique solutions,” she is able to find unique solutions.

- Although there is some inconsistency elsewhere (about curiosity), nothing in the premises establishes that Michelle is creative, nor that she is not creative.

- The only rule about creativity is one-way: “If Michelle is creative, then she can either inspire children or bring joy to adults, but not both.” We already have she inspires children and does not bring joy to adults, which is compatible with being creative but does not entail it.

Therefore, whether Michelle is creative cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain
