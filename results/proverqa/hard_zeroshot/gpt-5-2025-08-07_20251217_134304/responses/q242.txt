  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From learning new languages and exploring cultures, Skyla travels frequently. Given she travels frequently and collects art, and the rule is exclusive-or between appreciating nature and collecting art, she does not appreciate nature.
- She either enjoys outdoor activities or loves gardening (inclusive). She does not enjoy outdoor activities, so she loves gardening.
- If exactly one of passion for botany and love of gardening holds, then she appreciates nature. Since she does not appreciate nature and does love gardening, she must also have a passion for botany.

Thus, Skyla has a passion for botany. However, there is no information establishing that she studies rare flowers or conserves natural habitats. Therefore, the overall statement (a conjunction) cannot be confirmed.
