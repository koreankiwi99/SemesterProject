Context:
If Kaylee studies frogs, then she can either contribute to scientific knowledge or inspire others, but not both. If Kaylee lives in tropical regions, then she appreciates wildlife and explores rainforests. Kaylee examines habitats or analyzes amphibians. If Kaylee loves nature, then she studies frogs and values biodiversity. Enzo either documents wildlife or works in laboratories, but not both. If Kaylee either explores rainforests or analyzes amphibians (but not both), then she studies frogs. Kaylee publishes wildlife papers. If Kaylee either creates habitats or raises animals (but not both), then she works in laboratories. Enzo is not a conservationist. Kaylee either teaches wildlife courses or protects ecosystems, but not both. Kaylee does not collect samples. Enzo either explores rainforests or documents wildlife, but not both. Kaylee either teaches wildlife courses or analyzes amphibians, but not both. Kaylee either explores rainforests or documents wildlife, but not both. Kaylee does not inspire others. For all humans, if someone either publishes wildlife papers or protects ecosystems, then they are a conservationist. Kaylee is not a conservationist. If Kaylee attends conferences, then she either authors papers or develops theories, but not both. Enzo either teaches wildlife courses or analyzes amphibians, but not both. Shane does not conduct experiments. If Bode either explores rainforests or analyzes amphibians (but not both), then she studies frogs. Kaylee either documents wildlife or works in laboratories, but not both. If someone works in laboratories, then they collect samples and develop theories. If Bode studies frogs, then she can either contribute to scientific knowledge or inspire others, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kaylee does not contribute to scientific knowledge.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From: XOR(DW(Kaylee), WL(Kaylee)) and XOR(ER(Kaylee), DW(Kaylee)), plus WL → collect samples and Kaylee does not collect samples, we deduce DW(Kaylee) is true, WL(Kaylee) false, and ER(Kaylee) false.
- With ER(Kaylee) false, the rule XOR(ER, AA) → SF reduces to AA(Kaylee) → SF(Kaylee).
- From XOR(TWC, AA) and XOR(TWC, PE), we get AA(Kaylee) ↔ PE(Kaylee). No further facts force AA to be true or false.
- If AA true, then SF true, and with ¬Inspire(Kaylee) and “SF → exactly one of {Contribute, Inspire},” we get Contribute(Kaylee) true, making the target statement false. If AA false, SF is not implied and Contribute is unconstrained.
- Hence, whether Kaylee contributes to scientific knowledge is not determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
