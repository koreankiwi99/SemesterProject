Question ID: 246
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
For every person, either they find inner peace or they discover a new meaning in life, but these two are not necessarily related. For Matthew, facing challenges and finding solace are mutually exclusive. Matthew loses everything. If Matthew reassesses his priorities, then he either discovers a new meaning in life or restarts his life (or both). If someone hits rock bottom, then they reassess their priorities. Matthew faces challenges. If Matthew restarts his life, then he will either pursue his passion or find solace, but not both. Anyone who loses everything will hit rock bottom. Matthew finds inner peace.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Matthew pursues his passion.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Matthew loses everything ⇒ hits rock bottom ⇒ reassesses priorities ⇒ (discovers new meaning ∨ restarts life). So N ∨ R is true.
- Matthew faces challenges, and for him “facing challenges” and “finding solace” are mutually exclusive ⇒ he does not find solace (S is false).
- If Matthew restarts life (R), then exactly one of (pursues passion, finds solace). With S false, R ⇒ pursues passion (P).
- However, we only know N ∨ R; R is not entailed. It’s consistent that R is false and N is true, leaving P unconstrained.
- “Finds inner peace” does not link to “finding solace” or to “pursues passion” in the given statements.

Thus, whether Matthew pursues his passion cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:

Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
