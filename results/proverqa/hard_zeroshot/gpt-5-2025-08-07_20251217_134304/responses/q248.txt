Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Anyone who publishes papers and presents findings can receive international recognition. Elisa explores new ideas. Beckham learns from others. Papito sets goals. Elisa has a strong work ethic. If Elisa has curiosity, then she conducts innovative research and pushes boundaries. Greyson does not develop new treatments. If Elisa has passion, then she will conduct innovative research. If Elisa sets goals, then she overcomes obstacles and is highly motivated. Elisa sets goals. If Elisa either collaborates with experts or makes breakthrough discoveries (but not both), then she advances scientific knowledge. If Elisa collaborates with experts, then she either learns from others or gains new insights (but not both). Elisa does not solve complex problems. If someone either explores new ideas or has curiosity, then they solve complex problems. Anyone who conducts innovative research and receives international recognition can make breakthrough discoveries. If Papito understands brain functions, then she can either develop new treatments or receive international recognition, but not both. Elisa gains new insights. If Elisa understands brain functions, then she can either develop new treatments or receive international recognition, but not both. Elisa overcomes obstacles. If Elisa has a strong work ethic, then she is either highly motivated or advances scientific knowledge, but not both. Greyson explores new ideas. Elisa does not develop new treatments. Elisa learns from others. Anyone who enjoys learning or faces challenges can be highly motivated.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Elisa understands brain functions.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Elisa sets goals, so she is highly motivated. With a strong work ethic and the rule “either highly motivated or advances scientific knowledge, but not both,” this implies she does not advance scientific knowledge.
- Elisa both learns from others and gains new insights. Since “if she collaborates with experts then either learns or gains (but not both),” this implies she does not collaborate with experts.
- With not collaborating, “if (collaborates XOR makes breakthroughs) then advances knowledge” reduces to “if makes breakthroughs then advances knowledge.” Since she does not advance knowledge, she does not make breakthrough discoveries.
- From “if conducts innovative research and receives international recognition then makes breakthroughs” and the fact she does not make breakthroughs, we infer not(both conducts innovative research and receives international recognition). So at least one of those is false.
- If Elisa understands brain functions, then (given she does not develop new treatments) she would receive international recognition. This is consistent with the previous point provided she does not conduct innovative research, which we cannot establish either way. Likewise, we cannot show she lacks international recognition.

Conclusion: There is no definitive support for either Elisa understanding brain functions or not.
