==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Holden is a passionate cook, so by the given rule he is either a skilled chef or creative, but not both.
- If Holden were a skilled chef, he would run a popular kitchen, but he does not; therefore he is not a skilled chef. Hence, he must be creative.
- Anyone who pays attention to details or is successful can build a loyal customer base. Holden cannot build a loyal customer base, so he is neither successful nor pays attention to details.
- If Holden is either meticulous or creative (but not both), then he is successful. Since he is not successful, it cannot be that exactly one of meticulous or creative holds. Given he is creative, meticulous must also be true (so that “meticulous xor creative” is false).
