==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Rosalyn follows her instincts" and "If Rosalyn follows her instincts, then she is a sleuth and tracks down leads," we get that Rosalyn is a sleuth and tracks down leads.
- From "Rosalyn is an investigator" and "If Rosalyn is an investigator, then she is either uncovering facts or seeking truth, but not both," we know exactly one of uncovering facts or seeking truth is true, but we don't know which.
- "Rosalyn either analyzes clues or uncovers facts" does not determine which of those is true, nor does it fix the truth of seeking truth.
- We know Rosalyn is transparent and not dishonest, but there is no explicit rule connecting transparency or dishonesty to "hiding truth."
- The statement in question involves "seeking truth" XOR "hiding truth." We have no information about "hiding truth" at all, and "seeking truth" remains undetermined.

Therefore, the truth of the statement cannot be determined from the given information.
