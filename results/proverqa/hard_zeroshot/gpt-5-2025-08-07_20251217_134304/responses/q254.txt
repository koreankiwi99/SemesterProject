Question ID: 254
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Gustavo learns from failure. Anyone who makes impossible shots either masters strategies or wins competitions. If Gustavo is a skilled archer, then he can either anticipate his opponent's moves or make impossible shots, but not both. Gustavo pursues perfection. For Gustavo, either he achieves success or he experiences failure, but not both at the same time. If Gustavo either pursues perfection or remains humble, then he achieves success. Everyone who becomes legendary does not remain humble, and everyone who remains humble does not necessarily become legendary. Gustavo experiences failure. If Gustavo wins competitions and stays focused, then he becomes legendary. Gustavo does not master strategies. Gustavo manages pressure or stays focused. Gustavo either learns from failure or manages pressure, but not both. Gustavo is a skilled archer.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Gustavo cannot anticipate his opponent's moves.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Gustavo is a skilled archer” and the rule for skilled archers, exactly one of the following holds: Gustavo anticipates his opponent’s moves (A) or he makes impossible shots (M).
- From “Gustavo learns from failure” and the XOR with “manages pressure,” he does not manage pressure; therefore, given “manages pressure or stays focused,” he stays focused.
- If M, then (since he does not master strategies) he must win competitions; with staying focused, he becomes legendary, hence not humble. This does not create a contradiction with A being possible; it only shows consequences if M is chosen.
- There is no rule that forces A or forces M. Both branches remain compatible with the given information (setting aside unrelated tensions about success/failure).

Therefore, we cannot deduce that Gustavo cannot anticipate his opponent’s moves.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
