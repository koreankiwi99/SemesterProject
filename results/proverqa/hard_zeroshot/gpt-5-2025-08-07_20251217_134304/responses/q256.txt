If Rex is loyal, then he either protects Sarah or brings joy, but not both. If a dog runs quickly and plays frequently, then it keeps active. All dogs that scavenge successfully explore areas and keep active. Any dog that wags its tail or barks loudly can get attention. Every dog that defends its family will protect its owner. For any dog, if they perform tricks and act cute, then they get attention. If Rex finds food, then he will either avoid dangers or scavenge successfully. Rex either finds food or protects Sarah, but not both. Sawyer plays outdoors. Rex does not explore areas. Every dog either provides comfort or brings joy.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rex is not loyal.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Rex barks loudly, and any dog that barks loudly can get attention, so Rex gets attention. Given “Rex either provides comfort or gets attention, but not both,” this makes “provides comfort” false for Rex.
- Every dog either provides comfort or brings joy. Since Rex does not provide comfort, Rex brings joy.
- Suppose Rex finds food. Then (given Rex) he either avoids dangers or scavenges successfully. But Rex does not avoid dangers, so he would scavenge successfully. All dogs that scavenge successfully explore areas, yet Rex does not explore areas. Contradiction. Hence Rex does not find food.
- From “Rex either finds food or protects Sarah, but not both,” and “Rex does not find food,” it follows that Rex protects Sarah.
- So Rex both protects Sarah and brings joy. The condition “If Rex is loyal, then he either protects Sarah or brings joy, but not both” would be violated. Therefore, by contrapositive, Rex is not loyal.
