Question ID: 257
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Callan has a unique design, then it either pioneers a discovery or breaks boundaries (or both). If Galilea is either remarkable or has a unique design (but not both), then it makes history. Galilea does not make history. Galilea runs smoothly. Galilea has advanced sensors. If Galilea has a unique design, then it either pioneers a discovery or breaks boundaries (or both). Galilea either travels a long distance or is remarkable. Any spacecraft that meets specifications or is well maintained is fully functional. Callan does not make history. Galilea is maintained. Galilea does not break boundaries. If Callan is either remarkable or has a unique design (but not both), then it makes history. If Galilea is either fully functional or completely damaged (but not both), then it is remarkable. Galilea either pioneers a discovery or gathers critical data, but not both. Kenji runs smoothly. Any spacecraft with advanced sensors gathers critical data. Galilea operates normally or is fully functional. Kenji has advanced sensors. All maintained spacecraft either operate normally or run smoothly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Galilea is completely damaged.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Galilea has advanced sensors, so it gathers critical data. From the XOR “pioneers or gathers data,” Galilea does not pioneer.
- Galilea does not break boundaries. If it had a unique design, it would pioneer or break boundaries; since it does neither, Galilea does not have a unique design.
- If Galilea were (remarkable XOR unique design), it would make history. It does not make history, and it is not unique design, so it is not remarkable.
- Galilea is maintained; taking “maintained” to qualify as “well maintained,” any well maintained spacecraft is fully functional, so Galilea is fully functional.
- If Galilea were (fully functional XOR completely damaged), it would be remarkable. Since it is not remarkable, (fully functional XOR completely damaged) is false; with fully functional true, completely damaged must also be true.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
