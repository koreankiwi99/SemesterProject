==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Esteban loves designer brands and enjoys fine dining, so he has luxurious tastes.
- He craves attention and does not listen to others; with the XOR rule, he therefore ignores advice.
- Luxurious tastes and ignoring advice imply he invests recklessly.
- Having common sense implies he lives frugally and makes informed decisions; with the XOR, he does not spend excessively.
- There is no given rule that links investing recklessly (or any other established fact) to “financial difficulties,” and we have no evidence of debt or overspending.

Therefore, whether he will face financial difficulties cannot be determined from the given information.
