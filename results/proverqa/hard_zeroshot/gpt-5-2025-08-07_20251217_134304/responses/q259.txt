Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Aileen does not dislike tango.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Aileen has stage experience and performs ballet. From the rule (stage experience -> ballet XOR rumba), Aileen does not perform rumba.
- Aileen dances samba. Since she does not perform rumba, the condition (rumba XOR samba) holds, so Aileen teaches dance.
- Aileen appreciates music, so she instructs movement.
- From instructs movement -> loves waltz XOR loves salsa, and given Aileen loves waltz, it follows she does not love salsa.
- From teaches dance -> loves salsa XOR enjoys tango, and since she does not love salsa, Aileen enjoys tango.
- Given enjoys tango XOR dislikes tango, enjoying tango implies she does not dislike tango.

ANSWER: True
