Question ID: 260
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Norah is not careful. Norah publishes her findings. If Norah has attention to detail, then she is either an archaeologist or is careful (or both). Norah thinks logically. If Norah is an analyst, then she is either systematic or methodical (but not both). Norah is an analyst. If Norah publishes her findings, then she is an expert researcher. Norah has attention to detail. Anyone who solves puzzles is perceptive. If Norah works precisely, then she is either systematic or thinks logically (but not both). All archaeologists are either meticulous or perceptive. If someone is an expert researcher, then they are either methodical or perceptive. Norah works precisely.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Norah is not intelligent.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Works precisely and “systematic XOR thinks logically,” together with “thinks logically,” imply Norah is not systematic.
- Analyst and “systematic XOR methodical,” with not systematic, imply Norah is methodical.
- Publishes -> expert researcher -> (methodical or perceptive); already satisfied by methodical.
- Attention to detail and not careful, with “A2D -> (archaeologist or careful),” force archaeologist.
- Archaeologist -> (meticulous or perceptive).

No premise links any of these traits to “intelligent” or “not intelligent.” Therefore, whether Norah is intelligent is not determined by the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
