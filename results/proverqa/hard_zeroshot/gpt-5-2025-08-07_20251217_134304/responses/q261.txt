Options:

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Violet values serenity, by the rule “If Violet values serenity, then she practices yoga and seeks guidance,” Violet practices yoga.
- Suppose Violet finds inner peace. Then she respects tradition and cultivates self-discipline; respecting tradition implies living humbly; living humbly implies serving others or appreciating simple things. But Violet does not appreciate simple things, so she serves others. With Violet pursuing personal growth, serving others implies she feels fulfilled—contradicting “Violet does not feel fulfilled.” Therefore, Violet does not find inner peace.
- From “If Violet either meditates daily or practices yoga (but not both), then she will find inner peace,” contraposition gives: if Violet does not find inner peace, then it is not the case that exactly one of meditating daily and practicing yoga holds. Since she practices yoga, she must also meditate daily.
- Violet performs ablutions. For all humans, if they perform ablutions and meditate daily, then they feel calm. Hence Violet feels calm.
