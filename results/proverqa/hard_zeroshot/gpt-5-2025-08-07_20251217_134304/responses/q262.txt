Context:
If Johan either eats nutritious food or has good genes (but not both), then she looks healthy. If Laurel either eats nutritious food or has good genes (but not both), then she looks healthy. Laurel does not have a noble bloodline. For Juan, receiving proper grooming and getting regular vaccinations are mutually exclusive, but not necessarily, as Juan may or may not receive one or the other. Johan gets regular exercise. Laurel is either a champion or has a noble bloodline, but not necessarily both. If Laurel has a shiny mane, then she is either a spirited animal or has a radiant coat (or both). For Laurel, receiving proper grooming and getting regular vaccinations are mutually exclusive, but not necessarily, as Laurel may or may not receive one or the other. If Laurel either possesses strength or has agility (but not both), then she can become a champion. If Laurel has a radiant coat, then she can either excel in show jumping or become a champion, but not both. If Laurel gets regular exercise, then she either eats nutritious food or has access to clean water, but not both. If Juan has a radiant coat, then she can either excel in show jumping or become a champion, but not both. Laurel does not look healthy. Any horse that receives proper grooming or has good genes can have a radiant coat. Laurel does not have access to clean water. Laurel gets regular vaccinations. Laurel gets regular exercise.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Laurel does not excel in show jumping.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Laurel gets regular exercise and does not have access to clean water. From “If Laurel gets regular exercise, then she either eats nutritious food or has access to clean water, but not both,” we get that Laurel eats nutritious food (N = true).
- From “If Laurel either eats nutritious food or has good genes (but not both), then she looks healthy” and “Laurel does not look healthy,” we infer that not (N xor G). Since N is true, this forces G (good genes) to be true as well.
- Grooming and vaccinations are mutually exclusive, and Laurel gets regular vaccinations, so she does not receive proper grooming. But from “Any horse that receives proper grooming or has good genes can have a radiant coat,” and G true, we conclude Laurel has a radiant coat (R = true).
- Laurel is either a champion or has a noble bloodline (inclusive or), and she does not have a noble bloodline, so she is a champion (C = true).
- From “If Laurel has a radiant coat, then she can either excel in show jumping or become a champion, but not both,” with R = true and C = true, it follows that she does not excel in show jumping (SJ = false).

Therefore, the statement “Laurel does not excel in show jumping” is true.
