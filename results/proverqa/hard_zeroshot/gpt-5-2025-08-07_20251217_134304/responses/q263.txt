Question ID: 263
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Every parasite either invades a host or manipulates cellular machinery. India attaches to a host. If Queenie attaches to a host, then she will infect it. Queenie attaches to a host. Queenie does not invade a host. If Queenie has a strong flagellum, then she will dominate her host. Any parasite that dominates its host will reproduce successfully. If Queenie is a virulent parasite, then she either colonizes tissues or dominates her host, but not both. If Queenie infects her host, then she either multiplies rapidly or evades the host's defenses, but not both. All parasites are either able to adapt to their host or survive in its environment, if they reproduce successfully. Queenie does not colonize tissues. Queenie is able to adapt to her host. Every parasite that manipulates cellular machinery of a host either evades the host's defenses or survives in its environment. If Queenie either penetrates cells or secretes toxins (but not both), then she infects her host. Queenie is a virulent parasite.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Queenie multiplies rapidly.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Queenie is a parasite (given: virulent parasite).
- Every parasite either invades or manipulates; Queenie does not invade, so she manipulates cellular machinery.
- Queenie attaches to a host, so she infects it.
- Given virulent and not colonizing tissues, by the XOR rule she dominates her host; thus she reproduces successfully.
- Infecting implies exactly one of: multiplies rapidly XOR evades defenses.
- Manipulating implies evades defenses OR survives; reproducing implies adapts OR survives. We know she adapts, but nothing rules out or forces evasion.
- Both scenarios are consistent:
  - If she evades, then she does not multiply rapidly.
  - If she does not evade, then she multiplies rapidly (and survives).

Therefore, whether Queenie multiplies rapidly cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
