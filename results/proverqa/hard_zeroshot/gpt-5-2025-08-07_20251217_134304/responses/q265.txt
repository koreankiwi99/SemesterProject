==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Everyone engages in discussions or listens to others” and “Gunner does not listen to others,” Gunner engages in discussions.
- From “If Gunner reads philosophy and engages in discussions, then he can pursue social justice,” and given he reads philosophy, conclude he pursues social justice.
- From “Gunner either fights against oppression or pursues social justice, but not both,” and the previous step, Gunner does not fight against oppression.
- From “If Gunner understands critical theory, then he participates in activism and challenges the status quo,” and given he understands critical theory, he challenges the status quo.
- From “If Gunner questions authority, then he either rejects conformity or seeks truth (but not both),” and given he seeks truth, conclude he does not reject conformity.
- Given “Gunner does not embrace diversity,” if he valued individuality then, by “If Gunner values individuality, then he either rejects conformity or embraces diversity (but not both),” exactly one of {rejects conformity, embraces diversity} would be true. But both are false, so he cannot value individuality.
- From “If someone seeks personal freedom, then they either value individuality or fight against oppression,” and since both are false for Gunner, he does not seek personal freedom.
- From “Gunner either seeks personal freedom or advocates for change, but not both,” conclude he advocates for change.
- Now he both advocates for change and challenges the status quo. But “If Gunner is informed, then he can either advocate for change or challenge the status quo, but not both.” Since both are true, this would violate the exclusive condition if he were informed. Therefore, he is not informed.
