Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If an insect mimics nature and blends into its environment, then it can survive its predators. If Kye has masterful camouflage, then he contributes to ecosystem balance and earns unique recognition. Any insect that survives its predators or finds food easily thrives in its habitat. Any insect that either moves stealthily or evades threats will live longer. Kye will not live longer. Kye adapts to seasons. Kye cannot regulate his population. For all insects, if they either mimic nature or adapt to seasons, then they can evade threats. Kye does not find food easily. If Kye has a rare gift, then he can blend into his environment and regulate his population. Kye does not thrive in his habitat. Kye does not contribute to ecosystem balance. Kye influences colony dynamics. If Kye is intelligent and can problem solve, then he possesses a rare gift. If Kye either earns unique recognition or influences colony dynamics (but not both), then he possesses a rare gift.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kye does not have masterful camouflage.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- If Kye has masterful camouflage, then he contributes to ecosystem balance and earns unique recognition.
- We are given that Kye does not contribute to ecosystem balance.
- Therefore, the conjunction (contributes to ecosystem balance ∧ earns unique recognition) is false, so by contrapositive, Kye does not have masterful camouflage.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
