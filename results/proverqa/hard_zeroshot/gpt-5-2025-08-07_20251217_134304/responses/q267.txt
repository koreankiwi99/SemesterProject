Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Gabriella does not enter the workforce" and "WF xor HE," we get HE(G).
- HE(G) and "HE -> (CER xor AS)" with "Gabriella is not able to communicate effectively" and "(AS or EK) -> C" imply ¬AS(G) and thus CER(G) is true.
- From ¬C(G) and "(RW or VC) -> EK," we get ¬EK(G), hence ¬RW(G) and ¬VC(G).
- "RW xor PA" with ¬RW(G) gives PA(G).
- "PA -> (SP xor RA)" and "SP(G)" imply ¬RA(G).
- "SO ∧ WA -> Inf" with SO(G) and ¬Inf(G) gives ¬WA(G).
- "(ME xor TW) -> RA" with ¬RA(G) implies ¬(ME xor TW). Given ¬ME(G), this forces ¬TW(G).

Therefore, Gabriella is not a talented writer.
