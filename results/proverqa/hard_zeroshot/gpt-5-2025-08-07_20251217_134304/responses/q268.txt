If Rhea swims in schools, then she is either agile or darts quickly, but not both. Everly does not have many fins. Rhea swims in schools. All clownfish that thrive in reefs have natural camouflage and form symbiotic relationships. Everly either has natural camouflage or lives in coral, but not necessarily both. Everly is young. Everly swims in schools. If Everly swims in schools, then she is either agile or darts quickly, but not both. If Everly is a young clownfish, then she is either small or has many fins, but not both. Uriah is agile. If Everly is a small clownfish, then she is either a fast swimmer or has bright coloration, but not both. Everly either has bright coloration or thrives in reefs, but not necessarily both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Everly has an anemone home, then she is either protected from predators or helps nourish the anemone, but not both.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- The premises provide details about Everly’s speed, agility, schooling behavior, fins, possible camouflage or coral living, youth, and a disjunction about bright coloration or thriving in reefs.
- The only mention of symbiosis is: “All clownfish that thrive in reefs have natural camouflage and form symbiotic relationships.” However, it is not established that Everly is a clownfish, nor that she definitively thrives in reefs (it’s only “bright coloration or thrives in reefs,” inclusive).
- There are no premises that mention an anemone home, protection from predators, or helping nourish the anemone.
- Therefore, we cannot deduce the antecedent (Everly has an anemone home) or the consequent (exclusive-or of protection vs. nourishment), so the truth of the conditional cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain
