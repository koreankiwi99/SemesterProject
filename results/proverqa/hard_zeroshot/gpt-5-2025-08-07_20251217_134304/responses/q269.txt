Context:
If Alexander pursues his passion, then he will gain recognition. Alexander is either a person with practical skills or a curious person, but he may not necessarily be both. Alexander thinks creatively. Alexander does not collect specimens. If someone can manage a garden, then they have practical skills. Alexander receives awards. Alexander writes books. If someone seeks medical breakthroughs and has curiosity, then they make discoveries. Alexander conducts experiments. Alexander either studies plants or is dedicated to healing (or both). If Alexander makes discoveries and shares knowledge, then he will gain recognition. If Alexander writes books, then he is either recognized or receives awards (but not both). If Alexander either studies plants or collects specimens (but not both), then he seeks medical breakthroughs. Alexander collaborates with others. Anyone who asks questions has curiosity. A person is either skilled in practical application or has theoretical knowledge, but not necessarily both. Alexander shares knowledge. Anyone who thinks creatively and conducts experiments can be innovative. Clark collaborates with others. If Jakari writes books, then he is either recognized or receives awards (but not both). If Alexander is innovative, then he collaborates with others and has theoretical knowledge.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Alexander is not dedicated to healing.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Alexander writes books" and "If someone writes books, then he is either recognized or receives awards (but not both)" plus "Alexander receives awards," it follows that Alexander is not recognized.
- Given "If Alexander makes discoveries and shares knowledge, then he will gain recognition" and "Alexander shares knowledge," Alexander not being recognized implies he does not make discoveries.
- From "If someone seeks medical breakthroughs and has curiosity, then they make discoveries," not making discoveries implies that Alexander does not have both curiosity and seeks medical breakthroughs simultaneously (at least one of them is false).
- There is no rule linking "dedicated to healing" to seeking medical breakthroughs or curiosity, and we only know "Alexander either studies plants or is dedicated to healing (or both)." Nothing forces "not dedicated to healing."

Therefore, whether Alexander is dedicated to healing cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
