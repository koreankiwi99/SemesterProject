==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Brock appreciates history, so he visits cemeteries and values sacrifices.
- Visiting cemeteries implies either paying respects or honoring heroes (but not both). 
- Brock shares personal stories and is in an exclusive-or with paying respects, so he does not pay respects. Therefore, from the cemetery rule, he honors heroes.
- Other deduced facts (e.g., serves his country, writes history books) do not define anything about “respecting tradition.”
- The predicate “respect tradition” does not appear in the premises, nor is it defined or linked to any given predicates (such as paying respects, honoring heroes, appreciating history, or valuing sacrifices). Therefore, we cannot determine its truth value from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:
