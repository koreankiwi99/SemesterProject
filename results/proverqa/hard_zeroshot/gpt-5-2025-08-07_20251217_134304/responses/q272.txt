Question ID: 272
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Amiyah does not pioneer medical breakthroughs. Amiyah does not make new discoveries. If Amiyah is an expert or makes new discoveries, then she gains recognition. If Amiyah has sapremia, then she can either receive innovative treatment or contribute to medical research, but not both. Amiyah does not gain recognition. Amiyah attends conferences. Amiyah teaches at a university. If Amiyah works in a lab, then she can either contribute to medical research or teach at a university, but not both. If someone publishes scientific papers and attends conferences, then they can become an expert. Amiyah does not have a rare condition. If Amiyah receives innovative treatment, then she either has a rare condition or pioneers medical breakthroughs (or both). Amiyah either publishes scientific papers or works in a lab, but not both. If Amiyah collects data or analyzes results, then she can publish scientific papers.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Amiyah has sapremia.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If she receives innovative treatment, then she either has a rare condition or pioneers breakthroughs,” together with “She does not have a rare condition” and “She does not pioneer breakthroughs,” it follows she does not receive innovative treatment.
- From “If expert or makes new discoveries, then gains recognition” and “She does not gain recognition,” we get she is not an expert and does not make new discoveries.
- Assume for contradiction that she has sapremia. Then by the sapremia XOR rule and not receiving treatment, she must contribute to medical research.
- She teaches at a university. If she worked in a lab, the lab XOR rule would forbid contributing and teaching together, so she does not work in a lab.
- The XOR between publishing and working in a lab then forces that she publishes.
- She attends conferences; publishing and attending imply she is an expert, contradicting that she is not an expert.
- Therefore, the assumption that she has sapremia is impossible.

ANSWER: False

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
