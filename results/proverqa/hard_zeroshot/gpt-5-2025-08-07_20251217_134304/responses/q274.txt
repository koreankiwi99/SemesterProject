Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Marilyn is a rodeo rider.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From living rurally and not enjoying hiking, and LR -> (OE XOR EH), Marilyn is an outdoor enthusiast (OE).
- From ¬inspiration and (LBE OR sustainability) -> inspiration, she does not value sustainability (and not LBE). With ¬SLC and (SLC XOR CSC) -> sustainability, this forces CSC to be false.
- With OE and CSC false, from OE -> (CSC OR EA), Marilyn is an environmental advocate (EA).
- From ¬strong-willed and (RF -> strong-willed), Marilyn is not a respected figure (¬RF).
- From (R XOR EA) -> RF and ¬RF, we get ¬(R XOR EA). With EA true, this implies R is also true.

Therefore Marilyn is a rodeo rider.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
