Question ID: 275
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If someone enjoys writing, then they express themselves creatively. If Maddison works in a library, then she either creates indexes or organizes collections, but not both. If someone keeps diaries and creates poetry, then they enjoy writing. Anyone who shares learning appreciates history or promotes education (or both). Maddison does not promote education. Anyone who collects rare texts either values knowledge or shares learning (or both). Maddison does not appreciate history. If Maddison has a good memory or is detail-oriented, then she can collect rare texts. If Maddison values knowledge, then she works in archives and organizes collections. If Maddison admires scholars, then she collects rare texts and treasures ancient wisdom. Maddison either works in archives or studies librarianship, but not both. If Maddison either translates texts or edits manuscripts (but not both), then she shares learning. Maddison either enjoys writing or loves books, but these two interests are mutually exclusive. Maddison admires scholars. Maddison does not express herself creatively.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Maddison can become a curator.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Maddison admires scholars,” she collects rare texts. 
- Collecting rare texts implies she either values knowledge or shares learning. Since she neither appreciates history nor promotes education, she cannot share learning, so she values knowledge.
- Valuing knowledge implies she works in archives and organizes collections.
- From “does not express herself creatively” and “enjoys writing → expresses creatively,” she does not enjoy writing. Given the mutual exclusivity with loving books, she loves books.

None of the premises mention curatorship or link any of these traits/roles to becoming a curator. Therefore, the truth of “Maddison can become a curator” cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain
