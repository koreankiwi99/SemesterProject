==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Since Egghead is a socialite and “if socialite then plans weddings xor hosts events,” and we’re told he plans weddings, he does not host events.
- From “hosts events or throws awesome parties,” not hosting events implies he throws awesome parties.
- Anyone who throws awesome parties has infectious energy or attracts big crowds; but he does not attract big crowds, so he has infectious energy.
- He has charisma xor infectious energy; since he has infectious energy, he does not have charisma.
- He has charisma or an outgoing personality; lacking charisma implies he has an outgoing personality.
- Outgoing xor introverted; since he is outgoing, he is not introverted.

Therefore, the statement “Egghead has an introverted personality” is false.

ANSWER: False
