Callie either inspires followers or remains anonymous, but not both. If Callie is either a creative writer or an inspiring speaker (but not both), then she is influential. Anyone who publishes best sellers or wins literary awards is highly acclaimed. Callie is an accomplished author. Anyone who crafts beautiful prose or speaks from the heart is influential. Callie publishes best sellers. If Callie motivates others, then she is either a charismatic leader or a social activist (but not both). Callie is an eloquent orator. If Callie is an eloquent orator, then she is either a visionary thinker or a strategic planner (but not both). If Callie is an accomplished author, then she is either highly acclaimed or respected, but not both. If Callie is an inspiring speaker, then she is either a charismatic leader or a visionary thinker (but not both). Callie is a strategic planner. Callie remains anonymous.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Callie is a creative writer.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Callie publishes best sellers, so she is highly acclaimed. From being an accomplished author, she is either highly acclaimed or respected, but not both. Hence respected is false.
- If someone is influential, then they are respected; thus Callie is not influential.
- Eloquent orator implies either visionary thinker or strategic planner (but not both). Given Callie is a strategic planner, she is not a visionary thinker.
- If Callie were an inspiring speaker, then she would be either a charismatic leader or a visionary thinker (but not both). Since she is not a visionary thinker, she would be a charismatic leader, which would imply she inspires followers. But Callie remains anonymous and cannot both inspire followers and remain anonymous. Therefore, Callie is not an inspiring speaker.
- If Callie is either a creative writer or an inspiring speaker (but not both), then she is influential. Since she is not influential, the XOR antecedent must be false. With inspiring speaker false, this forces creative writer to be false.

Conclusion: Callie is not a creative writer.
