If Damon is experienced, then he is either visionary or has original ideas, but not both. All gifted individuals are creative and value innovation. If Damon demonstrates skill, then he either receives recognition or is an emerging talent (or both). If Damon is either an emerging talent or a rising star (but not both), then he is a gifted individual. Damon does not make a lasting impact. Fiona does not make a lasting impact.

Question:

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If Damon either overcomes obstacles or faces strong competition (but not both), then he becomes successful” and given ¬successful(Damon) and ¬overcomes_obstacles(Damon), it follows that faces_strong_competition(Damon) would imply success, so ¬faces_strong_competition(Damon).
- From “Anyone who has original ideas either makes a lasting impact or inspires others” and given ¬lasting_impact(Damon) and ¬inspires(Damon), we get ¬original_ideas(Damon).
- From “All gifted individuals are creative” and given ¬creative(Damon), we infer ¬gifted(Damon).
- From “If Damon is either an emerging talent or a rising star (but not both), then he is a gifted individual,” and ¬gifted(Damon), we conclude it is not the case that exactly one of emerging_talent and rising_star holds; thus they are either both true or both false.
- Given “Damon is either an established professional or an emerging talent, but not both,” we have exactly one of established_professional and emerging_talent true.

Two consistent scenarios remain:
1) emerging_talent = true, rising_star = true, established_professional = false.
2) emerging_talent = false, rising_star = false, established_professional = true.

Both are consistent with all constraints. Therefore, whether Damon is an established professional cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
