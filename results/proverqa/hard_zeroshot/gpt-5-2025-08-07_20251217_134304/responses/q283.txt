Question ID: 283
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Crew does not know biology. If Crew either rescues amphibians or researches marine life (but not both), then he studies axolotls. If Crew loves aquatic life, then he will study axolotls. Crew does not have a passion for nature. If someone cares for animals and understands ecology, then they can advocate for conservation. Anyone who enjoys scuba diving and appreciates marine life will love aquatic life. For all humans, if they value wildlife and help endangered species, then they care for animals. Crew helps endangered species. If Crew studies axolotls, then he either establishes a sanctuary or advocates for their conservation, but not both. Crew knows biology or understands ecology. Crew values wildlife. Crew has a passion for nature or loves aquatic life.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Crew does not establish a sanctuary.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Crew does not have a passion for nature, and he either has a passion for nature or loves aquatic life. Therefore, he loves aquatic life.
- If he loves aquatic life, then he studies axolotls. So he studies axolotls.
- If he studies axolotls, then exactly one of the following is true: he establishes a sanctuary or he advocates for axolotls’ conservation (but not both).
- Crew values wildlife and helps endangered species, so he cares for animals. Also, he does not know biology but must either know biology or understand ecology, so he understands ecology. From caring for animals and understanding ecology, he can advocate for conservation in general. However, this does not entail that he specifically advocates for axolotls.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether the exclusive choice triggered by studying axolotls selects “establishes a sanctuary” or “advocates for their conservation.”

Conclusion: It is not determined whether Crew establishes a sanctuary.
