Context:
Byron does not have a shiny coat. If Muffin either loses weight or reduces her appetite (but not both), then she improves her appearance. If Muffin looks vibrant or seems playful, then she has a shiny coat. If Muffin either grooms herself or improves her appearance (but not both), then she looks vibrant. For all cats, if they stay hydrated and groom themselves, then they feel healthy. Any cat that plays outside or chases toys will get regular exercise. Holland follows a strict diet. Byron reduces her appetite. Muffin follows a strict diet. If Holland either loses weight or reduces her appetite (but not both), then she improves her appearance. Muffin reduces her appetite. If Byron looks vibrant or seems playful, then she has a shiny coat. For all cats, if a cat follows a strict diet and gets regular exercise, then it will regain its health. If Muffin either sheds her fur or brightens her eyes (but not both), then she improves her appearance. Muffin does not increase her energy. Muffin stays hydrated. Muffin does not have a shiny coat. If Muffin loses weight, then she either increases her energy or gets regular exercise (or both). Byron does not feel healthy. Every cat that stays active either looks vibrant or has good posture (or both). Muffin does not seem playful. Muffin does not feel healthy.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If Muffin looks vibrant or seems playful, then she has a shiny coat” and “Muffin does not have a shiny coat,” we get that Muffin is neither vibrant nor playful.
- From “Muffin stays hydrated” and “If a cat stays hydrated and grooms itself, then it feels healthy,” together with “Muffin does not feel healthy,” we infer Muffin does not groom herself.
- From “If Muffin either grooms herself or improves her appearance (but not both), then she looks vibrant” and Muffin not vibrant, we get that the XOR antecedent is false; since she does not groom, this implies she does not improve her appearance.
- From “If Muffin either loses weight or reduces her appetite (but not both), then she improves her appearance” and Muffin does not improve her appearance, the XOR antecedent is false. Given “Muffin reduces her appetite,” this forces “Muffin loses weight” to be true.
- From “If Muffin loses weight, then she either increases her energy or gets regular exercise” and “Muffin does not increase her energy,” we conclude Muffin gets regular exercise.
- From “If a cat follows a strict diet and gets regular exercise, then it will regain its health” and “Muffin follows a strict diet,” we conclude Muffin regains her health.
