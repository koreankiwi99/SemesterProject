==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Juliana either pursues excellence or embraces change, but not both" and "Juliana embraces change," Juliana does not pursue excellence.
- From "Juliana values quality or pursues excellence," Juliana must value quality.
- Therefore, by the rule, Juliana is an artisan and has attention to detail.
- As an artisan and given "Juliana supports local communities," the XOR rule implies she does not preserve cultural heritage.
- Another XOR rule then implies she creates unique textiles.
- No statement connects any of Juliana’s confirmed attributes to "learns traditional weaving," nor equates it with preserving cultural heritage.

Therefore, whether Juliana learns traditional weaving cannot be determined from the given information.
