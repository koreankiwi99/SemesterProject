Question ID: 287
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Andi either reads avidly or analyzes data (but not both), then she is a fast learner. Noel is intelligent or adventurous. Noel does not retain information. If Noel either reads avidly or analyzes data (but not both), then she is a fast learner. Noel is a polyglot. If someone significantly contributes to their field, then they are intelligent. Cielo does not read avidly. Everyone who is a fast learner either has a good memory or retains information (or both). If Noel is a polyglot, then she either has a good memory or speaks multiple languages, but not both. Noel either communicates effectively or is intelligent, but not both. Noel does not read avidly. If Noel conducts research, then she either uncovers secrets or has a good memory (or both). Cielo does not retain information. Evander is intelligent or adventurous. Noel either speaks multiple languages or communicates effectively, but not both. Noel analyzes data.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Noel is adventurous.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Noel analyzes data and does not read avidly, so the XOR condition holds, implying Noel is a fast learner.
- Fast learners have a good memory or retain information; Noel does not retain information, so Noel has a good memory.
- Being a polyglot implies exactly one of good memory or speaks multiple languages; since Noel has a good memory, she does not speak multiple languages.
- Exactly one of speaks multiple languages or communicates effectively holds; thus Noel communicates effectively.
- Exactly one of communicates effectively or is intelligent holds; since Noel communicates effectively, she is not intelligent.
- Noel is intelligent or adventurous (inclusive). With not intelligent, Noel must be adventurous.

ANSWER: True

Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
