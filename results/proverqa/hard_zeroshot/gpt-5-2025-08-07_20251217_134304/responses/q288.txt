Context:
Jasper is not a successful sailor. If Quincy respects the ocean, then he wins sailing competitions and has strong determination. Everyone who either studies tides or anticipates winds (but not both) respects the ocean. If Jasper respects the ocean, then he wins sailing competitions and has strong determination. If Jasper either sets priorities or overcomes obstacles (but not both), then he has strong determination. Quincy does not set goals. Paula does not read sea conditions. If Elodie knows weather patterns or masters navigation skills, then he can win sailing competitions. Jasper does not read sea conditions. Everyone who understands currents either plots their course or anticipates winds (or both). Paula understands currents. Elodie is not a successful sailor. Jasper does not plot his course. Jasper does not study tides. If Jasper studies charts, then he masters navigation skills. If Quincy either knows weather patterns or reads sea conditions (but not both), then he is a successful sailor. Jasper understands currents. All confident individuals who can win competitions also stay focused. If Jasper either knows weather patterns or reads sea conditions (but not both), then he is a successful sailor. Paula does not love challenges. Elodie does not study tides.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jasper has sailing experience and masters navigation skills.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Jasper understands currents and does not plot his course, so by the rule (understands currents -> plots course or anticipates winds), he anticipates winds.
- Jasper does not study tides. Given the XOR rule (studies tides XOR anticipates winds -> respects the ocean), Jasper respects the ocean.
- If Jasper respects the ocean, then he wins sailing competitions and has strong determination. So he wins competitions.
- The only rule linking Jasper to mastering navigation skills is: if Jasper studies charts, then he masters navigation skills. There is no information that Jasper studies charts, nor any other rule implying he masters navigation skills.
- There is no information at all about whether Jasper has sailing experience.

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Jasper has sailing experience or masters navigation skills.

ANSWER: Uncertain
