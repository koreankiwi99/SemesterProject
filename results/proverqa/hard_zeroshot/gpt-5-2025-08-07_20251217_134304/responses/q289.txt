Cynthia either works hard or is a manager. If Cynthia is influential, then she either builds trust or commands attention (but not both). Anyone who holds leadership positions and has vision can drive innovation. Cynthia builds trust.

If Cynthia has authority, then she either thinks carefully or trusts her instinct, but not both. Cynthia does not drive innovation. Cynthia has authority. Everyone who works hard either achieves success or earns respect (or both). Everyone considers options or thinks carefully. Cynthia does not achieve success. Cynthia is influential. Cynthia trusts her instinct. Cynthia solves problems or holds leadership positions.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cynthia protects her interests.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Vision and (Leadership ∧ Vision) ⇒ Innovation, and given ¬Innovation, infer ¬Leadership.
- Influential and (BuildsTrust XOR CommandsAttention), plus BuildsTrust, imply ¬CommandsAttention.
- (EarnsRespect XOR CommandsAttention) ⇒ Leadership. With ¬CommandsAttention, this reduces to EarnsRespect ⇒ Leadership. Given ¬Leadership, infer ¬EarnsRespect.
- WorksHard ⇒ (AchievesSuccess ∨ EarnsRespect). With ¬AchievesSuccess and ¬EarnsRespect, infer ¬WorksHard.
- Either WorksHard or Manager. With ¬WorksHard, infer Manager.
- Manager ⇒ (ActsOnImpulse XOR ThinksCarefully). Authority ⇒ (ThinksCarefully XOR TrustsInstinct), and TrustsInstinct is true, so ¬ThinksCarefully, hence ActsOnImpulse. Then (ActsOnImpulse XOR InformedDecisions) gives ¬InformedDecisions.
- From (ConsidersOptions ∨ ThinksCarefully) and ¬ThinksCarefully, infer ConsidersOptions. From (SolvesProblems ∨ Leadership) and ¬Leadership, infer SolvesProblems.

None of the premises mention or imply “protects her interests,” nor its negation. Therefore, the truth of that statement cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
