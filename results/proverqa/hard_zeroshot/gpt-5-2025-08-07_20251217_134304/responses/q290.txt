Context:
Anyone who doubts the existence of a higher power and rejects religious doctrine is likely to be atheistic. Everyone who finds inner peace either lives sincerely or acts with compassion (or both). If someone faces challenges, then they seek guidance and look for answers. Everyone is either spiritual or atheistic, but not both. If Walter reads scriptures, then he either attends church or prays regularly, but not both. Walter is spiritual or devout. Walter does not value morality. Walter prays regularly. If someone either values morality or has faith, then they lead a good life. Walter does not lead a good life. If Isabel either believes in a religion or seeks guidance, then he finds inner peace. If Walter wears a symbol and feels protected, then he has faith. Walter does not act with compassion. If Walter either reads scriptures or practices meditation (but not both), then he has faith. Walter attends church. Walter does not live sincerely. If Walter believes in a religion, then he is either someone who practices meditation or someone who is atheistic, but not both. If Walter follows traditions, then he either listens to homilies or reads scriptures (but not both). Walter faces challenges. If Walter either believes in a religion or seeks guidance, then he finds inner peace.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Walter is devout.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Walter prays regularly” and “Walter attends church,” the condition “If Walter reads scriptures, then (attends church XOR prays regularly)” would be violated if he read scriptures; thus Not(reads scriptures).
- From “If (reads scriptures XOR practices meditation) then has faith” and Not(has faith) (derived below), we get Not(practices meditation).
- From “If (values morality or has faith) then lead a good life” and “Walter does not lead a good life,” plus “Walter does not value morality,” we conclude Not(has faith).
- From “Everyone who finds inner peace either lives sincerely or acts with compassion” and given “Walter does not live sincerely” and “Walter does not act with compassion,” we infer Not(inner peace).
- From “If (believes in a religion or seeks guidance) then inner peace” and Not(inner peace), we get Not(believes in a religion) and Not(seeks guidance). But “Walter faces challenges” implies he seeks guidance, so the premises are inconsistent on that point.

Nothing in the premises links “devout” to other properties besides “Walter is spiritual or devout.” We cannot establish Not(spiritual) (we cannot conclude he is atheistic), nor can we establish Not(devout). Therefore, whether Walter is devout cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
