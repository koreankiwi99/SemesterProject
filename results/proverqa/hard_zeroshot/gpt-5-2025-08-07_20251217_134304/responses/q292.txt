Question ID: 292
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Aliyah trusts her instinct. Aliyah has strong intuition. Anyone who speaks confidently or writes clearly can communicate complex ideas. If Aliyah meets deadlines, then she either collaborates well or works independently, but not both. If Aliyah collaborates well, then she has strong intuition and can communicate complex ideas. Aliyah does not work independently. Aliyah either thinks logically or trusts her instinct, but not both. Aliyah does not evaluate data effectively. If Aliyah makes accurate conclusions, then she either thinks logically or evaluates data effectively (but not both). If someone is accurate, then they are either precise in measurements or reliable in findings (or both). For Aliyah, being able to communicate complex ideas and being reliable in findings are mutually exclusive. Everyone who approaches problems systematically either thinks logically or considers multiple perspectives (or both). Aliyah does not have attention to detail. Aliyah is accurate or innovative. Aliyah meets deadlines. If Aliyah is precise in measurements, then she either has attention to detail or makes accurate conclusions (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Aliyah is not innovative.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Meets deadlines and not working independently imply she collaborates well (CW).
- Collaborates well implies she can communicate complex ideas (CC) and has strong intuition.
- CC and "CC and reliable (Rel) are mutually exclusive" give Rel is false.
- Trusts her instinct (TI) and "thinks logically (TL) XOR trusts instinct" give TL is false.
- Not evaluating data effectively (EDE) is given; thus TL XOR EDE is false.
- If she makes accurate conclusions (MAC), then TL XOR EDE must hold; since it’s false, MAC is false.
- Attention to detail (ATD) is false, so ATD XOR MAC is false; hence, from "Precise (Prec) -> ATD XOR MAC," we get not Prec.
- From "Accurate (Acc) -> (Prec or Rel)" and both Prec and Rel are false, we get not Acc.
- From "Acc or Innovative (Innov)" and not Acc, it follows that Innov is true.

Therefore, the statement "Aliyah is not innovative" is false.

ANSWER: False
