Saeedi is trained. For every horse, it is either domesticated or wild, but not both. If Saeedi either obeys commands or performs tricks (but not both), then he is domesticated.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Saeedi is a wild horse.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Saeedi has strength and is not fast, so by the strength rule he must roam free (and not be fast).
- Saeedi either roams free or follows training, but not both; since he roams free, he does not follow training.
- Saeedi either follows training or performs tricks; since he does not follow training, he performs tricks.
- Saeedi participates in parades and does not execute maneuvers; thus he responds to cues.
- Saeedi is trained, and trained implies obeys commands or responds to cues (but not both); since he responds to cues, he does not obey commands.
- If Saeedi obeys commands or performs tricks (but not both), then he is domesticated; with tricks true and obey false, this condition holds, so Saeedi is domesticated.
- Every horse is either domesticated or wild, but not both; hence Saeedi is not wild.

ANSWER: False

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
