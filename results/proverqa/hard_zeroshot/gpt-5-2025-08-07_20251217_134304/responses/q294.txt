Context:
If Rosalina either stands up for others or faces her fears head-on (but not both), then she is courageous. Anyone who provides medical aid or puts others first protects the vulnerable. If Rosalina is courageous, then she can either earn the respect of others or inspire leadership in others, but not both. Rosalina either protects the vulnerable or empowers others, but not necessarily both. Rosalina does not save lives. Everyone who dedicates their life to helping others either brings hope or empowers others (or both). Everyone who works selflessly either brings people together or protects the vulnerable (or both). Rosalina does not provide medical aid. Everyone who risks their life is either courageous or serves others (or both). Keaton saves lives or risks her life (or both). Rosalina saves lives or risks her life (or both). Keaton either protects the vulnerable or empowers others, but not necessarily both. Rosalina puts others first. Rosalina does not serve others. If someone empowers others, they may not necessarily inspire leadership in others, and if someone inspires leadership in others, they may not necessarily empower others.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rosalina does not earn the respect of others.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Rosalina saves lives or risks her life" and "Rosalina does not save lives," we infer Rosalina risks her life.
- From "Everyone who risks their life is either courageous or serves others (or both)" and "Rosalina does not serve others," we conclude Rosalina is courageous.
- Given "If Rosalina is courageous, then she can either earn the respect of others or inspire leadership in others, but not both," we deduce exactly one of the two (earn respect or inspire leadership) holds, but we cannot tell which.
- While "Rosalina puts others first" implies she protects the vulnerable, none of the provided rules determine whether she earns respect versus inspires leadership.

Therefore, whether Rosalina earns the respect of others is not determined by the information.

ANSWER: Uncertain
