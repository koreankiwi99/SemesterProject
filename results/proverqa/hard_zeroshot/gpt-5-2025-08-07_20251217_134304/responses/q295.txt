Question ID: 295
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Devin does not share knowledge. Andy does not foster collaboration. Andy values efficiency or has a strong work ethic. If Andy has a strong work ethic, then he is either dedicated to innovation or leads project teams (but not both). Gunnar speaks at conferences. If Andy is an expert in his field, then he is either mentoring others or pioneering new technology, but not both. Andy does not value efficiency. Andy guides newcomers. Andy is either an expert in his field or fosters collaboration, but not both. If someone is passionate about data, then they drive progress and are dedicated to innovation. If Andy either shares knowledge or guides newcomers (but not both), then he mentors others. If Devin has a strong work ethic, then he is either dedicated to innovation or leads project teams (but not both). Andy speaks at conferences. Andy either pursues an academic degree or has a strong work ethic. Andy does not share knowledge. Gunnar guides newcomers. Gunnar does not value efficiency. If Andy speaks at conferences, then he leads project teams. If Martin either shares knowledge or guides newcomers (but not both), then he mentors others. If Devin is an expert in his field, then he is either mentoring others or pioneering new technology, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Andy does not earn global recognition.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Andy values efficiency or has a strong work ethic" and "Andy does not value efficiency," deduce Andy has a strong work ethic.
- From "If Andy speaks at conferences, then he leads project teams" and "Andy speaks at conferences," deduce Andy leads project teams. By the XOR with strong work ethic, he is not dedicated to innovation.
- From "Andy is either an expert in his field or fosters collaboration, but not both" and "Andy does not foster collaboration," deduce Andy is an expert.
- From "If expert, then either mentors others or pioneers new technology (but not both)" and "Andy does not share knowledge" plus "Andy guides newcomers" and the XOR-to-mentoring rule, deduce Andy mentors others, hence not pioneering new technology.

Nowhere in the premises is "earning global recognition" mentioned or linked to any of Andy’s properties. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Andy does or does not earn global recognition.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
