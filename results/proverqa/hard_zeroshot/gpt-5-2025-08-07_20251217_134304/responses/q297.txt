Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Chosen is fearless.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Chosen avoids hunters and finds water. From “If Chosen thrives in Madagascar, then he can either find water or avoid hunters, but not both,” having both true implies Chosen does not thrive in Madagascar.
- With “All lemurs that eat berries and climb trees thrive in Madagascar” and Chosen climbs trees, not thriving implies he does not eat berries. Then from “If Chosen explores the rainforest, then he eats berries...,” not eating berries implies he does not explore the rainforest.
- From “If a lemur plays with others, then it feels happiness” and Chosen does not feel happiness, Chosen does not play with others. Given “Chosen either plays with others or leads the group,” he must lead. Also, outsmarting predators implies he has charisma. Having both leader and charisma does not force any conclusion about fearlessness.

No premise links Chosen to being fearless, and nothing deduces its negation. Therefore, whether Chosen is fearless cannot be determined.
