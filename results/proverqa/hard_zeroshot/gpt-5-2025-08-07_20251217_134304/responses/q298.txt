Question ID: 298
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Muppet does not become more efficient. All robots that acquire new skills learn from experience and improve their performance. If Muppet either executes predefined programs or follows scheduled routines (but not both), then it receives remote commands. Muppet improves its performance. Any robot that can process information is able to analyze data. If a robot learns from experience and achieves its mission objectives, then it becomes more efficient. Muppet does not operate offline. Muppet either performs tasks autonomously or has advanced sensors. For all robots, if a robot has advanced sensors and has deep learning capabilities, then it can make informed decisions. Muppet can process information. Muppet either receives remote commands or performs tasks autonomously, but not both. If Muppet makes precise calculations, then it will achieve its mission objectives. Muppet either receives remote commands or operates offline, but not both. Muppet acquires new skills. Every robot that can analyze data either has deep learning capabilities or can make precise calculations.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Muppet can make informed decisions.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Muppet does not operate offline, and “receives remote commands XOR operates offline” implies Muppet receives remote commands.
- Then, from “receives remote commands XOR performs tasks autonomously,” Muppet is not autonomous.
- From “performs tasks autonomously OR has advanced sensors,” Muppet has advanced sensors.
- Muppet can process information, so it can analyze data.
- From “analyze data → (deep learning OR precise calculations).”
- Muppet acquires new skills, so it learns from experience.
- If Muppet made precise calculations, then it would achieve its mission objectives, and with learning from experience it would become more efficient—contradicting “Muppet does not become more efficient.” Therefore, Muppet does not make precise calculations.
- Hence, Muppet has deep learning.
- With advanced sensors and deep learning, Muppet can make informed decisions.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
