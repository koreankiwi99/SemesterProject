Question ID: 300
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Lakelynn does not regain confidence. Steven does not practice mindfulness. Steven does not seek medical attention. Orion is physically inactive. If Orion's patients feel better, then they regain confidence. If Steven's patients feel better, then they regain confidence. If Steven's patients experience symptoms, then they either find a support network or overcome depression (or both). Brayan does not lead a balanced life. Steven's patients manage stress or overcome depression. If Lakelynn's patients get medical treatment and follow their prescription, then they can overcome depression. Steven does not regain confidence. Steven either has a debilitating condition or leads a healthy lifestyle, but not both. Lakelynn does not seek medical attention. If someone stays positive, then they can improve their mental health. Steven either leads a healthy lifestyle or is physically inactive, but not both. Steven does not lead a balanced life. Lakelynn's patients manage stress or overcome depression. If Steven either manages stress or practices mindfulness (but not both), then he leads a balanced life. Steven is physically inactive. For anyone who has a support system and engages in hobbies, they can manage stress. Everyone who has a debilitating condition either seeks medical attention or takes medicine (or both). For anyone who eats nutritious food and exercises regularly, they can lead a healthy lifestyle. If someone takes medicine and improves their mental health, then they feel better.

Question:

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

Model Response:
==================================================
We need to determine whether the premises entail: For Steven's patients, if they get medical treatment, then they can improve their mental health.

Relevant facts:
- For Steven's patients: If they feel better, then they regain confidence; if they experience symptoms, then they either find a support network or overcome depression; and unconditionally, Steven's patients manage stress or overcome depression.
- For Lakelynn's patients: getting medical treatment plus following their prescription implies they can overcome depression.
- General rules: If someone stays positive, they can improve their mental health. If someone takes medicine and improves their mental health, they feel better. Support system + hobbies -> manage stress.

There is no rule linking “getting medical treatment” to “improving mental health” for Steven’s patients. The only treatment-to-outcome rule is for Lakelynn’s patients (and it yields overcoming depression, not directly improving mental health). Also, “manage stress or overcome depression” does not, under the given rules, imply improving mental health. No rule connects “feel better” or “regain confidence” back to improving mental health, and nothing ties “medical treatment” to “takes medicine” or to “stays positive.”

Thus, the statement is not entailed by the premises, nor is its negation entailed. So its truth value is undetermined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
