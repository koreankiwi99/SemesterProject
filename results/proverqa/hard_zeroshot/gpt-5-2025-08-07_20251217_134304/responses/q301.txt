Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Hamza does not hold absolute power.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Hamza believes in authority and does not prioritize discipline. By the XOR rule, he has strict views.
- Hamza prefers structure, so he values order. Values order + strict views implies he imposes harsh laws.
- Hamza has big ideas and thinks critically, and he learns quickly and adapts; thus he sets high goals and works strategically, making him ambitious. Ambitious implies he seeks control, which (for Hamza) leads to suppressing individual freedoms and imposing harsh laws.

We can conclude Hamza suppresses individual freedoms and imposes harsh laws. However, there is no rule linking these behaviors to holding absolute power for Hamza. The only absolute power rule concerns Kash specifically. Therefore, whether Hamza holds absolute power is not determined.
