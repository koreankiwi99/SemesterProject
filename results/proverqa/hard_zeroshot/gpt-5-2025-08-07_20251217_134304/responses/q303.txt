Question ID: 303
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Noelle does not become an expert. Anyone who has curiosity and collects samples can conduct botanical research. Noelle does not document her findings. If Noelle does not have a green thumb or receives training, then she can tend to plants. If Noelle explores nature, then she either documents her findings or collects samples (or both). For every human, either they have a green thumb or they do not have a green thumb, but not both. If someone tends to plants and cultivates rare species, then they can become an expert. Noelle examines fungi. Noelle has curiosity. Noelle explores nature. Noelle either examines fungi or studies common plants, but not both. If Noelle conducts botanical research, then she either cultivates rare species or studies common plants, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Noelle does not have a green thumb.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From explores nature and not documenting: explores -> (documents or collects). Given not documents, so Noelle collects samples.
- Curiosity and collecting -> conducts botanical research. So she conducts botanical research.
- She examines fungi, and (examines fungi XOR studies common plants); therefore she does not study common plants.
- Conducts research -> (cultivates rare species XOR studies common plants). Since she does not study common plants, she cultivates rare species.
- If tends plants and cultivates rare species -> becomes an expert. Given she does not become an expert, and she does cultivate rare species, she must not tend plants.
- If not green thumb or trained -> tends plants. Since she does not tend plants, it is not the case that (not green thumb or trained); hence she has a green thumb (and is not trained).

Therefore, the statement “Noelle does not have a green thumb” is false.

ANSWER: False

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
