Question ID: 304
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If someone avoids publicity and keeps a low profile, then they remain unnoticed. Anders publishes research. If someone either collects plant samples or studies flora (but not both), then they are passionate about botany. Anders does not earn accolades. Anders does not explore nature. If Anders is influential, then he either builds a network or gains recognition (but not both). Anders either remains unnoticed or earns accolades, but not both. Anders does not pursue artistic interests. Anders either remains unnoticed or gains recognition, but not both. If Anders is passionate about botany, then he explores nature and contributes to science. If Anders either makes notable discoveries or publishes research (but not both), then he gains recognition. Anders either pursues artistic interests or contributes to science, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Anders is meticulous in his research.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Anders does not earn accolades and XOR(Remains unnoticed, Earns accolades), Anders remains unnoticed.
- From XOR(Remains unnoticed, Gains recognition) and remains unnoticed, Anders does not gain recognition.
- From Anders does not pursue artistic interests and XOR(Pursues artistic interests, Contributes to science), Anders contributes to science.
- From If passionate about botany then explores nature and contributes to science, and Anders does not explore nature, Anders is not passionate about botany.
- From Anders publishes research and If XOR(Makes notable discoveries, Publishes research) then gains recognition; since he does not gain recognition, the XOR antecedent must be false. With Publishes research true, this implies he also makes notable discoveries.

None of the premises mention or entail anything about being meticulous in his research, nor do they negate it. Therefore, the truth of the statement cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
