Question ID: 305
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Arlo understands ecosystems. Arlo appreciates nature. Diana conducts outdoor experiments. If Arlo is passionate about plants, then he is dedicated to research and mentors students. Francis studies genetics. Arlo studies genetics. If a botanist appreciates nature and understands ecosystems, then they can nurture gardens. If Rowen nurtures gardens, then he is passionate about plants and collaborates with experts. Francis understands ecosystems. If Diana loves the outdoors, then he experiments with new techniques and collaborates with experts. If a botanist studies genetics and collects field data, then they can publish groundbreaking work. If Rowen is passionate about plants, then he is dedicated to research and mentors students. Anyone who conducts outdoor experiments will collect field data. If Arlo owns an orchard, then he values biodiversity and collaborates with experts. Rowen does not love the outdoors. If Arlo nurtures gardens, then he is passionate about plants and collaborates with experts. Arlo conducts outdoor experiments.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Arlo contributes to conservation.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From the context, we can derive for Arlo: understands ecosystems, appreciates nature, studies genetics, conducts outdoor experiments → collects field data.
- We cannot derive that Arlo is a botanist (needed for rules that yield “can nurture gardens” or “can publish groundbreaking work”).
- We also cannot derive that Arlo nurtures gardens, is passionate about plants, or collaborates with experts unless additional conditions are met (e.g., Arlo nurtures gardens or owns an orchard), which are not established.
- No rule links any of Arlo’s established traits (understands ecosystems, appreciates nature, studies genetics, collects field data) to “contributes to conservation,” and that predicate never appears in the premises.

Therefore, the statement “Arlo contributes to conservation” is not entailed nor contradicted by the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
