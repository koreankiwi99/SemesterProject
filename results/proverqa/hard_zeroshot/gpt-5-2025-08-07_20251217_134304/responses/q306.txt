Context:
If Treasure is disciplined, then she is either enduring or has stamina, but not both. Treasure has light bones. Treasure has muscle mass. If Byron has endurance or responds to training, then she is strong-willed. Treasure has stamina. If Matteo is disciplined, then she is either enduring or has stamina, but not both. Matteo is loyal. For all horses, if they are agile, then they are athletic and have good reflexes. Treasure is either prone to nervousness or responds well to training, but not both. Treasure is prone to nervousness. All athletic horses are fast and strong-willed. Any horse that is built for speed or highly trained is athletic. If Treasure has muscle mass or has light bones, then she is built for speed. Byron is disciplined. Any horse that handles pressure has endurance or remains calm (or both). Treasure is disciplined.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Treasure is valued.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From Treasure has muscle mass or light bones -> built for speed. Treasure has both, so she is built for speed.
- Built for speed -> athletic. So Treasure is athletic.
- Athletic -> fast and strong-willed. So Treasure is fast and strong-willed.
- Treasure is disciplined and the rule says disciplined -> exactly one of enduring or stamina. Given Treasure has stamina, she is not enduring.
- Treasure is prone to nervousness; by the exclusive-or, she does not respond well to training.

None of the given rules connects any of these properties to being valued. There is no premise defining when a horse is valued, so we cannot determine whether Treasure is valued.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:

Ground Truth: Uncertain
