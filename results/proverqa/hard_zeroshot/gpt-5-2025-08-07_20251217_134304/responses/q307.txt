Question ID: 307
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Any being that experiments with DNA or uses unstable compounds can have genetic mutations. Sevyn analyzes data. Sevyn explores planetary environments. Any being that is radiation sensitive or undergoes cell division can have genetic mutations. If Sevyn works in a lab or analyzes data, then she studies genetics. Sevyn either studies genetics or is exposed to a mutagenic serum, but not both. Jimena explores planetary environments. If Sevyn is exposed to a mutagenic serum or has genetic mutations, then she develops extraordinary abilities. If Lauryn works in a lab or analyzes data, then she studies genetics. Malakai analyzes data. Lauryn either studies genetics or is exposed to a mutagenic serum, but not both. If Sevyn craves knowledge, then she seeks new discoveries and conducts field research. A being either conducts field research or experiments with DNA, but these two activities are not necessarily related. Sevyn either explores planetary environments or conducts field research, but these two activities are not necessarily related.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sevyn does not develop extraordinary abilities.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Sevyn analyzes data, so by (works in a lab OR analyzes data) -> studies genetics, Sevyn studies genetics.
- Given the XOR: studies genetics or exposed to mutagenic serum (but not both), Sevyn is not exposed to a mutagenic serum.
- Extraordinary abilities follow if (exposed to mutagenic serum OR has genetic mutations). Since serum is false, this depends on whether Sevyn has genetic mutations.
- Genetic mutations would follow if she experiments with DNA or uses unstable compounds, or if she is radiation sensitive or undergoes cell division. None of these are established.
- Although every being either conducts field research or experiments with DNA, we cannot conclude Sevyn experiments with DNA (she might conduct field research instead). Her exploring planetary environments doesn’t resolve this.
- Therefore, whether Sevyn develops extraordinary abilities remains undetermined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
