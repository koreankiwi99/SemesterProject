==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From DW(L) and VP(L) both true, the condition SR(L) -> (DW ⊕ VP) forces ¬SR(L) (contrapositive).
- Given SR(L) ⊕ EF(L), ¬SR(L) implies EF(L).
- EF(L) implies WBS(L).
- We also have ¬INF(L).
- Since (TW(L) ∧ WBS(L)) -> INF(L), with WBS(L) true and ¬INF(L), it follows that ¬TW(L).

ANSWER: True

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
