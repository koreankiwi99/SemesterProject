Context:
For any mythical creature that roams dreamscapes and is omnipotent, they will inspire awe. If Elaine sees beyond the surface or listens deeply, then he can hold wisdom. If Elaine embodies balance, then he either holds wisdom or masters the cosmos, but not both. If Dakari possesses magic, then he can weave illusions. If Dakari understands nature and controls elements, then he masters the cosmos. If Dakari sees beyond the surface or listens deeply, then he can hold wisdom. Dakari does not inspire awe. Dakari sees beyond the surface. Dakari embodies balance. If Dakari shapeshifts his form, then he either navigates realms or controls elements. Dakari understands nature. If Dakari possesses intuition, then he either holds wisdom or speaks the truth, but not both. Every mythical creature has powers or possesses magic. If Dakari embodies balance, then he either holds wisdom or masters the cosmos, but not both. Dakari roams dreamscapes. If Dakari either controls elements or has powers (but not both), then he is omnipotent.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dakari can weave illusions.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We need Dakari to possess magic to conclude he can weave illusions.

- From Dakari sees beyond the surface and the rule, Dakari holds wisdom.
- From Dakari embodies balance and the XOR rule, Dakari does not master the cosmos.
- From understanding nature and the rule (understands nature and controls elements -> masters the cosmos), and since he does not master the cosmos, Dakari does not control elements.

The only rule that leads to “can weave illusions” is: If Dakari possesses magic, then he can weave illusions. We have no direct statement that Dakari possesses magic. The only route to infer magic is via “Every mythical creature has powers or possesses magic,” but we are never told that Dakari is a mythical creature. Without that, we cannot deduce that he possesses magic.

Therefore, whether Dakari can weave illusions is not determined by the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
