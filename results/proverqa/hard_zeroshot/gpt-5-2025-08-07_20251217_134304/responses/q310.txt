- As a skilled chef, she must either host classes or write cookbooks (but not both). She writes cookbooks, so she does not host classes.
- Melissa either hosts classes or becomes a culinary influencer (but not both). Since she does not host classes, she is a culinary influencer.
- Melissa experiments with spice combinations and does not create unique recipes, satisfying the XOR condition that implies she understands flavor profiles.
- As a foodie, she must either master cooking skills or understand flavor profiles (but not both). Since she understands flavor profiles, she does not master cooking skills.
