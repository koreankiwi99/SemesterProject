Question ID: 311
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Shmoops senses energy or understands emotions, then it can build trust. If Shmoops either respects boundaries or has empathy (but not both), then it values harmony. Shmoops can understand emotions if Shmoops has compassion. Any being that prioritizes coexistence respects boundaries. If Shmoops either detects vibrations or senses energy (but not both), then it is intuitive. Shmoops does not detect vibrations. If Shmoops either reads body language or shares thoughts (but not both), then it is able to connect with others. Shmoops is not intuitive. If Shmoops has empathy, then it either builds trust or can read minds, but not both. Shmoops connects with others or understands emotions. Shmoops can read minds. Shmoops does not value harmony. If Shmoops forms a telepathic bond, then it shares knowledge. Shmoops prioritizes coexistence. If Shmoops connects with others, then it will form a telepathic bond.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Shmoops shares knowledge.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From prioritizes coexistence, we get respects boundaries (PC -> RB; PC true ⇒ RB true).
- If XOR(RB, E) then values harmony, but harmony is false; thus XOR(RB, E) is false. With RB true, E must be true.
- With empathy true, XOR(builds trust, read minds) holds. Since read minds is true, builds trust must be false.
- If (senses energy OR understands emotions) then builds trust. Since builds trust is false, neither senses energy nor understands emotions holds (by contrapositive).
- We have connects with others OR understands emotions; with understands emotions false, connects with others is true.
- If connects with others then forms a telepathic bond; hence telepathic bond is true.
- If forms a telepathic bond then shares knowledge; therefore shares knowledge is true.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
