==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Rocco does not seek personal gain" and "Rocco either seeks personal gain or identifies injustice, but not both," Rocco identifies injustice.
- Rocco advocates for change; thus, by "if someone identifies injustice and advocates for change, then they can fight for social justice," Rocco fights for social justice.
- From "if someone fights for social justice, then they either raise awareness or mobilize support (or both)," we get: Rocco raises awareness or mobilizes support.
- From philanthropist rules and "Rocco supports local initiatives," Rocco does not develop community programs. Given "Rocco develops community programs or builds strategic partnerships," he builds strategic partnerships. The statement "either he builds strategic partnerships or he mobilizes support, but not necessarily both" does not exclude mobilizes support.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether he raises awareness; it could be true or false depending on mobilizes support.
