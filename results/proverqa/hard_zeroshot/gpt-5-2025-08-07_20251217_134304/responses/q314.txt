==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Jaziel learns quickly, so by “anyone who learns quickly or adapts easily has versatile skills,” Jaziel has versatile skills.
- Jaziel also has specialized knowledge. If he had wide interests, then he would have exactly one of specialized knowledge or versatile skills, which contradicts having both; hence Jaziel does not have wide interests.
- From “Jaziel is either an avid reader or has wide interests, but not both,” and not wide interests, Jaziel is an avid reader.
- From “Jaziel is either an inspiring teacher or an avid reader, but not both,” and avid reader, Jaziel is not an inspiring teacher.
- Jaziel is not someone who makes an impact. Since “everyone who is either influential or achieves success makes an impact,” it follows that Jaziel is not influential and does not achieve success.
- From “if a person is either a prodigious writer or an inspiring teacher (but not both), then they are influential,” and Jaziel is not an inspiring teacher, if Jaziel were a prodigious writer he would be influential. But he is not influential. Therefore, Jaziel is not a prodigious writer.
