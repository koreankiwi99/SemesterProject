Question ID: 315
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Emmy does not inspire others. If Emmy is dedicated to archaeology, then she can either make groundbreaking discoveries or become a leading expert, but not both. If Emmy advances historical knowledge, then she will gain recognition. Emmy either pursues alternate careers or is dedicated to archaeology, but not both. If Emmy either makes groundbreaking discoveries or uncovers lost artifacts (but not both), then she advances historical knowledge. Anyone who uncovers lost artifacts or deciphers ancient texts can shed new light on history. Emmy does not gain recognition. If Emmy sheds new light on history, then she will inspire others. Emmy does not pursue alternate careers.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Emmy does not become a leading expert.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Emmy does not pursue alternate careers” and “Emmy either pursues alternate careers or is dedicated to archaeology, but not both,” we get D (dedicated to archaeology).
- From D and “If dedicated, then either G or L, but not both,” we get G XOR L.
- From “Emmy does not gain recognition” and “If A then R,” we get ¬A.
- From “Emmy does not inspire others” and “If S then I,” we get ¬S.
- From ¬S and “If U or T then S,” we get ¬U and ¬T.
- From ¬A and “If (G XOR U) then A,” we get ¬(G XOR U). With U false, this implies ¬G.
- From G XOR L and ¬G, we conclude L is true.

Therefore, the claim “Emmy does not become a leading expert” is false.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
