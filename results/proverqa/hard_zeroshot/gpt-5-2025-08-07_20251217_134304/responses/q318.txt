Question ID: 318
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If a botanist examines plant structures and collects botanical samples, then they explore botany. Every botanist either publishes scientific papers or discovers new species, but not necessarily both. Julio either identifies plant habitats or analyzes botanical data, but not necessarily both. Every botanist who explores botany either discovers new species or earns academic recognition (or both). Julio publishes scientific papers. If Julio studies plant classification, then he travels to rainforests and specializes in Commelinidae. Julio does not earn academic recognition. For every botanist, either they are specialized in Commelinidae or they are not specialized in Commelinidae, but not both. Every botanist either researches plant species or analyzes botanical data. Julio identifies plant habitats. Every botanist either explores botany or studies plant classification.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Julio is not specialized in Commelinidae.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We know:
- If Julio studies plant classification, then he is specialized in Commelinidae.
- We are not told Julio studies plant classification.
- The statements restricting choices (explore botany vs. study classification; specialized vs. not specialized) apply only to botanists. We are not told Julio is a botanist.
- Even if Julio were a botanist, he could be in the “explores botany” branch (consistent with not earning recognition by discovering new species), which gives no information about specialization.
- No premise implies that Julio is not specialized.

Thus, neither “Julio is specialized” nor “Julio is not specialized” can be deduced.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
