Gracelyn struggles to create. Gracelyn explores options. Gracelyn is passionate. Anyone who discovers a new medium or finds their flow can feel fulfilled.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Gracelyn has not found her artistic voice.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Gracelyn is passionate and not inspired. From “If passionate, then inspired XOR creative,” she must be creative.
- From “If creative, then found artistic voice XOR disillusioned,” exactly one of FoundVoice or Disillusioned is true.
- Gracelyn struggles to create. From “If struggles, then found fulfillment XOR disillusioned,” exactly one of FoundFulfillment or Disillusioned is true.
- Gracelyn is motivated and does not have a clear mind. From “If motivated, then finds flow XOR clear mind,” she finds her flow.
- From “finds their flow -> can feel fulfilled,” she can feel fulfilled. This does not entail “found fulfillment.”
- The universal states exactly one of FoundVoice or NotFoundVoice holds. Combined with the above, NotFoundVoice is equivalent to Disillusioned. But we cannot determine whether Disillusioned is true or false, since both options (FoundVoice true/Disillusioned false, or FoundVoice false/Disillusioned true) remain consistent with all premises.

Therefore, whether Gracelyn has not found her artistic voice cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
