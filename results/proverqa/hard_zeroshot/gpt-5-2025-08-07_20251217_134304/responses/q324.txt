Question ID: 324
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Leilani examines mineral formations. For any mineralogist, they either examine mineral formations or study crystal structures, but it's possible to do both. Any mineralogist who works hard or sets goals is diligent. Every mineralogist who draws accurate conclusions either studies crystal structures or contributes to technology advancements (or both). Leilani either publishes research or focuses on theoretical work, but not both. If Leilani is either diligent or innovative (but not both), then she is distinguished. If Leilani is an experienced mineralogist, then she either evaluates results or draws accurate conclusions, but not both. Leilani is innovative. Leilani focuses on theoretical work. All meticulous mineralogists analyze samples and draw accurate conclusions. Leilani does not contribute to technology advancements. All diligent mineralogists are meticulous and publish research.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Leilani is not distinguished.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Leilani focuses on theoretical work” and “Leilani either publishes research or focuses on theoretical work, but not both,” we get: not Publishes.
- If Leilani were a mineralogist and diligent, then by “All diligent mineralogists are meticulous and publish research” she would publish, contradicting not Publishes. So if she is a mineralogist, then she is not diligent.
- Given “Leilani is innovative,” the condition “If Leilani is either diligent or innovative (but not both), then she is distinguished” reduces to: if not diligent then distinguished. Thus, if she is a mineralogist, she is distinguished, making “not distinguished” false in that case.
- However, it is never stated that Leilani is a mineralogist. If she is not a mineralogist, none of the “diligent mineralogists” implications apply. She could be diligent and innovative (both), making the exclusive antecedent false and leaving “distinguished” unconstrained; in particular, she could be not distinguished.

Since whether she is a mineralogist is not entailed, the truth of “Leilani is not distinguished” cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
