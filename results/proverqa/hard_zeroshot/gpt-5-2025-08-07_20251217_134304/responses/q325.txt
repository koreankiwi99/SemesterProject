Gustavo either seeks power or speaks truth, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Gustavo is not an activist.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Gustavo stands up for his rights” and “Gustavo does not raise awareness,” we get challenges authority (since standing up implies challenges authority or raises awareness; with no awareness, it must be challenges authority).
- Challenges authority together with “does not inspire change” implies he empowers others.
- With empowers others true and “does not mobilize crowds,” the XOR condition for community organizer is satisfied, so he is a community organizer.
- “Does not seek power” and “either seeks power or speaks truth, but not both” implies he speaks truth to power.
- Speaking truth to power implies he is a social advocate.
- If he is a community organizer, then exactly one of social advocate or leader holds; since he is a social advocate, he is not a leader.
- From “leader or activist,” and not a leader, it follows he is an activist.

Therefore, “Gustavo is not an activist” is false.

ANSWER: False
