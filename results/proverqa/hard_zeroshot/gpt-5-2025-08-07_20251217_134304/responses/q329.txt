Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If King Cruz is a just ruler, then he either brings prosperity or forges unity (or both).

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- King Cruz seeks counsel. By the rule “Everyone who seeks counsel either evaluates options or possesses good judgment,” and since King Cruz does not evaluate options, it follows that he possesses good judgment.
- Anyone with good judgment makes wise decisions, so King Cruz makes wise decisions.
- King Cruz has leadership skills, and the rule says with leadership skills he either makes wise decisions or shows empathy, but not both. Since he makes wise decisions, he does not show empathy.
- From “Anyone who considers others or understands feelings can show empathy,” his not showing empathy implies he neither considers others nor understands feelings.

None of the given statements connect being a just ruler, bringing prosperity, or forging unity to the established attributes. We cannot determine whether King Cruz is a just ruler, nor whether he brings prosperity or forges unity. Therefore, the conditional “If King Cruz is a just ruler, then he either brings prosperity or forges unity (or both)” cannot be confirmed or refuted from the information provided.
