Question ID: 330
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Ayan keeps records or organizes notes. Ayan is either careful or careless, but not both. Ayan does not track data. Ayan maintains a database. If someone is either a researcher or collects samples, then they analyse results. If Ayan either organizes notes or tracks data (but not both), then he is meticulous. Ayan interprets data. Ayan follows protocol or is meticulous. Ayan either analyses results or interprets data, but not both. Oscar keeps records or organizes notes. Gunnar is either careful or careless, but not both. Ayan collects samples. If Ayan is a researcher, then he either keeps records or maintains a database, but not both. Oscar collects samples. Coraline interprets data. If someone is meticulous, then they pay attention to details and are careful. Coraline either analyses results or interprets data, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ayan is not careless.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Ayan is exactly one of careful or careless (exclusive).
- To conclude “not careless,” we need to show Ayan is careful.
- The only given route to careful is: meticulous -> careful.
- Paths to meticulous:
  - If (organizes notes XOR tracks data) then meticulous. We know Ayan does not track data, but we do not know he organizes notes (only “keeps records or organizes notes”), so we cannot trigger this.
  - “Ayan follows protocol or is meticulous” is a disjunction; it doesn’t let us conclude meticulous.
- No other statements determine carefulness. Conflicting info about analyses/interprets and collects samples doesn’t bear on carefulness.

Conclusion: We cannot determine that Ayan is not careless.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
