Question ID: 331
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Tate acts on impulse. Tate achieves success. Tate either prioritizes leisure or works tirelessly, but not both. If Tate is ambitious, then he either prioritizes leisure or enjoys freedom, but not both. Tate does not enjoy freedom. Tate has career goals. If Tate pursues his passion, then he is either dedicated or achieves success, but not both. For Tate, he either acts on impulse or thinks critically, but not both. If Tate loves nature, then he prioritizes leisure. Tate is ambitious. Tate does not have strong motivation. If Tate has career goals, then he either has strong motivation or pursues his passion, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Tate becomes an expert in his field.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From A (ambitious) and not F (does not enjoy freedom), and the rule If A then L XOR F, we get L (prioritizes leisure) true and thus W (works tirelessly) false.
- From C (has career goals) and not M (no strong motivation), and the rule If C then M XOR P, we deduce P (pursues passion) true.
- From P true and S (achieves success) true, and the rule If P then D XOR S, we get D (dedicated) false.
- From I (acts on impulse) and the rule I XOR T, T (thinks critically) is false.
- N (loves nature) is undetermined, but would imply L; L is already true.

No rule links these facts to “Tate becomes an expert in his field.” It is neither entailed nor contradicted by the premises.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
