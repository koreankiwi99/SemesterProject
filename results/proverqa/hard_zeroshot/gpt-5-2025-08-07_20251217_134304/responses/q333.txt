Question ID: 333
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If someone advances medical knowledge and communicates effectively, then they can inspire others. Jude either appreciates biological complexity or values scientific discovery (or both). Anyone who studies morphogenesis either identifies developmental mechanisms or understands cellular processes (or both). Rosemary either appreciates biological complexity or values scientific discovery (or both). Jude does not make new discoveries. Jude shares ideas or communicates effectively. Jude does not achieve recognition. Anyone who inspires others or makes new discoveries will achieve recognition. Anyone who appreciates biological complexity understands cellular processes or advances medical knowledge (or both). Ryan does not achieve recognition. Ryan either has curiosity or understands cellular processes, but it is possible for Ryan to have both. Jude has curiosity. Jude either has curiosity or understands cellular processes, but it is possible for Jude to have both. Saint has curiosity. Anyone who speaks clearly and listens actively can communicate effectively. Jude does not share ideas.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jude values scientific discovery.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Jude shares ideas or communicates effectively" and "Jude does not share ideas," it follows that Jude communicates effectively.
- From "Anyone who inspires others or makes new discoveries will achieve recognition" and "Jude does not achieve recognition," we infer that Jude does not inspire others (and indeed does not make new discoveries, which is also given).
- Given "If someone advances medical knowledge and communicates effectively, then they can inspire others," and since Jude communicates effectively but does not inspire others, Jude cannot be advancing medical knowledge.
- From "Jude either appreciates biological complexity or values scientific discovery (or both)" and "Anyone who appreciates biological complexity understands cellular processes or advances medical knowledge (or both)," together with Jude not advancing medical knowledge, if Jude appreciates biological complexity then he must understand cellular processes. This is consistent and does not force valuing scientific discovery.
- Therefore, the information does not entail that Jude values scientific discovery; it remains possible that he only appreciates biological complexity.

ANSWER: Uncertain
