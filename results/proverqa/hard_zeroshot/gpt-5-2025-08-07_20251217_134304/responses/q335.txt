- Bridger tells profound stories and does not speak from the heart. By the XOR rule for Bridger (heart OR profound stories -> high inspirational value), he has high inspirational value.
- If Bridger has high inspirational value, then he is either receiving divine messages or highly intellectually capable, but not both. Since Bridger is highly intellectually capable, it follows he is not receiving divine messages.
- From intuitive insight, Bridger has either extensive knowledge or great wisdom, but not both. Which one is not determined.
- The only rule connecting “revered as a prophet” is specific to Jayson. There is no rule that would make Bridger revered as a prophet under any of his properties, nor any rule that forbids it.
