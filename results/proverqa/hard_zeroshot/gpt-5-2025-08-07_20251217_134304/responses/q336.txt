==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Anyone who puts others first or makes time for others is thoughtful" and "Ellis makes time for others," we get Thoughtful(Ellis).
- From "Ellis does not stand up for himself" and "Ellis either stands up for himself or treats others kindly," we infer TreatsKindly(Ellis).
- From "Anyone who treats others kindly or acts selflessly has good intentions" and TreatsKindly(Ellis), we get GoodIntentions(Ellis).
- From "If Ellis has good intentions, then he is either thoughtful or empathetic, but not both" and Thoughtful(Ellis), we infer not Empathetic(Ellis).

No premise connects thoughtfulness, kindness, or good intentions to "offers support." Thus, whether Ellis offers support is not determined.
