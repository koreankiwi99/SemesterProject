Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Maia explores deserts or protects succulents” and “Maia does not protect succulents,” Maia explores deserts. Hence she gains deeper knowledge and conserves plants. 
- From “Maia collects specimens” and the XOR rule with sharing findings/conserving plants, and since she conserves plants, she does not share findings.
- Nothing in the premises defines “studies cacti” or establishes that Maia is (or is not) a cactus lover. The rules involving cactus lovers are conditional and do not assert that Maia is one. 
- “Maia does not contribute to society” only implies she is not simultaneously a cactus lover who documents plants or supports research; it does not prove she isn’t a cactus lover nor that she does or does not study cacti.

Therefore, whether Maia studies cacti is not determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
