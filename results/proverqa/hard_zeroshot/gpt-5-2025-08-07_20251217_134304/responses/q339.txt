Question ID: 339
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Presley does not try new techniques. If Presley is an innovative artist, then he either creates visually stunning work or applies mathematical principles in his art (or both). Presley takes creative risks. If an artist understands color theory and uses natural light effectively, then they can create visually stunning work. Presley does not pursue creative expression. For Presley, either his work focuses on functionality or it creates visually stunning effects, but these two aspects are mutually exclusive. If an artist is comfortable with taking risks, they will experiment fearlessly. Every artist who experiments fearlessly pushes boundaries. If Presley either tries new techniques or takes creative risks (but not both), then he is comfortable with uncertainty. All artists who push boundaries are innovative artists. For Presley, either his work focuses on functionality or he pursues creative expression, but these two aspects are mutually exclusive.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Presley applies mathematical principles in his art.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Presley does not pursue creative expression" and "Either functionality or creative expression (mutually exclusive)," Presley’s work focuses on functionality (F true).
- From "Either functionality or visually stunning (mutually exclusive)," and F true, it follows Presley’s work is not visually stunning (V false).
- If Presley is innovative (I), then V or M must hold. Since V is false, I would imply M.
- To get I: we would need Presley to push boundaries (PB), because PB -> I. PB would follow from experimenting fearlessly (EF), since EF -> PB. EF would follow from being comfortable with taking risks (CTR) via CTR -> EF.
- However, we are only given that Presley takes creative risks (CR) and is comfortable with uncertainty (CU) via the XOR condition with not trying new techniques. Neither CR nor CU implies CTR, EF, PB, or I.
- Thus, we cannot establish I, and therefore cannot conclude M. Nothing rules out M either.

Conclusion: The truth of “Presley applies mathematical principles in his art” cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
