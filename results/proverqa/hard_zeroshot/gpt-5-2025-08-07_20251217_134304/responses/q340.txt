Question ID: 340
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Mccoy has good memory. For any elephant that avoids sunlight and feels hot, it stays cool. If Dimples has good memory, then she does not necessarily have large ears, and if Dimples has large ears, then she does not necessarily have good memory. Mccoy does not need relaxation. Dimples does not stay cool. Either Dimples enjoys cool temperatures or she prefers warm temperatures, but not both. Dimples does not need relaxation. Any elephant that exercises outside or lives in the desert feels hot. Dimples does not live in the desert. Either Ocean enjoys cool temperatures or she prefers warm temperatures, but not both. All elephants who either avoid sunlight or prefer warm temperatures (but not both) seek shade. Dimples has good memory. Dimples exercises outside. All elephants that seek shade have large ears and need relaxation. Any elephant that has good hearing or lives in the savannah has large ears. Ocean does not live in the desert. Mccoy does not stay cool. If Dimples loves refrigerators, then she either avoids sunlight or has sensitive skin (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dimples enjoys cool temperatures.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Dimples exercises outside, so (as an elephant) she feels hot.
- If an elephant avoids sunlight and feels hot, it stays cool. Dimples feels hot and does not stay cool, so she does not avoid sunlight.
- If an elephant either avoids sunlight or prefers warm temperatures (but not both), it seeks shade, and all that seek shade need relaxation. Dimples does not need relaxation, so that XOR condition must be false. Since she does not avoid sunlight, this forces “prefers warm temperatures” to be false.
- Given the exclusive-or: either Dimples enjoys cool temperatures or she prefers warm (but not both). With “prefers warm” false, “enjoys cool” is true.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:

Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
