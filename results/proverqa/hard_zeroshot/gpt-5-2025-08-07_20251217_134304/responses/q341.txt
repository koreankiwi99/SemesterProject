Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Ahmad makes discoveries. Jasiah makes discoveries. Anyone who thinks critically will solve problems. Ahmad enhances his knowledge. If Ahmad is curious, then he can either make discoveries or drive innovation, but not both. Riley enhances his knowledge. Ahmad asks questions. Riley is inquisitive. If Ahmad pursues research, then he can either achieve recognition or drive innovation, but not both. Ahmad thinks critically. If someone has imagination, then they seek answers and explore concepts. If Ahmad either asks questions or explores concepts (but not both), then he is curious. Creed thinks critically. If Creed pursues research, then he can either achieve recognition or drive innovation, but not both. If Ahmad either examines data or investigates phenomena (but not both), then he has curiosity. Riley asks questions. Ahmad reads widely. Ahmad is inquisitive. Anyone who has expertise or collaborates widely can drive innovation. If Ahmad solves problems, then he pursues research and enhances his knowledge. If Ahmad either analyzes data or identifies patterns (but not both), then he solves problems. Creed reads widely. If Ahmad is inquisitive, then he either reads widely or explores concepts (but not both). If Creed either asks questions or explores concepts (but not both), then he is curious.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ahmad achieves recognition.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Ahmad thinks critically, so he solves problems.
- If he solves problems, then he pursues research (and enhances his knowledge). Hence, Ahmad pursues research.
- If Ahmad pursues research, then exactly one of achieve recognition or drive innovation holds.
- Ahmad is inquisitive and reads widely. From "If inquisitive, then exactly one of reads widely or explores concepts," we get that he does not explore concepts.
- Ahmad asks questions, and he does not explore concepts, so exactly one of asks questions or explores concepts holds; therefore, Ahmad is curious.
- If Ahmad is curious, then exactly one of make discoveries or drive innovation holds. Since Ahmad makes discoveries, it follows that he does not drive innovation.
- From the research XOR (recognition vs. drive innovation) and the fact that he does not drive innovation, it follows that Ahmad achieves recognition.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
