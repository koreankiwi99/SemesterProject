  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From values critique: V(R) -> (E(R) or O(R)). Given ¬E(R), we get O(R).
- If C(R) then (W(R) or SA(R)). Given ¬W(R), C(R) would imply SA(R).
- With K(R) and SA(R), (K ∧ SA) -> G(R), contradicting ¬G(R). Hence ¬C(R).
- From (O(R) ∧ UV(R)) -> C(R) and O(R) and ¬C(R), deduce ¬UV(R).
- From (RA(R) xor UV(R)) and ¬UV(R), deduce RA(R).
- From (RA(R) xor DE(R)) and RA(R), deduce ¬DE(R).

Therefore, Raphael is not a doubted expert.
