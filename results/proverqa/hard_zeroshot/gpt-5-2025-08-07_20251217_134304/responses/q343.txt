Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Everyone who embraces new ideas either creates innovative work or inspires others. Kenna either encourages free expression or follows conventional rules, but not both. If someone creates innovative work, then they think outside the box and foster creative growth. Kenna either appreciates conformity or values individuality, but not both. Kenna does not appreciate conformity. Kenna either follows conventional rules or thinks outside the box, but not both. Kenna either embraces new ideas or collaborates with others. If someone values individuality, they may not always foster creative growth, and vice versa. If Kenna collaborates with others or welcomes diverse perspectives (or both), then she creates innovative work. Kenna encourages free expression. If someone values order and prefers structure, then they follow conventional rules.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kenna does not welcome diverse perspectives.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Kenna encourages free expression. From the exclusive or (encourages free expression XOR follows conventional rules), she does not follow conventional rules.
- From the exclusive or (follows conventional rules XOR thinks outside the box), Kenna thinks outside the box.
- Kenna does not appreciate conformity; from the exclusive or (appreciates conformity XOR values individuality), she values individuality.
- From (collaborates with others OR welcomes diverse perspectives) → creates innovative work, the contrapositive is: if she does not create innovative work, then she neither collaborates nor welcomes diverse perspectives.
- From (collaborates with others OR embraces new ideas), at least one holds. If she collaborates, then she creates innovative work, but this does not determine whether she welcomes diverse perspectives. If she does not collaborate, she must embrace new ideas; embracing new ideas only guarantees either creating innovative work or inspiring others, which still leaves welcoming diverse perspectives undetermined.
- It is consistent that she welcomes diverse perspectives (e.g., if she collaborates or independently welcomes diverse perspectives, she creates innovative work) and also consistent that she does not (e.g., if she does not create innovative work, then she neither collaborates nor welcomes diverse perspectives).

Therefore, whether Kenna welcomes diverse perspectives cannot be determined from the given information.
