Question ID: 344
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Jasper does not build businesses. If Jasper has financial knowledge, then he invests wisely. For Jasper, being knowledgeable about economics and valuing humility are mutually exclusive traits. Jasper manages his assets or has financial knowledge. Jasper either pursues material wealth or is philanthropic, but not both. Jasper reads market trends. Jasper lives a private life. If Jasper either donates to charity or supports local communities (but not both), then he is philanthropic. If someone understands economics and reads market trends, then they have financial knowledge. Jasper does not value humility. If Jasper either invests wisely or builds businesses (but not both), then he pursues material wealth. Jasper either lives a private life or is respected by others, but not both. If Philip either invests wisely or builds businesses (but not both), then he pursues material wealth. Jasper manages assets or invests wisely.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jasper leaves a lasting impact.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Jasper lives a private life” and “private life XOR respected,” we get that Jasper is not respected by others.
- Jasper does not build businesses.
- Reads market trends is true. Whether he has financial knowledge depends on whether he understands economics, which is undetermined (mutual exclusivity with valuing humility plus “does not value humility” does not fix understanding economics). Hence financial knowledge and invests wisely are both undetermined.
- If he does invest wisely (and does not build businesses), then he pursues material wealth, making philanthropy false; otherwise, philanthropy/material wealth is determined only by the XOR constraint and remains open.
- No premise links any of these properties (private life, respect, philanthropy, wealth pursuit, investing, etc.) to “leaves a lasting impact.”

Therefore, whether Jasper leaves a lasting impact cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
