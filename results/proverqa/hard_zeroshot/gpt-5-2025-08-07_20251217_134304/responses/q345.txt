==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Nathaniel has expert knowledge or special skills, and he does not have special skills; therefore he has expert knowledge.
- With expert knowledge, he either writes academic publications or is a consultant. He does not write academic publications, so he is a consultant.
- If he is a consultant, then he either works with communities or develops environmental initiatives, but not both. If he develops environmental initiatives, then he must either educate local residents or promote eco-tourism, but he does neither; hence he does not develop environmental initiatives. Therefore, he works with communities.
- Working with communities implies he applies practical solutions.
- He either pursues theoretical knowledge or applies practical solutions, but not both. Since he applies practical solutions, he does not pursue theoretical knowledge.
- He either pursues theoretical knowledge or is dedicated to research, but not both. Since he does not pursue theoretical knowledge, he is dedicated to research.
- If he is dedicated to research, then he makes new discoveries.

Therefore, the claim that Nathaniel does not make new discoveries is false.
