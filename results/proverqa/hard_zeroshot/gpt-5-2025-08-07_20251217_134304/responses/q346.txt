==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Everyone makes plans or sets goals” and “Araya does not make plans,” Araya sets goals.
- Anyone who sets goals is motivated, so Araya is motivated.
- If Araya is motivated, then she is pursuing hobbies or has a stable job, but not both. Given she is pursuing hobbies, she does not have a stable job.
- Araya follows her intuition and enjoys exploration, so she can embrace spontaneity; thus she embraces spontaneity.
- Araya either values practicality or embraces spontaneity, but not both. Since she embraces spontaneity, she does not value practicality.
- Araya either values practicality or has a creative passion, but not both. Since she does not value practicality, she has a creative passion.
- If Araya has a creative passion or a stable job, then she leads a balanced life. She has a creative passion, so she leads a balanced life.

Therefore, the statement “Araya does not lead a balanced life” is false.
