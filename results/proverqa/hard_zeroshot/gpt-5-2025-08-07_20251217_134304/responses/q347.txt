Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ayleen does not lack expertise in botany.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Ayleen works outdoors and the rule “works outdoors -> exactly one of (studies horticulture, appreciates landscaping),” together with “Ayleen appreciates landscaping,” we get that Ayleen does not study horticulture.
- The rule “(loves gardening XOR studies horticulture) -> cares for plants” then reduces to “if Ayleen loves gardening, she cares for plants” (since she does not study horticulture).
- If Ayleen cares for plants, then she has expertise in botany. So, if she loves gardening, she has expertise in botany.
- However, we only know “Ayleen enjoys nature or loves gardening,” which does not force loves gardening to be true (enjoys nature could be the true disjunct).
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether she has expertise in botany. Given the exclusive dichotomy (has botany expertise XOR lacks it), which side holds remains undetermined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:

Ground Truth: True
