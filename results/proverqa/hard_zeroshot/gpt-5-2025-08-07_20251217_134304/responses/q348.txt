Context:
If Saul finds an inspirational figure, then he will either become a success or pay tribute to that figure, but not both. Saul does not continue to create. Saul practices diligently. If someone gains recognition and develops a unique voice, then they will continue to create. If someone explores their own style, they may not necessarily find an inspirational figure, and vice versa. Saul draws from influences. Saul values feedback. If Saul produces original work, then he will earn critical acclaim. Saul does not earn critical acclaim. If Saul either stays true to himself or values feedback (but not both), then he will remain authentic. If Saul diligently practices and stays true to himself, then he will gain recognition. Saul does not remain authentic. If Saul either draws from influences or pays tribute to a figure, then he produces original work. If someone explores their own style, then they will develop a unique voice.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Saul does not become a success.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If (stays true XOR values feedback) then remains authentic” and “Saul does not remain authentic,” with “Saul values feedback,” we get that the XOR is false; hence Saul stays true as well.
- With “Saul practices diligently,” “If diligently practices and stays true then gains recognition” gives Saul gains recognition.
- From “If gains recognition and develops a unique voice then continues to create” and “Saul does not continue to create,” we infer he does not develop a unique voice; thus he did not explore his own style.
- From “If produces original work then earns critical acclaim” and “Saul does not earn critical acclaim,” we infer he does not produce original work.
- But “Saul draws from influences” and “If draws from influences or pays tribute then produces original work” would imply he does produce original work, contradicting the prior conclusion. So the premises are inconsistent.

The only rule involving success is: if he finds an inspirational figure, then exactly one of success or paying tribute occurs. We cannot determine whether he finds an inspirational figure, nor can we consistently fix whether he pays tribute. Therefore we cannot determine whether he becomes a success. 

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
