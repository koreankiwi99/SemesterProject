- As a public figure, she is either ruthless or sophisticated (but not both). Given she is sophisticated, she is not ruthless.
- Emmy holds a leadership role, which implies she is either authoritative or compassionate (but not both).
- Emmy does not help others, but she either helps or volunteers; thus she volunteers. Anyone who volunteers is compassionate. Therefore, she is compassionate and not authoritative.
- Emmy is either kind or authoritative (but not both). Since she is not authoritative, she is kind.
- Since she is kind and not ruthless, “ruthless xor kind” is true, which implies she is complex.

Therefore, “Emmy is not complex” is false.
