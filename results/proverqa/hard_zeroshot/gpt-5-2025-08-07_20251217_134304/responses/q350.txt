Question ID: 350
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Rebekah is either a dedicated researcher or pursues independent projects, but not both. If Rebekah is a well-funded entomologist, then she either has a mentor or makes breakthroughs (but not both). Rebekah specializes in bees. If Rebekah is successful or has experience, then she makes breakthroughs. If Rebekah is curious, then she can solve complex problems and pursue independent projects. Every innovative entomologist either explores remote areas or develops new theories (or both). Rebekah does not explore remote areas. If Rebekah either investigates ecosystems or pursues independent projects (but not both), then she is innovative. Rebekah studies wasps. If Rebekah either makes breakthroughs or publishes papers (but not both), then she advances her field. All entomologists who advance their field are dedicated researchers and inspire others. Rebekah does not publish papers. If Molly either investigates ecosystems or pursues independent projects (but not both), then she is innovative. Rebekah investigates ecosystems. Any entomologist who either collects rare samples or discovers new species can be successful. Rebekah collaborates with colleagues. If Rebekah studies moths, then she either specializes in bees or studies wasps, but not both. Bryce does not develop new theories. If Rebekah either classifies insects or analyzes wing patterns (but not both), then she studies moths. Rebekah does not develop new theories. An entomologist either inspires others or collaborates with colleagues, but not necessarily both. For any entomologist, examining nocturnal behaviors and analyzing camouflage techniques can lead to innovation. If Rebekah either studies butterflies or studies moths (but not both), then she is successful.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rebekah does not study butterflies.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Every innovative entomologist explores remote areas or develops new theories” and Rebekah does neither (not ER and not DT), we get not Innovative.
- Given IE true and “(IE xor IP) -> Innovative,” not Innovative implies not(IE xor IP); since IE is true, this forces IP true. With “DR xor IP,” this yields DR false.
- From not PP and “(B xor PP) -> AF,” we get B -> AF. With AF -> DR and DR false, we have not AF, hence not B. From (S or E) -> B and not B, we get not S and not E.
- SB and SW are both true. With “SM -> (SB xor SW)” and (SB xor SW) false, we obtain not SM.
- From “(SBf xor SM) -> S” and not SM, this reduces to SBf -> S. With not S, we conclude not SBf.

Therefore, Rebekah does not study butterflies.

ANSWER: True
