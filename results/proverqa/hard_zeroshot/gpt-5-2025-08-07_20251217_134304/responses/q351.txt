==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Isabela prioritizes her own well-being” and “Isabela values her community,” and the rule “If she supports her family, then exactly one of those is true,” we infer she does not support her family (otherwise contradiction).
- Given “Isabela encounters problems” and the rule that then exactly one of “helps others” or “supports her family” holds, we conclude she helps others.
- From “Isabela does not stay motivated” and the rule “If exactly one of meets deadlines or faces challenges holds, then she stays motivated,” we infer that meets deadlines and faces challenges have the same truth value (both true or both false).
- From “Isabela does not overcome obstacles” and “Isabela pursues her passions,” and the rule “If exactly one of those, then she has ambition,” we infer she has ambition.
- With ambition and “Isabela achieves success,” and the rule “If she has ambition, then exactly one of sets goals or achieves success,” we get that she does not set goals.
- From “Exactly one of sets goals or meets deadlines,” we conclude she meets deadlines; thus, faces challenges is also true (same truth value).
- From “faces challenges” and “helps others,” and the rule “Anyone who faces challenges and helps others is brave,” we conclude she is brave.
- Since “Isabela is either brave or fearful, but not both,” being brave implies she is not fearful.
