Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Rule: If a person plays an instrument or composes music, then they bring people joy.
- For Boden: Either he appreciates silence or plays an instrument, but not both. Given Boden appreciates silence, he does not play an instrument.
- Boden has a creative vision, so he writes lyrics.
- Conditional: If (Boden writes lyrics XOR creates harmonies), then he composes music.
- We know Boden conveys emotions through his music. Also, for any person, they either convey emotions through their art or create harmonies (inclusive OR). Since Boden conveys emotions, this does not rule out that he also creates harmonies. Thus we cannot determine whether the XOR condition (writes lyrics XOR creates harmonies) holds, so we cannot conclude he composes music.
- Therefore, we cannot conclude he brings people joy (since we do not know if he composes), nor can we conclude he does not bring people joy (since he might compose).

ANSWER: Uncertain
