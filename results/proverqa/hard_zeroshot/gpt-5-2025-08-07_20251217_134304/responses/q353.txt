Question ID: 353
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Cuddlebug either respects nature or harms nature (but not both), then he is responsible. Devin visits beaches or enjoys hiking. If Devin enjoys hiking, then he either grows up outdoors or appreciates biodiversity, but not both. For Devin, he either conserves wildlife or harms nature, but not both. If Cuddlebug grows up outdoors, then he values the ecosystem and promotes sustainability. For anyone, if they love marine life and promote sustainability, then they conserve wildlife. If Devin either protects habitats or preserves water quality (but not both), then he conserves wildlife. Devin does not appreciate biodiversity. If Devin grows up outdoors, then he values the ecosystem and promotes sustainability. Devin does not explore caves. Cuddlebug does not explore caves. Devin loves marine life. Devin collects rocks. If Devin either explores caves or collects rocks (but not both), then he enjoys hiking.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Devin is not responsible.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Devin collects rocks and does not explore caves. Given the XOR rule (explores caves or collects rocks), Devin enjoys hiking.
- If Devin enjoys hiking, then he grows up outdoors or appreciates biodiversity, but not both. Since he does not appreciate biodiversity, he must grow up outdoors.
- If Devin grows up outdoors, he promotes sustainability. He also loves marine life. By the universal rule, loving marine life and promoting sustainability implies he conserves wildlife.
- From the XOR rule (conserves wildlife or harms nature), conserving wildlife implies he does not harm nature.

None of the given rules connect Devin’s properties to being “responsible.” The only responsibility rule applies specifically to Cuddlebug. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Devin is responsible or not.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
