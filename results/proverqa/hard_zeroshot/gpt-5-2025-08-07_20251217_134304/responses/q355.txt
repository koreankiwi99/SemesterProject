==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Quentin has good posture and enjoys outdoor games, so he is physically active.
- If Quentin is physically active, then he exercises regularly or has good habits, but not both. Since he has good habits, he does not exercise regularly.
- If someone leads a healthy life, they exercise regularly; thus Quentin does not lead a healthy life.
- If Quentin overcame health challenges, he would lead a healthy life; therefore he did not overcome health challenges.
- The only statement about proper medical care is: if someone receives proper medical care, then they can overcome health challenges. This does not allow us to infer whether Quentin receives proper medical care, nor does it conflict with him not having overcome challenges.
