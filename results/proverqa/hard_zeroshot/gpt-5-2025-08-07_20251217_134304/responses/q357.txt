Question ID: 357
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Addison either publishes research or leads workshops (but not both), then she is influential. If Faye either studied fungi or discovered a new species (but not both), then she is renowned. If Faye is influential, then she collaborates with others and mentors students. If Muffinhead either studied fungi or discovered a new species (but not both), then she is renowned. If a mycologist receives awards, then they are respected. Faye leads workshops. Faye is not respected. Addison leads workshops. All mycologists who collaborate with others develop new techniques and share knowledge. Faye shares knowledge. Every mycologist who contributes to the field is either influential or advances scientific knowledge (or both). If Faye has passion, then she is renowned and makes an impact. Muffinhead is not respected. Faye did not discover a new species. Addison shares knowledge. Faye does not develop new techniques. If Faye either publishes research or leads workshops (but not both), then she is influential. If a mycologist publishes research and is renowned, then they receive awards.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Faye did not study fungi.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

- From “If Faye is influential, then she collaborates...” and “All mycologists who collaborate develop new techniques...”, we get: Influential(Faye) -> DevelopTech(Faye). Given “Faye does not develop new techniques,” by contrapositive, Faye is not influential.
- Given “Faye leads workshops” and “If Faye either publishes or leads workshops (but not both), then she is influential,” the contrapositive implies the XOR condition is false. Since she leads workshops, it follows she also publishes research.
- From “If a mycologist receives awards, then they are respected” and “Faye is not respected,” it follows Faye does not receive awards.
- From “If a mycologist publishes research and is renowned, then they receive awards,” and since Faye publishes and does not receive awards, it follows Faye is not renowned.
- From “If Faye either studied fungi or discovered a new species (but not both), then she is renowned,” the contrapositive gives that if she is not renowned, then it’s not the case that exactly one of studied fungi or discovered a new species is true.
- Given “Faye did not discover a new species,” the only way for “not exactly one” to hold is that she also did not study fungi.

Therefore, Faye did not study fungi.
