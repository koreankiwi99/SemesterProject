==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
The context provides no statements or rules about “advanced skills,” nor any rule linking it to attributes we can infer for Alfonso (e.g., continuing education, dedication to osteopathy, communication/anatomy, patient outcomes). While we can deduce Alfonso is compassionate, selfless, not empathetic, not strongly ethical, not motivated to help others, not passionate about healthcare, not dedicated to osteopathy, and does not improve patient outcomes, none of these entail whether he has (or lacks) advanced skills.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
