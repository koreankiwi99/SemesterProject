  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Aarav is well-traveled” and “If well-traveled, then either speaks many languages or has local knowledge, but not both,” plus “Aarav does not have local knowledge,” we get: Aarav speaks many languages.
- From “Aarav either values honesty or understands cultures (but not both)” and “Aarav does not value honesty,” we get: Aarav understands cultures.
- From “Aarav serves nobly” and “Anyone who serves nobly or negotiates effectively is admired,” we get: Aarav is admired.
- From “Aarav holds high office” and “If Aarav holds high office, then he is either respected or admired, but not both,” together with “Aarav is admired,” we conclude: Aarav is not respected.

Now evaluate the target statement: “If Aarav is either charismatic or diplomatic (but not both), then he is respected.”
- We have no rules establishing whether Aarav is charismatic or diplomatic. The only related rule is “confidence ∧ wit -> charismatic,” but we don’t know if he has confidence or wit; nothing mentions being diplomatic.
- Since we know Aarav is not respected, the conditional would be false if its antecedent (charismatic XOR diplomatic) were true, and true if the antecedent were false. Because we cannot determine the antecedent, the overall truth of the conditional is undetermined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
