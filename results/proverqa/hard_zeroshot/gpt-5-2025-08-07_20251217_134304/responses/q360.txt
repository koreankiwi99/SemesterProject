Question ID: 360
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Valeria prioritizes efficiency. Valeria either prioritizes efficiency or values compassion, but not necessarily both. If someone either seeks power or craves wealth (but not both), then they are driven by a desire to pursue personal gain. Valeria is either selfless or selfish, but not both. If Valeria is ambitious, then she either craves wealth or desires recognition, but not both. Valeria either values compassion or may crave wealth, but not necessarily both. Valeria either serves others or seeks power, but not both. If Valeria holds authority, then she either seeks power or takes initiative (or both). Valeria is either driven by a desire to pursue personal gain or acts selflessly, but not both. Valeria serves others.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Valeria is not selfish.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Valeria serves others” and “serves others or seeks power, but not both,” we get seeks power (P) is false.
- Rule: (P XOR W) → G. With P false, this becomes: if craves wealth (W) then driven by personal gain (G).
- “Values compassion or craves wealth (inclusive)” means at least one of C or W is true, but doesn’t force W either way.
- “Selfless XOR selfish” and “G XOR selfless” together imply selfish iff G.

Two consistent possibilities:
- If W is true, then G is true, so selfish is true.
- If W is false, then (from C ∨ W) C must be true; G can be false (consistent with rules), so selfless is true and selfish is false.

Both outcomes are consistent, so we cannot determine whether Valeria is not selfish.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
