==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Esmeralda has a calm demeanor, which implies exactly one of: she soothes skittish animals or participates in therapy.
- Esmeralda performs tricks and, given she has strong instincts in an exclusive-or with adapting to habitat, she does not adapt. Therefore the “performs tricks or adapts (but not both)” condition holds, so she learns quickly. With keen instincts, she is experienced. She also establishes a connection (responds to commands + affectionate). None of these determine soothing vs therapy.
- From gentle nature, she either builds trust or soothes skittish animals, but this does not force soothing (and does not rule out therapy).
- No rule compels that she soothes or that she participates in therapy; either is consistent with the information.
