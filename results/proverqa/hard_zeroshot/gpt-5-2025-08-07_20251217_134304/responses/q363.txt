Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lenora is pain-free.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Lenora chooses natural remedies and, by the XOR with avoiding additives, she does not avoid additives.
- She buys organic; with not avoiding additives, the XOR condition holds, so she shops healthy.
- Shopping healthy implies she reads nutrition labels; reading labels implies she eats balanced meals.
- She does not get enough sleep. Thus, balanced meals XOR enough sleep holds, so she takes regular exercise.
- By the XOR between regular exercise and chronic pain, her taking exercise implies she does not have chronic pain.
- By the XOR between chronic pain and being pain-free, not having chronic pain implies she is pain-free.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
