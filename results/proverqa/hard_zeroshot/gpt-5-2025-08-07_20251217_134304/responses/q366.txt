Context:
Keanu has sharp hooves. All active deer have strong senses and good vision. All deer with powerful muscles and a lightweight build can run quickly. Keanu is calm. Florence is active. If a deer has keen senses, it may not necessarily run quickly, and vice versa. A deer either has a gentle nature or explores the wild, but not both is not necessarily true. All deer that live in the forest have keen senses. Keanu is not playful. Any deer that is surefooted or can leap far can explore the wild. Zayd has sharp hooves. Any deer that has sharp hooves and agile legs can run quickly. If Keanu has large ears or good vision, then he can live in the forest. Keanu has strong senses. Zayd is not playful. Keanu is active. If Keanu is calm, then he is either playful or has a gentle nature, but not both. Zayd has strong senses. If Keanu is fleet, then he is either capable of leaping far or is powerful, but not both. If Keanu has large antlers, then he is either capable of leaping far or has agile legs, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Keanu does not have large antlers.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We know:
- Keanu is active, so he has good vision and strong senses.
- With good vision, Keanu lives in the forest; forest implies keen senses.
- Keanu is calm and not playful; from the XOR rule (calm -> playful XOR gentle), Keanu must be gentle.

Consider the statement about large antlers:
- If Keanu has large antlers, then (leap far XOR agile legs).
  - If leap far, then he explores the wild. This does not contradict being gentle (there is no rule prohibiting both).
  - If agile legs, then with sharp hooves he can run quickly. This does not contradict any given facts.

No contradictions arise from assuming large antlers, and we have no rule forcing or forbidding large antlers. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Keanu lacks large antlers.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
