Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Fallon did not become an expert.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Reasoning:
- From: If Fallon examines antiquities (X), then she either analyzes data (A) or draws accurate conclusions (C), but not both; and given Fallon does not analyze data (¬A) and does not draw accurate conclusions (¬C), it follows that X cannot hold. So ¬X.
- From: Fallon examines antiquities or interprets her finds correctly (X ∨ I), with ¬X, we get I.
- From: Fallon either explores historical sites or interprets her finds correctly, but not both (H XOR I), with I true, we get ¬H.
- From: Fallon either explores historical sites or uncovers ancient artifacts (H ∨ U), with ¬H, we get U.
- Expert condition: If Fallon uncovers ancient artifacts and studies their significance (U ∧ S), then she becomes an expert (K). We have U true, but there is no information forcing S true or false. Therefore K cannot be determined.

Conclusion: Whether Fallon became an expert is not determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
