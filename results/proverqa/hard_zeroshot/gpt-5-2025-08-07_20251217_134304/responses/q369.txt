Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
1. From "Any person who listens actively or cares for others can build strong relationships" and "Yareli does not build strong relationships," conclude she neither listens actively nor cares for others.
2. Empathetic implies exactly one of respectful of boundaries or listens actively. Given she is respectful of boundaries, she does not listen actively (consistent with step 1).
3. From "cares for others or puts patients first" and not caring for others, conclude she puts patients first.
4. Anyone who puts patients first is a dedicated doctor; any dedicated doctor gains international recognition. Therefore, she gains international recognition.

Thus, the statement "Dr. Yareli Hernandez does not gain international recognition" is false.

ANSWER: False
