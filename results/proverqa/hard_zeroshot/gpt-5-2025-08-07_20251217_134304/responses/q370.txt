Context:

Anthony is either resilient or adapts quickly to new situations, but not both. If Anthony faces challenges, then he is either resilient or self-motivated (but not both). Anthony is disorganized. Francis meets deadlines or faces challenges. Willow fails his courses. Leo does not adapt quickly to new situations. Anthony does not meet deadlines. If Leo fails his courses, then he either lacks interest in the past or is disorganized. Francis is either resilient or adapts quickly to new situations, but not both. Anthony fails his courses. Willow does not meet deadlines. Anthony sets goals or is self-motivated. Anthony does not adapt quickly to new situations. If Leo faces challenges, then he is either resilient or self-motivated (but not both). Either Anthony is knowledgeable about ancient cultures or he is uninformed about ancient cultures, but not both. If Anthony is ignorant of history, then he either lacks interest in the past or has no formal education. If Anthony fails his courses, then he either lacks interest in the past or is disorganized. Anthony meets deadlines or faces challenges. Anthony is either knowledgeable about ancient cultures or ignorant of history. Willow is either knowledgeable about ancient cultures or ignorant of history. Anthony values learning or lacks interest in the past.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Anthony is not uninformed about ancient cultures.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Anthony meets deadlines or faces challenges" and "Anthony does not meet deadlines," we get FC(A) true.
- Given "Anthony is either resilient or adapts quickly, but not both" and "Anthony does not adapt quickly," we get R(A) true.
- From "If Anthony faces challenges, then he is either resilient or self-motivated (but not both)" and FC(A) true with R(A) true, we get SM(A) false.
- From "If Anthony has no formal education, then he is self-motivated and passionate about learning," contrapositive yields ¬SM(A) -> ¬NFE(A), so NFE(A) is false.

Now consider the target:
- "Either Anthony is knowledgeable about ancient cultures or he is uninformed about ancient cultures, but not both" gives KAC(A) xor UIAC(A).
- "Anthony is either knowledgeable about ancient cultures or ignorant of history" gives KAC(A) or IGH(A).
- If UIAC(A) is true, then KAC(A) is false, so IGH(A) must be true; this implies (via IGH -> LI or NFE and ¬NFE) that LI(A) is true. No contradiction arises.
- If UIAC(A) is false, then KAC(A) is true; also consistent.

Both UIAC(A) and ¬UIAC(A) are consistent with all premises. Therefore the truth of "Anthony is not uninformed about ancient cultures" cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
