Chanel either speaks jargon or has expert knowledge, but not both. Chanel is humorous. Ryker is well-respected. If Chanel has authority, then she is either humorous or empathetic (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Chanel is not credible.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We need to determine whether “Chanel is not credible” follows from the given information.

Relevant facts about Chanel:
- Chanel does not use complex vocabulary.
- Chanel either speaks jargon or has expert knowledge, but not both.
- If Chanel either speaks jargon or uses complex vocabulary (but not both), then she appears intellectual.
- Chanel does not appear intellectual.
From these, since not complex vocabulary and “if (jargon XOR complex) then appears intellectual” and not appears intellectual, we infer not (jargon XOR complex). With not complex, this implies not jargon. Given the XOR between jargon and expert knowledge, Chanel must have expert knowledge. Also, Chanel has a large following, and “large following -> (charismatic XOR expert knowledge)” then forces not charismatic (since expert knowledge is true).

Other given facts (humorous, empathetic, well-respected -> authority, and authority -> XOR(humorous, empathetic)) produce a contradiction about humorous/empathetic, but none of the rules mention credibility for Chanel. The only rule involving “credible” concerns Renata, not Chanel.

There is no rule connecting credibility to expert knowledge, charisma, authority, appearing intellectual, or any other stated Chanel attributes. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Chanel is not credible (nor that she is credible).

ANSWER: Uncertain
