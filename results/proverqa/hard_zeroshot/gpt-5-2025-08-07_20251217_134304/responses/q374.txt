==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Hope appreciates nature” and “If Hope appreciates nature, then she values balance and engages in yoga,” we get that Hope engages in yoga and values balance.
- Given “Hope does not live intentionally” and “If Hope either practices mindfulness or writes poetry (but not both), then she lives intentionally,” along with “Hope does not write poetry,” it follows that Hope does not practice mindfulness (otherwise she would live intentionally).
- From “Hope practices mindfulness or meditates daily,” and not practicing mindfulness, we conclude she meditates daily.
- From “Everyone who meditates daily either is calm or finds inner peace (or both),” we get that Hope is calm or finds inner peace.
- Only if Hope is calm do we get “she takes good photos.” We cannot conclude she is calm (she could instead only find inner peace), and there is no rule implying she does not take good photos.

Therefore, whether Hope takes good photos is not determined.
