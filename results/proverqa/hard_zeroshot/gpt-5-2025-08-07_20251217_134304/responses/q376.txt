Question ID: 376
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Lucille does not have high endurance. Lucille has fast feet. If someone has strategic skills, then they are not necessarily a formidable fighter, and vice versa. Lucille does not have strategic skills. Lucille either trains rigorously or is motivated, but not both. If Lucille has quick reflexes, then she is aggressive. If Lucille either trains rigorously or delivers powerful blows (but not both), then she has high endurance. If Lucille is a professional boxer, then she either builds a strong physique or trains rigorously, but not both. If Lucille either has fast feet or quick reflexes, then she delivers powerful blows. Lucille is motivated.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lucille is not defensive.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Lucille has fast feet” and “If Lucille either has fast feet or quick reflexes, then she delivers powerful blows,” we get that Lucille delivers powerful blows.
- From “If Lucille either trains rigorously or delivers powerful blows (but not both), then she has high endurance” and “Lucille does not have high endurance,” we deduce it’s not the case that exactly one of (trains rigorously, delivers powerful blows) is true. Since she delivers powerful blows, she must also train rigorously.
- But we’re also told “Lucille either trains rigorously or is motivated, but not both,” and “Lucille is motivated,” which implies she does not train rigorously. This creates a contradiction in the premises.
- There is no information linking “defensive” (or not defensive) to any of the provided traits. Even with the inconsistency, nothing allows us to conclude whether Lucille is not defensive.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
