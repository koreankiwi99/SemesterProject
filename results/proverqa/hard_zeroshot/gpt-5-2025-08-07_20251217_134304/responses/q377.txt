Question ID: 377
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Tate utilizes a plant. Tate protects species or exploits resources. If Tate utilizes a plant, then he either reduces waste or exploits resources, but not both. If someone either consumes excessively or wastes resources (but not both), then they overuse resources. Tate lives extravagantly. Tate reduces waste. Anyone who overuses resources and ignores warnings can disrupt the ecosystem. If Walter pursues research, then he either disrupts the ecosystem or conserves the environment, but not both. Tate ignores warnings. Tate pursues research. If Tate pursues research, then he either disrupts the ecosystem or conserves the environment, but not both. If Tate seeks knowledge, then he either finds innovative solutions or respects nature (or both). If someone lives extravagantly, then they will overuse resources.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Tate either respects nature or harms nature, but not both.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Tate lives extravagantly” and “If someone lives extravagantly, then they will overuse resources,” Tate overuses resources.
- From “Tate utilizes a plant” and the exclusive-or rule with “reduces waste or exploits resources,” and given “Tate reduces waste,” we infer Tate does not exploit resources.
- From “Tate pursues research” and “If Tate pursues research, then he either disrupts the ecosystem or conserves the environment, but not both,” exactly one of {disrupts the ecosystem, conserves the environment} is true.
- “Respects nature” is only linked to “seeks knowledge,” which is not given. There is no stated link between “conserves the environment” and “respects nature,” nor a clear definition of “harms nature” (it might mean “disrupts the ecosystem,” but that is not explicitly equated).
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether Tate respects nature, harms nature, or whether exactly one holds.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
