Question ID: 378
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
For all scientists, if a scientist is renowned, then they either make breakthrough discoveries or receive accolades (or both). If Dr. Clark conducts innovative research, then he will either advance the field or improve existing processes, but not both. If Dr. Clark pursues a PhD, then he either dedicates his career to research or works in industry, but not both. Dr. Clark pursues a PhD. If Dr. Kylan conducts innovative research, then he will either advance the field or improve existing processes, but not both. Dr. Clark leads research teams. Dr. Clark conducts innovative research. Dr. Kylan publishes papers. Dr. Clark either conducts experiments or teaches at a university. Dr. Clark does not drive progress. If Dr. Clark either develops new techniques or makes breakthrough discoveries (but not both), then he will advance his field. All scientists either study phenomena or develop new techniques. Dr. Clark either teaches at a university or works in industry, but not both. If Dr. Clark publishes papers and influences others, then he is renowned. Dr. Harrison pursues a PhD. Dr. Kylan does not create new materials. Dr. Clark does not create new materials. If a scientist develops new techniques, then they will drive progress in their field. Every scientist who dedicates their career to research either improves existing processes or creates new materials. Clark influences others. If Dr. Clark either leads research teams or teaches at a university (but not both), then he collaborates with his peers. Dr. Clark publishes papers. Clark does not collaborate with his peers. Any scientist who studies complex phenomena or tests new hypotheses can advance their field. Dr. Clark dedicates his career to research if he is passionate about science.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Clark does not receive accolades.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Clark publishes papers and influences others, so he is renowned.
- From “renowned → (breakthrough discoveries or accolades),” he must have at least one of those.
- Clark leads research teams and does not collaborate; since XOR(leads, teaches) ⇒ collaborates, and leads is true, teaches must also be true to keep XOR false.
- Teaching XOR industry is given; since he teaches, he does not work in industry. Pursuing a PhD with XOR(dedicate to research, industry) then implies he dedicates his career to research.
- Dedicates to research implies (improve processes or create materials). He does not create materials, so he improves processes.
- He conducts innovative research, and innovative ⇒ XOR(advance field, improve processes). Since he improves processes, he does not advance his field.
- If he developed new techniques, he would drive progress, but he does not drive progress, so he does not develop new techniques.
- If XOR(develop new techniques, breakthrough) then advance field; since he does not advance his field and does not develop new techniques, he cannot have breakthrough discoveries.
- Being renowned and not having breakthrough discoveries forces the other disjunct: he receives accolades.

Therefore, “Dr. Clark does not receive accolades” is false.

ANSWER: False

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
