Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Layne does not have breathing issues. If Layne has a beard, then he likes whiskey and snores loudly. Layne does not respect his heritage. If Layne either snores loudly or has sleep apnea (but not both), then he has breathing issues. Layne does not wear flannel. If Layne enjoys hiking, then he is either outdoorsy or has an adventurous spirit, but not both. Layne does not have strong roots in his community. If someone enjoys solitude and pursues adventure, then they keep a unique routine. Layne does not have a strong presence. Layne snores loudly. If Layne disturbs others, then he has a strong presence and keeps a unique routine. If Layne either has wild hair or wears flannel (but not both), then he is outdoorsy. If Layne is outdoorsy, then he is either lively or charismatic, but not both. If someone sleeps heavily and has loud snores, then they disturb others. Anyone who values tradition or respects heritage has strong roots in their community. If Hayes has either a lively personality or loud snores (but not both), then he is well known. Layne is charismatic. Layne either keeps a unique routine or values tradition, but not both. Layne has wild hair. If someone has sleep apnea, then they sleep heavily. If someone tires easily, then they sleep heavily and need rest.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Layne is well known.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Layne does not have breathing issues” and “If Layne either snores loudly or has sleep apnea (but not both), then he has breathing issues,” together with “Layne snores loudly,” it follows that Layne must also have sleep apnea (to avoid the XOR condition), hence he sleeps heavily and therefore disturbs others.
- Disturbing others implies Layne has a strong presence and keeps a unique routine, which contradicts the given statement that Layne does not have a strong presence. So the premises are inconsistent on that point.
- Regardless, the only rule about being “well known” applies specifically to Hayes, not Layne. There is no rule connecting Layne’s traits to being well known, so we cannot conclude whether Layne is well known.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
