==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Natalie does not admire masters" and "Natalie either admires masters or appreciates classics," conclude Natalie appreciates classics.
- Appreciating classics implies she is a traditional artist and values originality.
- From "Natalie is inspired by history" and the exclusive condition (traditional xor free-spirited), and since she is traditional, she is not free-spirited.
- From "Natalie draws from inspiration" and the general rule, she has creative expression or innovates her style (or both).
- No given rule connects any of these properties to "gains recognition," nor is recognition mentioned elsewhere with implications.

Therefore, whether Natalie gains recognition or not cannot be determined from the information provided.
