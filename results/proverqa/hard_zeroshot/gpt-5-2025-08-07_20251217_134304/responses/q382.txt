- Gustavo struggles financially and success is mutually exclusive with struggling, so Gustavo does not achieve success.
- From (respects craft ∨ connects with audience) → success and not success, we infer Gustavo neither respects his craft nor connects with his audience.
- From (humble ∨ down to earth) → connects and not connects, we infer Gustavo is neither humble nor down to earth.
