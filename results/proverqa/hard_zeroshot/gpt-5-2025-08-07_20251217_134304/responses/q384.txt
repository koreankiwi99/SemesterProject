If Eliana reduces waste or conserves resources, then she loves nature. Anthony does not have strategic vision. If Eliana works on large scale projects, then she either implements new technologies or has strategic vision (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Eliana supports conservation efforts.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Eliana is passionate, so she organizes the community and mobilizes volunteers.
- Eliana works on large scale projects and does not have strategic vision; given the XOR rule, she must implement new technologies.
- Organizing communities and implementing new technologies implies she reduces waste.
- Reducing waste implies she loves nature.
- Loving nature implies she cares for the environment and develops sustainable solutions.

However, there is no rule given that caring for the environment, developing sustainable solutions, or reducing waste implies supporting conservation efforts. No statement directly asserts or denies that Eliana supports conservation efforts. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
