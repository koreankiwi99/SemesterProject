==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Sweetsie loves her colony and has a strong stinger. By “All bees that love their colony and have a strong stinger will protect their hive,” Sweetsie protects her hive.
- By “Any bee that protects its hive will sting when threatened,” Sweetsie stings when threatened.
- There is no rule implying Sweetsie never stings; the “never sting” conditional applies only to Anderson.
- Since “stings when threatened” and “never stings” cannot both be true, and the first is true, exactly one holds.

ANSWER: True
