Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Devin loves water, so he enjoys boating.
- Enjoys boating implies exactly one of fisherman or work-on-cruise; given he does not work on a cruise, he must become a fisherman.
- Passion for the ocean implies exactly one of marine biologist or fisherman; since he is a fisherman, he is not a marine biologist.
- He enjoys surfing and has a beach house; by the exclusive condition, he does not live in a coastal town.
- Since he must live in a coastal town or grew up by the sea, and he does not live in a coastal town, he grew up by the sea.
- Growing up by the sea implies exactly one of marine biologist or coastal steward; since he is not a marine biologist, he must be a coastal steward.

Therefore, the statement “Devin does not become a coastal steward” is false.

ANSWER: False

Result:
==================================================
