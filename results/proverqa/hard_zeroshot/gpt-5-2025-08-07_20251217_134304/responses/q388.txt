Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Trenton values inclusion. Aarav values inclusion. Aarav has intuition or is an effective diplomat. Rafael adapts easily. If someone is open-minded, then they are culturally aware and respect traditions. Rafael respects traditions. Aarav respects traditions. Rafael speaks well. Aarav embraces change. Aarav adapts easily. For Aarav, either he adapts easily or he learns quickly, but it's not necessary that he does both. If Aarav either appreciates history or values cooperation (but not both), then he is culturally aware. If Aarav lives abroad, then he either accepts diversity or listens well, but not both. If someone accepts diversity, then they are open-minded. Anyone who values inclusion or embraces change accepts diversity. If Aarav either listens actively or seeks feedback (but not both), then he is open-minded.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Aarav is multilingual, or he is both culturally aware and an effective diplomat.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We know:
- Aarav values inclusion and embraces change.
- Anyone who values inclusion or embraces change accepts diversity. So Aarav accepts diversity.
- If someone accepts diversity, they are open-minded. So Aarav is open-minded.
- If someone is open-minded, they are culturally aware and respect traditions. Hence Aarav is culturally aware.

We also know:
- Aarav has intuition or is an effective diplomat (but this does not guarantee he is an effective diplomat).
- Nothing states Aarav is multilingual.

The statement requires: Aarav is multilingual, or he is both culturally aware and an effective diplomat.
- Multilingual: unknown.
- Effective diplomat: unknown; we only have a disjunction with intuition.
- Culturally aware: true.

Thus we cannot conclude the disjunction is true, nor can we conclude it is false (since he could be multilingual or an effective diplomat). The truth value is undetermined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
