Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jemma inspires others.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From works for a non-profit and the XOR with supports local initiatives, and given not supports local initiatives, we get provides shelter.
- Provides shelter implies empowers families or builds homes; given not empowers families, we get builds homes.
- Builds homes implies exactly one of creates communities or inspires others.
- If creates communities were false, then (designs neighborhoods XOR creates communities) would hold, implying fosters connection. With not leads by example, fosters connection implies drives social change; with not advocates for rights, that implies makes a difference, contradicting not makes a difference. Hence creates communities must be true.
- Since builds homes implies exactly one of creates communities or inspires others, and creates communities is true, inspires others must be false.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
