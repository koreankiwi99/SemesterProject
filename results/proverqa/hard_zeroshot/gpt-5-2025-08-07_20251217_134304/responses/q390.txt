==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From “Thiago does not analyze statistical data” and “Thiago either conducts in-depth research or analyzes statistical data, but not both,” we get: conducts in-depth research (IDR) is true.
- From “Thiago either tells human stories or conducts in-depth research, but not both,” and IDR true, we get: tells human stories (H) is false.
- From “Thiago tells human stories or is a photojournalist,” with H false, we get: photojournalist (PJ) is true.
- From “If Thiago is a photojournalist, then he either exposes social injustice or captures real-life stories, but not both,” we get exactly one of exposes social injustice (ESI) or captures real-life stories (CRS) is true.
- From “If a person documents humanitarian issues and captures real-life stories, then they raise global awareness,” and “Thiago does not raise global awareness,” we get: not both documents humanitarian issues (DHI) and CRS can be true.
  - If CRS is true, then DHI must be false.
  - If CRS is false, DHI is unconstrained (could be true or false).
- No other given statements determine whether CRS is true or false, so we cannot conclusively determine DHI.

Conclusion: It is not determined that Thiago does not document humanitarian issues.
