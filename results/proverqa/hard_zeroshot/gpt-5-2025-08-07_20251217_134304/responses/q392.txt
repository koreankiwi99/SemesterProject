Question ID: 392
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Anastasia studies wildlife, then she either educates others or advocates conservation (or both). If Anastasia lives near water, then she either documents habitats or studies wildlife (or both). If Anastasia pursues scientific research, then she either advocates conservation or supports local communities (but not both). Anastasia supports local communities. Anastasia meditates often. If Anastasia meditates often, then she has spiritual connections. Anastasia does not document habitats. Anyone who finds inner peace either follows their life passion or has spiritual connections (or both). Anastasia either educates others or protects the environment, or she may do both. Anastasia is either an entomologist or has spiritual connections, but not both. If someone shares knowledge, then they will educate other people. If Anastasia works outdoors, then she either protects the environment or respects ecosystems (but not both). Anastasia lives near water. Anastasia pursues scientific research.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Anastasia either protects the environment or appreciates nature (or both).

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From lives near water and not documenting habitats: Lives near water -> (documents habitats or studies wildlife). Since not documenting habitats, she studies wildlife.
- From studies wildlife: She either educates others or advocates conservation. From scientific research -> (advocates conservation xor supports local communities), and given she supports local communities, she does not advocate conservation. Therefore, she educates others.
- From meditates often -> has spiritual connections. Combined with "either entomologist or has spiritual connections, but not both," she is not an entomologist.

No given rule links any of these facts to "protects the environment" or to "appreciates nature." The statement "either educates others or protects the environment (or both)" does not entail that she protects the environment, since we already know she educates others and the disjunction is inclusive. There is also no information about "appreciates nature."

Therefore, we cannot determine whether she protects the environment or appreciates nature.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
