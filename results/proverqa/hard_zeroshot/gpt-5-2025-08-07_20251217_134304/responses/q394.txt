Context:
If a drag queen becomes a star, then they earn fans. Sweetness has stage presence. For all drag queens, if a drag queen is talented, then they have a charismatic stage presence or are inspiring to the audience (or both). Sweetness does not gain recognition. If Sweetness expresses himself freely and loves the spotlight, then he becomes a star. Sweetness does not earn fans. Every drag queen who performs drag either has a charismatic stage presence or has artistic flair (or both). Sweetness does not interact with the audience. If Sweetness crafts his own style, then he designs his own costumes. Every drag queen either interacts with the audience or performs with confidence, but not both is not explicitly stated. If Sweetness either chooses his own wigs or styles his own hair (but not both), then he creates his own persona. Every drag queen who performs with confidence either creates their own persona or designs their own costumes (or both). If a drag queen has artistic vision, then they take risks on stage and love the spotlight. Sweetness is not inspiring to the audience. Sweetness does not experiment with makeup. If Sweetness either creates his own persona or experiments with makeup (but not both), then he is able to express himself freely. A drag queen either has a charismatic stage presence or designs their own costumes, but not necessarily both. If Sweetness either loves the spotlight or has stage presence (but not both), then he gains recognition.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sweetness is a talented drag queen.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Sweetness has stage presence (SP) and does not gain recognition (¬GR). From the rule “XOR(loves spotlight, stage presence) ⇒ gains recognition,” SP ∧ ¬GR implies the XOR antecedent is false, so loves the spotlight (LS) must also be true.

- If Sweetness were a drag queen (DQ), then from “DQ ∧ star ⇒ earns fans” and ¬fans, we get ¬star. Given LS and the rule “expresses freely (EF) ∧ LS ⇒ star,” it follows that EF must be false if DQ.

- Also, with DQ and “either interact or perform with confidence,” and given ¬interacts, Sweetness would perform with confidence, which implies “creates persona (CrP) or designs costumes (DC).” Since ¬EM (does not experiment with makeup) and “XOR(CrP, EM) ⇒ EF,” CrP would imply EF, contradicting ¬EF. Hence, under DQ, CrP is false and DC is true.

- None of this yields that Sweetness is talented. The only talent rule is “DQ ∧ talented ⇒ (charismatic stage presence (CSP) ∨ inspiring),” and since ¬inspiring, talent would imply CSP; but neither DQ nor CSP is derivable. There is no rule that forces talent, nor any contradiction that rules it out.

Therefore, whether Sweetness is a talented drag queen cannot be determined from the given information.
