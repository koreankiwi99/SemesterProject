Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Snookums does not have diverse relationships.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Snookums thrives in groups, so she is social. Given the exclusive-or rule for social cats and that she does not have a lone habitat, she must live with others.
- Living with others implies she either shares affection or forms strong ties; since she does not form strong ties, she must share affection (not necessarily with multiple others).
- Snookums dominates a harem and is stated to form strong alliances; by the given XOR, she therefore does not have multiple partners.
- From (mates with others or forms multiple bonds) -> multiple partners and the fact she does not have multiple partners, we get that she neither mates with others nor forms multiple bonds.
- The only rule involving diverse relationships is: if polyandrous, then multiple partners or diverse relationships. We do not know that Snookums is polyandrous (the rule that could lead to polyandry requires “shares affection with multiple others,” which is not established).
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether Snookums has diverse relationships or not.

ANSWER: Uncertain
