Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kartier is selfless.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Kartier does not participate in volunteer work, and “donates or volunteers, but not both” implies Kartier donates to charity.
- If Kartier donates, then exactly one of {generous, selfish} is true.
- Kartier takes calculated risks and does not exhibit resilience. The rule “XOR(takes risks, faces challenges) -> resilience” forces XOR to be false; with takes risks true, this means faces challenges is true.
- “XOR(faces challenges, positive impact)” with faces challenges true implies Kartier does not have a positive impact.
- If Kartier were generous, then she would make a difference; combined with “puts others first,” she would be appreciated; being appreciated implies positive impact — a contradiction. Hence, Kartier is not generous.
- Therefore, from the donation rule (exactly one of generous or selfish), Kartier must be selfish.
- Given “selfless or selfish, but not both,” selfish true implies selfless false.

ANSWER: False
