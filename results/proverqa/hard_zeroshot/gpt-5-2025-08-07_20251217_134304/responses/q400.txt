==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Zelda roams freely” and “Zelda either roams freely or lives in stables, but not both,” Zelda does not live in stables.
- “If Zelda either lives in stables or forms a herd (but not both), then she thrives in company” reduces (given not in stables) to: if she forms a herd, then she thrives in company. Since “Zelda does not thrive in company,” she does not form a herd.
- “Every horse is either solitary or has companions,” and “Zelda does not have companions” imply Zelda is solitary.
- Given “For Zelda, she is either a social animal or a solitary creature, but not both,” solitary implies she is not social.
- From “If Zelda either forms a herd or forms a strong bond with humans (but not both), then she is a social animal,” the contrapositive gives: if she is not social, then it is not the case that exactly one of (forms a herd, forms a strong bond) holds. Since she does not form a herd, it follows she also does not form a strong bond with humans.
- From “If Zelda either has a gentle nature or an aggressive nature (but not both), then she forms a strong bond with humans,” the contrapositive yields: if she does not form a strong bond, then it is not the case that exactly one of (gentle, aggressive) holds. Given “Zelda has an aggressive nature,” this forces that she also has a gentle nature.

Therefore, the statement “Zelda does not have a gentle nature” is false.
