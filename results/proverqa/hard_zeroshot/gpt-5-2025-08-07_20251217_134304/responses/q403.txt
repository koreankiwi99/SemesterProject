Question ID: 403
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Every vulture either consumes remains or eats carrion (or both). If Peyton thrives alone, then she has a strong stomach and is adaptable. All vultures that track carrion have a keen sense of smell. If Peyton flies high, then she either dives steeply or soars effortlessly, but not both. Jonathan either soars effortlessly or tracks carrion, but not both at the same time. Franco dives steeply. Peyton either hunts preys or eats carrion. Peyton either soars effortlessly or tracks carrion, but not both at the same time. Peyton flies high. If Jonathan flies high, then she either dives steeply or soars effortlessly, but not both. All vultures that eat carrion have strong stomachs. Every vulture either scans the open plains or consumes remains, but not necessarily both. Peyton scans the open plains. Peyton dives steeply. Jonathan scans the open plains. If Franco has either a strong stomach or a keen sense of smell (but not both), then she is an effective scavenger. Every vulture either rides the wind or soars effortlessly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Peyton is an effective scavenger.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Peyton flies high, and for Peyton, flying high implies exactly one of dives steeply or soars effortlessly. Given Peyton dives steeply, she does not soar effortlessly.
- Peyton either soars effortlessly or tracks carrion, but not both. Since she does not soar effortlessly, she tracks carrion.
- All vultures that track carrion have a keen sense of smell. Therefore, Peyton has a keen sense of smell.
- Whether Peyton eats carrion (which would give her a strong stomach) is not determined; she could instead consume remains.
- The only rule linking traits to being an effective scavenger is specific to Franco. There is no rule that makes Peyton an effective scavenger based on her traits.

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Peyton is an effective scavenger.

ANSWER: Uncertain
