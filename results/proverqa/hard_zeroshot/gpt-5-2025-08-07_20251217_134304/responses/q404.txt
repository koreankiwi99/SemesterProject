Question ID: 404
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Julian has hidden talents, then he is either organized or creates new opportunities (or both). Julian does not avoid risks. Julian does not read widely. Julian is either curious or avoids risks, but not both. Samson overcomes challenges. Milana does not read widely. If Julian either values knowledge or pursues discovery (but not both), then he is a passionate researcher. All humans with curiosity value knowledge and respect history. If Julian pursues discovery or reads widely, then he will make new breakthroughs. Everyone who has an inquisitive nature will pursue discovery. If someone keeps things tidy and finds the resources they need, then they can achieve success. If Julian has clear goals, then he either works efficiently or finds the resources he needs, but not both. Julian overcomes challenges. Julian does not make new breakthroughs. If Julian is a passionate researcher, then he finds the resources he needs and overcomes challenges. Julian does not achieve success. If Julian is dedicated to his field, then he is a passionate researcher. If Milana either values knowledge or pursues discovery (but not both), then he is a passionate researcher. Everyone who analyzes data either draws conclusions or respects history (or both). Milana loves learning. Julian is either organized or disorganized, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Julian is disorganized.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Julian does not avoid risks" and "Julian is either curious or avoids risks, but not both," we get that Julian is curious.
- Curiosity implies Julian values knowledge and respects history.
- "If Julian pursues discovery or reads widely, then he will make new breakthroughs," but Julian does not read widely and does not make new breakthroughs, so he does not pursue discovery.
- Since Julian values knowledge and does not pursue discovery, the XOR condition holds, so he is a passionate researcher.
- Passionate researcher implies he finds the resources he needs and overcomes challenges.
- With "If someone keeps things tidy and finds the resources they need, then they can achieve success" and Julian not achieving success, given that he does find resources, it follows that he does not keep things tidy.
- However, there is no rule connecting "organized/disorganized" with "keeps things tidy" in the given statements.
- We only know "Julian is either organized or disorganized, but not both." Without a link between organization and tidiness, we cannot determine which side of the XOR holds.

Conclusion: The information does not determine whether Julian is disorganized.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
