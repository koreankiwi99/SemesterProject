Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- River gets distracted and does not find new interests, so by the rule “distracted -> (vivid imagination or finds new interests),” he must have a vivid imagination.
- Vivid imagination implies: excels in art XOR excels in music.
- River does not plan ahead, and “acts spontaneously XOR plans ahead,” so he acts spontaneously.
- Reflective implies: critical thinker XOR spontaneous actor. Since he is spontaneous, he is not a critical thinker.
- “Speaks fluently XOR thinks critically” then gives: speaks fluently (since he’s not a critical thinker).
- If someone writes well AND speaks fluently, they express themselves effectively. River cannot express himself effectively, and he speaks fluently, so he does not write well.
- Creative implies: writes well XOR excels in art. Since he does not write well, he excels in art.
- From (excels in art XOR excels in music) and excels in art, it follows that he does not excel in music.
