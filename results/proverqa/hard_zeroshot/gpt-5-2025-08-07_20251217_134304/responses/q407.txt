Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Zane does not build a loyal following.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Zane is not comfortable on stage. He performs publicly, and performing implies stage fright or comfort. So he must have stage fright.
- Having stage fright and the XOR condition with entertaining implies Zane is not entertaining.
- Zane is charismatic, and charismatic implies funny XOR entertaining. Since he’s not entertaining, he must be funny.
- If Zane is funny, then exactly one of gaining popularity or building a loyal following is true (XOR).
- If Zane is talented, then he gains popularity. But we only know Zane either works hard or is talented; we cannot conclude he is talented.
- Therefore, we cannot determine whether he gains popularity or instead builds a loyal following.

ANSWER: Uncertain
