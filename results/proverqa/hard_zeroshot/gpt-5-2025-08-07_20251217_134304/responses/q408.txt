==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- If Jaxton values science, then he either loves learning or values critical thinking, but not both.
- We are told Jaxton does not love learning and does not value critical thinking. Therefore, the condition required by “values science” is impossible, so Jaxton does not value science.
- Given “Jaxton is either passionate about astronomy or values science,” and we have just shown he does not value science, it follows that Jaxton is passionate about astronomy.
- If Jaxton is passionate about astronomy, then he will make groundbreaking discoveries. Hence, Jaxton makes groundbreaking discoveries.

Therefore, the statement “Jaxton does not make groundbreaking discoveries” is false.

ANSWER: False
