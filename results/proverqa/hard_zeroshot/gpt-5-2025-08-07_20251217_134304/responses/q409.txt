Question ID: 409
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Ellie either mentors young artists or inspires future generations (but not both), then she leaves a lasting legacy. If Ellie either creates original work or leaves a lasting legacy (but not both), then she achieves timeless fame. Ellie will not broaden her horizons. Ellie pursues artistic excellence. Ellie earns critical acclaim or achieves recognition. Ellie did not create an original work. Ellie does not achieve timeless fame. If someone becomes culturally influential and pursues artistic excellence, then they will inspire future generations. When someone studies abroad, they will broaden their horizons. Ellie does not mentor young artists. If Ellie masters a foreign language or achieves recognition, then she will become culturally influential.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ellie is not a world-class opera singer.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Given not timeless fame and not creating original work, the XOR rule implies Ellie does not leave a lasting legacy.
- Given not leaving a lasting legacy and not mentoring young artists, the XOR rule implies Ellie does not inspire future generations.
- Given she pursues artistic excellence and “culturally influential AND pursues excellence -> inspires,” her not inspiring implies she is not culturally influential.
- Given “masters a foreign language OR achieves recognition -> culturally influential,” her not being culturally influential implies she neither masters a foreign language nor achieves recognition.
- Given “earns critical acclaim OR achieves recognition” and not achieving recognition, she earns critical acclaim.
- Given “studies abroad -> broadens horizons” and she does not broaden horizons, she does not study abroad.

None of the premises or deductions address whether Ellie is a world-class opera singer. No logical link is provided between any derived facts and being a world-class opera singer.
