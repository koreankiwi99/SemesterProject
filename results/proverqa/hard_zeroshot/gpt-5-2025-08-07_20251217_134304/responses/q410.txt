Question ID: 410
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Elianna either specializes in microbiology or is environmentally conscious, but not necessarily both. If Rosalie conducts lab research, then she has a PhD and collaborates with peers. Elianna either cares about nature or is environmentally conscious. If Elianna investigates microorganisms or analyzes plant samples, then she can examine fungal behavior. If Elianna has a PhD, then she either publishes academic papers or develops new treatments, but not both. If Elianna researches plant diseases, then she either examines fungal behavior or studies water molds (but not both). Elianna does not publish academic papers. If Elianna studies water molds, then she specializes in microbiology. If Elianna investigates downy mildew or examines crop pathogens, then she studies water molds. If Rosalie has a PhD, then she either publishes academic papers or develops new treatments, but not both. If Elianna conducts lab research, then she has a PhD and collaborates with peers. Elianna conducts lab research. Elianna either develops new treatments or examines fungal behavior, but not both. Elianna is either environmentally conscious or innovative (or both). Elianna researches plant diseases.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Elianna is innovative.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Elianna conducts lab research ⇒ she has a PhD.
- With a PhD and not publishing, she must develop new treatments.
- From the exclusive-or (develops new treatments XOR examines fungal behavior), she does not examine fungal behavior.
- Researching plant diseases implies (examines fungal behavior XOR studies water molds); since she doesn’t examine fungal behavior, she studies water molds.
- Studying water molds ⇒ she specializes in microbiology.

None of these determine whether she is environmentally conscious. The statement “Elianna is either environmentally conscious or innovative (or both)” allows two consistent possibilities:
- If she is environmentally conscious, she need not be innovative.
- If she is not environmentally conscious, then she must be innovative.

Therefore, whether she is innovative cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
