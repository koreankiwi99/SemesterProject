Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Zora is not skilled with tools.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- The only direct information about Zora’s tool ability is: “Zora is either skilled with tools or inept with tools, but not both” (exclusive-or). So exactly one of the two holds, but we are not told which.
- The rule “If Zora needs training and is inept with tools, then she will avoid projects” does not help, because we cannot establish that Zora needs training.
- No other premises link Zora’s traits (perfectionist, self-taught, not formally educated, etc.) to being skilled or inept with tools.
- Although there are other contradictions in the knowledge base (e.g., about excelling professionally), none resolves whether she is skilled or inept with tools.

Therefore, whether “Zora is not skilled with tools” holds cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
