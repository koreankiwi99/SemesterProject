Question ID: 412
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Everly is not disciplined. All horses that do cross-country either have good agility or are athletic (or both). If Everly has good coordination, then he has muscle and obeys commands. Everly listens to his rider. Everly does not perform well. Everly has good endurance. Everly competes in events. If Everly has good endurance, then he either excels in show jumping or performs dressage (but not both). If Ramona either has good reflexes or competes in events (but not both), then he has good coordination. If Everly has good breeding and an intelligent nature, then he excels in show jumping. Ramona listens to his rider. Everly either has a quick reaction or has good reflexes (or both). If Everly either has good reflexes or competes in events (but not both), then he has good coordination. If Everly either listens to his rider or obeys commands (but not both), then he is disciplined. If Everly has a good temperament, then he either responds to commands or performs dressage (or both). If Everly either clears fences or gallops long distances (but not both), then he does cross-country. Everly is not athletic. Everly does not have good agility. For all horses, if they have good balance and respond to cues, then they obey commands. Everly does not have muscle. Any horse that is strong or has good stamina performs well. If Everly has good reflexes, then he either does cross-country or performs dressage (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Everly is well-trained.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- We are told Everly is not disciplined.
- If Everly either listens to his rider or obeys commands (but not both), then he is disciplined. Since Everly listens to his rider, to avoid the exclusive-or antecedent being true (which would make him disciplined), he must also obey commands. Hence, Everly both listens to his rider and obeys commands.
- Additional deductions (not essential to the query): From not having muscle and the rule “if good coordination then muscle and obeys,” we infer Everly does not have good coordination. Given he competes in events and the rule about exclusive-or with good reflexes implying coordination, he must have good reflexes. This, together with endurance and the agility/athletic constraints, yields that he performs dressage and does not do cross-country.
- However, the property “well-trained” is never defined or linked to any of the given predicates (disciplined, obeys commands, listens to rider, etc.). Therefore, we cannot determine its truth value from the provided information.

ANSWER: Uncertain
