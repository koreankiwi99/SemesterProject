- Shelby tends to a garden, so she cultivates an orchard. She does not raise livestock; thus exactly one of (raise livestock, cultivate orchard) holds, making her a farm owner.
- As a farm owner, she either grows her own crops or has food storage, but not both. Since she grows her own crops, she does not have food storage.
- Shelby is self-sufficient, hence lives off the land. Anyone who lives off the land is either prepared for emergencies or has food storage. Since she does not have food storage, she must be prepared for emergencies.
