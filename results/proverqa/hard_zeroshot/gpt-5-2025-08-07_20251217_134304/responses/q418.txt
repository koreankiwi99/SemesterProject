==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- A funds research and does not develop new treatments. Since (funds XOR develops) implies combats serious diseases, A combats serious diseases.
- Combats serious diseases implies advocates for patients’ rights or gains international recognition. Given A does not gain international recognition, A advocates for patients’ rights.
- Advocates for patients’ rights iff not pioneering a breakthrough, so A does not pioneer a breakthrough.
- Receiving a noble award implies (dedicated to cancer research XOR pioneers a breakthrough). With not pioneering, A is dedicated to cancer research.
- Dedicated to cancer research implies (makes groundbreaking discoveries XOR improves patients’ lives).
- A does not contribute to medicine, but (contributes to medicine or makes groundbreaking discoveries) holds; hence A makes groundbreaking discoveries.
- Therefore, by the XOR above, A does not improve patients’ lives.

ANSWER: True
