- From "Hunter does not use bait" and "Hunter uses bait or knows ictiobus," conclude Hunter knows ictiobus.
- With "Hunter does not understand currents" and "If he knows ictiobus, then he either reads the water or understands currents, but not both," conclude he reads the water.
- From "Hunter is not skilled" and "If he can read the water, then he is either skilled or experienced, but not both," conclude he is experienced.
- From "Hunter knows the river" and "If he knows the river, then he either has experience or catches fish, but not both," and since he is experienced, conclude he does not catch fish.
- From "Hunter either catches fish or is successful," and since he does not catch fish, conclude he is successful.

Thus he is not unsuccessful. Moreover, whether he is a fisherman is not established; even if he were, he would be successful, not unsuccessful.
