Context:
If Matias makes mistakes, then he either admits fault or takes responsibility, but not both. Matias avoids blame. Diamond does not respect others. Grrl avoids blame. If Matias craves attention, then he will seek public recognition. If Matias keeps his promises, then he will either build a strong reputation or earn the respect of others, but not both. Matias makes mistakes. If Matias either seeks public recognition or values his privacy (but not both), then he is confident. Diamond is not confident. Matias does not respect others. Matias is accountable. If someone builds a strong reputation, they may not necessarily seek public recognition, and vice versa. Matias values his privacy. If Matias leads by example, then he will either build a strong reputation or inspire others, but not both. Matias either admits fault or avoids blame, but does not do both. If Grrl makes mistakes, then he either admits fault or takes responsibility, but not both. If Seven acts with integrity, then he will either earn the respect of others or gain their trust, but not both. If Matias takes responsibility, then he either has integrity or is accountable, but not both. Grrl is accountable. If Grrl either seeks public recognition or values his privacy (but not both), then he is confident. If Grrl keeps his promises, then he will either build a strong reputation or earn the respect of others, but not both. Matias learns from errors or admits fault. Seven either keeps promises or prioritizes his own self-interest, but he does not consistently do both. Seven either admits fault or avoids blame, but does not do both. Matias either keeps promises or prioritizes his own self-interest, but he does not consistently do both. If Diamond takes responsibility, then he either has integrity or is accountable, but not both. If Matias either respects others or prioritizes his own self-interest, then he has integrity. Grrl makes mistakes. Grrl does not act with integrity. All individuals with moral values make ethical choices and keep their promises. Matias is not confident.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Matias does not gain the trust of others.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Matias avoids blame and, by the XOR rule with admitting fault, does not admit fault. Since he makes mistakes, the XOR rule implies he takes responsibility.
- Taking responsibility implies (integrity XOR accountability). Given he is accountable, he does not have integrity.
- From (respects others OR prioritizes self-interest) -> integrity and not integrity, conclude he neither respects others nor prioritizes self-interest. With XOR (keeps promises XOR self-interest), he keeps his promises.
- Keeping promises implies (builds reputation XOR earns respect). No rule here mentions trust.
- He values privacy and is not confident. From (public recognition XOR privacy) -> confident and not confident, it follows the XOR antecedent is false; since privacy is true, public recognition must also be true. Still, no rule links this to trust.
- The only trust-related rule concerns Seven, not Matias.

There is no given rule that entails Matias gains trust, nor any that entails he cannot gain trust. Therefore, the statement cannot be determined from the information.
