Question ID: 422
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Samantha encounters failure. Samantha is dedicated. Anyone who excels in their craft will build a reputation. If Samantha either sets goals or tracks progress (but not both), then she puts in persistent effort. If Samantha works hard, then she either gets mentorship or acquires expertise (or both) in her field. If Samantha is dedicated, then she is self-taught and learns quickly. Samantha excels in her craft. If Samantha faces challenges, then she develops resilience and puts in persistent effort. If Samantha encounters failure, then she either stays motivated or becomes discouraged (but not both). If Samantha is self-taught, then she can either gain recognition for her skills or acquire expertise in her field, but not both. Samantha faces challenges. If Samantha puts in persistent effort, then she can either acquire expertise in her field or build a reputation for her skills, but not both. Samantha finds solutions or develops resilience. Samantha becomes discouraged.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Samantha does not gain recognition for her skills.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Samantha is dedicated ⇒ she is self-taught. So ST is true.
- Being self-taught ⇒ exactly one of {Recognition, Expertise} is true.
- Samantha faces challenges ⇒ she puts in persistent effort (PE is true).
- Samantha excels ⇒ she builds a reputation (BuildRep is true).
- With PE true ⇒ exactly one of {Expertise, BuildRep} is true. Since BuildRep is true, Expertise must be false.
- From ST’s exclusivity and Expertise false ⇒ Recognition must be true.

Therefore, it is false that Samantha does not gain recognition.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
