Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Jase pursues personal gain and “PPG XOR POF” ⇒ POF is false.
- Jase holds authority and “HA ⇒ (PS XOR POF)” with POF false ⇒ PS is true.
- Jase supports others and does not make tough calls ⇒ (MTC XOR SO) is true ⇒ Jase is a leader.
- Leader ⇒ (AS XOR PS); with PS true ⇒ AS is false.
- Jase faces danger and “FD ⇒ (AS or AR)”; with AS false ⇒ AR is true.
- “AR XOR C” ⇒ C is false.
- “C XOR Cow” ⇒ Cow is true.

Therefore, Jase is cowardly.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
