Question ID: 426
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Raya formed in ancient times, then she holds historical value. Raya does not have vibrant colors. Every mineral is either found underground or valued by geologists. If Raya forms by pressure, then she has vibrant colors or occurs in layers (or both). If Raya either formed deeply or contains ancient secrets (but not both), then she holds historical value. Raya either holds historical value or has aesthetic appeal, but not both. If Raya either forms slowly or is created under heat (but not both), then she contains ancient secrets. Raya does not remain hidden. Any mineral found underground remains hidden until discovered. Raya either forms by pressure or has aesthetic appeal. Raya did not form deeply. Any mineral that occurs in caves or exists in igneous rocks is formed naturally. Raya does not occur in layers. Every mineral that is valued by geologists either formed naturally or contains ancient secrets. Raya forms under pressure if she is a metamorphic mineral.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Raya is rare, then she has unique properties and leads to groundbreaking discoveries.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From not vibrant colors and not occurring in layers, and the rule “if forms by pressure then vibrant colors or layers,” we get that Raya does not form by pressure.
- From “pressure or aesthetic appeal,” we conclude Raya has aesthetic appeal.
- From the XOR “historical value or aesthetic appeal,” we conclude Raya does not hold historical value; thus by contrapositive of “if formed in ancient times then historical value,” she did not form in ancient times.
- From the XOR rule “(formed deeply) XOR (contains ancient secrets) implies historical value,” together with not historical value and not formed deeply, we infer she does not contain ancient secrets.
- Other mineral-related rules do not establish anything about being rare, having unique properties, or leading to groundbreaking discoveries.

No premise mentions rarity, unique properties, or groundbreaking discoveries, nor do the derived facts imply or contradict them. The antecedent “Raya is rare” is neither entailed nor refuted, and the consequent is unrelated to the given information. Therefore, the truth of the conditional cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
