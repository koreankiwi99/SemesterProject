Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Koda is valuable for research because it has a distinct pattern. If Koda either prefers shaded areas or tolerates fertilizers (but not both), then it thrives in a greenhouse. For all orchids, if an orchid has star shaped blooms and grows in tropical climates, then it has a distinct pattern. Koda does not require high humidity. If Koda either requires high humidity or needs filtered light (but not both), then it thrives in a greenhouse. Koda either produces small buds or has unique colors. Koda requires warm temperatures. Koda does not produce small flowers. If Samir either requires high humidity or needs filtered light (but not both), then it thrives in a greenhouse. Any orchid that has a thin stem or requires specialized care is delicate. If Koda is an endangered orchid, then it has either a distinct pattern or large blooms, but not both. Koda is an endangered orchid. Samir is valuable for research because it has a distinct pattern. If Arianna either needs filtered light or requires warm temperatures (but not both), then it will blossom frequently. If Marigold is an endangered orchid, then it has either a distinct pattern or large blooms, but not both. Arianna is not low maintenance. Marigold is an endangered orchid. Samir does not produce small flowers. Koda is not low maintenance. Arianna is either an orchid that thrives in a greenhouse or has unique colors, but not both. Koda is either delicate or has unique colors, but not both. Koda is either an orchid that thrives in a greenhouse or has unique colors, but not both. Koda does not have large blooms. If Koda either needs filtered light or requires warm temperatures (but not both), then it will blossom frequently. Samir does not have large blooms. Arianna requires warm temperatures. If Koda either blossoms frequently or produces small flowers (but not both), then it is low maintenance.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Koda is rare.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We know many properties about Koda (endangered, has a distinct pattern, does not have large blooms, needs filtered light, thrives in a greenhouse, not low maintenance, does not blossom frequently, does not produce small flowers, produces small buds, delicate, and lacks unique colors). However, no statement links any of these properties (including being endangered) to being rare, and “rare” is never mentioned or defined.

Therefore, whether Koda is rare cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
