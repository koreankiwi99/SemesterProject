Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Angie does not share her expertise and does not adapt traditions. From “If Angie values her cultural heritage, then she either shares her expertise or adapts traditions,” it follows that Angie does not value her cultural heritage.
- By the exclusive-or “Angie either has a unique perspective or values her cultural heritage, but not both,” Angie must have a unique perspective. Unique perspective implies thinking outside the box.
- Angie does not respect tradition. From the exclusive-or “either loves experimenting or respects tradition, but not both,” she must love experimenting.
- Thinking outside the box and loving experimenting implies Angie is creative. Creative implies she is passionate about cooking and self-taught.
- Angie is talented. From “talented → enjoys baking XOR passionate,” and since she is passionate, she does not enjoy baking.
- From “prefers savory XOR enjoys baking,” and since she does not enjoy baking, she prefers savory (consistent with given).
- Nowhere is “successful chef” defined or linked to these traits. No rule allows concluding she is (or is not) a successful chef.
