Question ID: 432
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Elsie is a misinformation spreader. If someone is a reliable informer, then they are trustworthy. Elsie fact-checks her posts. Elsie is responsible if she cites references. If someone shares the truth and respects others' opinions, then they are trustworthy. Elsie either engages her audience or creates quality content. If someone values accuracy, then they create quality content. If Elsie verifies facts or is trustworthy, then she is respected online. Elsie does not have moral integrity. If Elsie is either a credible source or a misinformation spreader (but not both), then she is a reliable informer. If Elsie creates quality content and is respected online, then she has moral integrity. Elsie is not responsible. If someone either fact-checks their posts or cites references (but not both), then they value accuracy.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Elsie is not a credible source.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Elsie is responsible if she cites references" (C -> Resp) and "Elsie is not responsible" (¬Resp), conclude she does not cite references (¬C).
- Given "Elsie fact-checks her posts" (F) and ¬C, the exclusive-or rule (F ⊕ C) implies she values accuracy (V).
- From "If someone values accuracy, then they create quality content" (V -> Q), conclude Elsie creates quality content (Q).
- Assume for contradiction that Elsie is not a credible source (¬Credible). Since she is a misinformation spreader (M), the exclusive-or (Credible ⊕ M) holds, so she is a reliable informer (R), hence trustworthy (T).
- From "If Elsie verifies facts or is trustworthy, then she is respected online" (T suffices), conclude she is respected online (Rso).
- With Q and Rso, "If Elsie creates quality content and is respected online, then she has moral integrity" gives moral integrity (MI), contradicting "Elsie does not have moral integrity" (¬MI).

Thus ¬Credible leads to a contradiction; Elsie must be credible. Therefore, the statement "Elsie is not a credible source" is false.

ANSWER: False
