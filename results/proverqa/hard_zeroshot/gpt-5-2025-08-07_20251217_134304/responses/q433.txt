Question ID: 433
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Shiloh pursues her personal goals. Shiloh does not have good intentions. Anyone who works hard or learns quickly can gain experience. If someone makes a difference and inspires others, then they can improve their community. Shiloh inspires others. Shiloh either pursues her personal goals or enhances the lives of others, but these two pursuits can be mutually exclusive. Anyone who has experience or is educated can make a difference. Everyone has skills or makes a difference. Anyone who volunteers regularly or improves their community can enhance the lives of others. Everyone either has good intentions or gains knowledge, but these two are not necessarily related. If Shiloh either reads books or attends seminars (but not both), then she gains knowledge. Shiloh is selfless or educated (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Shiloh is selfless.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- We know Shiloh pursues her personal goals and does not have good intentions.
- From “everyone either has good intentions or gains knowledge,” and since Shiloh lacks good intentions, she gains knowledge. This does not imply she is educated.
- The only direct information about selflessness is: “Shiloh is selfless or educated (or both).” There is no rule that lets us infer she is educated, nor any rule that rules out her being educated.
- The statements about inspiring others, making a difference, improving the community, and enhancing lives do not establish selflessness, nor do they preclude it.
- The “either pursues personal goals or enhances lives” clause does not establish exclusivity (it says they can be mutually exclusive, not that they are), and there is no rule linking enhancing lives to being selfless.

Therefore, whether Shiloh is selfless cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
