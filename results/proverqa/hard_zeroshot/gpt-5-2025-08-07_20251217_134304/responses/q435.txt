Question ID: 435
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Jackson stands out, then he is either outgoing or has charisma, but not both. If Jackson has visible scars, then he either stands out or has a distinctive voice, but not both. Katie does not wear distinctive jewelry. Jackson does not wear distinctive jewelry. Jackson does not have bright hair. Jackson is not outgoing. For any person, if they have certain genes and were exposed to x-ray, then they may have unusual marks. Jackson does not have charisma. If Jackson is identifiable, then he has visible tattoos and wears distinctive jewelry. If Jackson often attends public events, then he either has visible tattoos or wears bold clothing (but not both). Jackson has distinct palmar patterns or a rare scar (or both). If someone either has bright hair or has unusual marks (but not both), then they stand out. If Jackson has unusual marks or a rare scar, then he can be easily identifiable.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jackson does not have unique fingerprints.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- If Jackson stood out, he would be outgoing XOR charismatic. Given he’s neither, by contrapositive he does not stand out.
- If (bright hair XOR unusual marks) then stand out. Jackson doesn’t have bright hair and doesn’t stand out, so he doesn’t have unusual marks.
- If identifiable then visible tattoos AND distinctive jewelry. Jackson doesn’t wear distinctive jewelry, so he is not identifiable.
- Jackson has distinct palmar patterns or a rare scar (or both). “Distinct palmar patterns” corresponds to unique fingerprints. Nothing above rules out either disjunct, and “can be easily identifiable” from rare scar is only a possibility, not an actuality, so no contradiction.

Thus, whether Jackson lacks unique fingerprints is not determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
