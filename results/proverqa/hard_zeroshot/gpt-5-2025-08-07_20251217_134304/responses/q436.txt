Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Bitsy does not excel in competition.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Bitsy has good breeding (GB) and is not well-trained (¬WTr).
- From "If Bitsy has good breeding, then she either has powerful hind legs or is well-trained, but not both," GB implies (PHL xor WTr). With ¬WTr, this forces PHL (powerful hind legs) to be true.
- From "If Bitsy has powerful hind legs or an agile front end, then she excels in competition," having PHL implies she excels (Excels).

Therefore, it is not true that Bitsy does not excel in competition.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
