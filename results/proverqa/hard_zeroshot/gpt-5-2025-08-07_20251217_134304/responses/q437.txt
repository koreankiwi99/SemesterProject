Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Zander does not explore themes” and “Zander either explores themes or writes semi-autobiographical works,” we get S(Z) (Zander writes semi-autobiographical works).
- From S(Z) and “If Zander writes semi-autobiographical works, then he is either critically acclaimed or widely popular, but not both,” we have XOR(C(Z), W(Z)).
- From “Zander writes a novel” and the XOR rule about touching hearts or connecting with others, together with “Zander does not touch hearts,” we get K(Z). (This doesn’t directly affect acclaim but is consistent.)
- From “Zander does not evoke emotions” and “If Zander either resonates with readers or evokes emotions (but not both), then he has an authentic voice,” the antecedent simplifies to R(Z), so R(Z) -> AV(Z). Given “Zander does not have an authentic voice,” we conclude ¬R(Z).
- From “Any author who draws from their life or is widely popular will resonate with readers,” i.e., (DL ∨ W) -> R, and ¬R(Z), we infer ¬W(Z).
- With XOR(C(Z), W(Z)) and ¬W(Z), it follows that C(Z) is true.

Therefore, “Zander is not critically acclaimed” is false.

ANSWER: False
