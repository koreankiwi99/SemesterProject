==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Mae is not ambitious and (ambitious XOR selfless) holds, so Mae is selfless. With passionate and selfless mutually exclusive, Mae is not passionate.
- If Mae were successful, she would be hard-working and passionate; but Mae is not hard-working, so Mae is not successful.
- Mae faces criticism, so she is nervous. She speaks in front of a crowd, so exactly one of confident or nervous holds; since she is nervous, she is not confident.
- Mae does not sing alone and must either perform in public or sing alone, so she performs in public. Then exactly one of stage fright or confident holds; since she is not confident, she has stage fright.
- Stage fright XOR charismatic implies Mae is not charismatic.
- If (charismatic XOR talented) then successful; since Mae is not successful, (charismatic XOR talented) is false. With charismatic false, talented must also be false.
