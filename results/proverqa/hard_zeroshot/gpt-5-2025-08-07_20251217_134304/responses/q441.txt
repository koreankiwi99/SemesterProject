Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kohen serves as a carriage horse.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Kohen runs frequently. Given “(Run XOR Exercise) -> Muscular” and “Kohen does not have a muscular body,” we must have not(XOR), so Exercise is true too.
- With Eats nutritious food and Exercises, Kohen has a large build; large build implies intimidating appearance. From (Intimidating XOR Gentle), Gentle is false; from (Gentle XOR Elegant), Elegant is true.
- As a horse: (Agile or Speed) -> Athletic, and (Athletic or Endurance) -> Perform well. Kohen does not perform well and lacks endurance and speed, so he cannot be athletic; hence he is not agile. From (Agile XOR Strong), Strong is true.
- With Strong true and Elegant true, the rule “If Strong then (Carriage XOR Elegant)” forces Carriage to be false.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
