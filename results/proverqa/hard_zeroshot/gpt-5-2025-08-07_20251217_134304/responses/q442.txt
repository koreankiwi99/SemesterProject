Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From faces adversity (F) and (F ∨ SR) -> P, we get P (pursues passion).
- From challenges authority (CA) and CA -> (S ∨ T) with ¬S, we get T (takes risks).
- From ¬PC and H with (V ⊕ H) -> PC, contrapositive gives V. Then (V ∨ C) -> R yields R (respects tradition).
- From XOR(B, R) and R true, we get ¬B.
- From ¬B and (T ∧ I) -> B with T true, contrapositive gives ¬I (not influential).
- From ¬I and (P ∧ L) -> I with P true, contrapositive gives ¬L (no lasting impact).
- From A -> L and ¬L, contrapositive gives ¬A.

Therefore, Cayson does not express himself artistically.
