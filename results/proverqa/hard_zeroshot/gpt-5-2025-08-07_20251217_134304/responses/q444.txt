Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Mohammad is a master blacksmith and either forges adamantine steel or creates indestructible armor (or both).

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Mohammad attends art school, so he is a skilled artist.
- If he is a skilled artist, then exactly one of: designs elegant art (DEA) or creates functional items (CFI). Given he creates functional items, he is not a designer of elegant art.
- From the separate XOR: either DEA or creates indestructible armor (CIA), but not both. Since he is not DEA, he must create indestructible armor. Hence the disjunction “forges adamantine steel or creates indestructible armor (or both)” is satisfied via CIA.

However, nothing in the premises establishes that Mohammad is a master blacksmith (nor even that he is a skilled blacksmith). The only blacksmith-related premise is conditional on being a skilled blacksmith, which is not given. Therefore, the conjunction requiring “Mohammad is a master blacksmith” cannot be confirmed or refuted from the information provided.

ANSWER: Uncertain
