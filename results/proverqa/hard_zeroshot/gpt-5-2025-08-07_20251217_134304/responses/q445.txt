- From "Grant cannot generate innovative ideas" and "(Thinks out of the box or Solves problems differently) -> Can generate innovative ideas," we get that Grant neither thinks out of the box nor solves problems differently.
- Given "Grant follows intuition or thinks out of the box," and not thinking out of the box, Grant follows intuition.
- "Grant acts spontaneously" and "Grant is either someone who thinks freely or someone who acts spontaneously, but not both" implies Grant does not think freely.
- From "Grant either follows rules or thinks freely," and not thinking freely, Grant follows rules.
- "Grant either creates masterpieces or follows rules, but not both," and follows rules implies Grant does not create masterpieces.
- "If someone observes details closely and has creativity, then they can create masterpieces," together with Grant’s creativity and not creating masterpieces implies Grant does not observe details closely.
