Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Everyone makes sacrifices or faces adversity. Nevaeh does not act with integrity. If someone perseveres under pressure, then they have resilience and remain disciplined. If Nevaeh demonstrates bravery, then she either follows her conscience or perseveres under pressure (but not both). If someone follows their conscience, then they will act with integrity. If Nevaeh faces adversity, then she displays compassion and acts selflessly. Nevaeh does not have resilience. Gael does not have resilience. All humans who have empathy display compassion and understand others. If Nevaeh either makes sacrifices or takes risks (but not both), then she demonstrates bravery. Nevaeh does not take risks. If Gael faces adversity, then she displays compassion and acts selflessly.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Nevaeh does not show loyalty.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If someone perseveres under pressure, then they have resilience” and “Nevaeh does not have resilience,” conclude Nevaeh does not persevere under pressure.
- From “If someone follows their conscience, then they will act with integrity” and “Nevaeh does not act with integrity,” conclude Nevaeh does not follow her conscience.
- “If Nevaeh demonstrates bravery, then exactly one of {follows conscience, perseveres} holds.” Since both are false, Nevaeh does not demonstrate bravery.
- From “If (makes sacrifices XOR takes risks) then bravery” and not bravery, conclude not (makes sacrifices XOR takes risks). Given “Nevaeh does not take risks,” it follows she does not make sacrifices.
- From “Everyone makes sacrifices or faces adversity” and not sacrifices, conclude Nevaeh faces adversity.
- From “If Nevaeh faces adversity, then she displays compassion and acts selflessly,” conclude she shows compassion and selflessness.

No premises relate loyalty to integrity, conscience, compassion, selflessness, bravery, or adversity. Therefore, whether Nevaeh shows loyalty cannot be determined from the given information.
