Question ID: 447
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Anyone who enjoys outdoor activities or captures landscapes is likely to pursue nature photography. If Damir has curiosity or seeks adventure, then he will venture into the wilderness. Damir does not value conservation. Damir either preserves habitats or explores ecosystems, but not both. Damir does not contribute to environmental science. If Damir pursues nature photography, then he either ventures into the wilderness or collects plant samples (or both). If Damir ventures into the wilderness, then he will discover new species. Damir values conservation or enjoys outdoor activities. Damir preserves habitats. If Damir pursues biological research, then he either studies plant species or contributes to environmental science. If someone collects plant samples, then they appreciate nature. If Damir studies plant species, then he can become a botany expert. Damir does not appreciate nature. If Damir conducts field work, then he either collects plant samples or documents wildlife, but not both. If Damir discovers a new species, then he either explores ecosystems or pursues biological research, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Damir cannot become a botany expert.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Damir does not value conservation" and "Damir values conservation or enjoys outdoor activities," Damir enjoys outdoor activities.
- Anyone who enjoys outdoor activities or captures landscapes pursues nature photography, so Damir pursues nature photography.
- If he pursues nature photography, then he either ventures into the wilderness or collects plant samples. But since collecting plant samples implies appreciating nature and Damir does not appreciate nature, he does not collect plant samples. Therefore, he ventures into the wilderness.
- Venturing into the wilderness implies discovering a new species.
- Damir preserves habitats, and he either preserves habitats or explores ecosystems but not both, so he does not explore ecosystems.
- Discovering a new species implies he either explores ecosystems or pursues biological research, but not both. Since he does not explore ecosystems, he pursues biological research.
- Pursuing biological research implies he either studies plant species or contributes to environmental science. He does not contribute to environmental science, so he studies plant species.
- Studying plant species implies he can become a botany expert.

Therefore, it is false that Damir cannot become a botany expert.

ANSWER: False
