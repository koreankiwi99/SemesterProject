- From “Astrid either pursues peace or engages in battles, but not both” and “Astrid does not pursue peace,” we get: Astrid engages in battles.
- If Astrid engages in battles, then she either shows bravery or is fearless.
- From “If Astrid is well-trained or shows bravery, then she will win battles” and “Astrid will not win battles,” we conclude: Astrid is neither well-trained nor shows bravery. Hence, bravery is false.
