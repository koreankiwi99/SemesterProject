  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Kevin has a PhD” and “If Kevin has a PhD, then he either collects data alongside rivers or writes books (but not both)” plus “Kevin writes books,” we get: Kevin writes books (W = true) and does not collect data alongside rivers (C = false).
- Given “Kevin conducts field research” (F = true) and “If someone either conducts field research or collects data alongside rivers (but not both), then they work outdoors,” since F = true and C = false, Kevin works outdoors (O = true).
- From “If Kevin works outdoors, then he either studies marine life or has scientific interests (or both)” and “Kevin either pursues artistic passions or has scientific interests, but not both” with “Kevin pursues artistic passions,” we have H = false, so to satisfy O -> (S ∨ H), S must be true. Thus Kevin studies marine life (S = true).
- By the universal rule “if they study marine life or love birds (or both), then they care about conservation,” S = true implies Kevin cares about conservation.

ANSWER: True

Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
