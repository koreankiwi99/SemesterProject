Context:
Vance makes sound judgments. Vance is either a thrill seeker or values stability, but not both. If Vance is either impulsive or a thrill seeker (but not both), then he is a forward thinker. Anyone who plans ahead values stability. If Vance is spontaneous, then he is either adaptable or a forward thinker (but not both). Vance is not open to new experiences. Vance does not take risks. Everyone who makes sound judgments either plans ahead or thinks carefully (or both). Vance does not think carefully. If Vance is a forward thinker or open to new experiences, then he will take risks. If Vance is either impulsive or cautious (but not both), then he is innovative. If Vance travels widely or tries new things, then he is a thrill seeker. Vance is cautious.

Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Vance is innovative.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Vance makes sound judgments" and "Everyone who makes sound judgments either plans ahead or thinks carefully (or both)" plus "Vance does not think carefully," we deduce Vance plans ahead.
- Anyone who plans ahead values stability, so Vance values stability.
- Given "Vance is either a thrill seeker or values stability, but not both," and stability is true, Vance is not a thrill seeker.
- From "Vance does not take risks" and "If Vance is a forward thinker or open to new experiences, then he will take risks," we conclude Vance is not a forward thinker (and also not open, which matches the given).
- From "If Vance is either impulsive or a thrill seeker (but not both), then he is a forward thinker," with thrill seeker false, this reduces to: if impulsive then forward thinker. Since he is not a forward thinker, he is not impulsive.
- Given "Vance is cautious," and we have not impulsive, the exclusive-or condition "either impulsive or cautious (but not both)" holds.
- Therefore, by "If Vance is either impulsive or cautious (but not both), then he is innovative," Vance is innovative.
