Question ID: 451
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Lane values privacy. For anyone, valuing privacy and seeking fame are mutually exclusive. If Lane works hard, then he either gains recognition or is admired by his peers (or both). Lane is charismatic. Lane is dedicated. Lane does not achieve success. If Lane is humble, then he is either well-reputed or charismatic, but not both. If Lane is either dishonorable or has integrity, then he will have a good reputation. Lane either acts with honor or is dishonorable. For everyone, being humble and seeking fame are mutually exclusive. If Lane is admired by his peers, then he achieves success. Everyone who is dedicated is either respected or admired by their peers (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Lane is loyal.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From "Lane values privacy" and "valuing privacy and seeking fame are mutually exclusive," conclude Lane does not seek fame.
- From "If Lane is admired by his peers, then he achieves success" and "Lane does not achieve success," conclude Lane is not admired by his peers (modus tollens).
- From "Lane is dedicated" and "Everyone who is dedicated is either respected or admired by their peers," together with "Lane is not admired," conclude Lane is respected.
- Other given statements (charismatic, honor/dishonor options, possible good reputation, humility constraints) do not establish anything about loyalty.
- No rule connects any given properties to being loyal, nor rules out loyalty.

Therefore, whether Lane is loyal cannot be determined from the information provided.
