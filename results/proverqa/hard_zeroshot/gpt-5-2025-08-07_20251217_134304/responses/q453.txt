Context:
Puppy requires nurturing. Puppy does not produce nectar. If Puppy either produces nectar or emits fragrance (but not both), then it attracts pollinators. If Puppy sways gently, then it either has vibrant colors or forms a unique shape (or both). Puppy sways gently. Puppy blossoms slowly. Puppy emits fragrance. If Puppy is rarely found or blossoms slowly, then it has delicate petals. Any plant that blossoms in spring or is soft to touch has delicate petals. Puppy thrives in harsh conditions. If Puppy has vibrant colors, then it attracts pollinators and has deep roots. If Puppy requires nurturing, then it is rarely found and needs special care. If Puppy blooms seasonally, then it either grows in clusters or has vibrant colors (or both). Puppy grows in meadows. If Puppy grows in meadows, then it either forms a unique shape or has delicate petals, but not both. All plants with nectar attract pollinators. If Puppy has deep roots, then it either thrives in harsh conditions or is highly adaptable, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Puppy is highly adaptable.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From requires nurturing, Puppy is rarely found; with blossoms slowly, (rarely found or blossoms slowly) implies delicate petals.
- Growing in meadows implies unique shape XOR delicate petals; since delicate petals is true, unique shape is false.
- Sways gently implies vibrant colors or unique shape; with unique shape false, vibrant colors is true.
- Vibrant colors implies deep roots (and attracts pollinators), so deep roots is true.
- Given thrives in harsh conditions is true, and deep roots implies (thrives in harsh conditions XOR highly adaptable), the XOR forces highly adaptable to be false.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
