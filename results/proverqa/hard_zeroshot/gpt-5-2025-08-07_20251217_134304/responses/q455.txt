Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Amelie is educated or open to learning (or both).

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We know:
- Amelie pursues personal growth, so she attends workshops. From traveling frequently and the XOR rule, she does not seek new experiences.
- Amelie recognizes her own ignorance, which implies she either values knowledge or embraces criticism; she also explicitly embraces criticism. We also have “Amelie values knowledge or listens critically,” but neither yields “accepts feedback” or “explores new ideas.”
- Open to learning requires either accepting feedback or exploring new ideas. There is no rule linking “embraces criticism” to “accepts feedback,” and no basis to conclude she explores new ideas.
- Educated requires valuing intellect; there is no information that Amelie values intellect.

Thus, we cannot conclude she is educated or open to learning, nor can we conclude she is not; the truth of the statement remains undetermined.
