Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Axel joins the Bolshevik party.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From promotes justice and values human rights, Axel advocates for equality.
- Working in a factory or living in poverty only implies Axel can sympathize with workers, not that he actually does.
- Without actual sympathy with workers or evidence that he fights injustice or seeks equality, we cannot conclude he supports the proletariat.
- The two XORs imply: pursues political power iff believes in socialism, but we cannot determine which is true because “can pursue political power” does not entail “pursues political power.”
- Joining the Bolshevik party requires both believing in socialism and supporting the proletariat; neither is established.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
