Options:

  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Mallory does not have hobbies and is not well-rounded. If she either balances life or has hobbies (but not both), then she would be well-rounded. Since she doesn't have hobbies and is not well-rounded, she does not balance her life.
- Given “Mallory either balances her life or is hard-working, but not both,” and we have not balancing life, Mallory must be hard-working.
- If Mallory is hard-working, then she publishes extensively and makes new discoveries. So she publishes extensively.
- If she publishes extensively, then she is either famous or highly accomplished, but not both.
- Mallory is either respected by her peers or works independently, but not both, and she does not work independently. Therefore, she is respected by her peers.
- If she is highly accomplished, then she is passionate about her work and respected by her peers. We already know she is respected, but that does not imply she is highly accomplished; she could instead be famous (not highly accomplished).
- The term “dedicated” is not defined in the premises, nor is it linked to “hard-working” or “passionate about their work” by any rule. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether “Mallory is dedicated.”
