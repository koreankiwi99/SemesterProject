Question ID: 459
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Delilah cannot communicate complex ideas. Delilah masters algorithms if she can crack complex codes. For Delilah, either she has deep knowledge of computer systems or she can communicate complex ideas, but not necessarily both. Delilah protects sensitive data. Delilah does not develop secure protocols. If someone understands encryption and studies code patterns, then they can excel in cryptography. If Delilah works on high-profile projects, then she either has deep knowledge of computer systems or master algorithms (but not both). Anyone who excels in cryptography either identifies system vulnerabilities or develops secure protocols (or both). If Delilah passes a hacking competition, then she either wins national awards or excels in cryptography (or both). Delilah understands encryption. Delilah studies code patterns. Delilah has a proven track record. Delilah has strong problem-solving skills. If Delilah protects sensitive data, then she is either a skilled cybersecurity expert or masters algorithms (or both). If Delilah has strong problem-solving skills, then she works on high-profile projects and has a proven track record.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Delilah does not create unbreakable passwords.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Delilah cannot communicate complex ideas (¬Cci).
- From "either deep knowledge or can communicate ideas" and ¬Cci, Delilah has deep knowledge (Dk).
- Strong problem-solving skills imply she works on high-profile projects (W) and has a proven track record.
- From W and the rule that W -> (Dk XOR M), and since Dk is true, Delilah does not master algorithms (¬M).
- From "cracks complex codes -> masters algorithms," and ¬M, she cannot crack complex codes (¬Cr).
- Protects sensitive data implies either skilled cybersecurity expert or masters algorithms; since ¬M, she is a skilled cybersecurity expert (Sce).
- Understands encryption and studies code patterns implies excels in cryptography (Ec).
- Excels in cryptography implies identifies vulnerabilities or develops secure protocols; given she does not develop secure protocols (¬Dsp), she identifies vulnerabilities (Iv).

None of the premises address whether Delilah creates unbreakable passwords. No logical link allows us to infer that she does or does not create unbreakable passwords.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
