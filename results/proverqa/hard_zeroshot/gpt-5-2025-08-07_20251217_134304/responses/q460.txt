Question ID: 460
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Mohammad studies diseases, then he will work on cures. Mohammad works on cures if he has medical training. Mohammad develops practical skills. If Mohammad either reduces suffering or enhances wellbeing (but not both), then he improves human lives. If someone works on cures, then they improve human lives. Mohammad explores nature or studies diseases. Hallie does not explore nature. For Mohammad, either he develops practical skills or pursues knowledge, but not both. Mohammad does not explore nature. If Mohammad has passion, then he either pursues knowledge or makes discoveries.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Mohammad contributes to science and improves human lives.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Mohammad explores nature or studies diseases” and “Mohammad does not explore nature,” we conclude Mohammad studies diseases.
- If he studies diseases, then he works on cures; hence Mohammad works on cures.
- Anyone who works on cures improves human lives; thus Mohammad improves human lives.
- Mohammad develops practical skills, and given the “either practical skills or pursues knowledge, but not both,” he does not pursue knowledge.
- There is no information linking any of Mohammad’s established activities (studying diseases, working on cures, developing practical skills) to “contributes to science,” nor do we know he makes discoveries or has passion. Therefore, whether he contributes to science is not determined.

Since “improves human lives” is true but “contributes to science” is undetermined, the conjunction is not established.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
