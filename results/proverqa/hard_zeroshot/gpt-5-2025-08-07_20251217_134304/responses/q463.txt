==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Davis either earns acclaim or faces harsh criticism, but not both” and “Davis faces harsh criticism,” we get Not Acclaim(Davis).
- Given “Davis does not gain recognition,” both Acclaim and Recognition are false for Davis.
- From “If Davis becomes an expert, then he either earns acclaim or gains recognition, but not both,” the consequent would be false, so Davis is not an expert. By contrapositive of “If Davis studies extensively, then he will become an expert,” Davis does not study extensively.
- From “Davis either dedicates his lifework or pursues his passion” and “Davis does not pursue his passion,” Davis dedicates his lifework (but we do not know to botany).
- The only rule mentioning “inspire a new generation” applies to Emilia, not Davis. No given rule implies or denies that Davis inspires a new generation.

ANSWER: Uncertain
