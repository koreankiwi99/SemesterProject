Question ID: 467
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If a researcher uses qualitative methods, then they either collect data or identify patterns. Everyone who collects data either analyzes their findings or publishes papers (or both). If Dr. Lubber is meticulous, then he produces accurate results and gains international recognition. Dr. Lubber does not design experiments. Dr. Lubber does not make new discoveries. If Dr. Lubber achieves a breakthrough, then he either collaborates with others or develops innovative methods, but not both. Every researcher collects data or conducts thorough research. If Dr. Eren either designs experiments or develops innovative methods (but not both), then he makes new discoveries. For every researcher, they either publish papers or teach students, but not both is not necessarily true. Dr. Lubber teaches students. If Dr. Lubber either designs experiments or develops innovative methods (but not both), then he makes new discoveries. For any researcher who gains international recognition, they must conduct thorough research and develop innovative methods. Dr. Lubber does not analyze his findings. Dr. Lubber produces accurate results. Any researcher who publishes breakthroughs or leads collaborative projects can gain international recognition.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Lubber is not meticulous.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “If Dr. Lubber either designs experiments or develops innovative methods (but not both), then he makes new discoveries,” together with “Dr. Lubber does not make new discoveries” and “Dr. Lubber does not design experiments,” it follows that Dr. Lubber does not develop innovative methods.
- For any researcher who gains international recognition, they must develop innovative methods (and conduct thorough research). Since Dr. Lubber is operating in the researcher context, not developing innovative methods implies he does not gain international recognition.
- If Dr. Lubber were meticulous, then he would gain international recognition (and produce accurate results). But he does not gain international recognition. Therefore, he is not meticulous.

ANSWER: True
