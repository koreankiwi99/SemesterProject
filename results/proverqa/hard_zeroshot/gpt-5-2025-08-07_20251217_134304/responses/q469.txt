Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Jaxx inspires others and has visionary ideas, then he achieves legendary status. Jaxx does not gain worldwide recognition. Jaxx lives in a fantasy world. Jaxx is not enchanted. If Jaxx transforms objects, then he either inspires others or possesses a subtle charm. If Jaxx is inspirational, then he either brings joy or creates beautiful art. Anyone who either achieves legendary status or gains worldwide recognition is revered by their peers. If Jaxx lives in a fantasy world and has a unique ability, then he inspires others. Jaxx appreciates detail. If Jaxx is artistic, then he either thinks creatively or has good imagination, but not both. All characters who appreciate detail have a good imagination and think outside the box. Jaxx is not revered by his peers. For all fictional characters, if they have a magical gift or are enchanted, then they have a unique ability. Jaxx has visionary ideas. Any character who is skilled with their hands or has a good imagination can create beautiful art.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jaxx does not possess special powers.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From: Anyone who either achieves legendary status or gains worldwide recognition is revered. Given Jaxx is not revered and does not gain worldwide recognition, it follows that Jaxx does not achieve legendary status.
- From: If Jaxx inspires others and has visionary ideas, then he achieves legendary status. Given he has visionary ideas but does not achieve legendary status, Jaxx does not inspire others.
- From: If Jaxx lives in a fantasy world and has a unique ability, then he inspires others. Since he lives in a fantasy world but does not inspire others, he does not have a unique ability.
- From: For all fictional characters, if they have a magical gift or are enchanted, then they have a unique ability. Since Jaxx does not have a unique ability, he has neither a magical gift nor enchantment (the latter also stated directly).

Thus Jaxx lacks unique ability and magical gift, i.e., he does not possess special powers.
