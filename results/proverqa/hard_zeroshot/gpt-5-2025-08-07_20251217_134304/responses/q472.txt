Question ID: 472
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Sky does not have natural talent. If Sky is an artist, then she either tells a story or evokes emotion, but not both. Sky evokes emotion. If Sky either expresses emotion or connects with the audience (but not both), then she builds a connection. Sky does not achieve success. If someone performs with elegance and connects with the audience, then they inspire others. If Sky has passion, then she tells a story and speaks from her heart. If Sky inspires others, then she will achieve success. Sky cannot touch the hearts of others. For all humans, if they are trained in ballet or have natural talent, then they perform with elegance. Sky is an artist. Anyone who either tells a story or builds a connection can touch the hearts of others. Sky expresses emotion.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Sky is an artist” and “If Sky is an artist, then she either tells a story or evokes emotion, but not both,” together with “Sky evokes emotion,” we get: Sky does not tell a story.
- From “Anyone who either tells a story or builds a connection can touch the hearts of others” and “Sky cannot touch the hearts of others,” we infer: Sky does not tell a story (consistent) and does not build a connection.
- From “If Sky either expresses emotion or connects with the audience (but not both), then she builds a connection” and “Sky expresses emotion” plus “Sky does not build a connection,” we conclude the XOR is false; hence Sky also connects with the audience.
- From “If someone performs with elegance and connects with the audience, then they inspire others,” together with “Sky connects with the audience” and “If Sky inspires others, then she will achieve success” plus “Sky does not achieve success,” we get: Sky does not inspire others, hence she does not perform with elegance.
- From “For all humans, if they are trained in ballet or have natural talent, then they perform with elegance,” and given Sky lacks natural talent and does not perform with elegance, by contrapositive we conclude Sky is not trained in ballet.
