==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Dayana’s good listening skills and “if GL then AB xor RB,” and given Dayana can read body language, it follows Dayana does not analyze behavior.
- Dayana has critical thinking, so she understands others. Since everyone who understands others either analyzes behavior or is empathetic (or both), and Dayana does not analyze behavior, she must be empathetic.
- If empathetic, then she is either intuitive or has rational thoughts (but not both). Given Dayana is not intuitive, she must have rational thoughts.
- Dayana either has rational thoughts or is sane, but not both. Since she has rational thoughts, she is not sane.
- For every human, they are either sane or insane, but not both. Therefore, since Dayana is not sane, she is insane.
