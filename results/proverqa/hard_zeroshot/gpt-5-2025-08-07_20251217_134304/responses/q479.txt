Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Sam fosters economic growth.

Options:
  True

  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Sam has engineering skills" and "Sam either has engineering skills or designs infrastructure, but not both," we get that Sam does not design infrastructure.
- From "Sam cares about others" ⇒ Sam connects isolated areas. Thus (designs infrastructure XOR connects isolated areas) holds for Sam, so by "If Sam either designs infrastructure or connects isolated areas (but not both), then he builds bridges," Sam builds bridges.
- From "Sam succeeds in projects" ⇒ exactly one of (strengthens social bonds, empowers local residents). Given "Sam empowers local residents," it follows that Sam does not strengthen social bonds.
- From "Sam overcomes obstacles" ⇒ (unites communities or strengthens social bonds). Since he does not strengthen social bonds, he must unite communities.
- From "If Sam builds bridges, then he can either foster economic growth or unite communities, but not both," and since he unites communities, it follows that he does not foster economic growth.

ANSWER: False
