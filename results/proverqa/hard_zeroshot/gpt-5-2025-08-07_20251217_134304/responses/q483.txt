Context:
Kelly ignores rules. Hailey either harms wildlife or protects nature. Hailey studies ecology. Hailey either fosters animals or harms wildlife. If a person either exploits resources or harms the ecosystem, then they damage the planet. Hailey does not exploit resources. If Hailey studies ecology, then she either protects nature or destroys habitat, but not both. Hailey follows regulations or harms the ecosystem. Hailey either conserves wildlife or harms wildlife, but not both. If Kelly ignores rules or acts recklessly, then she will disregard waste. If Hailey disregards laws, then she either faces fines imposed upon her or litters publicly. If someone pollutes the environment, then they destroy habitats. If Kelly disregards waste, then she will litter publicly. If Hailey disregards waste, then she will litter publicly. For any person, if they either pollute the environment or litter publicly, then they harm the ecosystem. Kelly does not exploit resources. If Hailey either wastes water or emits toxins (but not both), then she pollutes the environment. If Hailey ignores rules or acts recklessly, then she will disregard waste. Kelly does not damage the planet. Alia either conserves wildlife or harms wildlife, but not both. Hailey does not damage the planet. Hailey ignores rules.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Hailey does not conserve wildlife.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From Hailey ignores rules and the given rules, we derive: disregards waste -> litters publicly -> harms the ecosystem -> damages the planet, which contradicts the premise that Hailey does not damage the planet. So the knowledge base is inconsistent on environmental harm/damage.
- Regarding wildlife status, we have: (conserves wildlife) XOR (harms wildlife). We also have disjunctions such as (harms wildlife OR protects nature) and (fosters animals OR harms wildlife), but none force either conserves wildlife or harms wildlife to hold specifically.
- There are no rules linking the derived contradictions about ecosystem/damage to Hailey’s conserving/harms wildlife choice.
- Hence, whether Hailey conserves wildlife cannot be determined from the premises.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
