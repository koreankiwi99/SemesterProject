Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Kelly loses arguments. From “Kelly either wins cases or loses arguments, but not both,” she does not win cases.
- From “If Kelly is either confident in her speech or passionate, then she wins her cases,” and the fact she does not win cases, it follows that she neither speaks confidently nor is passionate.
- Kelly does not have strong convictions. From “If someone achieves their goals, then they are confident and have strong convictions,” contrapositive gives that Kelly does not achieve her goals.
- From “Kelly works hard” and “If Kelly is dedicated and works hard, then she achieves her goals,” contrapositive yields that Kelly is not dedicated.
- Hence Kelly is neither dedicated nor passionate, so the sufficient condition “If Kelly is either dedicated or passionate (but not both), then she is successful” does not apply. No other rule establishes that she is successful or that she is not.

Therefore, whether Kelly is successful cannot be determined.
