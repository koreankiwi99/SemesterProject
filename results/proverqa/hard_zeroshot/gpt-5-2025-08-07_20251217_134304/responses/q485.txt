Anastasia is a nature spirit. If Anastasia heals nature, then she either has mystical powers or is a guardian. Anastasia protects wildlife. Anastasia heals nature. For all beings, if they understand ecology and value sustainability, then they respect balance. If Anastasia loves wildlife and senses harmony, then she possesses a magical amulet. Anastasia values sustainability. If Anastasia has mystical powers, then she is either a nature spirit or possesses magical amulets, but not both. Any being that lives harmoniously or respects balance serves nature. Anastasia does not live harmoniously.
