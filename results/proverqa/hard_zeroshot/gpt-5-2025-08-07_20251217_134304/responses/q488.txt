Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Anahi is not culturally curious.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We can derive many properties about Anahi: she is open-minded, forges meaningful connections (and does not share personal stories), speaks multiple languages, lacks empathy, is not sociable, cannot build bridges, does not love adventure, does not explore cities, does not try new food, enjoys solitude, prioritizes community (thus does not value independence), does not travel alone, receives warm hospitality, and values kindness. However, none of the premises define or relate “culturally curious” to any of these attributes. There is no rule allowing us to infer whether she is or isn’t culturally curious.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
