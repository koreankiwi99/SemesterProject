==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Simba feels invincible” and “Every lion who feels invincible either asserts dominance or has confidence,” plus “Simba does not assert dominance,” Simba must have confidence.
- Simba seeks adventure. By “For all lions, if they have confidence and seek adventure, then they take risks,” Simba takes risks.
- Taking risks implies facing danger. Therefore, Simba does face danger, so “Simba will not face danger” is false.
