Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Meredith does not leave a lasting legacy.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Meredith has a generous spirit,” she shares credit and values collaboration.
- Given “Meredith does not attribute success,” the XOR condition in “If Meredith either shares credit or attributes success (but not both), then she remains humble” is satisfied, so Meredith remains humble.
- From “Meredith makes breakthroughs,” she either receives awards or craves fame. If she craves fame, she hunts for recognition; otherwise not. This leaves whether she hunts for recognition or has selfless dedication (given the XOR) undetermined.
- No rule connects Meredith’s traits to leaving a lasting legacy. The only legacy rule given concerns Lewis specifically.

Therefore, whether Meredith leaves a lasting legacy is not determined.
