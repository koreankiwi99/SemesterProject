Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
If Elisabeth owns a big plot of land and needs extra help, then he will employ workers. Raul is an experienced farmer. If Raul manages a large plantation, then he either harvests efficiently or uses sustainable practices, but not both. Raul works independently. If Raul dedicates time to his farm, then he either grows high-quality beans or supports local projects. Elisabeth needs extra help. If Asher either employs workers or mechanizes tasks (but not both), then he manages a large plantation. If Raul is a successful farmer, then he either employs many workers or manages large plantations, but not both. If Raul owns a big plot of land and needs extra help, then he will employ workers. If Asher manages a large plantation, then he either harvests efficiently or uses sustainable practices, but not both. Kieran owns a big plot of land. If Raul is an experienced farmer, then he either grows high-quality beans or harvests efficiently, but not both. If Raul either employs workers or mechanizes tasks (but not both), then he manages a large plantation. Raul needs extra help. Raul either works independently or shares knowledge with others, but not both. Raul owns a big plot of land. Raul uses sustainable practices. Raul does not mechanize tasks. Asher uses sustainable practices.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Raul can improve the community.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Raul owns a big plot of land and needs extra help, so he employs workers.
- Since he employs workers and does not mechanize tasks, he manages a large plantation.
- He uses sustainable practices; given managing a large plantation implies (harvests efficiently XOR uses sustainable practices), he does not harvest efficiently.
- Being an experienced farmer and not harvesting efficiently implies he grows high-quality beans.
- Raul works independently and, given (works independently XOR shares knowledge), he does not share knowledge.

“Improving the community” would align with supporting local projects or sharing knowledge. We cannot derive that Raul supports local projects (which would require knowing he dedicates time to his farm), and we know he does not share knowledge. Thus, it is not entailed nor contradicted that he can improve the community.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
