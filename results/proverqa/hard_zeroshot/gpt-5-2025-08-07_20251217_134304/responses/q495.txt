Question ID: 495
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
All penguins who either guard their nest or are protective are defending their family. If Pancake has a mate, then he is either loyal or protective, but not both. If Pancake dives deep, then he either finds food or hunts efficiently, but not both. Any penguin that builds a nest or raises its young can care for its chicks. Pancake keeps vigilant. All penguins who either guard their nest or keep vigilant will safeguard their territory. Pancake hunts efficiently. Pancake either raises his young or migrates seasonally, but not at the same time. Pancake migrates seasonally. Pancake is devoted. Pancake has a mate. Pancake builds a nest. If Pancake cares for his chicks and defends his family, then he can find food. If Pancake is either loving or devoted (but not both), then he is loyal. Pancake dives deep. Pancake does not safeguard his territory.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Pancake is not loving.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:

1) From “All penguins who either guard their nest or keep vigilant will safeguard their territory,” together with “Pancake keeps vigilant” and “Pancake does not safeguard his territory,” we can take the contrapositive to conclude Pancake is not a penguin.

2) From “Pancake dives deep” and “If Pancake dives deep, then he either finds food or hunts efficiently, but not both,” plus “Pancake hunts efficiently,” we get that Pancake does not find food.

3) From “If Pancake cares for his chicks and defends his family, then he can find food” and the fact he does not find food, we conclude it’s not the case that Pancake both cares for his chicks and defends his family. (At least one of those is false.) Because Pancake is not a penguin, we cannot infer caring from building a nest or raising young.

4) From “Pancake has a mate” and “If Pancake has a mate, then he is either loyal or protective, but not both,” we have exactly one of loyal or protective is true.

5) From “Pancake is devoted” and “If Pancake is either loving or devoted (but not both), then he is loyal,” we get: if Pancake is not loving, then he is loyal. But this does not force whether he is loving or not; it only says that if he isn’t loving, then he must be loyal.

6) Both possibilities are consistent:
- If not loving, then loyal (and hence not protective) — consistent with all facts.
- If loving, then the antecedent of the loyalty rule is false, and he can be either loyal or protective (but not both) per the mate condition — also consistent.

Therefore, the truth of “Pancake is not loving” cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Correct: No
