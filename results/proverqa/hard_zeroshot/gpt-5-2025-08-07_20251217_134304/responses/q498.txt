Question ID: 498
Difficulty: hard_zeroshot

Context:
Saul does not achieve his goals. Saul is not receiving support. Saul does not set realistic goals. If Saul either regains confidence or builds self-esteem (but not both), then he overcomes adversity. If Saul meets challenges, then he either becomes discouraged or finds new strength, but not both. If Saul either uses assistive devices or requires medical attention (but not both), then he is disabled. If someone requires medical attention and has a strong will, then they can achieve goals. Anyone who achieves success will build their self-esteem. If Saul faces obstacles, then he either loses motivation or finds new strength, but not both. Saul uses assistive devices. Saul does not overcome adversity. If someone suffers injuries, then they face obstacles and develop resilience. Saul has a strong will. Saul either builds self-esteem or sets realistic goals, but not both. If Saul finds new strength, then he either regains confidence or rediscovers purpose, but not both. Saul rediscovers his purpose. If someone recognizes their ability and makes progress, then they can regain confidence. If Saul is disabled, then he is either receiving support or suffering injuries (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Saul does not lose motivation.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Saul either builds self-esteem or sets realistic goals, but not both” and “Saul does not set realistic goals,” we get: Saul builds self-esteem.
- If XOR(regains confidence, builds self-esteem) then overcome adversity. Since Saul does not overcome adversity and builds self-esteem, the XOR must be false, so Saul also regains confidence.
- Given “Saul rediscovers his purpose,” and “If Saul finds new strength, then XOR(regains confidence, rediscovers purpose),” having both regains confidence and rediscovers purpose true forces: Saul does not find new strength.
- Saul has a strong will. If he required medical attention and had a strong will, then he would achieve goals; but he does not achieve his goals, so he does not require medical attention.
- Saul uses assistive devices and does not require medical attention, so XOR(uses devices, requires medical attention) holds, implying Saul is disabled.
- If disabled, then XOR(receiving support, suffering injuries). Since he is not receiving support, he must be suffering injuries.
- Suffering injuries implies he faces obstacles. If he faces obstacles, then XOR(loses motivation, finds new strength). With “does not find new strength,” it follows that he loses motivation.

Therefore, the statement “Saul does not lose motivation” is false.

ANSWER: False
