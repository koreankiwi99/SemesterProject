Context:
If Ashlynn develops resilience, then she achieves success. Ashlynn does not achieve success. If Ashlynn experiences failure, then she is either someone who learns from mistakes or faces life challenges, but not both. If Ashlynn faces life challenges, then she either develops resilience or has a supportive family (or both). Buster either lacks motivation or struggles with decisions. Ashlynn either lacks motivation or struggles with decisions. Ashlynn does not struggle with decisions. If Ashlynn has a supportive family, then she either becomes dependent or becomes independent (or both, as evidenced by her transformation). If Ashlynn values her loved ones, then she feels secure and has a supportive family. If Ashlynn takes risks, then she either faces life challenges or builds confidence (but not both).

If Ashlynn becomes dependent, then she either lacks motivation or has low self-esteem (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ashlynn does not become independent.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From R -> S and ¬S, we get ¬R.
- From AR and (LM XOR AR), we get ¬LM.
- From F and (LM XOR LC) with ¬LM, we get LC.
- From LC -> (R ∨ SF) and ¬R, we get SF.
- From (LMot ∨ SD) and ¬SD, we get LMot. Also LSE is given.
- From Dep -> (LMot XOR LSE) and (LMot ∧ LSE), we get ¬Dep (by contrapositive).
- From SF -> (Dep ∨ Ind) with SF and ¬Dep, we get Ind.

Thus, Ashlynn does become independent, so the statement “Ashlynn does not become independent” is false.

ANSWER: False

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: False
Correct: Yes
