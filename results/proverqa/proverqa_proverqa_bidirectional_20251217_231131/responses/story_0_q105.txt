Premises: If a farmer works hard, then they value quality and are dedicated to their work. Anders does not use crop rotation. Every dedicated farmer either improves their crops or is experienced (or both). For all farmers, either they diversify their farm or improve their crops, but not necessarily both. Ronan either manages pests or increases crop yields. Ronan does not use crop rotation. Any farmer who uses quality seeds or optimizes soil conditions can increase crop yields. Every farmer monitors soil or manages pests. Ronan rotates fields. If Ronan is experienced, then he can either increase crop yields or develop new techniques, but not both. If Alyssa is experienced, then he can either increase crop yields or develop new techniques, but not both. If Bo either rotates fields or uses crop rotation (but not both), then he is dedicated. Ronan either uses sustainable methods or manages pests, but not both. If Ronan either rotates fields or uses crop rotation (but not both), then he is dedicated. Ronan diversifies his farm. Ronan uses sustainable methods. Bo diversifies his farm.
Conclusion: Ronan does not develop new techniques.
