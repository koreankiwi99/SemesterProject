Premises: For every horse, either the horse participates in wassailing or the horse does not participate in wassailing, but not both. Vada does not enjoy outdoor activities. Tessa either enjoys outdoor activities or has participated in parades. If Kiddo has a good temperament, then she either wins competitions or is majestic (or both). Kiddo either works on a farm or competes in shows, but not both. Vada works on a farm. Kiddo works on a farm. Kiddo does not enjoy outdoor activities. Kiddo has a good temperament. All horses with a noble appearance are majestic. Tessa either works on a farm or competes in shows, but not both. For Kiddo, either she has participated in parades or she wins competitions, but not necessarily both. If Tessa has a good temperament, then she either wins competitions or is majestic (or both). Any horse that leads processions has participated in parades. Kiddo either enjoys outdoor activities or has participated in parades. For Tessa, either she has participated in parades or she wins competitions, but not necessarily both. Tessa has a good temperament. If Kiddo is majestic, then she either competes in shows or participates in wassailing, but not both.
Conclusion: Kiddo does not participate in wassailing.
