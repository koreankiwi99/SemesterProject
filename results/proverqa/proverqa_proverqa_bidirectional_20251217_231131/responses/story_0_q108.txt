Premises: Iyla does not become an expert. If Iyla excels in experiments, then she will achieve success. Iyla discovers new properties. Eloise conducts experiments. Christian gains recognition or publishes research (or both). Anyone who has an innovative mind or works hard can excel in experiments. Asher does not become an expert. If Iyla conducts experiments, then she either shares her findings or keeps her notes private, but not both. If Iyla pursues her passion, then she either gains recognition or improves people's lives (or both). Iyla conducts experiments. A renowned alchemist excels in experiments. Christian does not achieve success. Iyla does not achieve success. Iyla makes new findings or publishes research. If Asher excels in experiments, then she will achieve success. Asher discovers new properties. If Iyla discovers new properties and shares her findings, then she becomes an expert. Christian does not leave a lasting impact. Christian either publishes her research or keeps her notes private, but not both. Iyla either publishes her research or keeps her notes private, but not both. If Eloise discovers new properties and shares her findings, then she becomes an expert. Iyla gains recognition or publishes research (or both). If Iyla gathers data or analyzes results, then she will share her findings.
Conclusion: Iyla does not develop innovative remedies.
