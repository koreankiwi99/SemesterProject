Premises: Dr. Marlon reads often. Dr. Marlon follows his experience or trusts his instinct. Dr. Marlon does not follow his experience. Dr. Marlon is not analytical. If Dr. Marlon either learns quickly or has good memory, then he is analytical. If Dr. Marlon has good memory, then he is either rational or intuitive, but not both. Dr. Marlon learns quickly if he reads often. If Dr. Marlon values insight, then he both listens carefully and trusts his instinct. Anyone who trusts their instinct is intuitive. Everyone is rational or emotional (or both).
Conclusion: Dr. Marlon's patients are emotional.
