Premises: All chemical engineers who solve complex problems both enhance water treatment processes and improve public health. Luv does not advance industrial processes. Luv does not conduct academic research. Luv solves complex problems. Veronica does not conduct academic research. Anyone who can purify contaminated water will enhance water treatment processes. A chemical engineer either designs ecofriendly products or conducts academic research, but not necessarily both. Any chemical engineer who creates demulsifying agents or improves environmental sustainability can reduce pollution. If Luv studies emulsions or experiments with chemicals, then she can create demulsifying agents. Koen either creates demulsifying agents or enhances water treatment processes. Veronica solves complex problems. Luv either designs ecofriendly products or reduces pollution, but not necessarily both. If Luv develops innovative techniques, then she can either improve environmental sustainability or advance industrial processes, but not both.
Conclusion: Luv does not develop innovative techniques.
