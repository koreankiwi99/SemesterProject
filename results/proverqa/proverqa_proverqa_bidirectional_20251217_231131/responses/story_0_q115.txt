Premises: Miracle is either someone who prioritizes others or thinks of herself, but not both. Either Miracle is community-oriented or self-centered, but not both. Miracle either fosters collaboration or is a leader, but not necessarily both. Miracle does not value harmony. Either Miracle puts others first or she is community-oriented, but she cannot be both.

Conclusion: Miracle is not self-centered.
