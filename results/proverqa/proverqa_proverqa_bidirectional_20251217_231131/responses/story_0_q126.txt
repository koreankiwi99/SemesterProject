Premises: Heath either has practical skills or has innovative ideas, but not both. If Andy studies planetary science or develops new technology, then he supports terraforming. Kabir cares about nature. Andy cares about nature. If Andy believes in space exploration or values environmental engineering, then he supports terraforming. If Andy has a passion, then he pursues sustainable living and learns quickly. If Cassidy has innovative ideas, then he believes in space exploration and is curious about ecosystems. If Cassidy believes in space exploration or values environmental engineering, then he supports terraforming. Heath either pursues sustainable living or values environmental engineering, but not both. Andy does not have practical skills. If Andy has innovative ideas, then he believes in space exploration and is curious about ecosystems. If Andy enjoys astrophysics, then he is either adventurous or believes in space exploration (but not both). Andy either has practical skills or has innovative ideas, but not both. Heath either supports terraforming or opposes it, but not both. If Andy is visionary, then he works hard and values environmental engineering. If Andy cares about nature, then he will pursue sustainable living. Andy either pursues sustainable living or values environmental engineering, but not both. Andy either supports terraforming or opposes it, but not both.
Conclusion: Andy does not oppose terraforming.
