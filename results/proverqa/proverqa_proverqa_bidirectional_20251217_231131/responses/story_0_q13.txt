Premises: If Aubree is curious, then she is either a philosophical thinker or has a pragmatic approach, but not both. Aubree explores questions. If Aubree is an astrophysicist, then she is either a logical analyzer or an outside-the-box thinker, but not both. Joseph is either an outside-the-box thinker or a conventional thinker. Steven explores questions. If Aubree is open-minded, then she is an unconventional thinker. If Aubree is either a conventional thinker or an unconventional thinker (but not both), then she is innovative. Joseph is a logical analyzer. Aubree seeks answers. Aubree follows established rules. If Joseph is either a conventional thinker or an unconventional thinker (but not both), then she is innovative. Aubree has a pragmatic approach. Aubree is either an outside-the-box thinker or a conventional thinker. Tyler either follows established rules or is an unconventional thinker, but not both. Steven is either a philosophical thinker or an astrophysicist, but not both. Joseph follows established rules. Aubree is a logical analyzer. Anyone who explores questions and seeks answers has curiosity. Aubree is either a philosophical thinker or an astrophysicist, but not both. Aubree either follows established rules or is an unconventional thinker, but not both. If Tyler is an astrophysicist, then she is either a logical analyzer or an outside-the-box thinker, but not both.
Conclusion: Aubree is innovative.
