Premises: If Samantha is either self-taught or has vocational training (but not both), then she is a mechanic. Samantha does not troubleshoot well. Samantha does not develop creative solutions. Anyone who has natural talent or works hard can learn through practice. If Samantha is a mechanic, then she either has formal education or apprenticeship training, but not both. If Samantha has either formal education or hands-on experience (but not both), then she is skilled. Samantha has apprenticeship training. Samantha fixes problems. Anyone who troubleshoots well or fixes problems can gain hands-on experience. Samantha works hard. Samantha is not self-taught. Everyone who learns through practice either develops creative solutions or has vocational training (or both). If Samantha either participates in courses or reads manuals (but not both), then she has vocational training.
Conclusion: Samantha is not skilled.
