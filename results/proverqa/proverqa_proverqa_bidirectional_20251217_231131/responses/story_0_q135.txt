Premises: If someone is passionate, then they push boundaries and have an experimental approach. Johanna is not creative. If someone is a diligent worker, then they have high standards and are passionate. Johanna does not gain widespread recognition. Johanna either has an experimental approach or values tradition. Anyone who puts in extra effort is a diligent worker. If Johanna is talented, then she either pushes boundaries or takes risks, but not both. Johanna puts in extra effort. Johanna does not influence others. Johanna either follows trends or creates unique pieces, but not both. If Johanna either sets style standards or follows trends (but not both), then she is creative. Johanna has high standards. For all humans, if someone is a renowned designer, then they create unique pieces and gain widespread recognition. Johanna does not value tradition. If Johanna either influences others or pushes boundaries (but not both), then she sets style standards. Johanna develops skills or creates unique pieces.
Conclusion: Johanna is a renowned designer.
