Premises: If Aileen loves beauty and practices regularly, then she can paint professionally. Aileen is globally influenced. Aileen develops a unique style. Aileen is not naturally talented. Aileen is either globally influenced or culturally appreciative, but not both. Aileen values tradition or is artistically talented. If Aileen either uses fine brushes or works with small shapes (but not both), then she is skilled at drawing intricate details. If Aileen either experiments with techniques or studies art history (but not both), then she is an experienced artist. If someone develops a unique style and masters color techniques, then they can paint professionally. Aileen has formal training. If Aileen is an experienced artist, then she is either skilled at drawing intricate details or uses unconventional materials, but not both. Aileen uses unconventional materials. If Aileen has formal training, then she is either naturally talented or an experienced artist, but not both. If Aileen paints professionally, then she is either skilled at drawing intricate details or creating vibrant pieces, but not both. Dear develops a unique style. Aileen masters color techniques.
Conclusion: Aileen is culturally appreciative, or she is both artistically talented and community oriented.
