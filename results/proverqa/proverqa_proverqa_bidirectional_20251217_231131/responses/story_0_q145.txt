Premises: Margot is adaptable or has experience. If Margot either thinks critically or acts quickly (but not both), then she has resourcefulness. Margot faces challenges. If Margot travels alone, then she is either adaptable or follows plans, but not both. For all humans, if they are determined and have resourcefulness, then they can overcome challenges. Margot learns lessons. Margot does not have experience. For all humans, if someone seeks adventure, then they take risks and push their limits. For all humans, if they either overcome challenges or seek adventures, then they are resilient. Everyone who handles uncertainty either stays focused or thinks critically (or both). If Margot faces challenges, then she thinks critically and learns lessons. Anyone who tries new things and enjoys freedom seeks adventure. If Margot is adaptable, then she either stays calm or acts quickly (but not both). Margot avoids uncertainty. Margot stays calm. Margot does not take risks. Margot is either resilient or avoids uncertainty, but not both.
Conclusion: Margot is not determined.
