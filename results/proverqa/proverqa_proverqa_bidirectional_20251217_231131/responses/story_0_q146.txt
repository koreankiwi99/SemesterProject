Premises: Dilan either understands others or shows empathy, but not both. Madeleine either retains knowledge or lacks focus, but not both. If someone learns quickly and has good memory, then they can retain knowledge. Madeleine is attentive. Madeleine is not intuitive. Everyone either uses language to communicate or understands others. Dilan is attentive. Juliette cares for others. If someone is erudite, then they possess cognitive skills. Juliette either retains knowledge or lacks focus, but not both. Madeleine either understands others or shows empathy, but not both. If Madeleine is attentive, then she either has good memory or is intuitive (but not both). If Sweetum is attentive, then she either has good memory or is intuitive (but not both). If someone cares for others, then they show empathy. If Madeleine either expresses her thoughts or conveys her emotions (but not both), then she uses language to communicate. Madeleine lacks focus. Juliette is not intuitive. Madeleine cares for others.
Conclusion: Madeleine possesses cognitive skills and uses language to communicate.
