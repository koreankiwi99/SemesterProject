Premises: Marlowe does not earn recognition. Vanessa has momentum. If Marlowe is ambitious and pursues alternate credentials, then he will earn recognition. If Vanessa does not have a PhD, then he will pursue alternate credentials. For every human, either they have a PhD or they do not have a PhD. If Marlowe does not have a PhD, then he will pursue alternate credentials. Marlowe is either disciplined or thinks creatively, but not both. If Guy has momentum, then he is either disciplined or sets high goals, but not both. Anyone who has a clear vision or strives for excellence sets high goals. Guy is either disciplined or thinks creatively, but not both. If someone either seeks specialized certification or applies for fellowships (but not both), then they pursue alternate credentials. If Marlowe has momentum, then he is either disciplined or sets high goals, but not both. Marlowe works hard. Vanessa does not earn recognition. Marlowe has momentum. If Guy is ambitious and pursues alternate credentials, then he will earn recognition. Marlowe thinks creatively. Anyone who sets high goals or works hard is ambitious.
Conclusion: Marlowe does not have a PhD.
