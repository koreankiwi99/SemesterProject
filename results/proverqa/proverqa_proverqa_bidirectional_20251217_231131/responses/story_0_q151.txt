Premises: If Mia is highly respected, then she is either an expert in her field or charismatic, but not both. Mia is not charismatic. Anyone who has expertise in their field either serves clients well or adeptly navigates complex markets (or both). If someone has high integrity, then they build trust and achieve success. Mia either manages risk or serves clients, but not necessarily both. If Mia is either of high integrity or highly skilled (but not both), then she is highly respected. Mia builds trust. Mia communicates effectively with her clients. Mia does not achieve success. Everyone either navigates complex financial markets or communicates effectively with their clients, but not both is not a requirement. Mia manages risk.
Conclusion: Mia is not highly skilled.
