Premises: Evelyn either loves unconditionally or cherishes memories, but not both. Evelyn has a positive outlook. Evelyn either finds inner peace or experiences hardship, but not both. If Evelyn has a positive outlook, then she either appreciates beauty or enjoys life, but not both. Anyone who values connections or puts others first can love unconditionally. Evelyn either pursues happiness or finds inner peace, but not both. Evelyn cherishes memories. Evelyn appreciates beauty. For all humans, if they experience hardship or love unconditionally (or both), then they develop resilience. Everyone enjoys life or pursues happiness.
Conclusion: Evelyn does not develop resilience.
