Premises: Elina loves reading. Elina sets goals or stays disciplined. Elina either enjoys the outdoors or loves reading, but not both. If Elina either monitors her performance or evaluates her results (but not both), then she tracks her progress. Stella does not stay motivated. Elina learns from her failures. Bridget does not perform well. Bridget either enjoys the outdoors or loves reading, but not both. Elina does not perform well. Everyone faces challenges or overcomes fear. If someone either achieves success or stays motivated, then they perform well. If someone visualizes success, then they build strategies and set goals. Elina does not stay motivated. If Bridget is a professional athlete, then she either overcomes fear or stays disciplined, but not both. Elina either tracks her progress or learns from her failures, but not both. Remington sets goals or stays disciplined. If Elina masters extreme sports, then she can overcome fear. If Elina either tracks her progress or sets goals (but not both), then she achieves success. If Elina is a professional athlete, then she either overcomes fear or stays disciplined, but not both. Remington enjoys the outdoors or is a professional athlete. Elina enjoys the outdoors or is a professional athlete. If Elina lives in a rural area, then she either has an adventurous spirit or enjoys the outdoors, but not both.
Conclusion: Elina does not master extreme sports.
