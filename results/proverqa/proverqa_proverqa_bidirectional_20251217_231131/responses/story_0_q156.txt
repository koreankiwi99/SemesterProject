Premises: Alaina values physical health. Everyone either gets enough sleep or stays hydrated, but it's possible for someone to do both or neither. Jaxton gets enough sleep. Anyone who manages their medical condition stays hydrated or takes supplements. Jaxton values physical health. Alaina gets enough sleep. For any person, if they eat nutrient-rich food and exercise regularly, then they have a healthy diet. Jaxton stays hydrated or eats nutrient-rich food. If Jaxton has high energy, then he either engages in physical activities or eats nutrient-rich food, but not both. Chanel does not have low iron levels. For Jaxton, either he has a healthy diet or he has anemia, but it's not necessarily the case that both occur together. Anyone who values physical health exercises regularly.
Conclusion: Jaxton needs medical attention.
