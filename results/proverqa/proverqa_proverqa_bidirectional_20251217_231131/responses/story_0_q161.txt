Premises: If Theo values precision, then he achieves success. Theo either pursues creativity or revolutionizes industries. If Theo improves lives, then he deserves awards. Theo takes risks. If Theo is curious, then he either thinks outside the box or takes risks (but not both). If Theo gains recognition, then he improves lives. If Theo is ambitious, then he is either detail-oriented or values precision, but not both. Theo is either detail-oriented and values precision, or he is curious, but not both. Theo does not deserve awards. If someone pursues creativity, then they think outside the box. Theo does not achieve success.
Conclusion: Theo is not innovative.
