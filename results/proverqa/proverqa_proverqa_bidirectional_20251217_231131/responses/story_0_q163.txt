Premises: Enoch appreciates beauty. If Nikolai either works with precision or creates intricate designs (but not both), then he crafts beautiful pieces. Pet does not strive for perfection. Anyone who meets high standards and has a strong work ethic can earn a good reputation. Pet sets high goals. If Enoch either works with precision or creates intricate designs (but not both), then he crafts beautiful pieces. Enoch does not craft beautiful pieces. Enoch pursues hobbies. Enoch either makes artistic pieces or creates intricate designs (or both). Raphael appreciates beauty. For every person, either they pursue hobbies or they can earn a good reputation, but these are not necessarily related. Enoch sets high goals. If Raphael appreciates beauty and has a patient nature, then he is a skilled plasterer. If someone works with precision, then they take pride in their work and meet high standards. If Enoch appreciates beauty and has a patient nature, then he is a skilled plasterer. Raphael does not craft beautiful pieces. For all humans, if someone is a skilled plasterer, then they either create intricate designs or pay attention to detail (or both). Anyone who works diligently either earns a good reputation or builds a client base. If Enoch sets high goals, then he has a strong work ethic and learns quickly.
Conclusion: Enoch pays attention to detail.
