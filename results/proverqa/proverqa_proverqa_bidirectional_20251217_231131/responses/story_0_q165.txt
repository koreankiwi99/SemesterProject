Premises: Jon does not seek medical attention. If Jon has a medical condition, then he will either change his lifestyle or learn methods to prevent future episodes, but not both. Tootsie will prioritize his vocal health. Jon maintains good health. Jon does not have an office job. Ayden does not seek medical attention. Jon is either a performer or has an office job, but not both. Everyone who experiences a health scare either seeks medical attention or has a medical condition (or both). If Jon fears public performance, then he will either quit singing or seek vocal coaching, but not both. Jon experiences a health scare. Ayden experiences a health scare. Julio is either a performer or has an office job, but not both. If Jon is a performer, then he either has vocal problems or maintains good health, but not both. Jon changes his lifestyle.
Conclusion: If Jon has experienced laryngospasm, then he will either quit singing or learn methods to prevent future episodes, but not both.
