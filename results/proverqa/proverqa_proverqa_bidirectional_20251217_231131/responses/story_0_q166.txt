Premises: Henrik either works with his local community or exposes corruption, but not both. Rocco either works with his local community or exposes corruption, but not both. If Rocco is outspoken, then he either supports human rights or stands up for others, but not both. Rocco either raises awareness or speaks against discrimination. Anyone who stands up for others and challenges unfair systems fights for equality. Rocco either helps those in need or challenges unfair systems. If Ivanna either speaks against discrimination or exposes corruption (but not both), then he challenges unfair systems. Rocco does not support human rights. Kylie either fights for equality or values social justice (or both). Anyone who believes in fairness and respects all people fights for equality. Henrik does not raise awareness. Rocco does not raise awareness. Rocco is outspoken. If Rocco either speaks against discrimination or exposes corruption (but not both), then he challenges unfair systems. Rocco works with his local community.
Conclusion: Rocco values social justice.
