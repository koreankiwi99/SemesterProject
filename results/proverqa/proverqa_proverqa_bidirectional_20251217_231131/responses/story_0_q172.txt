Premises: Lucian does not trust others. If Lucian is disciplined, then he either wins competitions or leads teams (but not both). Lucian does not set goals. Everyone who thinks critically either makes strategic moves or adapts to situations (or both). If Watson either stays focused or makes strategic moves (but not both), then he wins competitions. Anyone who performs under pressure either builds confidence or gains recognition (or both). Lucian either has natural talent or achieves success, but not necessarily the same way. If Watson either performs under pressure or makes strategic moves (but not both), then he achieves success. Everyone who becomes a professional athlete either has natural talent or practices regularly (or both). Lucian either sets goals or stays focused. If someone has a supportive network, they may not necessarily build confidence, and vice versa. Adonis does not set goals. Anyone who remains calm or thinks quickly can perform under pressure. Adonis does not trust others. Everyone either has natural talent or works hard (or both). Lucian is disciplined. Lucian communicates openly. If Lucian either performs under pressure or makes strategic moves (but not both), then he achieves success. If Lucian either communicates openly or trusts others (but not both), then he has a supportive network. Lucian does not gain recognition. Lucian leads teams. If Lucian either stays focused or makes strategic moves (but not both), then he wins competitions. If someone values relationships and nurtures connections, then they have a supportive network. If someone has a good coach, then they practice regularly and stay focused.
Conclusion: Lucian does not work hard.
