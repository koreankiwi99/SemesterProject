Premises: If Nicholas possesses great wealth, then he lives lavishly and owns expensive items. Nicholas does not possess inner beauty. Nicholas either wears fine attire or possesses inner beauty, but not both. Any person who excels in battle or demonstrates courage will gain a reputation. Nicholas does not own expensive items. Nicholas achieves success. Nicholas does not become legendary. Nicholas lives lavishly. For all people, if they either earn recognition or achieve success, then they will gain a reputation. If Nicholas gains a reputation, then he either has a noble title or possesses great wealth (or both). If someone leads armies, then they possess great wealth and hold power. If Nicholas takes pride in his appearance, then he will command respect and become legendary. Nicholas does not have a noble title.
Conclusion: Nicholas does not take pride in his appearance.
