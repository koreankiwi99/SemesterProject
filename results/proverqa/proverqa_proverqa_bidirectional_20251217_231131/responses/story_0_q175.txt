Premises: If Zachary immigrated recently, then he either values diversity or learns local practices (or both). Atticus does not learn local practices. If Zachary speaks multiple languages, then he works internationally and values diversity. Zachary does not respect traditions. Zachary relies on intuition. Zachary does not learn local practices. Anyone who adapts to their environment either respects traditions or builds new connections (or both). Zachary speaks multiple languages. Zachary does not explore new places. If someone has global skills and thrives in new places, then they work internationally. Zachary does not build new connections. If Zachary feels lost, then he is either someone who immigrated recently or someone who explores new places (but not both). Anyone who is curious or open-minded can adapt to their environment. Everyone either knows their direction or feels lost. If Scott immigrated recently, then he either values diversity or learns local practices (or both). Everyone who lives abroad either adapts to their environment or embraces local customs (or both). Amanda does not build new connections. If Zachary is open-minded, then he either lives abroad or is embracing new experiences (or both). If Zachary studies abroad, then he either values diversity or appreciates culture, but not both. Atticus faces a cultural barrier. Zachary faces a cultural barrier. If Zachary works internationally, then he lives abroad. Scott does not explore new places. For Zachary, relying on intuition and seeking local guidance are mutually exclusive approaches to navigating unfamiliar situations. Anyone who faces a cultural barrier either feels lost or seeks local guidance (or both).
Conclusion: Zachary does not retain his original identity.
