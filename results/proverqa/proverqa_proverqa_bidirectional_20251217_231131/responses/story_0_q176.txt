Premises: Madden does not have good instincts. If Shay is respected by his peers, then he either has leadership skills or is strategic, but not both. Anyone who demonstrates expertise is either respected by their peers or can handle pressure (or both). Madden is either self-taught or demonstrates expertise, but not necessarily both. If Madden practices critical thinking, then he will solve complex problems. Madden practices critical thinking. Madden has formal training. For all people, if someone is a skilled problem solver, then they are effective in critical situations and valued by others. If Madden solves complex problems, then he is either self-taught or has formal training, but not both. Madden either works hard or has leadership skills. Madden is either a skilled problem solver or has good instincts. If Madden is respected by his peers, then he either has leadership skills or is strategic, but not both. For Madden, either he thinks creatively or is strategic, but not both. Madden cannot handle pressure. Anyone who identifies patterns and thinks logically can solve complex problems. If Langston practices critical thinking, then he will solve complex problems. If Madden either works efficiently or stays calm under stress (but not both), then he demonstrates expertise. Shay is not loyal. Madden thinks creatively.
Conclusion: Madden is not effective in critical situations.
