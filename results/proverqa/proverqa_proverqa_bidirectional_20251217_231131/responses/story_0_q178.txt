Premises: Brendan either makes groundbreaking discoveries or works independently, but not both. Pandabear sets high goals. Brendan teaches students. Victoria manages time effectively. Brendan receives invitations. If someone is a renowned botanist and collaborates with experts, then they advance scientific knowledge. If someone publishes papers and receives invitations, then they attend conferences. If Brendan either studies unique species or cultivates rare flowers (but not both), then he is a renowned botanist. Brendan works independently if he values freedom. Brendan publishes papers. If Victoria is a professor, then he either teaches students or shares research findings, but not both. Anyone who sets high goals and manages time effectively can work independently. If Brendan is either a renowned botanist or passionate about plants (but not both), then he makes groundbreaking discoveries. Brendan is a professor. Brendan sets high goals. If Brendan either shares research findings or attends conferences (but not both), then he collaborates with experts. If Brendan has original ideas, then he collaborates with experts and values feedback. Patrick teaches students. Brendan does not advance scientific knowledge. Pandabear is a professor. Patrick does not advance scientific knowledge. If Brendan either studies rare species or contributes to innovation (but not both), then he makes groundbreaking discoveries. If Brendan is a professor, then he either teaches students or shares research findings, but not both. Brendan manages time effectively.
Conclusion: Brendan is passionate about plants.
