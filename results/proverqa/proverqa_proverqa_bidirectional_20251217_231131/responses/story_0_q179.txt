Premises: If Lachlan either exercises regularly or eats nutritious food (but not both), then he has good health. Treasure is either in good health or works under stress, but not both. Lachlan has a balanced lifestyle. If Lachlan's research subjects either practice good hygiene or avoid unhealthy habits (but not both), then they have normal Bartholin gland function. Kalani has a balanced lifestyle. If Lachlan's research subjects either regulate their hormones or maintain their fertility (but not both), then they have a healthy reproductive system. If someone has a balanced lifestyle and eats nutritious food, then they can maintain their fertility. Treasure strives for perfection. Lachlan is either in good health or works under stress, but not both. All individuals who set high goals strive for perfection and often work under stress. Lachlan sets high goals. Anyone with a healthy reproductive system has normal Bartholin gland function. Lachlan does not regulate his hormones. For every human, either they have a Bartholin gland disorder or they have normal Bartholin gland function, but not both. Lachlan's research subjects either practice good hygiene or have a healthy reproductive system. Lachlan exercises regularly. Kalani exercises regularly. Lachlan strives for perfection.
Conclusion: Lachlan's research subjects have a Bartholin gland disorder.
