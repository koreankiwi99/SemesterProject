Premises: Wyatt does not demonstrate proficiency. If someone is motivated, then they produce quality work and stay focused. If Wyatt takes pride in his work and meets challenges, then he also rushes through tasks. Wyatt meets deadlines. Wyatt is either a skilled stonemason or an inexperienced stonemason, but not both. Wyatt avoids details. Wyatt either works precisely or rushes through tasks, but not both. Wyatt either pays attention to details or makes mistakes, but not both. Wyatt does not have strong foundations. Wyatt learns quickly or makes mistakes. Wyatt either lacks practice or works precisely. Anyone who lacks practice and makes mistakes is an inexperienced stonemason. If Wyatt either earns recognition or gains acclaim, then he demonstrates proficiency. If Wyatt has strong foundations or produces quality work, then he will earn recognition. If someone has experience and pays attention to details, then they produce quality work. Wyatt does not gain acclaim. Anyone who meets deadlines and avoids details tends to rush through tasks. If Chase either earns recognition or gains acclaim, then he demonstrates proficiency. Wyatt has experience. If Wyatt avoids hard tasks and gives up quickly, then he lacks practice.
Conclusion: Wyatt is a skilled stonemason.
