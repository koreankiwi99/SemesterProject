Premises: Dallas does not strive for recognition. Noel does not strive for recognition. For Noel, she either values durability or appreciates impermanence, but not both. If Noel appreciates impermanence, then she can either create timeless masterpieces or find moments of beauty, but not both. Noel demands high standards. Noel dedicates herself to her craft. If Noel pursues excellence, then she is either a passionate artist or strives for recognition, but not both. Kaitlyn either seeks perfection or finds moments of beauty, but not both. If Noel is a passionate artist, then she seeks perfection and demands high standards. Noel either seeks perfection or finds moments of beauty, but not both. If Dallas is a passionate artist, then she seeks perfection and demands high standards. Kaitlyn does not value durability. Anyone who sets high goals or dedicates themselves to their craft will pursue excellence. Noel does not value durability. If someone either pours their heart into their work or expresses their creativity, then they are a passionate artist. If Dallas pursues excellence, then she is either a passionate artist or strives for recognition, but not both. If Noel either innovates recipes or perfects techniques (but not both), then she pursues excellence. If Kaitlyn appreciates impermanence, then she can either create timeless masterpieces or find moments of beauty, but not both. Noel sets high goals. Kaitlyn dedicates herself to her craft. Kaitlyn demands high standards.
Conclusion: Noel creates timeless masterpieces.
