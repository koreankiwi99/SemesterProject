Premises: If Joshua is passionate about nature and excels in academics, then he will obtain a PhD. Joshua does not gain experience. If someone enters the workforce, then they gain experience and develop skills. If Joshua dedicates himself to research, then he makes new discoveries. Joshua either makes new discoveries or collaborates with others, but not both. Joshua either teaches at a university or publishes findings, but not both. Cowboy either teaches at a university or publishes findings, but not both. If Joshua obtains a PhD, then he will teach at a university. Yara develops skills. If Joshua pursues an advanced degree, then he will obtain a PhD. Joshua either collaborates with others or publishes findings. Joshua develops skills. If Joshua has curiosity, then he has a passion for learning and pursues an advanced degree. Anyone who collects data and analyzes results can publish findings. Joshua either enters the workforce or pursues an advanced degree, but not both at the same time. Yara either collaborates with others or publishes findings.
Conclusion: Joshua dedicates himself to research.
