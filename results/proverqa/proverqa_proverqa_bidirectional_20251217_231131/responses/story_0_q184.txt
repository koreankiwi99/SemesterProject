Premises: If Jameson performs experiments and is detail-oriented, then he can make groundbreaking discoveries. If Jameson works in a laboratory, then he uses a microscope. Jameson is either detail-oriented or careless, but not both. Anyone who contributes to science is accomplished. Jameson does not advance knowledge. Jameson uses a microscope or studies microorganisms. Estella does not make groundbreaking discoveries. If Jameson examines cells or analyzes samples, then he studies microorganisms. If someone either examines samples or analyzes images (but not both), then they make observations. Estella conducts research. Jameson thinks creatively. Anyone who analyzes results either draws conclusions or performs experiments (or both). Everyone who conducts research either performs experiments or collects data (or both). If Jameson examines evidence, then he either identifies patterns or develops theories. Gabriel thinks creatively. Everyone who studies microorganisms either contributes to science or develops new techniques (or both). Jameson is not accomplished. Collin does not develop new techniques. Anyone who makes observations either identifies patterns or advances knowledge. For anyone who uses a microscope and collects data, it is the case that they make observations. Jameson does not make groundbreaking discoveries. Jameson either thinks creatively or identifies patterns, but not both. Gabriel either thinks creatively or identifies patterns, but not both. Jameson conducts research. Jameson does not develop new techniques.
Conclusion: Jameson is not careless.
