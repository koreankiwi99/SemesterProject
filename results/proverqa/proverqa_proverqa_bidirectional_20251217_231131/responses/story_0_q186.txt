Premises: Khalani manages stress or stays active. If Khalani either has relaxation techniques or meditates daily (but not both), then she gets enough sleep. Kelly has a balanced diet. If someone has a balanced diet and exercises regularly, then they can get enough sleep. For Khalani, either she gets enough sleep or she stays active, but it's not necessarily both. Khalani has a balanced diet. For Spark, either she gets enough sleep or she stays active, but it's not necessarily both. If Nikolai's clients face challenges, then they are either emotionally strong or practice self-care (but not both). If Khalani practices self-care, then she either has good habits or manages stress well (but not both). If Khalani's clients face challenges, then they are either emotionally strong or practice self-care (but not both). Khalani either finds calm or embraces change, but not both. Kelly has good habits. Khalani has resilience. Khalani has good habits. If Khalani's clients undergo therapy, then they either develop coping skills or are emotionally strong (or both). Spark exercises regularly. If Kelly practices self-care, then she either has good habits or manages stress well (but not both). If Khalani either has resilience or faces challenges, then she finds calm. Spark embraces change. If Khalani either prioritizes tasks or remains focused (but not both), then she manages stress well. Khalani embraces change. Khalani exercises regularly.
Conclusion: Khalani's clients do not seek support when needed.
