Premises: Anyone who produces quality work has exquisite taste or is highly skilled (or both). For all humans, if they either take risks or think outside the box, then they drive progress. If Haisley is innovative, then she either has experience or takes risks, but not both. Anyone who sets high standards and meets deadlines is a diligent worker. Bubbies does not think outside the box. Haisley is either a conservative designer or creative. Haisley is either creative or uninspired, but not both. Haisley is not attentive to detail. If Bubbies is passionate, then she is either creative or innovative (or both). Anyone who loves art is passionate. If Mabel is innovative, then she either has experience or takes risks, but not both. Haisley does not drive progress. Ermias follows trends. Mabel is either passionate or a diligent worker (or both). Anyone who is a diligent worker or attentive to detail produces quality work. If Haisley is passionate, then she is either creative or innovative (or both). Haisley is not highly skilled. A person either follows trends or has exquisite taste, but not necessarily both. Haisley follows trends. Ermias does not have experience. If Haisley admires history, then she has exquisite taste and values craftsmanship. Haisley is either passionate or a diligent worker (or both). Haisley does not think outside the box. Haisley does not have experience.
Conclusion: Haisley is uninspired.
