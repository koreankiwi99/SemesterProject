Premises: Connor leads research teams. Connor collaborates with peers. If Connor collaborates with peers, then he teaches at a university and mentors students. Connor publishes academic papers or is recognized as a leading expert. If Connor has extensive experience, then he either teaches at a university or publishes academic papers, but not both. Connor does not study fossils. Connor will mentor students if he leads research teams. Connor specializes in theropod dinosaurs if he focuses on ancient species. Every paleontologist either has extensive experience or studies fossils.
Conclusion: Connor makes groundbreaking discoveries, or he specializes in theropod dinosaurs and is recognized as a leading expert.
