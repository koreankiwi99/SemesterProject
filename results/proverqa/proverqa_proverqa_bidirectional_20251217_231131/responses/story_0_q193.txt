Premises: Any mythical creature that possesses wisdom or understands nature can have ancient knowledge. Ashley understands nature. Every mythical creature that either controls elements or reads minds (but not both) possesses special powers. Ashley either has the ability to transform or control elements, but not both. Anne does not communicate telepathically. If Ashley, the dragon, has unique physical features or possesses special powers, then she plays a protective role. All mythical creatures with mystical significance possess special powers and are revered. Ashley either has ancient knowledge or unique physical features, but the two are not necessarily related. If Shorty, the dragon, has unique physical features or possesses special powers, then she plays a protective role. Ashley lives in harmony with other beings. If Ashley is legendary, then she either has telekinesis or reads minds (but not both). Ashley does not communicate telepathically. Anne either has ancient knowledge or unique physical features, but the two are not necessarily related. Ashley has the ability to transform. If Ashley lives in harmony with other beings, then she either communicates telepathically or reads minds (or both). If Ashley is a revered mythical creature, then she is either knowledgeable about ancient lore or has mystical abilities, but not both. Every mythical creature that holds spiritual significance either holds mystical powers or has unique physical features (or both).
Conclusion: Ashley does not play a protective role.
