Premises: Payton conducts experiments. Anyone who works in their field or conducts experiments has practical experience. For Payton, either she has practical experience or she is knowledgeable about marine life, but these are not necessarily related. If someone studies hard and thinks creatively, then they can make a new discovery. Payton thinks creatively. Everyone who earns a prestigious grant either works in their field or publishes research. Payton sets goals. Payton is knowledgeable about marine life or passionate about research (or both). If Payton sets goals, then she will overcome challenges and study hard. If Eithan makes a new discovery, then she receives recognition and earns a prestigious grant. Rosalee is knowledgeable about marine life or passionate about research (or both). Payton does not publish research. If Payton either reads scientific articles or explores the ocean (but not both), then she is knowledgeable about marine life. If Payton makes a new discovery, then she receives recognition and earns a prestigious grant. For anyone, having a willingness to get hands dirty and learning from mistakes leads to having practical experience. Rosalee thinks creatively.
Conclusion: Payton is not passionate about research.
