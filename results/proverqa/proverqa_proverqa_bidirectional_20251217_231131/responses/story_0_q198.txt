Premises: Gary makes tactical decisions. Gary cannot handle critical situations. If Gary leads others effectively, then he either makes tactical decisions or communicates clearly, but not both. Anyone who thinks quickly and stays calm under pressure can handle critical situations. Gary gains experience or has training. If Gary takes risks, then he either acts impulsively or follows his instincts (but not both). Gary thinks quickly. Gary either performs heroic actions or takes risks. Anyone who prioritizes their own safety and has proper training can respond to emergencies effectively. Anyone who responds to emergencies either stays calm under pressure or leads others effectively (or both). Gary does not gain experience. Gary does not act impulsively. If Gary is brave, then he will perform heroic actions and earn accolades. Gary either prioritizes his own safety or is brave, but Gary may not necessarily do both. Gary does not follow his instincts. Gary communicates clearly.
Conclusion: Gary does not earn accolades.
