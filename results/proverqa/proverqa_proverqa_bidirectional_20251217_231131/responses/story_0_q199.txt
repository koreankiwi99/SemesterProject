Premises: If Stefan asks questions, then he explores opportunities and values experience. Stefan visits a foreign land. Stefan travels abroad. For all humans, if they either have curiosity or ask questions, then they seek knowledge. Stefan listens to podcasts. Anyone who reads widely or meets new people loves learning. If Stefan visits a foreign land, then he either becomes thoughtful or develops cultural appreciation, but not both. If Stefan either listens to podcasts or reads widely (but not both), then he has curiosity. If Stefan travels abroad, then he either immerses himself in the culture or becomes thoughtful (or both). Stefan does not value experience. Stefan does not seek knowledge. If Stefan loves learning, then he develops cultural appreciation and appreciates diversity. For all humans, if they immerse themselves in a culture, then they gain a new perspective.
Conclusion: Stefan does not gain a new perspective.
