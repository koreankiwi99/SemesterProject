Premises: Anastasia studies ecology. If Anastasia is an entomologist, then she either cares for the environment or advocates for sustainability, but not both. If someone embraces self-reflection and nurtures their curiosity, then they can pursue personal growth. Bryson either has an artistic side or is an entomologist, but not both. If Anastasia has curiosity, then she contributes to science and thinks critically. Anastasia does not educate others. If someone either values simplicity or seeks elegance (but not both), then they appreciate beauty. Anyone who practices mindfulness will pursue personal growth. Bryson nurtures her curiosity. Anastasia either has an artistic side or is an entomologist, but not both. Anastasia does not have an artistic side. Anastasia embraces self-reflection. Anastasia nurtures her curiosity. If Anastasia studies ecology, then she either advocates for sustainability or educates others (or both). If Jones studies ecology, then she either advocates for sustainability or educates others (or both). Anastasia either pursues personal growth or contributes to science, or both.
Conclusion: Anastasia either appreciates beauty or contributes to science (or both).
