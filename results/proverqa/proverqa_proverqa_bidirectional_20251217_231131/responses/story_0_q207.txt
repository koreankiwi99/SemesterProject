Premises: Jase pursues personal interests. If Jase either puts his family first or gives back to the community (but not both), then he makes sacrifices. Jase values teamwork. If Slick is a senior officer, then he earns respect and serves selflessly. If Jase either analyzes situations or makes informed decisions (but not both), then he is a strategic thinker. If Avalynn demonstrates leadership or shows dedication, then he can become a senior officer. If Jase demonstrates leadership or shows dedication, then he can become a senior officer. Avalynn either values teamwork or is a strategic thinker, but not both. Slick values teamwork. If Jase is a senior officer, then he earns respect and serves selflessly. Avalynn has a strong work ethic. Slick pursues personal interests. If Cuddles has a strong work ethic, then he is either a strategic thinker or demonstrates leadership, but not both. Jase either values teamwork or is a strategic thinker, but not both. Jase has a strong work ethic. If Jase has a strong work ethic, then he is either a strategic thinker or demonstrates leadership, but not both. Jase either pursues personal interests or makes sacrifices, but not both.
Conclusion: Jase earns respect.
