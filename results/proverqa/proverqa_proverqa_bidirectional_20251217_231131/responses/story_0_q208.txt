Premises: Gatlin has support. Gatlin does not learn from his mistakes. Everyone pursues their passions or sets goals. Gatlin builds resilience. Anyone who remains focused and builds resilience can overcome obstacles. Gatlin experiences failure. If someone has support and pursues their passions, then they find motivation. If Gatlin experiences failure, then he either remains focused or learns from his mistakes (but not both). If someone sets goals and overcomes obstacles, then they will achieve success. Gatlin does not find motivation.
Conclusion: Gatlin faces setbacks.
