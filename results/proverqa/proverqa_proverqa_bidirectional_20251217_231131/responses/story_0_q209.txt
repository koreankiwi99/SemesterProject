Premises: Timothy either acts quickly or is brave. Timothy takes risks. If Timothy takes risks and stays calm, then he is a hero. For anyone who faces challenges and exercises self-control, they can stay calm. Timothy does not think cautiously. Timothy remains focused. Everyone who works under pressure either exercises self-control or thinks cautiously (or both). If Timothy remains focused, then he will work under pressure. Timothy does not make decisive moves. If Timothy either acts quickly or makes decisive moves (but not both), then he handles emergencies. If Timothy practices mindfulness, then he either exercises self-control or has emotional balance, but not both. Timothy does not handle emergencies. Timothy faces challenges.
Conclusion: Timothy is not skilled.
