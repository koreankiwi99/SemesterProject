Premises: If Adeline pursues her passion, then she will achieve success. Adeline is intelligent or dedicated. If Adeline sets goals, then she will work hard. If Adeline is dedicated, then she either has expertise or works hard (but not both). Adeline achieves success or has expertise. Adeline does not shape the opinions of others. Adeline sets goals. If Adeline achieves success, then she will gain recognition. If someone makes discoveries and publishes research, then they will have influence in their field. If Adeline is passionate, then she is dedicated and cares about others. Those who have influence in their field will shape the opinions of others. Briella sets goals. If someone gains recognition, then they will have influence in their field.
Conclusion: Adeline is intelligent.
