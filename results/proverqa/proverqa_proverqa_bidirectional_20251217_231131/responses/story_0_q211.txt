Premises: If Meadow grows up in an industry town, then she either witnesses destruction or sees animal suffering. All people who value wildlife and seek truth care about the environment. If Kailani lives near polluted areas or cares about the environment, then she becomes an environmental activist. Maisy sees polluted rivers. Meadow either enjoys fresh mountains or breathes toxic air, but not both. If Meadow lives near polluted areas or cares about the environment, then she becomes an environmental activist. Meadow enjoys fresh mountains. Meadow either witnesses destruction or lives near polluted areas. If Meadow experiences health problems, then she either witnesses destruction or sees dead animals (but not both). Cyrus does not reduce her carbon footprint. Anyone who lives near factories or works with hazardous materials can breathe toxic air. Maisy does not support conservancy. Meadow sees animal suffering. Meadow sees polluted rivers. If Meadow either breathes toxic air or sees polluted rivers (but not both), then she grows up in an industry town. If Cyrus either supports conservancy or reduces her carbon footprint (but not both), then she cares about the environment.
Conclusion: Meadow does not become an environmental activist.
