Premises: If Mekhi faces adversity, then he will show resilience and find a way to overcome it. Trenton either experiences failure or avoids risks. If Landen learns from his mistakes, then he will achieve success. Musa does not gain recognition. If Trenton faces adversity, then he will either become stronger or stay motivated, but not both. Landen does not gain recognition. If Landen experiences failure, then he will either learn from his mistakes or stay motivated, but not both. Musa pursues his passions or achieves success. Musa becomes stronger. If Mekhi sets goals and achieves success, then he will gain recognition. Musa sets goals. Mekhi becomes stronger. Musa does not avoid risks. If Musa learns from his mistakes, then he will achieve success. If Musa sets goals and achieves success, then he will gain recognition. If Musa faces adversity, then he will either become stronger or stay motivated, but not both. If Musa experiences failure, then he will either learn from his mistakes or stay motivated, but not both. Musa either experiences failure or avoids risks. Musa either has determination or stays motivated.
Conclusion: Musa does not find a way to overcome.
