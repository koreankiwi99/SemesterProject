Premises: If Samantha either reads widely or attends seminars (but not both), then she has formal education. If someone works under a mentor, then they gain practical experience. Samantha either gains practical experience or reads widely, but not both. If Samantha overcomes adversity, then she either has natural talent or learns quickly. Samantha puts in diligent effort or has a hard work ethic. Everyone who is self-taught either reads widely or learns through apprenticeship (or both). Charli either gains practical experience or reads widely, but not both. Samantha does not put in diligent effort. Samantha works under a mentor. Samantha attends seminars. If Samantha achieves recognition, then she has either natural talent or a hard work ethic (but not both). Charli works under a mentor. Aries achieves recognition. If Samantha has either formal education or natural talent (but not both), then she is successful. Samantha achieves recognition.
Conclusion: Samantha is not successful.
