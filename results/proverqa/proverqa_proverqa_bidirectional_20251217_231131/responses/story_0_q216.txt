Premises: Colten either works independently or lends a helping hand, but not both. All mechanically inclined people fix broken things and enjoy problem-solving. Colten either fixes broken things or reads manuals, but not necessarily both. Colten is either intelligent or kind-hearted (or both). Colten either works independently or follows directions, but not both. Colten listens carefully. Everyone who lends a helping hand either fixes broken things or has common sense (or both). A person either has common sense or is intelligent, but not necessarily both. Colten reads manuals. Anyone who listens carefully or asks questions can follow directions.
Conclusion: Colten is kind-hearted.
