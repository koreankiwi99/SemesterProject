Premises: Dangelo cooperates with others. Antonio communicates clearly. Either Clay has distinctive features or he looks like other polar bears, but not both. If Dangelo is an experienced hunter, then he either has distinctive features or has earned respect from others (or both). Clay either lives in groups or adapts to his environment, but these two are not necessarily related. Clay cooperates with others. Clay has courage. Every polar bear adapts to the environment or is an experienced hunter. Any polar bear that has battle scars or is large in size has distinctive features. If Clay has social skills and cooperates with others, then he tends to live in groups. If Clay has courage, then he either has respect or is intelligent, but not both. If Clay is an experienced hunter, then he either has distinctive features or has earned respect from others (or both). Clay is intelligent. If Chris has social skills and cooperates with others, then he tends to live in groups. Every polar bear who leads others either builds strong bonds with fellow bears or has social skills (or both). Clay communicates clearly. Antonio is intelligent. If Clay listens actively or communicates clearly, then he has social skills.
Conclusion: Clay does not look like other polar bears.
