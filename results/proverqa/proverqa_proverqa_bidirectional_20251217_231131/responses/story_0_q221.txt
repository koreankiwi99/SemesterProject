Premises: Anyone who strives for success has ambition. If Matias has experienced failure, then he refuses to quit and is determined. If Matias is a professional athlete, then he either seeks feedback or stays disciplined, but not both. Kyler is not able to overcome obstacles. Matias is not able to overcome obstacles. Matias does not analyze errors. Everyone who has ambition sets goals. If Matias faces challenges, then he believes in himself and stays motivated. Matias pursues success or has ambition. Anyone who tracks progress or identifies weaknesses can set goals. All individuals who seek improvement build confidence and strive for success. Everyone who faces setbacks either learns from mistakes or works hard (or both). If Matias either learns from mistakes or analyzes errors (but not both), then he is able to overcome obstacles. If someone works hard and believes in themselves, then they strive for success. Everyone who sets goals is determined. Kyler faces setbacks. Matias faces setbacks. Everyone gains experience or learns from mistakes. Matias is a professional athlete. Matias stays disciplined. If Valentin is a professional athlete, then he either seeks feedback or stays disciplined, but not both. Matias either seeks feedback or believes in himself, but not both.
Conclusion: Matias is resilient.
