Premises: Shay works hard or is skilled. If someone has a lot of imaginations, then they enjoy creating things and think outside the box. If Shay is detail-oriented, then she either takes pride in her work or enjoys creating things (but not both). Shay values quality or is skilled. If Shay strives for excellence, then she either has perfectionism or seeks feedback (but not both). Shay seeks feedback. Shay remains anonymous. Shay strives for excellence. Shay has a lot of imaginations. Shay has perfectionism if she sets high standards. Shay is detail-oriented. Either Shay is a famous artist or she remains anonymous, but not both. If someone values quality, then they either take pride in their work or have perfectionism.
Conclusion: Shay's work is not viral.
