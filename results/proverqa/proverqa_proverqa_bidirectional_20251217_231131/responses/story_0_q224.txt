Premises: Snuggems does not nuzzle her owners. If Snuggems is curious, then she either chases feathers or climbs high, but not both. If Kiya is either mechanically inclined or affectionate (but not both), then she is lovable. If Kiya either nuzzles her owners or curls up tightly (but not both), then she purrs frequently. All cats that purr frequently and enjoy attention are affectionate. Snuggems does not bring joy. If Snuggems either plays with toys or chases feathers (but not both), then she has fun. Kiya does not have fun. Snuggems does not have fun. Marlon does not climb high. Every cat either has soft fur or is lovable (or both). All cats that sleep soundly eat well and look healthy. Marlon does not nuzzle her owners. If Snuggems either nuzzles her owners or curls up tightly (but not both), then she purrs frequently. Marlon does not eat well. Snuggems is curious. Snuggems does not eat well. Snuggems enjoys attention. If Snuggems either likes engine noise or bats at wires (but not both), then she curls up tightly. For any cat, if it plays with toys and is lovable, then it brings joy. Snuggems does not climb high. If Snuggems is either mechanically inclined or affectionate (but not both), then she is lovable. Every cat either sleeps soundly or curls up tightly. Snuggems does not look healthy. Christina enjoys attention. Christina does not look healthy. If Marlon is curious, then she either chases feathers or climbs high, but not both. If Snuggems either catches mice or bats strings (but not both), then she plays with toys.
Conclusion: Snuggems is not mechanically inclined.
