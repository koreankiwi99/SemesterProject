Premises: If someone engages in yoga and gets enough sleep, then they feel rejuvenated. Carly has clarity. Everyone who reduces stress either finds balance or increases calmness (or both). If Carly lives longer, then she does not necessarily age gracefully, and if Carly ages gracefully, then she does not necessarily live longer. Carly does not stay positive. Everyone who exercises regularly either improves their mood or boosts their energy (or both). Carly does not feel rejuvenated. Everyone either has clarity or finds balance, but it's not always both at the same time. Carly stays hydrated. If Carly either reduces stress or improves her mood (but not both), then she stays positive. If Carly either gets enough sleep or stays hydrated (but not both), then she ages gracefully. Carly does not boost her energy. Carly engages in yoga. Carly does not increase calmness. Carly either exercises regularly or has good health.
Conclusion: Carly does not eat alkaline-rich foods.
