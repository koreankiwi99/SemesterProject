Premises: If Cuteness has imagination, then she can make people smile and bring color to life. Any character who visits the studio either enjoys coloring or is an admirer of art. If Donovan has imagination, then she can make people smile and bring color to life. Romina does not appreciate beauty. Cuteness has creative flair. Donovan spreads joy. Hattie has creative flair. If Cuteness has creative flair, then she is either a talented artist or loves to draw, but not both. Cuteness enjoys coloring or loves to draw. Cuteness does not appreciate beauty. If a character develops skills and expresses creatively, then they can be a talented artist. If Cuteness enjoys coloring, then she has good taste and appreciates beauty. Cuteness does not bring color to life. If a character either makes cartoons or designs characters (but not both), then they love to draw. Donovan enjoys coloring or loves to draw. If Hattie enjoys coloring, then she has good taste and appreciates beauty. Every character expresses creativity or has imagination. Romina does not bring color to life. If Hattie is a talented artist and has imagination, then she creates masterpieces.
Conclusion: Cuteness does not create masterpieces.
