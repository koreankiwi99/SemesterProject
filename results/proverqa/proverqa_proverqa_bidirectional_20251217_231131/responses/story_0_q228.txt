Premises: Jaylah either works in teams or leads solo projects, but not both. If Ernesto has a strong network, then he either works in teams or builds strong partnerships, but not both. Jaylah collaborates with experts. If Ernesto is curious, then he has creative ideas and communicates effectively. Ernesto either works in teams or leads solo projects, but not both. Anyone who thinks outside the box or explores new areas can have creative ideas. Ernesto collaborates with experts. Ernesto does not value precision. If Collins is a dedicated researcher, then he will make a notable discovery and gain international recognition. A person is either curious or values precision, but being one does not necessarily imply being the other. Collins either collaborates with experts or leads solo projects, but not both. Everyone who has leadership skills either leads solo projects or builds strong networks (or both). If Ernesto is a dedicated researcher, then he will make a notable discovery and gain international recognition. Ernesto does not pursue knowledge. Jaylah does not value precision. Ernesto either collaborates with experts or leads solo projects, but not both. If someone enjoys learning, then they ask insightful questions and are curious. If someone has creative ideas and works in teams, then they can make a notable discovery. Ernesto either pursues knowledge or is a dedicated researcher.
Conclusion: Ernesto does not gain international recognition.
