Premises: Hallie does not become mainstream. If Hallie either experiments with genres or collaborates with other artists (but not both), then she releases popular music. If Hallie is charismatic, then she creates hit singles. Every musician who is part of a band either writes songs or performs live (or both). Hallie does not experiment with genres. Hallie does not release popular music. If Hallie either plays an instrument or composes music (but not both), then she is part of a band. For every musician, if they are either part of a band or a solo artist (but not both), then they are creative. Hallie has vocal range. If Hallie either creates hit singles or records top tracks (but not both), then she becomes mainstream. Hallie is either a solo artist or produces albums, but not both. Every musician who gains a following either creates hit singles or collaborates with other artists (or both). If Hallie has vocal range and produces albums, then she gains a following. Hallie does not record top tracks. Hallie does not write songs. If Hallie either sells tickets or wins awards (but not both), then she gains a following. Hallie does not perform live.
Conclusion: Hallie is not creative.

-- Goal: Hallie is not creative
theorem goal : ¬ Creative Hallie := by
  -- From the given premises, we can derive many properties about Hallie (as above),
  -- but there is no premise that links Creative to any of these properties in a way
  -- that would yield a contradiction from assuming Creative Hallie.
  -- In particular, the only premise mentioning Creative requires Hallie to be a Musician,
  -- which is not given, so we cannot derive Creative Hallie nor its negation from the premises.
