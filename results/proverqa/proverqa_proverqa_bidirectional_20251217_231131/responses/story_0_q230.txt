Premises: Khai either stays in one city or travels to new places, but not at the same time. Khai does not support local businesses. Khai tends to stay in one city if he has strong community ties. If Khai likes exotic flavors or craves hearty meals, then he will explore street food. If someone follows food blogs, then they either try Khai's stew or recommend it to friends. If Petal appreciates traditions, then he either loves local food or supports local businesses (or both). Khai does not have new experiences. Khai does not explore culture. Khai does not sample regional specialties. If someone visits Khai's stall and tries the stew, then they become a regular customer. Petal either stays in one city or travels to new places, but not at the same time. If Khai appreciates traditions, then he either loves local food or supports local businesses (or both). If Daphne enjoys soups, then he will explore street food and try the stew. Simon does not support local businesses. If Khai enjoys soups, then he will explore street food and try the stew. Simon does not have new experiences. Petal does not sample regional specialties. Daphne enjoys soups. If Khai either explores culture or stays in one city (but not both), then he has new experiences. If Khai gets bored and seeks adventure, then he travels to new places. Anyone who travels to new places will either sample regional specialties or try local cuisine (or both). If Khai craves spicy food, then he will venture outdoors and try local cuisine. Khai appreciates traditions. If Khai loves local food, then he will visit his own stall. Khai enjoys soups.
Conclusion: Khai does not become a regular customer.
