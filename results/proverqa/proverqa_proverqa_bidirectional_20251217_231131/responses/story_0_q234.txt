Premises: If Addilynn either partners with companies or exports goods overseas (but not both), then she enters global markets. If someone establishes an international office, then they enter global markets. If Addilynn either develops new products or enters global markets (but not both), then she expands into new markets. Anyone who embraces challenges and is open-minded thinks outside the box. Addilynn is either business-savvy or takes risks, but not both. Addilynn does not invest in a startup. Addilynn does not export goods overseas. Addilynn is open-minded. Addilynn does not develop new products. Addilynn embraces challenges. Addilynn has imagination. Addilynn partners with companies. If someone either invests in a startup or expands into new markets (but not both), then they take risks. If someone has imagination and thinks outside the box, then they are creative.
Conclusion: If Addilynn is either creative or business-savvy (but not both), then she is successful.
