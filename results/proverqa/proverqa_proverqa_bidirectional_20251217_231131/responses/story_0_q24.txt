Premises: Everyone who expresses themselves emotionally through their craft either performs publicly or composes original pieces (or both). If Noelle is musically gifted, then she will compose original pieces. For all humans, if someone is a piano prodigy, then they either read music fluently or improvise easily (or both). Noelle either composes original pieces or improvises easily, but not necessarily both. Noelle has perfect pitch. If Noelle appreciates harmony, then she is musically gifted. If Noelle has perfect pitch, then she either plays by ear or is classically trained, but not both. Those who create beautiful music are musically gifted. Jaime either plays by ear or is a piano prodigy, but not both. If Aisha is musically gifted, then she will compose original pieces. If Aisha has perfect pitch, then she either plays by ear or is classically trained, but not both. Noelle can play by ear if she learns music quickly. Aisha has perfect pitch. Noelle is classically trained. Noelle creates beautiful music. Noelle either plays by ear or is a piano prodigy, but not both. Valentina either composes original pieces or improvises easily, but not necessarily both.
Conclusion: Noelle does not read music fluently.
