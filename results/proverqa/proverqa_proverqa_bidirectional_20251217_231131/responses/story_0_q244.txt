Premises: Mila does not think critically. Mila communicates effectively. If someone is detail-oriented, then they are organized and focused. If Detective Mila either prioritizes tasks or meets deadlines (but not both), then she achieves her objectives. If Detective Omar sets clear goals, then she either manages her time effectively or achieves her objectives, but not both. Detective Omar does not value accuracy. If Detective Mila remains calm, then she has experience and communicates effectively. Mila sets clear goals. If Detective Travis remains calm, then she has experience and communicates effectively. Mila manages her time effectively. Travis does not have experience. If Detective Mila either examines evidence or analyzes data (but not both), then she is detail-oriented. Mila is not focused. Anyone who prioritizes tasks or maintains records is organized. Anyone who is organized either handles pressure well or achieves their objectives (or both). Mila does not have experience. If Detective Mila sets clear goals, then she either manages her time effectively or achieves her objectives, but not both. If Detective Mila handles pressure well, then she is either someone who remains calm or someone who thinks critically (but not both). Omar communicates effectively. Omar is not focused. If Detective Crue handles pressure well, then she is either someone who remains calm or someone who thinks critically (but not both). Detective Omar is not procedural. Travis does not follow protocol. Crue sets clear goals.
Conclusion: Detective Mila is meticulous, or procedural, or detail-oriented.
