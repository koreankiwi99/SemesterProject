Premises: For every person, either they find inner peace or they discover a new meaning in life, but these two are not necessarily related. For Matthew, facing challenges and finding solace are mutually exclusive. Matthew loses everything. If Matthew reassesses his priorities, then he either discovers a new meaning in life or restarts his life (or both). If someone hits rock bottom, then they reassess their priorities. Matthew faces challenges. If Matthew restarts his life, then he will either pursue his passion or find solace, but not both. Anyone who loses everything will hit rock bottom. Matthew finds inner peace.
Conclusion: Matthew pursues his passion.
