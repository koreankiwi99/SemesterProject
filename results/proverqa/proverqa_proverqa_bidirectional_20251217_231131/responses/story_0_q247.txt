Premises: Anyone who respects differences values individuality. For all humans, if they express emotions and value individuality, then they are passionate. If someone is inspired, then they express emotions and are open-minded. Rudy is open-minded. Anyone who embraces imperfection or follows their intuition is inspired. Rudy respects differences. If Rudy is free-spirited, then he is either creative or passionate (but not both). Rudy is either creative or authentic (or both). Rudy is free-spirited. If Rudy listens intently, then he will be inspired. Rudy embraces imperfection.
Conclusion: Rudy is not authentic.
