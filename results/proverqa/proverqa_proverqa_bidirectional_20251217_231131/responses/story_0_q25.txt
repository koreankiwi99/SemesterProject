Premises: Ramon sets high goals. If Ramon sets challenging targets, then he either practices often or achieves success (or both). Ramon analyzes games or studies opponents. If someone thinks ahead and anticipates outcomes, then they can have a strategic mind. Ramon develops new openings. If Ramon has a strategic mind, then he can either win major tournaments or become a legend in chess, but not both. Anyone who thinks critically has a strategic mind. Ramon thinks critically. Ramon does not dedicate time to achieve his goals. For Ramon, he either develops new openings or analyzes games, but not necessarily both. Everyone who sets high goals either dedicates time to achieve them or practices often (or both). If someone studies their opponents and practices often, then they can win major tournaments.
Conclusion: Ramon does not become a legend in chess.
