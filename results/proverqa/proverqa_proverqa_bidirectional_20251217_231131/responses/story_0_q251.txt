Premises: Leanna lives a fulfilling life or finds happiness. Leanna retires. If someone sets goals and surrounds themselves with support, then they can stay positive. If Leanna takes risks, then she either learns from her mistakes or surrounds herself with support. Leanna either faces adversity or embraces change, but not both at the same time. Leanna sets goals. Leanna follows her heart or lives a fulfilling life. Everyone who follows their dreams either achieves success or discovers their talent (or both). If someone finds happiness and stays positive, then they can bounce back. If Leanna either has good health or has social connections (but not both), then she stays positive. Sarai does not embrace change. If Leanna pursues her lifelong passion, then she will achieve recognition and live a fulfilling life. Leanna does not embrace change. Sarai lives a fulfilling life or finds happiness. If someone follows their heart and discovers their talent, then they can find happiness. Everyone who overcomes fear either surrounds themselves with support or builds confidence (or both). Gian either faces adversity or embraces change, but not both at the same time. If Leanna retires, then she will pursue her lifelong passion. If Leanna can bounce back, then she will achieve success. Leanna does not build confidence. Leanna overcomes fear. Leanna either faces adversity or achieves success, but not both at the same time.
Conclusion: Leanna does not achieve recognition.
