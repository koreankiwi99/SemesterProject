Premises: If Ramon plays chess, then he either anticipates outcomes or studies games, but not both. Ramon analyzes situations. If Ramon either plans ahead or anticipates outcomes (but not both), then he is strategic. Anyone who analyzes situations or evaluates risks can solve problems logically. Ramon is fascinated by tactics. If Ramon is strategic, then he is either creative or a logical problem solver, but not both. Ramon does not evaluate risks. Ramon plans ahead. Ramon plays chess. Anyone who sets goals or makes plans is strategic. If someone is fascinated by tactics, then they study games and learn from experience.
Conclusion: Ramon cannot outmaneuver his opponents.
