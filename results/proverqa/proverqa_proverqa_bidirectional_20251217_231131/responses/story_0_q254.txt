Premises: Gustavo learns from failure. Anyone who makes impossible shots either masters strategies or wins competitions. If Gustavo is a skilled archer, then he can either anticipate his opponent's moves or make impossible shots, but not both. Gustavo pursues perfection. For Gustavo, either he achieves success or he experiences failure, but not both at the same time. If Gustavo either pursues perfection or remains humble, then he achieves success. Everyone who becomes legendary does not remain humble, and everyone who remains humble does not necessarily become legendary. Gustavo experiences failure. If Gustavo wins competitions and stays focused, then he becomes legendary. Gustavo does not master strategies. Gustavo manages pressure or stays focused. Gustavo either learns from failure or manages pressure, but not both. Gustavo is a skilled archer.
Conclusion: Gustavo cannot anticipate his opponent's moves.
