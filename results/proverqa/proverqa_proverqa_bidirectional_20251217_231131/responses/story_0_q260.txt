Premises: Norah is not careful. Norah publishes her findings. If Norah has attention to detail, then she is either an archaeologist or is careful (or both). Norah thinks logically. If Norah is an analyst, then she is either systematic or methodical (but not both). Norah is an analyst. If Norah publishes her findings, then she is an expert researcher. Norah has attention to detail. Anyone who solves puzzles is perceptive. If Norah works precisely, then she is either systematic or thinks logically (but not both). All archaeologists are either meticulous or perceptive. If someone is an expert researcher, then they are either methodical or perceptive. Norah works precisely.
Conclusion: Norah is not intelligent.
