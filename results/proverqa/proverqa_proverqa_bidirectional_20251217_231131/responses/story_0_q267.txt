Premises: Peter is not influential. Gabriella either enters the workforce or pursues higher education, but not both. Liv is not a meticulous editor. If Gabriella is a published author, then she is either a seasoned publisher or a respected authority, but not both. Gabriella has strong opinions. If Liv is either a meticulous editor or a talented writer (but not both), then she is a respected authority. If Gabriella is either a meticulous editor or a talented writer (but not both), then she is a respected authority. Gabriella either reads widely or is a published author, but not both. Anyone who has strong opinions and writes articles can be influential. Everyone who either attends seminars or has expansive knowledge is able to communicate effectively. If Gabriella pursues higher education, then she either conducts extensive research or attends seminars, but not both. Peter conducts extensive research or writes articles. Lily either enters the workforce or pursues higher education, but not both. Peter does not enter the workforce. Gabriella does not enter the workforce. Anyone who reads widely or has voracious curiosity will have expansive knowledge. If Liv pursues higher education, then she either conducts extensive research or attends seminars, but not both. Lily is not able to communicate effectively. Gabriella is not able to communicate effectively. Gabriella is a seasoned publisher. Gabriella conducts extensive research or writes articles. Liv is a seasoned publisher. Liv either reads widely or is a published author, but not both. Gabriella is not influential. Liv has strong opinions. Gabriella is not a meticulous editor.
Conclusion: Gabriella is not a talented writer.
