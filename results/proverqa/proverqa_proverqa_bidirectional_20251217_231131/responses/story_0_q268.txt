Premises: Everly is a fast swimmer. Everly is agile. Uriah either has natural camouflage or lives in coral, but not necessarily both. If Rhea swims in schools, then she is either agile or darts quickly, but not both. Everly does not have many fins. Rhea swims in schools. All clownfish that thrive in reefs have natural camouflage and form symbiotic relationships. Everly either has natural camouflage or lives in coral, but not necessarily both. Everly is young. Everly swims in schools. If Everly swims in schools, then she is either agile or darts quickly, but not both. If Everly is a young clownfish, then she is either small or has many fins, but not both. Uriah is agile. If Everly is a small clownfish, then she is either a fast swimmer or has bright coloration, but not both. Everly either has bright coloration or thrives in reefs, but not necessarily both.
Conclusion: If Everly has an anemone home, then she is either protected from predators or helps nourish the anemone, but not both.
