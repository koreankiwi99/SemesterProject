Premises: Amiyah does not pioneer medical breakthroughs. Amiyah does not make new discoveries. If Amiyah is an expert or makes new discoveries, then she gains recognition. If Amiyah has sapremia, then she can either receive innovative treatment or contribute to medical research, but not both. Amiyah does not gain recognition. Amiyah attends conferences. Amiyah teaches at a university. If Amiyah works in a lab, then she can either contribute to medical research or teach at a university, but not both. If someone publishes scientific papers and attends conferences, then they can become an expert. Amiyah does not have a rare condition. If Amiyah receives innovative treatment, then she either has a rare condition or pioneers medical breakthroughs (or both). Amiyah either publishes scientific papers or works in a lab, but not both. If Amiyah collects data or analyzes results, then she can publish scientific papers.
Conclusion: Amiyah has sapremia.
