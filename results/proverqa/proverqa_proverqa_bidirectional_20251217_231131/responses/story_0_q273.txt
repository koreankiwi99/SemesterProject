Premises: Aspyn cultivates her imagination. Aspyn enjoys drawing or has creative talent. If Aspyn has creative talent, then she can either become a professional artist or maintain it only as a hobby, but not both. If Aspyn dedicates her life to art, then she will pursue a full-time career in it. Aspyn values self-expression. Aspyn does not play music. Aspyn either plays music or writes poetry. Aspyn either writes poetry or enjoys drawing, but not both. Aspyn either pursues a full-time career or maintains her art only as a hobby, but not both. If Aspyn values self-expression, then she dedicates her life to art and cultivates imagination.
Conclusion: Aspyn becomes a professional artist.
