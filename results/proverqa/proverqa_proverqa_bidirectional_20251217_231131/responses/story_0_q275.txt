Premises: If someone enjoys writing, then they express themselves creatively. If Maddison works in a library, then she either creates indexes or organizes collections, but not both. If someone keeps diaries and creates poetry, then they enjoy writing. Anyone who shares learning appreciates history or promotes education (or both). Maddison does not promote education. Anyone who collects rare texts either values knowledge or shares learning (or both). Maddison does not appreciate history. If Maddison has a good memory or is detail-oriented, then she can collect rare texts. If Maddison values knowledge, then she works in archives and organizes collections. If Maddison admires scholars, then she collects rare texts and treasures ancient wisdom. Maddison either works in archives or studies librarianship, but not both. If Maddison either translates texts or edits manuscripts (but not both), then she shares learning. Maddison either enjoys writing or loves books, but these two interests are mutually exclusive. Maddison admires scholars. Maddison does not express herself creatively.
Conclusion: Maddison can become a curator.
