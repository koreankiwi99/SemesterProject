Premises: Hadleigh evaluates outcomes. For anyone who appreciates botany and enjoys care giving, they can study horticultural therapy. Hadleigh has curiosity. If someone pursues their passion, then they face challenges and think outside the box. Hadleigh pursues her passion. If someone assesses situations and evaluates outcomes, then they can take calculated risks. If Hadleigh either sets high goals or overcomes obstacles (but not both), then she faces challenges. If Jayla either takes calculated risks or questions conventional wisdom (but not both), then she thinks outside the box. Jayla pursues her passion. If Jayla faces challenges, then she is either persistent or stays motivated, but not both. Anyone who explores new ideas and seeks innovative solutions is thinking outside the box. If Hadleigh has curiosity, then she either assesses situations or solves problems, but not both. Hadleigh does not question conventional wisdom. If Hadleigh either takes calculated risks or questions conventional wisdom (but not both), then she thinks outside the box. Hadleigh stays motivated. Issac evaluates outcomes. If Jayla studies horticultural therapy and has persistence, then she will succeed in research. Hadleigh does not solve problems. If Hadleigh faces challenges, then she is either persistent or stays motivated, but not both. If Hadleigh has experience, then she assesses situations and collaborates with others.
Conclusion: Hadleigh will succeed in research.
