Premises: Crew does not know biology. If Crew either rescues amphibians or researches marine life (but not both), then he studies axolotls. If Crew loves aquatic life, then he will study axolotls. Crew does not have a passion for nature. If someone cares for animals and understands ecology, then they can advocate for conservation. Anyone who enjoys scuba diving and appreciates marine life will love aquatic life. For all humans, if they value wildlife and help endangered species, then they care for animals. Crew helps endangered species. If Crew studies axolotls, then he either establishes a sanctuary or advocates for their conservation, but not both. Crew knows biology or understands ecology. Crew values wildlife. Crew has a passion for nature or loves aquatic life.
Conclusion: Crew does not establish a sanctuary.
