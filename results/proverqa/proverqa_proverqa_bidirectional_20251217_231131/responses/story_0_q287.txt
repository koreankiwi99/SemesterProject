Premises: If Andi either reads avidly or analyzes data (but not both), then she is a fast learner. Noel is intelligent or adventurous. Noel does not retain information. If Noel either reads avidly or analyzes data (but not both), then she is a fast learner. Noel is a polyglot. If someone significantly contributes to their field, then they are intelligent. Cielo does not read avidly. Everyone who is a fast learner either has a good memory or retains information (or both). If Noel is a polyglot, then she either has a good memory or speaks multiple languages, but not both. Noel either communicates effectively or is intelligent, but not both. Noel does not read avidly. If Noel conducts research, then she either uncovers secrets or has a good memory (or both). Cielo does not retain information. Evander is intelligent or adventurous. Noel either speaks multiple languages or communicates effectively, but not both. Noel analyzes data.
Conclusion: Noel is adventurous.
