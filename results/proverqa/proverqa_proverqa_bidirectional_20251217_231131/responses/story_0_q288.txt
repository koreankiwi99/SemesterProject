Premises: Jasper is not a successful sailor. If Quincy respects the ocean, then he wins sailing competitions and has strong determination. Everyone who either studies tides or anticipates winds (but not both) respects the ocean. If Jasper respects the ocean, then he wins sailing competitions and has strong determination. If Jasper either sets priorities or overcomes obstacles (but not both), then he has strong determination. Quincy does not set goals. Paula does not read sea conditions. If Elodie knows weather patterns or masters navigation skills, then he can win sailing competitions. Jasper does not read sea conditions. Everyone who understands currents either plots their course or anticipates winds (or both). Paula understands currents. Elodie is not a successful sailor. Jasper does not plot his course. Jasper does not study tides. If Jasper studies charts, then he masters navigation skills. If Quincy either knows weather patterns or reads sea conditions (but not both), then he is a successful sailor. Jasper understands currents. All confident individuals who can win competitions also stay focused. If Jasper either knows weather patterns or reads sea conditions (but not both), then he is a successful sailor. Paula does not love challenges. Elodie does not study tides.
Conclusion: Jasper has sailing experience and masters navigation skills.
