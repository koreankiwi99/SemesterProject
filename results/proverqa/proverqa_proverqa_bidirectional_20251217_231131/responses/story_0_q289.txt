Premises: Cynthia has vision. If Cynthia is a manager, then she either acts on impulse or thinks carefully, but not both. Cynthia either acts on impulse or makes informed decisions, but not both. Cynthia either works hard or is a manager. If Cynthia is influential, then she either builds trust or commands attention (but not both). Anyone who holds leadership positions and has vision can drive innovation. Cynthia builds trust. If Cynthia either earns respect or commands attention (but not both), then she holds leadership positions. If Cynthia has authority, then she either thinks carefully or trusts her instinct, but not both. Cynthia does not drive innovation. Cynthia has authority. Everyone who works hard either achieves success or earns respect (or both). Everyone considers options or thinks carefully. Cynthia does not achieve success. Cynthia is influential. Cynthia trusts her instinct. Cynthia solves problems or holds leadership positions.
Conclusion: Cynthia protects her interests.
