Premises: Hope is mentally tough. If Hope has experience or is well-prepared, then she achieves her mountaineering goals. Hope is not physically fit. Hope does not have natural talent. Hope learns quickly or has experience. If Hope sets challenging goals, then she is either physically fit or well-prepared, but not both. Hope seeks adventure or sets challenging goals. Hope does not build resilience. Hope does not seek adventure. Hope pushes beyond her limits. Everyone who pushes beyond their limits either develops coping skills or is strategically grounded (or both). If Hope is either experienced or has natural talent (but not both), then she reaches the summit. Hope faces challenges. Hope either sets goals or reaches the summit. If Hope reaches the summit, then she is either mentally tough or strategically grounded (but not both). Anyone who faces challenges and develops coping skills can build resilience.
Conclusion: Hope achieves her mountaineering goals.
