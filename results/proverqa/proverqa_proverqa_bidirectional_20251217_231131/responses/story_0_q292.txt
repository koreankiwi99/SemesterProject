Premises: Aliyah trusts her instinct. Aliyah has strong intuition. Anyone who speaks confidently or writes clearly can communicate complex ideas. If Aliyah meets deadlines, then she either collaborates well or works independently, but not both. If Aliyah collaborates well, then she has strong intuition and can communicate complex ideas. Aliyah does not work independently. Aliyah either thinks logically or trusts her instinct, but not both. Aliyah does not evaluate data effectively. If Aliyah makes accurate conclusions, then she either thinks logically or evaluates data effectively (but not both). If someone is accurate, then they are either precise in measurements or reliable in findings (or both). For Aliyah, being able to communicate complex ideas and being reliable in findings are mutually exclusive. Everyone who approaches problems systematically either thinks logically or considers multiple perspectives (or both). Aliyah does not have attention to detail. Aliyah is accurate or innovative. Aliyah meets deadlines. If Aliyah is precise in measurements, then she either has attention to detail or makes accurate conclusions (but not both).
Conclusion: Aliyah is not innovative.
