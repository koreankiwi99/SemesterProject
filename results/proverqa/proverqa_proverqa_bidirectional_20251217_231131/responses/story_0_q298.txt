Premises: Muppet does not become more efficient. All robots that acquire new skills learn from experience and improve their performance. If Muppet either executes predefined programs or follows scheduled routines (but not both), then it receives remote commands. Muppet improves its performance. Any robot that can process information is able to analyze data. If a robot learns from experience and achieves its mission objectives, then it becomes more efficient. Muppet does not operate offline. Muppet either performs tasks autonomously or has advanced sensors. For all robots, if a robot has advanced sensors and has deep learning capabilities, then it can make informed decisions. Muppet can process information. Muppet either receives remote commands or performs tasks autonomously, but not both. If Muppet makes precise calculations, then it will achieve its mission objectives. Muppet either receives remote commands or operates offline, but not both. Muppet acquires new skills. Every robot that can analyze data either has deep learning capabilities or can make precise calculations.
Conclusion: Muppet can make informed decisions.
