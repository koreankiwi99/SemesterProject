Premises: If Oaklyn has elegance, then she inspires others and forms strong bonds with her rider. All well-trained horses have endurance and are athletic. Oaklyn builds muscle. Oaklyn has a gray coat. Makenna builds muscle. If Oaklyn has a gray coat, then she either has refined features or possesses a calm temperament, but not both. All horses that mature slowly have endurance and develop strength. If Oaklyn is athletic, then she can either win competitions or inspire others, but not both. If Oaklyn either gallops freely or shows elegance (but not both), then she inspires others. All horses with refined movement have elegance. Oaklyn is not agile. If Oaklyn has discipline, then she is either agile or well-trained, but not both. Oaklyn does not have refined features. Oaklyn grows strong or matures slowly. Every horse that possesses a calm temperament either has elegance or displays grace (or both). If Oaklyn either grows tall or builds muscle (but not both), then she matures slowly. Oaklyn does not grow tall. Oaklyn has discipline. Oaklyn does not display grace.
Conclusion: Oaklyn does not win competitions.
