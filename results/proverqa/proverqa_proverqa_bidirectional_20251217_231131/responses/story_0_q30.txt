Premises: Raelynn prioritizes stability. Raelynn does not take risks. Raelynn is curious. If someone either pushes boundaries or works with traditional techniques (but not both), then they are innovative. If Raelynn is innovative or takes risks, then she will achieve success. If Raelynn has a creative vision, then she will either achieve success or build a strong network, but not both. If Raelynn is curious, then she either thinks outside the box or pushes boundaries, but not both. If Major experiments with materials, then she creates innovative products. Raelynn does not think outside the box. Raelynn either experiments with materials or works with traditional techniques, but not both. Major does not take risks. Raelynn either prioritizes stability or can achieve success, but not both.
Conclusion: Raelynn creates innovative products.
