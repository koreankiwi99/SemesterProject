Premises: If Treasure is disciplined, then she is either enduring or has stamina, but not both. Treasure has light bones. Treasure has muscle mass. If Byron has endurance or responds to training, then she is strong-willed. Treasure has stamina. If Matteo is disciplined, then she is either enduring or has stamina, but not both. Matteo is loyal. For all horses, if they are agile, then they are athletic and have good reflexes. Treasure is either prone to nervousness or responds well to training, but not both. Treasure is prone to nervousness. All athletic horses are fast and strong-willed. Any horse that is built for speed or highly trained is athletic. If Treasure has muscle mass or has light bones, then she is built for speed. Byron is disciplined. Any horse that handles pressure has endurance or remains calm (or both). Treasure is disciplined.
Conclusion: Treasure is valued.
