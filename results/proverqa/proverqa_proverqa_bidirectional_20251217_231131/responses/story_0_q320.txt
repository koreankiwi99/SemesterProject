Premises: Kayson has adaptability. If Kayson lives in an arid land, then he either has strong coils or specialized scales, but not both. Kayson does not have strong coils. Kayson cannot survive in harsh environments. If Kayson lives in the desert, then he is either camouflaged or has a striking pattern (or both). All snakes that live in the desert have good vision and are camouflaged. If a snake is either an expert hunter or a desert dweller (but not both), then it slides through the sand. Kayson has stealth. All snakes with effortless movement either have remarkable speed or specialized scales (or both). If Kayson has a striking pattern, then he is venomous and has a deadly reputation. Edith lives in an arid land. Kayson does not dominate his territory. If a snake is a skilled predator and has stealth, then it dominates its territory. If a snake is adaptable and camouflaged, then it can survive in harsh environments. Kayson lives in an arid land. Carla is not a fast mover. Kayson is an expert hunter. All snakes with specialized scales are either skilled predators or have a deadly reputation (or both). For all snakes, having venom glands and injecting toxic fluid makes them venomous. Kayson is not a fast mover. All snakes that slide through the sand are fast movers.
Conclusion: Kayson is not agile.
