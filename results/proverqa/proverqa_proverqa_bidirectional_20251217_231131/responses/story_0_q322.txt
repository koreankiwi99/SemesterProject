Premises: If Gracelyn has talent, then she is either content or disillusioned, but not both. Gracelyn is not inspired. If Gracelyn is passionate, then she is either inspired or creative (but not both). Gracelyn does not seek new challenges. For every human, either they have found their artistic voice or they have not found it, but not both. If Amalia is creative, then she has either found her artistic voice or is disillusioned, but not both. If Gracelyn struggles to create, then she has either found fulfillment or is disillusioned, but not both. Gracelyn does not have a clear mind. If Gracelyn is creative, then she has either found her artistic voice or is disillusioned, but not both. Gracelyn is motivated. If Gracelyn explores options or seeks new challenges, then she can discover a new medium. If Gracelyn is motivated, then she either finds her flow or has a clear mind, but not both. Gracelyn struggles to create. Gracelyn explores options. Gracelyn is passionate. Anyone who discovers a new medium or finds their flow can feel fulfilled.
Conclusion: Gracelyn has not found her artistic voice.
