Premises: Scarlet tells stories. If Ezrah either communicates effectively or listens actively (but not both), then she can convey complex ideas. Ezrah does not understand human nature. Camilo cannot uncover hidden truths. Ezrah tells stories. For anyone who interprets symbols and offers valuable insights, they can uncover hidden truths. Ezrah does not listen actively. Ezrah is attuned to others. If Ezrah has charisma, then she either speaks passionately or has authority, but not both. If Ezrah possesses a gift, then she either understands human nature or communicates effectively (or both). If Camilo possesses a gift, then she either understands human nature or communicates effectively (or both). If Olivia tells stories, then she speaks passionately and has conviction. Ezrah does not inspire others. Ezrah cannot uncover hidden truths. If someone conveys complex ideas and speaks passionately, then they can inspire others. If Olivia is attuned to others, then she interprets symbols and has intuitive abilities. If Camilo either communicates effectively or listens actively (but not both), then she can convey complex ideas. Ezrah has conviction. If Ezrah either reads energy or senses vibrations (but not both), then she possesses a gift. If Ezrah is attuned to others, then she interprets symbols and has intuitive abilities. If Ezrah tells stories, then she speaks passionately and has conviction.
Conclusion: Ezrah does not gain people's trust.
