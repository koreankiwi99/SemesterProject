Premises: Leilani examines mineral formations. For any mineralogist, they either examine mineral formations or study crystal structures, but it's possible to do both. Any mineralogist who works hard or sets goals is diligent. Every mineralogist who draws accurate conclusions either studies crystal structures or contributes to technology advancements (or both). Leilani either publishes research or focuses on theoretical work, but not both. If Leilani is either diligent or innovative (but not both), then she is distinguished. If Leilani is an experienced mineralogist, then she either evaluates results or draws accurate conclusions, but not both. Leilani is innovative. Leilani focuses on theoretical work. All meticulous mineralogists analyze samples and draw accurate conclusions. Leilani does not contribute to technology advancements. All diligent mineralogists are meticulous and publish research.
Conclusion: Leilani is not distinguished.
