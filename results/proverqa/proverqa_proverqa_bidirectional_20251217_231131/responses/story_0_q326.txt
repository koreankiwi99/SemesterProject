Premises: If Jaylani is adaptable, then she thrives alone and embraces freedom. Jaylani loves nature. Jaylani either enjoys stability or likes travel, but not both. Everyone who values comfort either enjoys stability or settles down (or both). If Jaylani loves nature, then she either values comfort or appreciates routine, but not both. Jaylani is adaptable. Jaylani either settles down or embraces freedom, but not both. Jaylani is either a land lover or a sea goer, but not both. Anyone who has a family tends to enjoy stability. Jaylani does not appreciate routine. Jaylani either likes travel or is a land lover.
Conclusion: Jaylani is a sea goer.
