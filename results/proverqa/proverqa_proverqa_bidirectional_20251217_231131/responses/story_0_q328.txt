Premises: If Paloma is attentive to details, then she understands lighting and visualizes compositions. If someone understands lighting, then they may not necessarily compose framing well, and vice versa. If Quinn has good eyesight, then she is either detail-oriented or culturally sensitive (but not both). Paloma cannot edit images. Jordan does not have artistic talent. If Paloma has good eyesight, then she is either detail-oriented or culturally sensitive (but not both). Paloma either buys quality equipment or has a creative vision. If Paloma either sees beyond appearance or finds unique angles (but not both), then she has a creative vision. If Paloma knows photography techniques and buys quality equipment, then she has a good camera. If Paloma has a creative vision, then she either understands lighting or can edit images, but not both. Quinn cannot edit images. Paloma is detail-oriented. If Paloma travels extensively and has a good camera, then she can become a professional photographer. If Paloma becomes a professional photographer, then she will take stunning photos. Doobie is culturally sensitive. Paloma does not have artistic talent. Paloma knows photography techniques. If Paloma takes stunning photos, then she either has good eyesight or artistic talent (but not both). Anyone who captures intimate moments or tells powerful stories can take stunning photos. Paloma composes framing well. Paloma is culturally sensitive.
Conclusion: Paloma travels extensively.

-- Premises
-- If Paloma is attentive to details (detail-oriented), then she understands lighting and visualizes compositions.
axiom ax1 : DetailOriented Paloma → (UnderstandsLighting Paloma ∧ VisualizesCompositions Paloma)

-- If someone understands lighting, then they may not necessarily compose framing well, and vice versa.
-- We formalize "and vice versa" as mutual exclusivity:
