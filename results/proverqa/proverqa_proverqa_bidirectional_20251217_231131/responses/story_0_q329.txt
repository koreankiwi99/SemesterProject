Premises: King Cruz does not evaluate options. If King Cruz has leadership skills, then he either makes wise decisions or shows empathy, but not both. If King Cruz either analyzes situations or considers alternatives (but not both), then he makes wise decisions. King Cruz has leadership skills. Anyone who possesses good judgment will make wise decisions. Everyone who seeks counsel either evaluates options or possesses good judgment (or both). King Quinn does not rule wisely. If King Ezra has leadership skills, then he either makes wise decisions or shows empathy, but not both. King Cruz seeks counsel. King Adriana does not evaluate options. Anyone who considers others or understands feelings can show empathy.
Conclusion: If King Cruz is a just ruler, then he either brings prosperity or forges unity (or both).
