Premises: Tyson is an experienced gamer. If Andy either masters new skills or adapts to changes (but not both), then he is a quick learner. Andy is a team player. If Andy is an experienced gamer, then he is either a dedicated leader or a strategic thinker, but not both. If Andy either plays regularly or analyzes gameplay (but not both), then he is a skilled player. Andy is a strategic thinker. Andy does not master new skills. Andy is an experienced gamer. Houston does not master new skills. If Tyson is an experienced gamer, then he is either a dedicated leader or a strategic thinker, but not both. Andy thinks critically. Houston is a team player. If Sophia is a top-ranked gamer, then he is either a team player or a skilled player, but not both. If Andy is a top-ranked gamer, then he is either a team player or a skilled player, but not both. All active participants who are top-ranked gamers are quick learners. If Andy sets high standards, then he is a dedicated leader. If Andy has good reflexes or makes strategic moves, then he is top-ranked. Tyson is a strategic thinker. Any gamer who stays focused or thinks critically can adapt to changes. Houston thinks critically. Tyson is an active participant. Andy is an active participant.
Conclusion: Andy is not respected.
