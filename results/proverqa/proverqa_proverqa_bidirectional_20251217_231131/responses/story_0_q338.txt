Premises: If Ameer earns recognition or leads by example, then he can advance knowledge. If Dahlia studies hard, then he makes meaningful contributions to society. If Ameer is passionate about research, then he collaborates with others and specializes in a field. If Ameer pursues higher education, then he either becomes an expert or makes meaningful contributions to society (or both). Everyone either specializes in a specific field or advances knowledge, but not necessarily both. Ameer is passionate about research. If someone prioritizes the wellbeing of others, then they have strong ethics. If someone has vision and takes initiative, then they can lead by example. Ameer collaborates with others. Ameer prioritizes the wellbeing of others. Ameer values integrity or pursues noble goals. If Declan either makes meaningful contributions or pursues noble goals (but not both), then he leads by example. If Ameer either makes meaningful contributions or pursues noble goals (but not both), then he leads by example. If Ameer either publishes research or mentors students (but not both), then he can advance knowledge. Ameer does not inspire others. Anyone who has strong ethics and pursues noble goals will inspire others. If Ameer studies hard, then he makes meaningful contributions to society.
Conclusion: Ameer does not study hard.
