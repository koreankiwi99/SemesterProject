Premises: Presley does not try new techniques. If Presley is an innovative artist, then he either creates visually stunning work or applies mathematical principles in his art (or both). Presley takes creative risks. If an artist understands color theory and uses natural light effectively, then they can create visually stunning work. Presley does not pursue creative expression. For Presley, either his work focuses on functionality or it creates visually stunning effects, but these two aspects are mutually exclusive. If an artist is comfortable with taking risks, they will experiment fearlessly. Every artist who experiments fearlessly pushes boundaries. If Presley either tries new techniques or takes creative risks (but not both), then he is comfortable with uncertainty. All artists who push boundaries are innovative artists. For Presley, either his work focuses on functionality or he pursues creative expression, but these two aspects are mutually exclusive.
Conclusion: Presley applies mathematical principles in his art.
