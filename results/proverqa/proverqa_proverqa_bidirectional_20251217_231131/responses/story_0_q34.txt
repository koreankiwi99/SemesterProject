Premises: Chana either prioritizes tasks or handles multiple projects. All excellent troubleshooters are respected experts and have a strong work ethic. If Chana either identifies root causes or develops creative solutions (but not both), then she is an excellent troubleshooter. Chana does not work under pressure. If Chana leads critical projects, then she either demonstrates professionalism or has a strong work ethic, but not both. Vivian is a key team member. Anyone who consistently meets deadlines has a strong work ethic. Chana is a key team member. Chana is not highly motivated. Chana does not handle multiple projects. If Chana is a key team member, then she is either an excellent troubleshooter or highly motivated, but not both. Anyone who prioritizes tasks and manages time can meet deadlines. Chana either works under pressure or is organized, but not both. If someone is organized, then they manage their time effectively.
Conclusion: Chana does not have in-depth data analysis abilities.
