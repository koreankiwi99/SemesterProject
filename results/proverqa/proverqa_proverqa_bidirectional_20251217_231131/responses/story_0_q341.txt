Premises: Ahmad makes discoveries. Jasiah makes discoveries. Anyone who thinks critically will solve problems. Ahmad enhances his knowledge. If Ahmad is curious, then he can either make discoveries or drive innovation, but not both. Riley enhances his knowledge. Ahmad asks questions. Riley is inquisitive. If Ahmad pursues research, then he can either achieve recognition or drive innovation, but not both. Ahmad thinks critically. If someone has imagination, then they seek answers and explore concepts. If Ahmad either asks questions or explores concepts (but not both), then he is curious. Creed thinks critically. If Creed pursues research, then he can either achieve recognition or drive innovation, but not both. If Ahmad either examines data or investigates phenomena (but not both), then he has curiosity. Riley asks questions. Ahmad reads widely. Ahmad is inquisitive. Anyone who has expertise or collaborates widely can drive innovation. If Ahmad solves problems, then he pursues research and enhances his knowledge. If Ahmad either analyzes data or identifies patterns (but not both), then he solves problems. Creed reads widely. If Ahmad is inquisitive, then he either reads widely or explores concepts (but not both). If Creed either asks questions or explores concepts (but not both), then he is curious.
Conclusion: Ahmad achieves recognition.
