Premises: Everyone who values critique either embraces debate or is open-minded (or both). Anyone who considers alternatives and questions assumptions can challenge the status quo. Raphael has extensive knowledge. Raphael does not write influential books. Raphael is either a respected authority or has unconventional views, but not both. Anyone who has extensive knowledge and speaks authoritatively gains recognition. Raphael is either a respected authority or a doubted expert, but not both. Raphael does not embrace debate. Raphael does not gain recognition. If Raphael challenges the status quo, then he either writes influential books or speaks authoritatively (or both). If someone is open-minded and has unconventional views, then they challenge the status quo. Raphael values critique.
Conclusion: Raphael is a doubted expert.

open Classical

-- Derived facts

-- From values critique and not embracing debate, Raphael is open-minded.
theorem openMinded_R : OpenMinded Raphael := by
  have h := ax1 Raphael ax12
  cases h with
  | inl hED =>
    exact False.elim (ax8 hED)
  | inr hOM =>
    exact hOM

-- If Raphael has unconventional views, he challenges the status quo (using open-mindedness).
theorem challenges_from_UV : UnconventionalViews Raphael → ChallengesStatusQuo Raphael := by
  intro hUV
  exact ax11 Raphael ⟨openMinded_R, hUV⟩

-- If Raphael challenges the status quo, then (by ax10 and ax4) he speaks authoritatively.
theorem speaks_from_challenges : ChallengesStatusQuo Raphael → SpeaksAuthoritatively Raphael := by
  intro hC
  have h := ax10 hC
  cases h with
  | inl hWIB =>
    exact False.elim (ax4 hWIB)
  | inr hSA =>
    exact hSA

-- If Raphael speaks authoritatively and has extensive knowledge, he gains recognition.
theorem gains_from_SA : SpeaksAuthoritatively Raphael → GainsRecognition Raphael := by
  intro hSA
  exact ax6 Raphael ⟨ax3, hSA⟩

-- If Raphael is not a respected authority, then (via ax5a) he has unconventional views, hence gains recognition.
theorem gains_if_not_RA : ¬ RespectedAuthority Raphael → GainsRecognition Raphael := by
  intro hNotRA
  have hDisj := ax5a
  have hUV : UnconventionalViews Raphael := by
    cases hDisj with
    | inl hRA => exact False.elim (hNotRA hRA)
    | inr hUV => exact hUV
  have hC : ChallengesStatusQuo Raphael := challenges_from_UV hUV
  have hSA : SpeaksAuthoritatively Raphael := speaks_from_challenges hC
  exact gains_from_SA hSA

-- Therefore, Raphael must be a respected authority (otherwise contradicts ax9).
theorem respected_R : RespectedAuthority Raphael := by
  by_cases hRA : RespectedAuthority Raphael
  · exact hRA
  · have hGR := gains_if_not_RA hRA
    exact False.elim (ax9 hGR)

-- Consequently, Raphael is not a doubted expert (by exclusivity ax7b).
theorem not_doubted_R : ¬ DoubtedExpert Raphael := by
  intro hDE
  exact ax7b ⟨respected_R, hDE⟩

-- The requested conclusion (Raphael is a doubted expert) does not follow from the premises.
-- In fact, its negation is derivable as shown above.
-- If one insists on the original conclusion as a theorem, it is unprovable from these premises.

-- For completeness, we restate the (unwanted) conclusion type without proof:
-- theorem goal : DoubtedExpert Raphael := by
--   admit
