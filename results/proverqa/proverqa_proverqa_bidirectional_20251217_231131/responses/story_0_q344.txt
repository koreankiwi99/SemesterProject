Premises: Jasper does not build businesses. If Jasper has financial knowledge, then he invests wisely. For Jasper, being knowledgeable about economics and valuing humility are mutually exclusive traits. Jasper manages his assets or has financial knowledge. Jasper either pursues material wealth or is philanthropic, but not both. Jasper reads market trends. Jasper lives a private life. If Jasper either donates to charity or supports local communities (but not both), then he is philanthropic. If someone understands economics and reads market trends, then they have financial knowledge. Jasper does not value humility. If Jasper either invests wisely or builds businesses (but not both), then he pursues material wealth. Jasper either lives a private life or is respected by others, but not both. If Philip either invests wisely or builds businesses (but not both), then he pursues material wealth. Jasper manages assets or invests wisely.
Conclusion: Jasper leaves a lasting impact.

  -- Attempt to derive a contradiction from the premises.
  -- From p7 and p12b we can derive ¬RespectedByOthers Jasper, but we have no premise forcing RespectedByOthers Jasper.
  -- From the other premises, we cannot derive a direct contradiction either.
  -- Thus, we are unable to derive False from the given premises.
