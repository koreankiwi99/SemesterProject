Premises: If Nathaniel has expert knowledge, then he either writes academic publications or is a consultant (or both). If someone works with communities, then they collaborate with experts and apply practical solutions. If Georgia is a consultant, then he either works with communities or develops environmental initiatives, but not both. If Nathaniel either analyzes data or collects samples (but not both), then he is dedicated to research. Nathaniel has expert knowledge or has special skills. Nathaniel does not have special skills. Pumpkin does not write academic publications. Nathaniel either pursues theoretical knowledge or is dedicated to research, but not both. If Nathaniel is dedicated to research, then he makes new discoveries. If Nathaniel has field experience and values social impact, then he will work with communities. Phillip either pursues theoretical knowledge or applies practical solutions, but not both. Anyone who is curious and seeks answers can pursue theoretical knowledge. Nathaniel does not write academic publications. Nathaniel does not promote eco-tourism. Nathaniel either pursues theoretical knowledge or applies practical solutions, but not both. Phillip either pursues theoretical knowledge or is dedicated to research, but not both. Nathaniel collaborates with experts. Nathaniel does not educate local residents. If Nathaniel develops environmental initiatives, then he either educates local residents or promotes eco-tourism, but not both. Phillip does not educate local residents. If someone identifies real problems and thinks creatively, then they can apply practical solutions. If Nathaniel is a consultant, then he either works with communities or develops environmental initiatives, but not both.
Conclusion: Nathaniel does not make new discoveries.
