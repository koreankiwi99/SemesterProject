Premises: For Looker, either he appreciates silence or he plays an instrument, but not both. Looker has a creative vision. For all humans, if they play an instrument or compose music (or both), then they bring people joy. If Boden is attuned to nature, then he expresses emotions deeply and values sincerity. Boden appreciates silence. If Looker has a creative vision, then he expresses emotions deeply and writes lyrics. Aidan appreciates silence. If Boden has a creative vision, then he expresses emotions deeply and writes lyrics. If Boden either writes lyrics or creates harmonies (but not both), then he composes music. For any person, they either convey emotions through their art or create harmonies, but not necessarily both. Isaac conveys emotions through his music. For Boden, either he appreciates silence or he plays an instrument, but not both. Boden conveys emotions through his music. Boden has a creative vision.
Conclusion: Boden does not bring people joy.
