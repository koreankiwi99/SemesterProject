Premises: Hunky enjoys outdoor games. If Quentin gets enough sleep or manages stress, but not both, then he is likely to maintain his overall well-being. If Trace is physically active, then he either exercises regularly or has good habits, but not both. Hunky either eats nutritious food or stays hydrated (or both). For all humans, if they receive proper medical care, then they can overcome health challenges. Oliver does not have good energy. Quentin feels happy or leads a healthy life. Quentin has good habits. If Quentin either gets enough sleep or stays hydrated (but not both), then he has good energy. If someone has a strong will and is surrounded by a supportive family, then they can overcome health challenges. If Trace either gets enough sleep or stays hydrated (but not both), then he has good energy. Anyone who has good posture and enjoys outdoor games is physically active. Hunky practices mindfulness. Quentin enjoys outdoor games. If Quentin has a high-pressure job, then he either manages stress or practices mindfulness, but not both. Quentin has a high-pressure job. Quentin practices mindfulness. If Oliver overcomes health challenges, then he will lead a healthy life. If Quentin overcomes health challenges, then he will lead a healthy life. Quentin has good posture. If Oliver gets enough sleep or manages stress, but not both, then he is likely to maintain his overall well-being. Quentin does not have good energy. If someone leads a healthy life, then they eat nutritious food and exercise regularly. If Quentin is physically active, then he either exercises regularly or has good habits, but not both.
Conclusion: Quentin receives proper medical care.
