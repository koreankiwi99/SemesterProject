Premises: If Aarav has a good memory and listens attentively, then he can speak many languages. If Aarav holds high office, then he is either respected or admired, but not both. For anyone who speaks many languages and understands cultures, they can communicate well. Aarav does not have local knowledge. If Aarav either speaks confidently or listens attentively (but not both), then he is respected. Anyone who has confidence and has wit can be charismatic. Aarav either values honesty or understands cultures, but no one necessarily possesses both qualities. If Aarav is well-traveled, then he either speaks many languages or has local knowledge, but not both. Aarav does not value honesty. If Cuteness is well-traveled, then he either speaks many languages or has local knowledge, but not both. Aarav is well-traveled. Anyone who serves nobly or negotiates effectively is admired. Aarav serves nobly. Aarav holds high office. Anyone who studies history or lives abroad understands cultures.
Conclusion: If Aarav is either charismatic or diplomatic (but not both), then he is respected.
