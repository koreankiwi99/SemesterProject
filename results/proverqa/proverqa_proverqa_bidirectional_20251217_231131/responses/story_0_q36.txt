Premises: If Murphy either writes efficient code or designs intuitive interfaces (but not both), then he is a good software developer. Murphy reads technical books. If Murphy is passionate about coding, then he is a good software developer and enjoys problem solving. Anyone who reads technical books and participates in hackathons is dedicated to learning. If Murphy is dedicated to learning, then he will build innovative products. Murphy joins online forums. For Murphy, either networking with peers or attending tech conferences (but not both) are ways to advance in his career. Murphy networks with his peers. Murphy enjoys problem solving. If Murphy builds innovative products, then he either values user feedback or is passionate about coding (or both). If Murphy either attends tech conferences or joins online forums (but not both), then he participates in hackathons. Murphy either codes regularly or attends tech conferences. Murphy does not value user feedback. If Murphy engages in self-study, then he either participates in hackathons or contributes to open source projects (or both).
Conclusion: Murphy creates fast software.
