Premises: If Caiden has a calm demeanor, then she can either soothe skittish animals or participate in therapy, but not both. If Esmeralda is curious, then she learns quickly. Esmeralda has keen instincts. Esmeralda has strong instincts. If Esmeralda has an even temper or remains calm under pressure, then she can soothe skittish animals. If Esmeralda has a calm demeanor, then she can either soothe skittish animals or participate in therapy, but not both. Lana has a calm demeanor. If Esmeralda has good memory and obeys her handler, then she is experienced. Wes either has strong instincts or adapts to her habitat, but she cannot necessarily do both. Caiden has an affectionate personality. Every horse that has a gentle nature either builds trust or soothes skittish animals. Esmeralda has an affectionate personality. Every horse follows its handler or establishes a connection with them. If a horse responds to commands and has an affectionate personality, then it can establish a connection with its handler. If a horse is experienced, then it either builds trust or establishes a connection with its handler. Esmeralda has a gentle nature. Esmeralda either has strong instincts or adapts to her habitat, but she cannot necessarily do both. If Esmeralda either performs tricks or adapts to her habitat (but not both), then she learns quickly. Esmeralda responds to commands. Lana has strong instincts. Wes responds to commands. Caiden has keen instincts. Lana performs tricks. Esmeralda has a calm demeanor. If Esmeralda has keen instincts and learns quickly, then she is experienced. If a horse listens attentively and remains composed, then it can build trust. Caiden has a gentle nature. Esmeralda performs tricks.
Conclusion: Esmeralda participates in therapy.

-- Negation of the conclusion (to prove the conclusion is false):
theorem not_participates_Esmeralda : ¬ ParticipatesTherapy Esmeralda := by
  -- Attempt to use the exclusive-or from calm demeanor:
  -- From premise6 and premise24 we know Esmeralda satisfies exactly one of:
  --  (SoothesSkittish ∧ ¬ParticipatesTherapy) or (ParticipatesTherapy ∧ ¬SoothesSkittish).
  -- To conclude ¬ParticipatesTherapy, it would suffice to derive SoothesSkittish Esmeralda,
  -- but the premises only give GentleNature Esmeralda → (BuildsTrust ∨ SoothesSkittish),
  -- which does not eliminate the BuildsTrust branch.
  -- No available premise rules out BuildsTrust Esmeralda, nor derives EvenTemper or CalmUnderPressure,
  -- so we cannot derive SoothesSkittish Esmeralda outright.
  -- Hence the proof cannot be completed from the given premises.
