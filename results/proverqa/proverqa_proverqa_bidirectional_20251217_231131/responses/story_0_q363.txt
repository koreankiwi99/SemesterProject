Premises: If Lenora either eats balanced meals or gets enough sleep (but not both), then she takes regular exercise. Coleson does not cook at home. Lenora chooses natural remedies. For Lenora, she either chooses natural remedies or avoids additives, but not both, when it comes to her health and wellness. For Coleson, she either chooses natural remedies or avoids additives, but not both, when it comes to her health and wellness. Anyone who reads nutrition labels or cooks at home eats balanced meals. Either Coleson has chronic pain or she is pain-free, but not both. Either Lenora has chronic pain or she is pain-free, but not both. If Lenora prioritizes wellness, then she makes informed choices and avoids additives. If someone either buys organic or avoids additives (but not both), then they shop healthy. Lenora buys organic. Lenora does not cook at home. Anyone who plans out their meals or tracks their nutrition eats balanced meals. Either Lenora takes regular exercise or she has chronic pain, but not both. Alena does not get enough sleep. If Lenora shops healthy, then she will read nutrition labels. Lenora does not get enough sleep. If Lenora has good habits, then she either practices mindfulness or shops healthy, but not both.
Conclusion: Lenora is pain-free.
