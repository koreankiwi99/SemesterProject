Premises: If someone either handles emergencies or makes quick decisions (but not both), then they work under pressure. Anyone who feels empathy and takes initiative will act selflessly. Kingsley does not prioritize others. If Valeria cares for others and acts selflessly, then she will be remembered as a hero. If someone stays calm, they may not always think critically, and vice versa. Kingsley prioritizes others or puts others first. Valeria does not save lives. Zain does not save lives. Valeria shows empathy or puts others first. Valeria stays calm. Valeria does not make quick decisions. If Valeria works under pressure, then she either saves lives or cares for others (or both). If Kingsley cares for others and acts selflessly, then she will be remembered as a hero. Valeria prioritizes others or puts others first. If Valeria either thinks critically or responds flexibly (but not both), then she is able to handle emergencies. Valeria does not prioritize others. If Kingsley either thinks critically or responds flexibly (but not both), then she is able to handle emergencies. Anyone who helps those in need or puts others first can act selflessly. Valeria responds flexibly. Everyone manages resources or handles emergencies.
Conclusion: Valeria will not be remembered as a hero.

  -- At this point, we cannot derive that Valeria handles emergencies (only that she is able to),
  -- and thus cannot derive she works under pressure; consequently we cannot obtain that she cares for others.

  -- Hence we leave the goal unproven.
