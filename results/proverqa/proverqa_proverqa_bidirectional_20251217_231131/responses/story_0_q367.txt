Example ID: 367
Premises: If Fallon documents her findings, she does not necessarily study their significance, and if Fallon studies the significance of her finds, she does not necessarily document them. If Fallon examines antiquities, then she either analyzes data or draws accurate conclusions, but not both. Fallon does not draw accurate conclusions. Fallon either explores historical sites or uncovers ancient artifacts. If Fallon uncovers ancient artifacts and studies their significance, then she will become an expert. Fallon either explores historical sites or interprets her finds correctly, but not both. If Fallon has an academic background or gains field experience, then she can interpret her finds correctly. Fallon does not analyze data. Dane does not document her findings. If Richard uncovers ancient artifacts and studies their significance, then she will become an expert. Fallon examines antiquities or interprets her finds correctly. If Fallon values history, then she examines antiquities. If Fallon is an archaeologist, then she either excavates ruins or explores historical sites, but not both. Fallon does not document her findings. If someone searches archaeological sites and uses specialized equipment, then they can uncover ancient artifacts.
Conclusion: Fallon did not become an expert.
