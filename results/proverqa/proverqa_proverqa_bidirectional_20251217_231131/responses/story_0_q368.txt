Premises: If Cassidy has an advanced degree, then she works in research. If Ayla can solve complex problems, then she has a creative mind and collaborates with others. Ayla either pursues innovation or engineers new technologies. Ayla does not receive an award. If Ayla is inquisitive, then she is either passionate about discovery or seeks knowledge (but not both). If Ayla enjoys learning, then she is passionate about discovery and mentors others. If Ayla pursues innovation, then she either publishes papers or receives an award (or both). Ayla thinks outside the box. If Ayla thinks critically, then she has a creative mind. Angie thinks outside the box. If Cassidy thinks outside the box, then she will design new products. If Ayla has a creative mind, then she either designs new products or engineers new technologies, but not both. If Ayla excels in science, then she will engineer new technologies. Ayla collaborates with others. Cassidy can solve complex problems. If Ayla is passionate about discovery, then she has an advanced degree and publishes papers. If Ayla thinks outside the box, then she will design new products. Cassidy is inquisitive. If Angie can solve complex problems, then she has a creative mind and collaborates with others. Ayla does not seek knowledge. Ayla is inquisitive. If Angie has a creative mind, then she either designs new products or engineers new technologies, but not both. Superstar does not seek knowledge. If Ayla has an advanced degree, then she works in research. Everyone who values progress either pursues innovation or mentors others (or both). If Superstar pursues innovation, then she either publishes papers or receives an award (or both). If Superstar is inquisitive, then she is either passionate about discovery or seeks knowledge (but not both). Ayla can solve complex problems.
Conclusion: Ayla does not work in research.
