Premises: Lucille does not have high endurance. Lucille has fast feet. If someone has strategic skills, then they are not necessarily a formidable fighter, and vice versa. Lucille does not have strategic skills. Lucille either trains rigorously or is motivated, but not both. If Lucille has quick reflexes, then she is aggressive. If Lucille either trains rigorously or delivers powerful blows (but not both), then she has high endurance. If Lucille is a professional boxer, then she either builds a strong physique or trains rigorously, but not both. If Lucille either has fast feet or quick reflexes, then she delivers powerful blows. Lucille is motivated.
Conclusion: Lucille is not defensive.
