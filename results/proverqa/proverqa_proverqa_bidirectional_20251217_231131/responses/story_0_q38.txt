Premises: If Schmoopy either sniffs out clues or follows trails (but not both), then she is able to discover hidden passages. Schmoopy does not find hidden food. If Schmoopy loves climbing and enjoys solving puzzles, then she is adventurous. Schmoopy does not fit in tight spaces. If Schmoopy has keen senses, then she either navigates mazes or digs burrows (but not both). If Schmoopy is adventurous, then she can either discover hidden passages or find hidden food, but not both. If Schmoopy has a small size, then she either lives in a mansion or fits in tight spaces (or both). If Schmoopy either navigates mazes or jumps obstacles (but not both), then she loves climbing. Schmoopy either enjoys shadows or fears darkness. Schmoopy does not jump obstacles. Schmoopy has a small size. Schmoopy is either curious or fearful of darkness, but not both. If Schmoopy lives in a mansion, then she either navigates mazes or runs quickly, but not both. If Schmoopy is nocturnal, then she is either fearful of darkness or has good vision, but not both. Schmoopy does not enjoy shadows. Schmoopy enjoys solving puzzles. Schmoopy does not run quickly. For any mouse, if it explores new areas and tries new things, then it is adventurous.
Conclusion: Schmoopy does not explore hidden rooms.
