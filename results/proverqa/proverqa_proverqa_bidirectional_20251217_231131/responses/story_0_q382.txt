Premises: Gustavo either struggles financially or achieves success, but not both. Anyone who understands emotions and expresses themselves sincerely can connect with their audience. If Myla listens to others, then he both values feedback and is down to earth. Gustavo is either charismatic or remains humble, but not both. Clayton does not listen to others. Gustavo struggles financially. If Gustavo appreciates support, then he works hard and remains humble. Anyone who respects their craft or connects with their audience can achieve success. Anyone who remains humble or is down to earth can connect with their audience.
Conclusion: Gustavo does not have exceptional talent.
