Premises: If Sailor guards his secrets, then he has charisma and creates intrigue. Sailor is not transparent. Anyone who has visible scars or a troubled past has experienced adversity. Sailor does not have charisma. Sailor either creates intrigue or is transparent, but not both. If Sailor builds trust, then he shows vulnerability and guards secrets. For Sailor, he either hides his vulnerability or opens up his emotions, but not both. Sailor tells compelling stories. Sailor either opens up his emotions or guards his secrets, but not both. If Sailor tells compelling stories, then he has experienced adversity or hides vulnerability. For all humans, if they have experienced adversity, then they have emotional depth.
Conclusion: Sailor has emotional depth.
