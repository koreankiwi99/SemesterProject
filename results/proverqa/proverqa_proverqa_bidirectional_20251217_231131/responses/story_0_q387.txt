Premises: Devin enjoys surfing. If Devin loves water, then he enjoys boating. Dahlia enjoys surfing. Devin has a passion for the ocean. If Devin enjoys boating, then he can either become a fisherman or work on a cruise, but not both. Devin studies ecology or becomes a fisherman. Dahlia has a passion for the ocean. Everyone who either likes sailing or owns a yacht (but not both) enjoys boating. Anthony lives in a coastal town or grew up by the sea. If Koa enjoys boating, then he can either become a fisherman or work on a cruise, but not both. If Devin grows up by the sea, then he can either become a marine biologist or a coastal steward, but not both. Devin does not work on a cruise. Devin lives in a coastal town or grew up by the sea. If Devin enjoys surfing, then he either has a beach house or lives in a coastal town (but not both). If Devin has a passion for the ocean, then he can either become a marine biologist or a fisherman, but not both. Devin has a beach house. Koa does not work on a cruise. If Dahlia loves water, then he enjoys boating. Anthony has a beach house. Devin loves water. If Anthony enjoys surfing, then he either has a beach house or lives in a coastal town (but not both). If Devin enjoys exploring outdoors, then he either becomes a conservationist or grows up by the sea (or both).
Conclusion: Devin does not become a coastal steward.
