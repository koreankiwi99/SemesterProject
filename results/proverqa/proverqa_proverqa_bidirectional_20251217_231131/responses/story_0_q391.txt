Premises: If a fish blends with its environment, then it avoids predators. Tiger does not protect his family. Everything guards his territory or becomes a leader. Tiger explores the reef. Captain does not protect his family. Everything has sharp teeth. Tiger does not hunt alone. Frank guards his territory. Tiger does not avoid predators. Every fish that feels secure either has good reflexes or swims confidently (or both). If Tiger lives in a coral reef, then he either blends with his environment or has camouflage scales (or both). If Tiger explores the reef, then he is either a confident swimmer or hunts alone, but not both. If Frank has sharp teeth and is fearless, then he will protect his family. If Tiger swims quickly, then he darts between rocks and has a unique appearance. If Captain explores the reef, then he is either a confident swimmer or hunts alone, but not both. If Tiger has sharp teeth and is fearless, then he will protect his family. Tiger either has a unique appearance or blends with his environment, but not both. Tiger has sharp teeth. Tiger does not have a strong will. Captain does not avoid predators. Captain does not have a strong will. If Frank earns respect, then he has a unique appearance and a strong will. Captain explores the reef. If Tiger earns respect, then he has a unique appearance and a strong will.
Conclusion: If Tiger defends his home, then he will either earn the respect of others or become a leader, but not both.
