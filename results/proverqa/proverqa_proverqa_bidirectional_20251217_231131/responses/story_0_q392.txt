Premises: If Anastasia studies wildlife, then she either educates others or advocates conservation (or both). If Anastasia lives near water, then she either documents habitats or studies wildlife (or both). If Anastasia pursues scientific research, then she either advocates conservation or supports local communities (but not both). Anastasia supports local communities. Anastasia meditates often. If Anastasia meditates often, then she has spiritual connections. Anastasia does not document habitats. Anyone who finds inner peace either follows their life passion or has spiritual connections (or both). Anastasia either educates others or protects the environment, or she may do both. Anastasia is either an entomologist or has spiritual connections, but not both. If someone shares knowledge, then they will educate other people. If Anastasia works outdoors, then she either protects the environment or respects ecosystems (but not both). Anastasia lives near water. Anastasia pursues scientific research.
Conclusion: Anastasia either protects the environment or appreciates nature (or both).
