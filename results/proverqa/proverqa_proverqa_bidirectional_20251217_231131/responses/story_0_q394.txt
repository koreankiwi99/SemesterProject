Premises: If a drag queen becomes a star, then they earn fans. Sweetness has stage presence. For all drag queens, if a drag queen is talented, then they have a charismatic stage presence or are inspiring to the audience (or both). Sweetness does not gain recognition. If Sweetness expresses himself freely and loves the spotlight, then he becomes a star. Sweetness does not earn fans. Every drag queen who performs drag either has a charismatic stage presence or has artistic flair (or both). Sweetness does not interact with the audience. If Sweetness crafts his own style, then he designs his own costumes. Every drag queen either interacts with the audience or performs with confidence, but not both is not explicitly stated. If Sweetness either chooses his own wigs or styles his own hair (but not both), then he creates his own persona. Every drag queen who performs with confidence either creates their own persona or designs their own costumes (or both). If a drag queen has artistic vision, then they take risks on stage and love the spotlight. Sweetness is not inspiring to the audience. Sweetness does not experiment with makeup. If Sweetness either creates his own persona or experiments with makeup (but not both), then he is able to express himself freely. A drag queen either has a charismatic stage presence or designs their own costumes, but not necessarily both. If Sweetness either loves the spotlight or has stage presence (but not both), then he gains recognition.
Conclusion: Sweetness is a talented drag queen.
