Premises: Gabriel learns quickly or reads widely. If Gabriel seeks knowledge, then he makes informed decisions. Gabriel either learns quickly or has intuition, but not both. If Gabriel appreciates culture, then he either pursues artistic interests or supports sports, but not both. Anyone who values education or reads widely seeks knowledge. Gabriel does not support sports. Gabriel has intuition. Gabriel appreciates culture. Gabriel either values education or pursues artistic interests, but not necessarily both.
Conclusion: Gabriel makes informed decisions.
