Premises: If Bria either turns trash into treasure or makes something useful (but not both), then she creates something valuable. Bria creates something valuable or solves problems. For all persons, if they are curious and try new things, then they enjoy experimenting. If Bria has imagination, then she will try new things. For all people, if a person is creative, then they think outside the box and create something valuable. Bria does not achieve success. Bria is innovative. If someone is innovative and enjoys experimenting, then they are creative. Bria has imagination. Anyone who loves learning and solves problems can achieve success. Bria loves learning. Bria is curious.
Conclusion: Bria thinks outside the box.
