Premises: Aleah gets distracted. Anyone who daydreams often or thinks outside the box has a vivid imagination. If River gets distracted, then he either has a vivid imagination or finds new interests (or both). River is creative. River gets distracted. River does not plan ahead. River cannot express himself effectively. River is reflective. River either speaks fluently or thinks critically, but not both. If River is reflective, then he is either a critical thinker or a spontaneous actor, but not both. If River is creative, then he either writes well or excels in art, but not both. River either acts spontaneously or plans ahead, but not both. For anyone, writing well and speaking fluently can lead to expressing themselves effectively. If River either draws portraits or sculpts figures (but not both), then he excels in art. Aleah either acts spontaneously or plans ahead, but not both. River does not find new interests. If River has a vivid imagination, then he excels in either art or music, but not both.
Conclusion: River excels in music.
