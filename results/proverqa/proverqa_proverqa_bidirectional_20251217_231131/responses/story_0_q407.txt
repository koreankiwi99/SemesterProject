Premises: Zane is not comfortable on stage. If Zane is talented, then he will gain popularity. Zane is charismatic. If Zane is funny, then he can either gain popularity or build a loyal following, but not both. Zane has raw potential. A person either has raw potential or works hard, but not necessarily both at the same level. If Zane performs publicly, then he either has stage fright or is comfortable on stage (or both). Zane performs publicly. Zane either has stage fright or is entertaining, but not both. Zane either works hard or is talented. If Zane is charismatic, then he is either funny or entertaining, but not both.
Conclusion: Zane does not build a loyal following.
