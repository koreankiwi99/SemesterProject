Premises: Shelby is a rural resident. If Shelby is self-sufficient, then she lives off the land. For every human, either they are prepared for emergencies or they are unprepared for emergencies, but not both. Shelby does not raise livestock. Pudding does not raise livestock. If Shelby tends to a garden, then she cultivates an orchard. If someone either raises livestock or cultivates an orchard (but not both), then they are a farm owner. If Shelby is a rural resident, then she either grows her own crops or buys from local markets, but not both. If Nalani is a farm owner, then she either grows her own crops or has food storage, but not both. Pudding is a rural resident. Anyone who lives off the land is either prepared for emergencies or has food storage. If Shelby values independence, then she grows her own crops. Shelby either keeps bees or cultivates an orchard (or both). Shelby does not buy from local markets. Shelby tends to a garden. Andres does not buy from local markets. If Shelby is a farm owner, then she either grows her own crops or has food storage, but not both. Shelby is self-sufficient. If Nalani is self-sufficient, then she lives off the land.
Conclusion: Shelby is unprepared for emergencies.
