Premises: If Tristan either builds trust or wins cases (but not both), then he is a successful lawyer. Tristan is straightforward. Matthew is either introspective or has good listening skills, but not necessarily both. If Tristan either avoids confrontation or values privacy (but not both), then he is introspective. Tristan does not value privacy. Tristan does not prefer solo work. Tristan is reserved. If someone is straightforward, then they may not necessarily empathize with others, and vice versa. If Tristan either is reserved or prefers solo work (but not both), then he tends to avoid confrontation. Tristan has good listening skills or is persuasive. Tristan is either introspective or has good listening skills, but not necessarily both. Anyone who is attentive or understands feelings can empathize with others.
Conclusion: If Tristan is charismatic or persuasive, then he is a successful lawyer.
