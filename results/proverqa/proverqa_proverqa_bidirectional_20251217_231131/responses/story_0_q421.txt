Premises: If Matias makes mistakes, then he either admits fault or takes responsibility, but not both. Matias avoids blame. Diamond does not respect others. Grrl avoids blame. If Matias craves attention, then he will seek public recognition. If Matias keeps his promises, then he will either build a strong reputation or earn the respect of others, but not both. Matias makes mistakes. If Matias either seeks public recognition or values his privacy (but not both), then he is confident. Diamond is not confident. Matias does not respect others. Matias is accountable. If someone builds a strong reputation, they may not necessarily seek public recognition, and vice versa. Matias values his privacy. If Matias leads by example, then he will either build a strong reputation or inspire others, but not both. Matias either admits fault or avoids blame, but does not do both. If Grrl makes mistakes, then he either admits fault or takes responsibility, but not both. If Seven acts with integrity, then he will either earn the respect of others or gain their trust, but not both. If Matias takes responsibility, then he either has integrity or is accountable, but not both. Grrl is accountable. If Grrl either seeks public recognition or values his privacy (but not both), then he is confident. If Grrl keeps his promises, then he will either build a strong reputation or earn the respect of others, but not both. Matias learns from errors or admits fault. Seven either keeps promises or prioritizes his own self-interest, but he does not consistently do both. Seven either admits fault or avoids blame, but does not do both. Matias either keeps promises or prioritizes his own self-interest, but he does not consistently do both. If Diamond takes responsibility, then he either has integrity or is accountable, but not both. If Matias either respects others or prioritizes his own self-interest, then he has integrity. Grrl makes mistakes. Grrl does not act with integrity. All individuals with moral values make ethical choices and keep their promises. Matias is not confident.
Conclusion: Matias does not gain the trust of others.
