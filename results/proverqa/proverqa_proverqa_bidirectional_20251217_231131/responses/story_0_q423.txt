Premises: Anyone who has curiosity and seeks experience can decide to study abroad. Everyone who values education either seeks experience or explores opportunities. If Aileen studies abroad, then she will love foreign languages. Aileen does not explore opportunities. Aileen either loves foreign languages or appreciates Argentine culture, but not necessarily both. For Aileen, either she stays in her home country or she has curiosity, but not both. Aileen values education. Anyone who has a passport or gets a scholarship can study abroad. Aileen does not stay in her home country. Aileen either appreciates Argentine culture or enjoys dancing (or both).
Conclusion: Aileen does not enjoy dancing.
