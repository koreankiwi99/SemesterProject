Premises: If Raya formed in ancient times, then she holds historical value. Raya does not have vibrant colors. Every mineral is either found underground or valued by geologists. If Raya forms by pressure, then she has vibrant colors or occurs in layers (or both). If Raya either formed deeply or contains ancient secrets (but not both), then she holds historical value. Raya either holds historical value or has aesthetic appeal, but not both. If Raya either forms slowly or is created under heat (but not both), then she contains ancient secrets. Raya does not remain hidden. Any mineral found underground remains hidden until discovered. Raya either forms by pressure or has aesthetic appeal. Raya did not form deeply. Any mineral that occurs in caves or exists in igneous rocks is formed naturally. Raya does not occur in layers. Every mineral that is valued by geologists either formed naturally or contains ancient secrets. Raya forms under pressure if she is a metamorphic mineral.
Conclusion: If Raya is rare, then she has unique properties and leads to groundbreaking discoveries.
