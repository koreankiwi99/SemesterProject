Premises: Raul does not gain academic recognition. If Zoey is scholarly, then he can either make groundbreaking discoveries or become a leading authority, but not both. Every meticulous researcher either gains academic recognition or makes groundbreaking discoveries (or both). Raul does not teach at a university. If Zoey is passionate about history, then he translates ancient texts and is a meticulous researcher. Zoey translates ancient texts. If Cherry publishes academic works, then he is either scholarly or teaches at a university (or both). Raul publishes academic works. For anyone who loves books and values knowledge, they enjoy reading. If Raul publishes academic works, then he is either scholarly or teaches at a university (or both). Cherry enjoys reading or is passionate about history. If Raul is scholarly, then he can either make groundbreaking discoveries or become a leading authority, but not both. Raul translates ancient texts. Raul has a good memory. Raul enjoys reading or is passionate about history. Raul either has a good memory or enjoys reading, but it's not necessarily true that Raul's enjoyment of reading is related to his memory. Briar does not teach at a university. Briar either has a good memory or enjoys reading, but it's not necessarily true that Briar's enjoyment of reading is related to his memory. If Raul has high intellect, then he can either think critically or be scholarly, but not both. Briar has a good memory. If Raul has a curious mind, then he is a meticulous researcher and produces innovative work. If Raul is passionate about history, then he translates ancient texts and is a meticulous researcher. If Raul loves learning, then he is passionate about history and values accuracy. Cherry does not gain academic recognition.
Conclusion: Raul becomes a leading authority.
