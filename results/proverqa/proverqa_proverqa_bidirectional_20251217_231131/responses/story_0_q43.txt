Premises: If Spencer achieves success or takes risks, then he will gain recognition. If someone is dedicated to their work and develops skills, then they can be an excellent craftsman. Anyone who practices self-care or manages emotions can maintain focus. If Spencer craves recognition, then he strives for perfection and innovates recipes. Spencer does not value excellence. Anyone who handles stress prioritizes tasks or manages emotions (or both). Anyone who is self-aware or has good habits can manage their emotions. Spencer does not practice self-care. Spencer values excellence or is an excellent craftsman. If Spencer is an excellent craftsman, then he either sets high standards or strives for perfection, but not both. Spencer cannot maintain focus. Anyone who sets high standards or pays attention to details can achieve success. Spencer either handles stress or works under pressure. Spencer does not prioritize tasks. Spencer does not take risks. Spencer is either passionate about cooking or works under pressure, but these two traits do not necessarily coexist. Spencer does not gain recognition.
Conclusion: Spencer demands quality and strives for perfection.
