Premises: Shiloh pursues her personal goals. Shiloh does not have good intentions. Anyone who works hard or learns quickly can gain experience. If someone makes a difference and inspires others, then they can improve their community. Shiloh inspires others. Shiloh either pursues her personal goals or enhances the lives of others, but these two pursuits can be mutually exclusive. Anyone who has experience or is educated can make a difference. Everyone has skills or makes a difference. Anyone who volunteers regularly or improves their community can enhance the lives of others. Everyone either has good intentions or gains knowledge, but these two are not necessarily related. If Shiloh either reads books or attends seminars (but not both), then she gains knowledge. Shiloh is selfless or educated (or both).
Conclusion: Shiloh is selfless.
