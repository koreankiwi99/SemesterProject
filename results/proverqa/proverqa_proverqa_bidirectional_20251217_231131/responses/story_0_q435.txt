Example ID: 435
Premises: If Jackson stands out, then he is either outgoing or has charisma, but not both. If Jackson has visible scars, then he either stands out or has a distinctive voice, but not both. Katie does not wear distinctive jewelry. Jackson does not wear distinctive jewelry. Jackson does not have bright hair. Jackson is not outgoing. For any person, if they have certain genes and were exposed to x-ray, then they may have unusual marks. Jackson does not have charisma. If Jackson is identifiable, then he has visible tattoos and wears distinctive jewelry. If Jackson often attends public events, then he either has visible tattoos or wears bold clothing (but not both). Jackson has distinct palmar patterns or a rare scar (or both). If someone either has bright hair or has unusual marks (but not both), then they stand out. If Jackson has unusual marks or a rare scar, then he can be easily identifiable.
Conclusion: Jackson does not have unique fingerprints.
