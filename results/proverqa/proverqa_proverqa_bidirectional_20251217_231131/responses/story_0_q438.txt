Premises: Holly is not hard-working. If Coraline is either charismatic or talented (but not both), then she is successful. Mae is not ambitious. For Mae, being passionate and being selfless are mutually exclusive. Anyone who performs solo either commands attention or has stage fright (or both). Holly either has stage fright or is charismatic, but not both. If Holly is successful, then she is both hard-working and passionate. If Mae faces criticism, then she gets nervous and feels sensitive. If Mae speaks in front of a crowd, then she is either confident or gets nervous, but not both. Mae faces criticism. If Mae follows her heart, then she either puts others first or is selfless (or both). Mae is either ambitious or selfless, but not both. Sexy faces criticism. Holly either performs in public or sings alone. For Sexy, being passionate and being selfless are mutually exclusive. If Mae loves music, then she has charisma and performs in public. If Coraline performs in public, then she either has stage fright or is confident, but not both. If Mae is either charismatic or talented (but not both), then she is successful. If Coraline faces criticism, then she gets nervous and feels sensitive. Holly speaks in front of a crowd. Mae is not hard-working. If Mae is successful, then she is both hard-working and passionate. Mae speaks in front of a crowd. Holly is either ambitious or selfless, but not both. If Mae performs in public, then she either has stage fright or is confident, but not both. Mae does not sing alone. Mae either performs in public or sings alone. Mae either has stage fright or is charismatic, but not both. If Mae fears failure and meets expectations, then she gets nervous.
Conclusion: Mae is talented.
