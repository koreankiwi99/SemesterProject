Premises: If Spencer faces adversity, then he either finds inner peace or has a passion for art, but not both. Spencer tries new things. If Spencer undergoes a life change, then he is either someone who finds new purpose or someone who experiences tragedy, but not both. For all people, if they experience tragedy and overcome challenges, then they face adversity. Anyone who experiences loss or meets difficulty faces adversity. Spencer does not find new purpose. If Nora faces adversity, then he either finds inner peace or has a passion for art, but not both. Spencer remains optimistic. If Spencer experiences loss, then he discovers resilience and undergoes a life change. Marcus either remains optimistic or finds inner peace, but not both. If Nora has a passion for art, then he creates something beautiful. Marcus overcomes challenges. Marcus meets new people. Spencer overcomes challenges. Nora does not find new purpose. If Spencer meets new people and tries new things, then he will undergo a life change. If Spencer has a passion for art, then he creates something beautiful. Spencer either remains optimistic or finds inner peace, but not both. Spencer meets new people.
Conclusion: Spencer does not create something beautiful.
