Premises: Pudding does not enjoy learning. Every cat that lives in luxury is either a charming companion or has a playful side (or both). If Pudding has many hobbies, then she either has a curious nature or enjoys learning (or both). All cats that purr frequently are affectionate. If Pudding is affectionate, then she is either a charming companion or gets into mischief, but not both. Pudding either plays outside or gets into mischief. If Pudding is charismatic, then she explores various interests and is a charming companion. Pudding has many hobbies. If Pudding has a curious nature, then she explores various interests. Pudding does not stay healthy. Pudding purrs frequently. If Pudding plays outside, then she stays healthy.
Conclusion: Pudding is charismatic.

-- Goal (conclusion to analyze): Pudding is charismatic.
theorem goal : Charismatic Pudding := by
  -- From the given premises, we can derive that Pudding explores various interests
  -- and is involved in mischief, but there is no premise that implies Charismatic Pudding.
  -- Moreover, P7 only gives (Charismatic → Explores ∧ Charming), which is not invertible.
  -- Hence, we cannot derive Charismatic Pudding from the premises.
