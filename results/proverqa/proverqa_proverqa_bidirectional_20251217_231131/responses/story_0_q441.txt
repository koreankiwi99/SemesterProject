Premises: Kohen eats nutritious food. If Kohen either runs frequently or exercises regularly (but not both), then he has a muscular body. Kohen does not perform well. Snookums either has a gentle nature or becomes a symbol of elegance, but not both. For all horses, if they are either agile or have speed, then they are athletic. If Kohen eats nutritious food and exercises regularly, then he has a large build. Every horse that is either athletic or has endurance performs well. Kohen will become a symbol of elegance if he is prized by Mr. Jenkins. Kohen either has an intimidating appearance or has a gentle nature, but not both. If Kohen either practices obedience or engages in play (but not both), then he exercises regularly. If Snookums eats nutritious food and exercises regularly, then he has a large build. Kohen runs frequently. Kohen either has a gentle nature or becomes a symbol of elegance, but not both. Madisyn either has an intimidating appearance or has a gentle nature, but not both. Every well-cared-for horse is either strong or has good posture (or both). Kannon does not perform well. All horses with tall height and well-proportioned body have a large build. Madisyn does not have endurance. Kohen has an intimidating appearance if he has a large build. If Kohen is strong, then he can either serve as a carriage horse or become a symbol of elegance, but not both. Snookums is either agile or strong, but he cannot be both. Kohen does not have endurance. Kohen does not have speed. If Kannon is strong, then he can either serve as a carriage horse or become a symbol of elegance, but not both. Kohen is either agile or strong, but he cannot be both. If Kannon either runs frequently or exercises regularly (but not both), then he has a muscular body. Kohen does not have a muscular body.
Conclusion: Kohen serves as a carriage horse.
