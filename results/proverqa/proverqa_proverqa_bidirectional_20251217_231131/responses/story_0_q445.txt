Premises: For all humans, if someone is a brilliant artist, then they either observe details closely or think out of the box (or both). Lakelyn acts spontaneously. Grant cannot generate innovative ideas. Grant acts spontaneously. Grant does not solve problems differently. Grant follows intuition or thinks out of the box. Lakelyn either creates masterpieces or follows rules, but not both. Grant has creativity. Everyone who is perceptive observes details closely. Anyone who thinks out of the box or solves problems differently can generate innovative ideas. Everyone who expresses their thoughts openly either thinks freely or embraces their individuality. Grant is either someone who thinks freely or someone who acts spontaneously, but not both. If someone observes details closely and has creativity, then they can create masterpieces. Azriel is either someone who thinks freely or someone who acts spontaneously, but not both. Lakelyn either follows rules or thinks freely. Azriel cannot generate innovative ideas. Grant either creates masterpieces or follows rules, but not both. Grant either follows rules or thinks freely.
Conclusion: Grant is not a brilliant artist.
