Premises: If Astrid is respected by others, then she makes quick decisions and is strategic. If Astrid is well-trained or shows bravery, then she will win battles. Astrid either pursues peace or engages in battles, but these two paths do not often intersect. Astrid is either a risk-taker and avoids being strategic, or she is strategic and avoids taking risks. If Astrid faces dangers, then she either shows bravery or leads warriors (or both). Jeremiah does not pursue peace. If Jeremiah is well-trained or shows bravery, then she will win battles. Tinsley does not gain victory. If Astrid leads triumphantly, then she has a strong will and engages in battles. Astrid does not gain victory. If Astrid is experienced, then she is either strategic or has combat skills, but not both. Astrid does not avoid risks. Tinsley will not win battles. If Tinsley is well-trained or has combat skills (but not both), then she will gain victory. If someone either wields swords or throws axes (but not both), then they have combat skills. If Astrid is well-trained or has combat skills (but not both), then she will gain victory. Astrid is either fearless or cowardly, but not both. Astrid is either experienced or holds authority. Astrid does not pursue peace. Ana is either fearless or cowardly, but not both. Tinsley does not avoid risks. If Astrid engages in battles, then she either shows bravery or is fearless (or both). Astrid will not win battles. Ana is either experienced or holds authority. Ana either pursues peace or engages in battles, but these two paths do not often intersect. Astrid does not hold authority.
Conclusion: Astrid is cowardly.
