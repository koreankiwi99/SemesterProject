Premises: Vance makes sound judgments. Vance is either a thrill seeker or values stability, but not both. If Vance is either impulsive or a thrill seeker (but not both), then he is a forward thinker. Anyone who plans ahead values stability. If Vance is spontaneous, then he is either adaptable or a forward thinker (but not both). Vance is not open to new experiences. Vance does not take risks. Everyone who makes sound judgments either plans ahead or thinks carefully (or both). Vance does not think carefully. If Vance is a forward thinker or open to new experiences, then he will take risks. If Vance is either impulsive or cautious (but not both), then he is innovative. If Vance travels widely or tries new things, then he is a thrill seeker. Vance is cautious.
Conclusion: Vance is innovative.
