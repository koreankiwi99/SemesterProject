Premises: If Luis is determined, then she has found success and earned recognition. Anyone who has traveled widely or raised a family has life experience. Everyone who leads by example either makes a positive impact or is determined (or both). Davian sets goals or is determined. Anyone who achieves their goals or makes a positive impact can find success. Evelyn is a public figure. For any person, if they have faced challenges and learned from mistakes, then they have life experience. If Evelyn is determined, then she has found success and earned recognition. Evelyn does not set goals. Evelyn has raised a family. If Evelyn has overcome adversity, then she has either lived through hardship or found success (but not both). Evelyn sets goals or is determined. Davian does not set goals. Davian is a public figure. If Evelyn has life experience, then she is either a public figure or an author (but not both). Davian has raised a family. Evelyn has overcome adversity.
Conclusion: Evelyn is not inspirational.
