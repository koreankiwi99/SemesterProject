Premises: Mallory does not work independently. Kennedy does not inspire others. Mallory either balances her life or is hard-working, but not both. If Kennedy has published extensively, then she is either famous or highly accomplished, but not both. Kennedy does not work independently. Anyone who has expertise is either highly accomplished or receives awards (or both). Arlet values knowledge. All highly accomplished individuals are passionate about their work and respected by their peers. If Mallory has published extensively, then she is either famous or highly accomplished, but not both. Anyone who expands knowledge is either passionate about their work or contributes to society (or both). Mallory values knowledge. Mallory does not have hobbies. Mallory makes new discoveries. Mallory does not inspire others. Mallory contributes to her field or publishes extensively. For anyone who values knowledge and is passionate about their work, they can inspire others. If Mallory sets high goals, then she is either hard-working or seeks recognition (or both). Ocean is not well-rounded. If Mallory is hard-working, then she publishes extensively and makes new discoveries. If Mallory either balances her life or has hobbies (but not both), then she is well-rounded. Mallory is not well-rounded. Mallory is either respected by her peers or works independently, but not both. If Ocean is hard-working, then she publishes extensively and makes new discoveries.
Conclusion: Mallory is dedicated.
