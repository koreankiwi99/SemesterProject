Premises: If Mohammad studies diseases, then he will work on cures. Mohammad works on cures if he has medical training. Mohammad develops practical skills. If Mohammad either reduces suffering or enhances wellbeing (but not both), then he improves human lives. If someone works on cures, then they improve human lives. Mohammad explores nature or studies diseases. Hallie does not explore nature. For Mohammad, either he develops practical skills or pursues knowledge, but not both. Mohammad does not explore nature. If Mohammad has passion, then he either pursues knowledge or makes discoveries.
Conclusion: Mohammad contributes to science and improves human lives.
