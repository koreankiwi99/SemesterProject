Premises: For all personality, if it is optimistic and has charisma, then it is inspirational. If Goofy is creative and determined, then he is successful. Goofy's personality is either spontaneous or meticulous, but not both. Goofy is a perfectionist. Goofy does not stand out. Goofy's personality is meticulous. Goofy is not reserved. For every personality, if they are either successful or have charisma, then they stand out. Goofy is not inspirational. For Goofy's personality, it is either optimistic or reserved, but not both. If Goofy is a perfectionist, then he is either creative or spontaneous, but not both.
Conclusion: Goofy is not determined.
