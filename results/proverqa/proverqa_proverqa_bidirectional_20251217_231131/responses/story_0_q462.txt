Premises: If Gabriela is either reckless or charismatic (but not both), then she is legendary. Lilly is confident. If Lilly is discreet or avoids publicity, then she will stay safe. Gabriela keeps secrets. Gabriela has intuition. Gabriela does not trust others. Everyone values their privacy or enjoys socializing. Lilly handles risk or is discreet. Guy either values her privacy or dresses well, but not both. Lilly is adventurous. If Lilly is either reckless or charismatic (but not both), then she is legendary. Lilly does not stay safe. If Lilly is confident, then she either has flair or dresses well, but not both. Lilly either values her privacy or dresses well, but not both. Everyone who keeps secrets either lives a private life or avoids publicity (or both). If Guy is discreet, then she either trusts others or has intuition (but not both). Lilly keeps secrets. Lilly is either legendary or lives a private life, but not both. Guy does not stay safe. Lilly does not enjoy socializing. If Lilly is adventurous, then she is either charismatic or has flair, but not both.
Conclusion: Lilly is reckless.
