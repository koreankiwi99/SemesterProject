Premises: If finding honey is either easy or difficult (but not both) for Damon, then he enjoys the journey. For Pooh, if he knows the terrain and sniffs around, then he finds honey easily. If Pooh gets lost, then he loves honey and meets friends. If a bear enjoys adventure and has curiosity, then they try new routes. Every bear enjoys walking or loves nature. Pooh moves slowly. Pooh explores the forest. Haisley does not try new routes. If Pooh explores the forest, then he either finds honey quickly or has a good memory, but not both. If Pooh either roams freely or meets friends (but not both), then he enjoys adventure. Pooh has a good memory. Haisley has curiosity. Pooh does not have good balance. Pooh has curiosity. Pooh either enjoys the journey or gets lost, but not both. Haisley does not love honey. All bears that enjoy walking have good balance and move slowly. Pooh does not love honey. Damon roams freely. Damon does not have good balance. Pooh does not try new routes. If Pooh lives outdoors, then he enjoys walking. If Pooh lives in the forest, then he either enjoys the journey or has good direction, but not both. Pooh roams freely. If Pooh loves nature, then he either finds honey quickly or finds it easy to find honey, but not both. If Pooh either follows streams or climbs trees (but not both), then he meets friends.
Conclusion: Finding honey is not difficult for Pooh.
