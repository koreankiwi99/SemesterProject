Premises: If Aries can think discursively, then he can either challenge established narratives or foster open dialogue, but not both. If Aries either reads widely or synthesizes information (but not both), then he analyzes complex ideas. Aspen listens actively. Aries values critical thinking. If Aspen can think discursively, then he can either challenge established narratives or foster open dialogue, but not both. Anyone who exposes new ideas either develops cohesive narratives or examines multiple views (or both). Cyrus participates in discussions. If Aries is a professor, then he either presents arguments or writes academic papers, but not both. Aries listens actively. Aries does not specialize in simple topics. If Aries analyzes complex ideas, then he does not develop cohesive narratives, and if he develops cohesive narratives, then he does not analyze complex ideas. Everyone who participates in discussions either develops cohesive narratives or presents arguments (or both). Aspen either specializes in simple topics or analyzes complex ideas, but not both. If Aspen values critical thinking, then he thinks discursively and encourages collaboration. Aries participates in discussions. Aries challenges established narratives. If Aries values critical thinking, then he thinks discursively and encourages collaboration. Aries either specializes in simple topics or analyzes complex ideas, but not both. Anyone who presents arguments or listens actively can engage in debates.
Conclusion: Aries fosters open dialogue.

-- Conclusion to analyze: Aries fosters open dialogue.
-- We attempt to prove FostersOpenDialogue Aries, but it actually contradicts the premises.
-- We can derive ¬ FostersOpenDialogue Aries from the given premises.

theorem not_fosters_Aries : ¬ FostersOpenDialogue Aries := by
  -- From values critical thinking, Aries thinks discursively.
  have hTD : ThinkDiscursively Aries := (prem17 prem4).left
  -- Therefore, by prem1, (challenge ∨ foster) ∧ ¬(challenge ∧ foster)
  have hxor : (ChallengesEstablishedNarratives Aries ∨ FostersOpenDialogue Aries) ∧
              ¬(ChallengesEstablishedNarratives Aries ∧ FostersOpenDialogue Aries) :=
    prem1 hTD
  have hNotBoth : ¬ (ChallengesEstablishedNarratives Aries ∧ FostersOpenDialogue Aries) := hxor.right
  -- Aries challenges established narratives (prem16), so he cannot foster open dialogue.
  intro hFoster
  apply hNotBoth
  exact And.intro prem16 hFoster

-- For completeness, some derived consequences (not needed for the negation above):
theorem aries_analyzes : AnalyzesComplexIdeas Aries := by
  -- From prem18: (Spec ∨ Analyze) ∧ ¬(Spec ∧ Analyze), and prem10: ¬Spec, conclude Analyze.
  have hdisj : SpecializesInSimpleTopics Aries ∨ AnalyzesComplexIdeas Aries := (And.left prem18)
  cases hdisj with
  | inl hspec => exact False.elim (prem10 hspec)
  | inr hanal => exact hanal

theorem aries_presents : PresentsArguments Aries := by
  -- From participation (prem15) and prem12, Aries develops or presents; but from aries_analyzes and prem11a, not develops; hence presents.
  have h := prem12 Aries prem15
  have hNotDev : ¬ DevelopsCohesiveNarratives Aries := prem11a aries_analyzes
  cases h with
  | inl hDev => exact False.elim (hNotDev hDev)
  | inr hPres => exact hPres

-- The target conclusion would be:
-- theorem goal : FostersOpenDialogue Aries := by
--   -- This is not derivable given the premises; in fact, not_fosters_Aries shows its negation.
--   admit
