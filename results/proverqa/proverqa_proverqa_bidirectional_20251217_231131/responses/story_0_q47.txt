Premises: Major does not dress elegantly. Major trains regularly. Major is not highly educated. Major is a famous figure. If Major has sympathy for others and is successful, then he supports charity. If Major is well-connected, then he is wealthy and an influential person. Major speaks well. If Major trains regularly and is a formidable opponent, then he can win championships. For Major, having wealth and supporting charity are mutually exclusive, but not necessarily exhaustive. Major has loyal fans. If someone has discipline and natural talent, then they can win championships. Anyone who speaks well or dresses elegantly can have high social status. If Major has natural talent, then he has high social status and works hard. Everyone who is a famous figure is either a respected leader or an influential person (or both). Major is not a popular figure. If Major has high social status, then he is either well-connected or highly educated (but not both). If Major wins championships, then he either supports charity or is a popular figure (or both). If Major is a skilled boxer, then he is a formidable opponent and has loyal fans. Major is not a respected leader.
Conclusion: Major is not a skilled boxer.
