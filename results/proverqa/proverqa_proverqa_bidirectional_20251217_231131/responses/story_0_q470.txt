Premises: Either Colin is meticulous or careless, but not both. Colin is either rash or meticulous, but not both. Anyone who considers details and weighs consequences is likely to think cautiously. Colin either thinks cautiously or acts impulsively, but not both. Anyone who plans ahead or weighs outcomes evaluates risks. Everyone assesses situations or evaluates risks. Colin either follows his intuition or assesses situations, but not both. Colin does not consider his options. Colin is either impulsive or rash, but not both. If someone either considers their options or evaluates the risks, then they think cautiously. Colin follows his intuition. If Colin achieves success, then he is meticulous and pays attention.
Conclusion: Colin is not careless.
