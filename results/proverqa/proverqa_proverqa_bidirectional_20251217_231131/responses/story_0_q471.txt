Premises: Cohen is not highly motivated. Isaac does not report fairly. Cohen does not advocate for human rights. Everyone who seeks justice either speaks out against injustice or advocates for human rights (or both). Isaac does not advocate for human rights. Ronan is ambitious or dedicated. Cohen either pursues truth or values integrity (or both). Cohen does not speak out against injustice. Anyone who pursues truth seeks justice or reports fairly (or both). If Cohen has curiosity, then he seeks justice and asks questions. Cohen does not report fairly. If Cohen either follows ethics or respects others (but not both), then he values integrity. Kylie is not highly motivated. Kylie is either driven to succeed or values integrity, but not both. Ronan does not speak out against injustice. Cohen is ambitious or dedicated. Isaac either pursues truth or values integrity (or both). If Cohen is either ambitious or driven to succeed (but not both), then he is highly motivated. Cohen is either driven to succeed or values integrity, but not both.
Conclusion: Cohen is not dedicated.
