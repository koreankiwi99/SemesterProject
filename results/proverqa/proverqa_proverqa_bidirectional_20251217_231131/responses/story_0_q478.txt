Premises: If Dayana has good listening skills, then she either analyzes behavior or can read body language, but not both. Azriel can read body language. For every human, they are either sane or insane, but not both. Dayana has good listening skills. Dayana solves complex problems. Dayana can read body language. If Dayana either trusts her instinct or values objectivity (but not both), then she is empathetic. If Dayana is empathetic, then she is either intuitive or has rational thoughts, but not both. If someone has critical thinking, then they understand others and solve complex problems. Dayana has critical thinking. Azriel has good listening skills. Dayana either has rational thoughts or is sane, but not both, in her interactions with her patients. Flame has critical thinking. Dayana is not intuitive. Azriel either has rational thoughts or is sane, but not both, in her interactions with her patients. Everyone who understands others either analyzes their behavior or is empathetic (or both). Rylan is not intuitive.
Conclusion: The Silent Patient, Dayana, is insane.
