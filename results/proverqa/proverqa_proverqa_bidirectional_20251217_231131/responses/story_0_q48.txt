Premises: If Orlando either reads widely or pursues knowledge (but not both), then he makes new connections. Orlando pursues knowledge or conducts meaningful research. Orlando does not advance industries. Everyone learns from others or pursues knowledge. Orlando develops new technologies. If Orlando works in a team, then he is either collaborative or follows instructions (but not both). Orlando does not achieve success. Orlando does not have an open mind. If Orlando is collaborative or has an open mind, then he can achieve success. Anyone who makes breakthrough discoveries either gains recognition or advances industries (or both). If Orlando makes new connections, then he is collaborative and thinks creatively. Orlando does not read widely. Orlando does not gain recognition. Anyone who conducts meaningful research or develops new technologies can improve people's lives. If someone sets clear goals and works with focus, then they can conduct meaningful research.
Conclusion: Orlando is an innovative scientist.

-- Conclusion to prove: Orlando is an innovative scientist.
theorem goal : InnovativeScientist Orlando := by
  -- Attempt to use the premises:
  -- From A2 and A12, if we had PursuesKnowledge Orlando we could build the XOR and get MakesNewConnections via A1,
  -- then Collaborative via A11, and then CanAchieveSuccess via A9. However, there is no given link from these to InnovativeScientist.
  -- Moreover, "can achieve success" does not contradict "does not achieve success" (A7), so no contradiction is derivable to explode.
  -- The premises do not provide any rule connecting the existing properties to "InnovativeScientist".
