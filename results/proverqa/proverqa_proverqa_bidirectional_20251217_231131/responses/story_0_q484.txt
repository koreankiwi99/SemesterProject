Premises: If Kamiyah is either dedicated or passionate (but not both), then she is successful. If Kamiyah either argues logically or speaks confidently (but not both), then she secures freedom for her clients. Kelly loses arguments. Kelly does not secure freedom for her clients. If someone achieves their goals, then they are confident and have strong convictions. All people who have integrity are dedicated and value justice. If Kelly is either dedicated or passionate (but not both), then she is successful. Cuddlebug does not secure freedom for her clients. If Kelly is either confident in her speech or passionate, then she wins her cases. If Kelly either argues logically or speaks confidently (but not both), then she secures freedom for her clients. If Cuddlebug is either confident in her speech or passionate, then she wins her cases. Kelly works hard. Cuddlebug is confident. If Kelly builds a strong defense, then she will win her cases. Cuddlebug does not have strong convictions. Kelly is confident. If Finley is dedicated and works hard, then she achieves her goals. If Kelly is dedicated and works hard, then she achieves her goals. Kelly does not have strong convictions. Kelly either wins cases or loses arguments, but not both. If Kelly presents arguments, then she either speaks confidently or has authority (or both). If Kelly is persistent, then she either achieves her goals or makes progress, but not both. Kelly argues logically.
Conclusion: Kelly is successful.
