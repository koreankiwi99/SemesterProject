Premises: Joaquin has a real-world impact. Kenna is intelligent or innovative. If Caroline is a software engineer, then she is either theoretically sound or has practical experience, but not both. Kenna learns programming. Joaquin is either theoretically sound or has a real-world impact, but not both. Everyone is either intelligent or has practical experience, but the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive. If Kenna has specialized knowledge, then she is both theoretically sound and passionate. Anyone who works on projects has practical experience. If someone learns programming and enjoys problem solving, then they write code. If Kenna writes code, then she is a software engineer. If Kenna is a software engineer, then she is either theoretically sound or has practical experience, but not both. Kenna is either theoretically sound or has a real-world impact, but not both. Kenna enjoys problem solving. Caroline enjoys problem solving. If Caroline writes code, then she is a software engineer. If someone reads widely and thinks critically, then they are intelligent. Joaquin learns programming. Kenna has a real-world impact.
Conclusion: Kenna is not innovative.
