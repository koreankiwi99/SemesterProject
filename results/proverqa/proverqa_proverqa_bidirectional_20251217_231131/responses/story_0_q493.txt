Huxley enjoys nature or prefers solitude. If someone sets high standards and pursues quality, then they are perfectionistic. If Huxley is pursuing a PhD, then he is either renowned or receiving grants (but not both). Iris works hard or focuses intensely. Anyone who values privacy and focuses intensely tends to prefer solitude. Huxley avoids the spotlight. Huxley is either renowned or prefers solitude, but not necessarily both. Huxley is self-motivated. Huxley works hard or focuses intensely. If Tate is self-motivated, then he is perfectionistic and strives for excellence.
Conclusion: Huxley is dedicated to his work.
