Premises: If Elisabeth owns a big plot of land and needs extra help, then he will employ workers. Raul is an experienced farmer. If Raul manages a large plantation, then he either harvests efficiently or uses sustainable practices, but not both. Raul works independently. If Raul dedicates time to his farm, then he either grows high-quality beans or supports local projects. Elisabeth needs extra help. If Asher either employs workers or mechanizes tasks (but not both), then he manages a large plantation. If Raul is a successful farmer, then he either employs many workers or manages large plantations, but not both. If Raul owns a big plot of land and needs extra help, then he will employ workers. If Asher manages a large plantation, then he either harvests efficiently or uses sustainable practices, but not both. Kieran owns a big plot of land. If Raul is an experienced farmer, then he either grows high-quality beans or harvests efficiently, but not both. If Raul either employs workers or mechanizes tasks (but not both), then he manages a large plantation. Raul needs extra help. Raul either works independently or shares knowledge with others, but not both. Raul owns a big plot of land. Raul uses sustainable practices. Raul does not mechanize tasks. Asher uses sustainable practices.
Conclusion: Raul can improve the community.
