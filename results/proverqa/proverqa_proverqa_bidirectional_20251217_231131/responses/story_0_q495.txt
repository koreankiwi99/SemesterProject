Premises: All penguins who either guard their nest or are protective are defending their family. If Pancake has a mate, then he is either loyal or protective, but not both. If Pancake dives deep, then he either finds food or hunts efficiently, but not both. Any penguin that builds a nest or raises its young can care for its chicks. Pancake keeps vigilant. All penguins who either guard their nest or keep vigilant will safeguard their territory. Pancake hunts efficiently. Pancake either raises his young or migrates seasonally, but not at the same time. Pancake migrates seasonally. Pancake is devoted. Pancake has a mate. Pancake builds a nest. If Pancake cares for his chicks and defends his family, then he can find food. If Pancake is either loving or devoted (but not both), then he is loyal. Pancake dives deep. Pancake does not safeguard his territory.
Conclusion: Pancake is not loving.
