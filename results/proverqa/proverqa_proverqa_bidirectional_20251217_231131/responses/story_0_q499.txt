Premises: If Ashlynn develops resilience, then she achieves success. Ashlynn does not achieve success. If Ashlynn experiences failure, then she is either someone who learns from mistakes or faces life challenges, but not both. If Ashlynn faces life challenges, then she either develops resilience or has a supportive family (or both). Buster either lacks motivation or struggles with decisions. Ashlynn either lacks motivation or struggles with decisions. Ashlynn does not struggle with decisions. If Ashlynn has a supportive family, then she either becomes dependent or becomes independent (or both, as evidenced by her transformation). If Ashlynn values her loved ones, then she feels secure and has a supportive family. If Ashlynn takes risks, then she either faces life challenges or builds confidence (but not both). Haven experiences failure. Ashlynn either learns from mistakes or avoids risks, but not both. Ashlynn avoids risks. Ashlynn experiences failure. If someone takes calculated risks, then they value feedback and learn from mistakes. Ashlynn has low self-esteem. If Ashlynn becomes dependent, then she either lacks motivation or has low self-esteem (but not both).
Conclusion: Ashlynn does not become independent.
