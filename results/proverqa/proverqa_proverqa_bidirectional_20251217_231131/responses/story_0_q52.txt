Premises: Alora is either an experienced climber or an inexperienced climber, but not both. Norah either leads private expeditions or is a professional guide, but not both. If Norah has acuminate instincts, then she either detects hidden dangers or is a novice adventurer (or both). If Norah enjoys solo trips, then she is either a thrill seeker or a participant in competitions, but not both. Norah is either an experienced climber or an inexperienced climber, but not both. Norah is either a professional guide or a novice adventurer, but not both. Keegan either leads private expeditions or is a professional guide, but not both. If Keegan is a thrill seeker, then she leads private expeditions. Norah attempts record breaks. Alora does not explore remote areas. Norah is either a novice adventurer or an experienced climber, but not both. Norah does not explore remote areas. If Norah is a thrill seeker, then she leads private expeditions. If someone either explores remote areas or attempts record breaks (but not both), then they are a thrill seeker.
Conclusion: Norah is not an inexperienced climber.
