Premises: For Wyatt, either building lasting connections or valuing loneliness is true, but not both. If Wyatt travels frequently, then he either tries new things or explores new places, but not both. Wyatt is either open-minded or follows a routine, but not both. Everyone who is adventurous either takes risks or explores new places. Mohammad does not appreciate moments. If Mohammad is adventurous, then he is both open-minded and planned. Everyone who enjoys uncertainty is adventurous. Wyatt values loneliness. Wyatt does not pursue his passion. Cade is either open-minded or follows a routine, but not both. If Wyatt meets new people, then he either captures beauty or builds lasting connections (or both). If Cade travels frequently, then he either tries new things or explores new places, but not both. Axl values loneliness. Wyatt does not follow a routine. Wyatt either appreciates moments or tries new things, but not both. Wyatt does not appreciate moments. Wyatt travels frequently. Cade does not pursue his passion. If Wyatt takes risks, then he will achieve success. Anyone who achieves success either pursues their passion or builds lasting connections (or both).
Conclusion: Wyatt's relationship is not spontaneous.
