Premises: Yosef farms his own food or lives off the land. Yosef either lives simply or is harmonious with nature (or both). If Yosef dedicates his life to his faith, then he is a monk. If Yosef is spiritual, then he is either in harmony with nature or he dominates his environment, but not both. Yosef does not practice meditation. Yosef does not farm his own food. If Yosef leads a quiet life, then he is either a monk or clergy, but not both. Yosef practices meditation or dedicates his life to his faith. Either Yosef is harmonious with nature or he is disruptive to nature, but not both. If Yosef has strong faith, then he either lives off the land or is self-sufficient, but not both. If Yosef is a monk, then he either lives off the land or lives simply, but not both.
Conclusion: Yosef is disruptive to nature.
