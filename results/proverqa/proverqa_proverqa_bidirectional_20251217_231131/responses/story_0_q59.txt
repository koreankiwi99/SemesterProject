Premises: If Paradise is an emotional person, then she speaks without thought. Paradise either thinks before acting or acts on impulse, but not both. If Wilson hurts others, then she either apologizes sincerely or makes amends, but not both. Paradise thinks before acting. Kylie thinks before acting. Wilson takes responsibility. Paradise listens carefully or speaks without thought. If Paradise either speaks without thought or acts on impulse (but not both), then she hurts others. Paradise takes responsibility. If Paradise values honesty, then she either takes responsibility or owns up to her mistakes, but not both. If someone takes blame, then they own up to their mistakes and learn from errors. If Paradise hurts others, then she either apologizes sincerely or makes amends, but not both. If a person owns up to their mistakes, they may not necessarily make amends, and vice versa. Paradise does not listen carefully. Paradise values honesty.
Conclusion: Paradise apologizes sincerely.
