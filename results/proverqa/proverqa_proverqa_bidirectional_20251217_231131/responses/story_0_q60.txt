Premises: If Cassian sets priorities, then he either overcomes obstacles or finds motivation. Skylar does not learn quickly. Everyone either sets goals or stays disciplined, but not both is not necessarily true. If Skylar sets goals or achieves success, then he will gain recognition. If Cassian is driven, then he either pushes his limits or faces challenges (but not both). All people who have passion put in effort and stay disciplined. Wren is hardworking. Skylar will make progress. Cassian either remains anonymous or gains recognition, but not both. Skylar does not remain anonymous. Skylar faces challenges. Cassian is driven. Skylar does not succeed professionally. If Cassian either learns quickly or overcomes obstacles (but not both), then he succeeds professionally. Cassian pursues his dream. If Aila puts in effort, then he will make progress. If Aila either pushes his limits or strives for excellence (but not both), then he is dedicated. Cassian does not succeed professionally. Aila either remains anonymous or gains recognition, but not both. If Skylar is driven, then he either pushes his limits or faces challenges (but not both). Everyone who pursues their dream either has passion or overcomes obstacles. Cassian faces challenges. Wren pursues his dream. Cassian does not learn quickly. Cassian does not remain anonymous. Aila is driven. Cassian values practice or puts in effort. If Skylar either learns quickly or overcomes obstacles (but not both), then he succeeds professionally. Cassian either sets high standards or achieves success.
Conclusion: Cassian achieves success, or he is both dedicated and hardworking.
