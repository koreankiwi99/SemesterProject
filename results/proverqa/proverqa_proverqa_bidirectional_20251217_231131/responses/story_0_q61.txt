Premises: If Goldie is artistic, then she either writes stories or creates poetry (or both). Anyone who draws well or has good taste is artistic. Goldie is a charismatic performer. If someone is inspiring, then they either have a good imagination or have creativity (but both is allowed in the input logic expression). For all people, if someone is a charismatic performer, then they either have creativity or have irrepressible energy (or both). Goldie has good taste. For a person, being a good communicator and expressing themselves effectively can make them inspiring. Goldie does not create poetry. If someone either writes stories or composes music (but not both), then they have a good imagination. Goldie is passionate. Goldie does not compose music. If someone is passionate, then they are inspiring and think outside the box.
Conclusion: Goldie does not have irrepressible energy.
