Premises: Everyone who is inspired either thinks outside the box or values creativity (or both). Anyone who expresses emotions and values creativity can be artistic. Edith does not perform well. Edith expresses emotions. Anyone who taps into emotions either understands the human experience or values creativity (or both). Anyone who taps into emotions is either artistic or understands human experience (or both). If someone takes risks and thinks outside the box, then they can achieve success. Edith either is inspired or pursues her passions. Emanuel does not perform well. Edith does not feel fulfilled. Cheyenne does not feel fulfilled. If Kartier either performs well or achieves success (but not both), then she feels fulfilled. Cheyenne does not have intuition. If Edith either performs well or achieves success (but not both), then she feels fulfilled. Edith takes risks. Cheyenne takes risks. Edith does not pursue her passions. Emanuel expresses emotions.
Conclusion: Edith cannot create meaningful art.
