Premises: Israel shares wisdom or inspires others. Israel makes sacrifices or leads by example. Israel has experience. For Israel, he either leads by example or seeks personal gain, but not both. Israel lives a long life. Israel serves others. If Israel lives a long life, then he can either leave a lasting legacy or pass on his knowledge to others, but not both. All humans who have experience and command respect hold power. Anyone who possesses wisdom and commands loyalty can hold power. If someone leads by example, then they leave a lasting legacy and inspire others. Anyone who shows bravery or upholds honor can inspire others. Israel does not uphold honor. If Israel holds power, then he either serves others or seeks personal gain, but not both. Israel shows bravery.
Conclusion: Israel passes on his knowledge to others.
