Premises: Anyone who has passion or seeks opportunities will take risks. Cristian either plays it safe or seeks stability, but not both. For Cristian, either he works hard or prioritizes relaxation, but no one does both. Cristian either prioritizes relaxation or stays active. Cristian either plays it safe or pursues his dreams, but not both. Cristian trusts his instincts. If Cristian takes risks, then he achieves success. Cristian does not seek stability. If Cristian trusts his instincts, then he either works hard or is driven (or both). If someone is driven, then they will seek opportunities. If someone loves music, then they have passion. Anyone who has passion or is motivated will pursue their dreams. Cristian does not stay active.
Conclusion: Cristian achieves success.
