Premises: If Jamir faces health challenges, then he remains optimistic and takes personal responsibility. For Drew, either he needs external help or he is self-sufficient, but not both. Drew has healthcare coverage. If Drew faces health challenges, then he remains optimistic and takes personal responsibility. If Drew has healthcare coverage, then he is either self-sufficient or requires medication (but not both). Jamir has healthcare coverage. If Jamir has a chronic illness or has a supportive doctor, then he manages his condition effectively. Drew either monitors his health or requires medication. Drew needs external help. Alfredo needs external help. If Alfredo requires medication, then he either has a strong support system or a chronic illness (but not both). Joziah has a strong support system. Drew faces health challenges. If Drew either manages his finances or makes independent decisions (but not both), then he is self-sufficient. Joziah faces health challenges. For Joziah, either he needs external help or he is self-sufficient, but not both. Everyone either takes personal responsibility for their health or has a supportive doctor, but not both is not necessarily true. If Drew requires medication, then he either has a strong support system or a chronic illness (but not both). Drew has a strong support system.
Conclusion: Drew manages his condition effectively.
