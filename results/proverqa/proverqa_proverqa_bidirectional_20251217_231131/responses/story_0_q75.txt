Premises: If Emelia handles pressure well, then she either earns respect from others or saves lives, but not both. Anyone who is meticulous will attend to details. Emelia coordinates efficiently. Emelia is meticulous. If someone meets deadlines, then they prioritize their work. Emelia handles pressure well. If Emelia performs her job precisely, then she saves lives and coordinates efficiently. Emelia does not prioritize her work. Emelia either manages tasks or meets deadlines, but not both. For all people, if they attend to details and manage tasks, then they perform their job precisely.
Conclusion: Emelia earns respect from others.
