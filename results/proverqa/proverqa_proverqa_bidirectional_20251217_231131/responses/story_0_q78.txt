Premises: If Aurelio has good intuition, then he is either self-aware or reflective about his actions, but not both. Aurelio does not reflect on his actions. Aurelio does not maintain balance. Aurelio either engages in physical activity or manages stress, but not both. Everyone who pursues wellbeing either engages in physical activity or maintains balance (or both). Aurelio has good intuition. If Aurelio practices mindfulness, then he follows an alkaline diet and stays hydrated. Aurelio practices mindfulness or manages stress. Any person who recognizes their emotions or connects with nature can manage stress. Aurelio does not take care of his emotions. Aurelio pursues wellbeing. If someone either plays sports or dances frequently (but not both), then they engage in physical activity. If Aurelio is self-aware, then he either listens to his body or takes care of his emotions, but not both. If Aurelio practices reflection, then he either is self-aware or values self-growth, but not both.
Conclusion: Aurelio does not prioritize his health.
