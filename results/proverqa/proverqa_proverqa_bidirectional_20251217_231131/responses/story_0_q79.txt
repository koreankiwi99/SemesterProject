Premises: If Myla thinks discursively, then he gains influence and leaves a lasting impact. Aries embraces paradoxes. If Aries seeks understanding, then he either avoids complexity or values clarity, but not both. Aries either avoids complexity or embraces paradoxes, but not both. Matthew influences public opinion. If Aries pursues knowledge, then he is either able to think discursively or develop critical thinking, but not both. Myla challenges conventional wisdom. If Aries challenges conventional wisdom, then he either influences public opinion or leaves a lasting impact, but not both. For any philosopher, if they evaluate evidence and consider different perspectives, then they can develop critical thinking. If Matthew pursues knowledge, then he is either able to think discursively or develop critical thinking, but not both. Aries either avoids complexity or pursues knowledge, but not both. Aries challenges conventional wisdom. Aries does not examine arguments. Every philosopher examines arguments or develops critical thinking. Aries influences public opinion. Every philosopher who engages in debates either thinks discursively or seeks new perspectives.
Conclusion: Aries gains influence.
