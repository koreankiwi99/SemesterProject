Premises: If Brandon drives regularly, then he follows traffic rules and is a defensive driver. For Brandon, he is either an experienced driver or teaches road safety, but not both. Brandon follows traffic rules. If Brandon is a driving instructor, then he is either a professional racer or teaches road safety, but not both. If Brandon respects life, then he is precise and a cautious driver. Brandon knows vehicle mechanics. Brandon drives regularly. Brandon enjoys mentoring. If Brandon is an experienced driver, then he is either a defensive driver or a cautious driver, but not both. Either Brandon is a cautious driver or a reckless driver, but not both. Brandon is a professional racer. If Brandon owns a driving school, then he is either a driving instructor or creates a driving curriculum, but not both. If someone knows vehicle mechanics and enjoys mentoring, then they can be a driving instructor.
Conclusion: Brandon is a reckless driver.
