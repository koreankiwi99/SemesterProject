Premises: Moshe either achieves success or faces major setbacks, but not both. Everyone either conquers challenges or learns from failure. Moshe does not reach new heights. Moshe either finds inner peace or builds resilience, but not necessarily both. If Moshe either sets high goals or pursues excellence (but not both), then he pushes past his limits. If Moshe pushes past his limits, then he either overcomes fears or builds resilience (but not both). Everyone who conquers challenges either reaches new heights or finds inner peace (or both). Moshe does not overcome his fears. If Moshe either connects with nature or practices mindfulness (but not both), then he finds inner peace. Moshe does not set high goals. Anyone who sets ambitious targets or believes in themselves aspires to greatness. If Moshe sets challenging targets, then he will push past his limits. Moshe does not face major setbacks. If Moshe either sets goals or embraces risks (but not both), then he conquers challenges. Moshe does not learn from failure.
Conclusion: Moshe aspires to greatness and inspires others along the way.

-- Goal: Moshe aspires to greatness and inspires others along the way.
-- We attempt a proof, but there is no premise linking Moshe to either
