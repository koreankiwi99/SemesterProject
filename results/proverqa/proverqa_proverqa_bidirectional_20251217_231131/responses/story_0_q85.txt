Premises: Brody holds a high rank. Jase prioritizes others. Jase fosters teamwork. If Reece either makes tough decisions or prioritizes others (but not both), then he is respected. If Jase holds a high rank, then he can either lead by example or inspire others, but not both. Anyone who meets challenges and mentors others can become experienced. Jase meets challenges. If Jase either makes tough decisions or prioritizes others (but not both), then he is respected. Reece meets challenges. Harlem is accountable. Anyone who demonstrates integrity and puts others first is respected. Harlem acts with empathy. If Jase is experienced, then he can either foster teamwork or inspire others, but not both. Jase is accountable. Anyone who works hard or sets high standards can inspire others. If Jase is accountable, then he either makes tough decisions or acts with empathy, but not both. Jase mentors others. Jase holds a high rank. If Jase either takes charges or sets goals (but not both), then he makes tough decisions. Jase acts with empathy. If Reece is accountable, then he either makes tough decisions or acts with empathy, but not both. If Jase is respected, then he can either train elite units or lead by example, but not both.
Conclusion: Jase trains elite units.
