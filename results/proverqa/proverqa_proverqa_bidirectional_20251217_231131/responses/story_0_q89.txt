Premises: If Wesson has a noble character, then he is either considered a hero or performs selfless acts, but not both. Wesson prioritizes his family life. Wesson stays under the radar. Wesson either works tirelessly or prioritizes his family life, but not both. If Wesson is well-respected, then he either performs selfless acts or helps others unconditionally, but not both. If someone has strong convictions, then they perform selfless acts and stand up for others. Wesson does not help others unconditionally. Wesson either makes a groundbreaking discovery or stays under the radar, but not both. If Wesson either meets deadlines or contributes freely (but not both), then he works tirelessly. If Wesson is recognized by governments or respected by peers, then he is considered a hero. Wesson has a noble character. Wesson is well-respected or works tirelessly. If Wesson saves lives, then he demonstrates bravery and is recognized by governments.
Conclusion: Wesson is not respected by peers.
