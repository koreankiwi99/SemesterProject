Premises: David assists people or provides quality care. Dearie either assists people or works behind the scene, but does not do both. If Musa has experience, then he is either able to think critically or respond effectively (but not both) in high-pressure situations. If David either assesses situations or coordinates teams (but not both) in emergencies, then he responds effectively. Anyone who prioritizes tasks stays focused. Everyone who faces challenges either solves problems or thinks critically (or both). David is reliable. David either provides quality care or handles emergencies, but not necessarily both. David either assists people or works behind the scene, but does not do both. If David has experience, then he is either able to think critically or respond effectively (but not both) in high-pressure situations. Dearie is reliable. If Grady either acts quickly or stays focused (but not both) in emergencies, then he responds effectively. Grady does not analyze situations. If someone has empathy and has medical skills, then they can assist people. David either works well under pressure or thinks critically, but not both. Musa either provides quality care or handles emergencies, but not necessarily both. If Musa is reliable, then he works well under pressure and has good judgment. David has experience. If Musa either analyzes situations or makes informed decisions (but not both), then he has good judgment. Dearie assists people or provides quality care. Dearie either works well under pressure or thinks critically, but not both. Everyone either stays focused or handles emergencies (or both). If David is reliable, then he works well under pressure and has good judgment. David works behind the scene. Musa does not remain calm. Grady works behind the scene. If someone evaluates evidence and weighs options, then they have good judgment.
Conclusion: David either remains calm or acts quickly in emergencies (or both).
