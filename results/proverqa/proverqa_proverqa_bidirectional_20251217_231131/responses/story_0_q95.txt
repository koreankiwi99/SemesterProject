Premises: Anyone who worked under a mentor or studied design has experience. Maci does not have good taste. If Maci has experience in fashion design, then she is either a perfectionist or creates quality work, but not both. Maci is not a perfectionist. Maci runs her own business. If Maci pays attention to details or has good taste, then she will produce beautiful designs. Maci either runs her own business or studies design, but not both. Maci learns from others. Maci does not produce beautiful designs. If Maci learns from others, then she has worked under a mentor.
Conclusion: Maci either values precision or cares about her appearance (or both).
