Context:
Axl listens to podcasts. Camden either engages in physical activity or reads self-help books, but not both. Noe does not achieve his goals. Axl values his privacy. If Catalina remains composed under pressure, he may not always stay focused, and vice versa. Axl does not achieve his goals. For all humans, if someone is a successful athlete, then they either stay focused or stay disciplined (or both). If Catalina is motivated, then he either reads self-help books or listens to podcasts, but not both. Noe values his privacy. Camden listens to podcasts. Axl either engages in physical activity or reads self-help books, but not both. Axl is motivated. Noe does not prioritize tasks. Catalina achieves his goals or is a successful athlete. Anyone who practices mindfulness or manages stress can remain composed under pressure. If Catalina either prioritizes tasks or sets boundaries (but not both), then he is able to manage stress. If Axl remains composed under pressure, he may not always stay focused, and vice versa. Axl does not prioritize tasks. If Axl is motivated, then he either reads self-help books or listens to podcasts, but not both. If someone values their privacy, then they set boundaries. Camden either engages in physical activity or meditates regularly, but not both. Axl achieves his goals or is a successful athlete. If Axl either prioritizes tasks or sets boundaries (but not both), then he is able to manage stress. Axl either engages in physical activity or meditates regularly, but not both. If someone respects their limits, then they set boundaries. Camden is motivated.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Axl stays disciplined.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Axl values his privacy, so he sets boundaries. He also does not prioritize tasks. Thus, exactly one of {prioritizes tasks, sets boundaries} is true, so by the XOR rule, Axl manages stress.
- Managing stress implies he remains composed under pressure. For Axl, remaining composed implies he does not stay focused.
- Axl does not achieve his goals, but we have (achieves goals or successful athlete). Therefore, Axl is a successful athlete.
- For all humans, successful athlete implies stays focused or stays disciplined. Since Axl does not stay focused, he must stay disciplined.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: True
Correct: No
