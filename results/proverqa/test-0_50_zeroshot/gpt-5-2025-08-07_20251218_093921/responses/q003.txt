Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Bryson pursues public recognition.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Bryson wants fame, so by the rule "If Bryson wants fame or loves performing, then he will perform in public," he performs in public. He also does not share online content. Therefore, the XOR condition "performs in public or shares online content (but not both)" holds. By that conditional, Bryson seeks public recognition. This is consistent with the XOR between seeking public recognition and valuing anonymity.

ANSWER: True

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: True
Correct: No
