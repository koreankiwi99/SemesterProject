Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Emmitt meets challenges and does not manage stress, so he works under a deadline.
- Under a deadline and prioritizes tasks implies he does not stay focused.
- Emmitt faces pressure implies he remains calm or stays focused; since he does not stay focused, he remains calm.
- Emmitt has experience and remains calm, so he trusts his gut feeling; thus he acts on instinct.
- Since Emmitt either acts on instinct or is analytical (but not both), acting on instinct means he is not analytical.
- Emmitt follows clues or pursues details, and he does not follow clues, so he pursues details.
- Interpreting “investigative” as follows clues or pursues details, Emmitt is investigative.

Therefore, although Emmitt is not analytical and we cannot conclude he is probative, he is investigative. The disjunction “analytical or investigative or probative” is thus true.
