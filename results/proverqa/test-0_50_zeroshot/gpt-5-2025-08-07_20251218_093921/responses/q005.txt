Question ID: 5
Difficulty: test-0_50_zeroshot

Context:
Matthias either advances medical knowledge or improves human lives, but not both, doesn't necessarily mean he can't contribute in other ways. Moises teaches at a university. Moises either publishes academic papers or has clinical experience, or he may do both. Moises is not open-minded. Moises either collaborates with peers or develops new techniques, but not both. If Moises has strong curiosity, then he either thinks outside the box or is innovative, but not both. Morgan does not think outside the box. If Kashton is innovative, then he either works independently or collaborates with peers, but not both. If Moises is introspective, then he is either open-minded or has strong curiosity, but not both. Moises does not work independently. If Moises is innovative, then he either works independently or collaborates with peers, but not both. Moises either teaches at a university or publishes academic papers, or he may do both. If Morgan is dedicated to research, then he will make groundbreaking discoveries and improve human lives. Moises either advances medical knowledge or improves human lives, but not both, doesn't necessarily mean he can't contribute in other ways. Morgan either teaches at a university or publishes academic papers, or he may do both. Kashton teaches at a university. If Kashton is introspective, then he is either open-minded or has strong curiosity, but not both. Morgan either collaborates with peers or develops new techniques, but not both. Moises is introspective. Moises develops new techniques or advances medical knowledge. For everyone, either they have clinical experience or they are dedicated to research, but not both is not necessarily true. Moises does not think outside the box. Kashton either publishes academic papers or has clinical experience, or he may do both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Moises does not make a groundbreaking discovery.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Moises is introspective and not open-minded, so by the given rule he must have strong curiosity.
- With strong curiosity and given he does not think outside the box, he must be innovative (from the XOR condition).
- If innovative, he must either work independently or collaborate (XOR). Since he does not work independently, he collaborates with peers.
- Given he collaborates and must XOR with developing new techniques, he does not develop new techniques.
- From “develops new techniques or advances medical knowledge,” he therefore advances medical knowledge.
- From “advances medical knowledge XOR improves human lives,” he does not improve human lives.

There is no rule linking Moises to making groundbreaking discoveries. The only rule about groundbreaking discoveries applies to Morgan. Hence, whether Moises makes a groundbreaking discovery is not determined by the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
