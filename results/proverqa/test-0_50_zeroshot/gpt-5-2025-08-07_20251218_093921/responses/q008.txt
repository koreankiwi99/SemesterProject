Difficulty: test-0_50_zeroshot

Context:
If Eliel either excels in experiments or develops innovative theories (but not both), then he has talent. If Eliel is diligent, then he can either make groundbreaking discoveries or inspire future generations, but not both. Eliel develops innovative theories. Eliel contributes to society. If Navy either excels in experiments or develops innovative theories (but not both), then he has talent. Navy either values his privacy or is a specialist, but not both. If Yehuda works hard, then he either achieves success or has talent. Yehuda either excels in experiments or thinks outside the box, but not both. If Eliel works hard, then he either achieves success or has talent. Eliel does not value his privacy. Eliel is curious. Yehuda works hard. Eliel works hard. If Erik either asks unconventional questions or explores uncharted areas (but not both), then he thinks outside the box. Erik achieves success or is diligent. Eliel either pursues hobbies or inspires future generations, but not necessarily both. If Eliel either asks unconventional questions or explores uncharted areas (but not both), then he thinks outside the box. Yehuda develops innovative theories. Yehuda does not value his privacy. If Navy is curious, then he either explores uncharted areas or takes risks (but not both). Eliel achieves success or is diligent. Eliel either excels in experiments or thinks outside the box, but not both. Eliel either values his privacy or is a specialist, but not both. Eliel asks unconventional questions. Yehuda takes risks. If Eliel is curious, then he either explores uncharted areas or takes risks (but not both). If Eliel is a specialist, then he either pursues hobbies or contributes to society, but not both. Erik is curious. Navy either pursues hobbies or inspires future generations, but not necessarily both. Eliel takes risks.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Eliel does not make groundbreaking discoveries.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- From Eliel does not value his privacy and (values privacy XOR specialist), Eliel is a specialist.
- If specialist then (pursues hobbies XOR contributes to society). Given Eliel contributes to society, he does not pursue hobbies.
- From (pursues hobbies OR inspires future generations) and not pursuing hobbies, Eliel inspires future generations.
- From curiosity and (explores uncharted areas XOR takes risks), and given Eliel takes risks, he does not explore uncharted areas.
- Given asks unconventional questions and not exploring uncharted areas, (asks XOR explores) holds, so Eliel thinks outside the box.
- From (excels in experiments XOR thinks outside the box) and thinking outside the box, Eliel does not excel in experiments.
- Given develops innovative theories and not excelling in experiments, (excels XOR develops) holds, so Eliel has talent.

About groundbreaking discoveries:
- If Eliel is diligent, then (groundbreaking discoveries XOR inspires future generations). Since he inspires future generations, diligence would force not making groundbreaking discoveries.
- However, we do not know if Eliel is diligent. We only have “Eliel achieves success or is diligent,” which leaves diligence undecided (success could satisfy the disjunction).
- If he is not diligent, there is no constraint preventing him from making groundbreaking discoveries.

Therefore, whether Eliel makes groundbreaking discoveries cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain
