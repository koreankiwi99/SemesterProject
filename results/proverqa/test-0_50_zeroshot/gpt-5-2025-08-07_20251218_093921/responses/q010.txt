- From Leila experiments frequently, she values originality and appreciates uniqueness.
- Leila has a vivid imagination, so she finds beauty everywhere, sees new possibilities, and thinks outside the box.
- Thinking outside the box plus valuing originality makes her creative.
- Leila listens actively, so she is perceptive.
- She is attentive and does not take notes; with the exclusive-or condition, she must have good memory. Then, from perceptive with the exclusive-or, she does not study carefully.

None of the rules connect these properties to being resourceful, nor is there any rule that implies she is not resourceful. Therefore, whether Leila is resourceful cannot be determined.
