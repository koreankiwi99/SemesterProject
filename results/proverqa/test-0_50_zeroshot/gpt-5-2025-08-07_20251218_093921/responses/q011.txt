==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Kartier either thinks creatively or listens actively, but not both" and "Kartier thinks creatively," we conclude Kartier does not listen actively.
- From "Kartier listens actively or communicates effectively," he must communicate effectively.
- With "Kartier builds strong relationships" and the rule that strong relationships + effective communication ⇒ skilled networker, Kartier is a skilled networker.
- Given "Kartier has a strong work ethic" and the XOR rule (excels in profession or skilled networker), since he is a skilled networker, he does not excel in his profession.
- From "Kartier is passionate about his craft" and the rule, he has attention to detail and is an innovative designer.
- No rule connects these traits (innovative designer, skilled networker, attention to detail, etc.) to "creates wearable art," nor is there any explicit statement that he creates wearable art.

Therefore, the truth of "Kartier creates wearable art" cannot be determined from the given information.
