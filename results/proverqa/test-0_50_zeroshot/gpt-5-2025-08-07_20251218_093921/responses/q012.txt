Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Chosen is respected.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Chosen listens actively, so he builds consensus (and values diversity).
- Chosen leads by example, so he has charisma. With charisma, he must either empower others or foster collaboration (but not both). Given he fosters collaboration, he does not empower others.
- Chosen avoids confrontation; with the XOR rule, he does not foster inclusion.
- Since he builds consensus and does not empower others, the (builds consensus XOR empowers others) condition holds, so he has leadership skills.
- Having leadership skills implies (morally strong XOR strong convictions). Given he has strong convictions, he is not morally strong.
- Chosen has authority, and with the (stands tall XOR commands attention) rule plus “does not command attention,” he stands tall. Standing tall implies he is physically imposing.
- Thus, he is physically imposing and not morally strong, so (physically imposing XOR morally strong) holds, which implies he is respected.

ANSWER: True

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False

Correct: No
