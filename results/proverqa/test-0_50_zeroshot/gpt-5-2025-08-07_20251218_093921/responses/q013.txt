==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Mylah has a strong network” and “If Mylah has a strong network, then she either builds a successful team or has leadership skills, but not both,” plus “Mylah does not build a successful team,” it follows that Mylah has leadership skills.
- With leadership skills and “If Mylah has leadership skills, then she either starts her own business or leads a community project, but not both,” and given “Mylah starts her own business,” it follows she does not lead a community project.
- From “Mylah either leads a community project or holds public office,” she holds public office.
- From “Mylah either holds public office or works in industry, but not both,” she does not work in industry.
- From “Mylah either works in industry or pursues a Ph.D., but not both,” she pursues a Ph.D.
- “Mylah is highly educated” implies she publishes papers; with “Anyone who publishes papers either receives accolades or conducts extensive research (or both)” and “Mylah does not receive accolades,” she conducts extensive research, hence “If Mylah conducts extensive research, then she will advance scientific knowledge,” so she advances scientific knowledge.
- Given “If Mylah pursues a Ph.D., then she is either dedicated to marine research or advances scientific knowledge, but not both,” and she advances scientific knowledge, she is not dedicated to marine research.

There is no rule linking any of Mylah’s properties to inspiring environmental action; the only such rule applies to Alfredo. Thus we cannot determine whether Mylah inspires environmental action.
