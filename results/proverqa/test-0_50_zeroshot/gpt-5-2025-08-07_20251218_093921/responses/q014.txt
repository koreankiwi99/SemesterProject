Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Leyla gives back to her community.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Leyla appreciates beauty, so she loves nature; anyone who loves nature is outdoorsy. Therefore, Leyla is outdoorsy.
- If Leyla is outdoorsy, then she either pursues environmental causes or supports local businesses (but not both). Given Leyla does not support local businesses, she must pursue environmental causes.
- Separately, Leyla either pursues environmental causes or finds inspiration (but not both). Since she pursues environmental causes, she does not find inspiration.
- The only rule connecting “gives back to her community” is specific to Louisa: if Louisa finds inspiration, then she can either create beautiful art or give back to her community (but not both). There is no analogous rule for Leyla.
- No given rule implies that Leyla gives back to her community, nor do the facts entail its negation.

Conclusion: We cannot determine whether Leyla gives back to her community.
