Question ID: 16
Difficulty: test-0_50_zeroshot

Context:
For Ethan, either he advocates for conservation or he cares about the environment, but it's not necessarily the case that he does both. Either Ethan has artistic talent or he applies science, but not both. Ethan supports sustainability. Ethan applies science or is a theorist. Ethan builds prototypes. Ethan does not design models. Ethan either pursues scientific research or studies botany, but not both. If Cadence either designs models or builds prototypes (but not both), then he is an inventor. Anyone who expresses creatively or has good taste has artistic talent. If Ethan either designs models or builds prototypes (but not both), then he is an inventor. Ethan expresses creatively. Either Anne has artistic talent or he applies science, but not both. If Ethan either supports sustainability or protects wildlife (but not both), then he advocates for conservation. Ethan does not protect wildlife. Ethan either has practical skills or pursues scientific research, but not both. If Ethan is an inventor, then he is either a theorist or has practical skills, but not both.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ethan develops eco-friendly solutions.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Given facts let us deduce what we can about Ethan:
- He expresses creatively, so he has artistic talent. By XOR, he does not apply science.
- Since “applies science or is a theorist,” and he doesn’t apply science, he is a theorist.
- He builds prototypes and does not design models; by the XOR-conditional, he is an inventor.
- If inventor, then (theorist XOR practical skills); since he is a theorist, he does not have practical skills.
- From (practical skills XOR pursues research), he pursues scientific research; thus he does not study botany.
- He supports sustainability and does not protect wildlife; given the XOR conditional, he advocates for conservation.

None of these statements entail that he “develops eco-friendly solutions.” That predicate is not defined or implied by supporting sustainability, advocating conservation, being an inventor, or building prototypes.

ANSWER: Uncertain
