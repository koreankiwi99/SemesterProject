Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Hero is loyal.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Hero is gentle” and “If Hero is gentle, then he either has a good temper or follows a leader (but not both)” plus “Hero has a good temper,” we infer Hero does not follow a leader.
- From “Hero either follows a leader or responds to cues,” and not follows a leader, we infer Hero responds to cues.
- This may lead to possible training/discipline, but no given rule connects any of these traits to loyalty.
- The only statement involving loyalty is “Hero is strong or loyal.” Without proving that Hero is not strong, we cannot conclude he is loyal; and nothing states he is loyal outright.

Therefore, whether Hero is loyal cannot be determined from the given information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
