Context:
Savanna does not exercise regularly. If Smoochie has gangly limbs, then she either trips frequently or is clumsy (or both). Jenesis has gangly limbs. Savanna does not get enough rest. Smoochie does not exercise regularly. Savanna has gangly limbs. Jenesis is active. For all giraffes, having good reflexes and tripping frequently are mutually exclusive. Savanna does not have good balance. If Savanna grows rapidly or needs practice, then she will mature slowly. If Smoochie is active, then she either gets enough rest or eats nutritious food, but not both. If Savanna is an adult giraffe, then she either has a strong jaw or a long neck, but not both. For all giraffes, if they have a long neck or long legs, then they can reach high food. Savanna does not grow rapidly. If Genevieve matures slowly, then she has a long neck and develops unique skills. Any giraffe that exercises regularly or eats nutritious food can have a strong body. If Genevieve grows rapidly or needs practice, then she will mature slowly. Genevieve has good reflexes. If Genevieve is tall, then she either has long legs or a strong body, but not both. Genevieve does not have good balance. If Smoochie is clumsy, then she needs practice. Savanna is active. Jenesis does not grow rapidly. If Savanna has gangly limbs, then she either trips frequently or is clumsy (or both). If Savanna is curious, then she needs practice and learns quickly. If Savanna is active, then she either gets enough rest or eats nutritious food, but not both. Genevieve does not get enough rest. Every giraffe that matures quickly either has a strong body or a good physique (or both). If Savanna can run fast, then she is either tall or has good balance, but not both. If Savanna is clumsy, then she needs practice. If Genevieve can run fast, then she is either tall or has good balance, but not both. Savanna can run fast. Any giraffe that has a high center of gravity or walks efficiently has long legs. If Savanna is tall, then she either has long legs or a strong body, but not both. Savanna has good reflexes. Smoochie can run fast. If Savanna matures slowly, then she has a long neck and develops unique skills.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Savanna can reach high food.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Savanna has gangly limbs. If she has gangly limbs, then she trips frequently or is clumsy.
- Savanna has good reflexes, and good reflexes and tripping frequently are mutually exclusive. Therefore, she does not trip frequently, so she must be clumsy.
- If Savanna is clumsy, she needs practice. If she needs practice (or grows rapidly), she matures slowly. Hence, Savanna matures slowly.
- If Savanna matures slowly, then she has a long neck.
- Any giraffe with a long neck or long legs can reach high food. Therefore, Savanna can reach high food.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: True
Correct: No
