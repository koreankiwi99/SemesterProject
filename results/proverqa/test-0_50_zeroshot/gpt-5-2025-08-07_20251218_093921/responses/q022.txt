Question ID: 22
Difficulty: test-0_50_zeroshot

Context:
If Stetson navigates the sea, then he will read nautical maps. Ophelia enjoys diving. If Maximiliano has curiosity, then he appreciates marine life and enjoys diving. Stetson does not fear depths. Reyna either respects history or values discovery (or both). Reyna does not fear depths. If Ophelia loves the underwater world, then he likes scuba diving. If Ophelia explores shipwrecks, then he either learns from the past or appreciates marine life (but not both). Ophelia preserves sites. If Reyna likes scuba diving and reads nautical maps, then he can study oceanography. If Ophelia navigates the sea, then he will read nautical maps. For Reyna, either he loves the underwater world or he fears depths, but not both. Reyna has curiosity. Stetson preserves sites. Stetson enjoys diving. Maximiliano is adventurous. Stetson does not track currents. Maximiliano does not track currents. If Stetson is adventurous, then he either explores shipwrecks or studies oceanography (but not both). If Stetson likes scuba diving and reads nautical maps, then he can study oceanography. Stetson tracks currents or navigates the sea. If Stetson loves the underwater world, then he likes scuba diving. For Stetson, either he loves the underwater world or he fears depths, but not both. If Maximiliano is adventurous, then he either explores shipwrecks or studies oceanography (but not both). All people who preserve sites respect history and learn from the past. Stetson has curiosity. Ophelia tracks currents or navigates the sea. Stetson is adventurous. Stetson collects artifacts or likes scuba diving. If Stetson has curiosity, then he appreciates marine life and enjoys diving.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Stetson does not value discovery.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
We are given no rule that links Stetson to valuing discovery, either positively or negatively.

From the facts:
- Stetson does not fear depths and, given the XOR (loves underwater world or fears depths), he must love the underwater world. Hence he likes scuba diving.
- Stetson does not track currents but must navigate the sea (from the disjunction), so he reads nautical maps, and thus he can study oceanography (but that is “can study,” not “studies”).
- Stetson preserves sites, so he respects history and learns from the past.

None of these imply anything about “values discovery” for Stetson, and there is no rule making valuing discovery incompatible with respecting history or learning from the past. The only statement connecting “values discovery” is specific to Reyna. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Stetson values discovery or not.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
