Difficulty: test-0_50_zeroshot

Context:
For Pet, he either values mystery or loves history, but not both. Zyaire stays motivated. Everyone manages stress or works under pressure. Zyaire has an academic reputation. Anyone who is inquisitive or enjoys puzzles values mystery. If Princeton faces criticism, then he either manages stress or stays motivated (but not both). Pet does not enjoy puzzles. Princeton is inquisitive. Princeton stays motivated. Giggles is either a dedicated archaeologist or has an academic reputation, but not both. For Princeton, he either values mystery or loves history, but not both. Giggles is inquisitive. Giggles does not have a strong focus. If Princeton is introspective, then he prefers to work alone. If Giggles works under pressure, then he is either strongly focused or introspective (but not both). Princeton does not have a strong focus. Princeton has an academic reputation. If Princeton collects artifacts, then he loves history. Princeton is either a dedicated archaeologist or has an academic reputation, but not both. Anyone who prioritizes tasks and takes breaks can manage stress. If Giggles is introspective, then he prefers to work alone. Princeton faces criticism. Princeton does not enjoy puzzles. Zyaire either prefers to work alone or seeks discovery, but not both. Giggles faces criticism. Princeton either prefers to work alone or seeks discovery, but not both. If Princeton works under pressure, then he is either strongly focused or introspective (but not both). If Zyaire faces criticism, then he either manages stress or stays motivated (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Princeton is not willing to risk failure.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Princeton is inquisitive, so he values mystery; by the XOR with loving history, he does not love history.
- He faces criticism and stays motivated; by the XOR rule (manages stress vs stays motivated), he does not manage stress.
- Since everyone either manages stress or works under pressure, Princeton works under pressure.
- Working under pressure implies either strong focus or introspective (but not both). Given he does not have a strong focus, he is introspective.
- Introspective implies he prefers to work alone. By the XOR with seeking discovery, he does not seek discovery.

None of the given rules define or relate “willing to risk failure” to any of these properties. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of the statement from the provided information.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
