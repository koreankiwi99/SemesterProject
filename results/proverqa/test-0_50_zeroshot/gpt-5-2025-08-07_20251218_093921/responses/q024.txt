Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Casanova does not attract female attention.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Casanova is charismatic and spontaneous. From “If charismatic, then spontaneous or follows tradition, but not both,” and given he is spontaneous, he does not follow tradition.
- From “follows tradition or has confidence, but not both,” since he does not follow tradition, he has confidence.
- Given he has confidence and does not express himself creatively, he must perform a courtship display.
- From “every peacock that performs a courtship display either displays vibrant feathers or has iridescent plumage,” and Casanova does not have iridescent plumage, he must display vibrant feathers. This likely conflicts with “Casanova does not have vibrant plumage,” indicating some inconsistency in the premises.
- From practicing vocal skills and developing individuality, he has a distinct call; thus he either blends in or becomes a social leader. Separately, since he does not have vibrant plumage and “vibrant plumage or blends in, but not both,” he blends in.

Crucially, there is no rule linking any of these properties to “attracts female attention.” The phrase is not defined in the premises, and no provided implication determines whether he does or does not attract female attention. Therefore, the truth of the statement cannot be determined from the given information.
