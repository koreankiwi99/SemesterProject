Options:
  True

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From Rayne’s high standards: H → (respects tradition ∧ perfectionist). So Rayne is a perfectionist.
- Perfectionist ⇒ (values precision xor creative). Given Rayne is not creative, he must value precision.
- “Thinks spontaneously” and “meticulous by nature” are opposites (S ↔ ¬M). Given Rayne does not think spontaneously, he is meticulous by nature; hence he has attention to detail.
- Attention to detail ⇒ (pursues excellence ∨ works diligently). Given Rayne does not pursue excellence, he works diligently.
- Passion ∨ works diligently ⇒ dedicated to craft. So Rayne is dedicated; hence skilled lapidary artist.
- Skilled lapidary artist ⇒ (create masterpieces xor reveal hidden beauty). Given Rayne can reveal hidden beauty, the xor forces that he does not create masterpieces.
