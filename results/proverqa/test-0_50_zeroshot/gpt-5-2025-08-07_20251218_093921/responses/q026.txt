==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From "Marco has passion" and "If Marco has passion, then he works outdoors and values wildlife," we get: Marco works outdoors and values wildlife.
- From "Anyone who lives sustainably or values wildlife respects nature," Marco respects nature.
- From "Marco is curious-minded" and "If someone is curious-minded, then they will pursue knowledge," Marco pursues knowledge.
- From "Anyone who respects nature and pursues knowledge can be dedicated to conservation," we only get that Marco can be dedicated (possibility), not that he is dedicated.
- Only if Marco is dedicated to conservation does it follow that he will make a lasting impact. No premise asserts that he is dedicated.

Therefore, whether Marco makes a lasting impact cannot be determined.
