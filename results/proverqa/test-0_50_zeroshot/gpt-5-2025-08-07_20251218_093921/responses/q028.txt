Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Dr. Santiago Hernandez does not inspire future researchers.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Santiago has passion and does not collaborate with others. From the rule “If passion then (pursues knowledge XOR collaborates with others),” this forces Santiago to pursue knowledge.
- If he has curiosity or pursues knowledge, then he studies microorganisms. Since he pursues knowledge, Santiago studies microorganisms.
- Santiago has expertise, which implies he develops new treatments.
- If Santiago studies microorganisms, then he can either develop new treatments or inspire future researchers, but not both (exclusive OR). Since he develops new treatments, he cannot inspire future researchers.

Therefore, Santiago does not inspire future researchers.

ANSWER: True

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: True
Prediction: True
Correct: Yes
