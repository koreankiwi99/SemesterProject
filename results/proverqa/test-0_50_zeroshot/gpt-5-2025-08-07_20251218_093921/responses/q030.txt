Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Jasper is a calculated risk taker, or he is a skilled poker player and makes informed decisions.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Jasper monitors the game or plays strategically” and “Jasper does not monitor the game,” we get that Jasper plays strategically.
- If Jasper plays strategically, then exactly one of Skilled(Jasper) or ReadsOpp(Jasper) holds. Given “Jasper reads his opponents well,” it follows that Skilled(Jasper) is false.
- From perceptive + confidence → listens to intuition → trusts instincts, and from practicing → sharpens skills → studies patterns → assesses odds, we get Jasper assesses odds and trusts his instincts; thus he takes bold action.
- There is no rule connecting Jasper’s bold action to being a calculated risk taker, and no information establishing whether Jasper makes informed decisions.

Therefore, the statement “Jasper is a calculated risk taker, or he is a skilled poker player and makes informed decisions” reduces to “Jasper is a calculated risk taker,” which is not determined by the premises.

ANSWER: Uncertain
