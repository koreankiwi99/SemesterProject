Question ID: 31
Difficulty: test-0_50_zeroshot

Context:
Layne has a chronic problem. If Lubber experiences relief, then he either adheres to a treatment plan or changes his lifestyle (but not both). If Tyler has a chronic problem, then he has a medical condition and seeks alternative solutions. Tyler receives a proper diagnosis. Lubber regains independence. Anyone who receives a proper diagnosis or finds effective medication can experience relief. Tyler has a chronic problem. If Layne suffers an injury, then he will undergo physical therapy. If Tyler suffers an injury, then he will undergo physical therapy. Carter sets realistic goals. Layne does not find effective medication. Carter seeks medical attention. If Layne has a chronic problem, then he has a medical condition and seeks alternative solutions. If Carter has a medical condition, then he either undergoes physical therapy or takes prescribed medication (but not both). For anyone, either finding new hobbies or changing their lifestyle are two separate paths, and not necessarily related. Tyler seeks medical attention. If Tyler has a medical condition, then he either undergoes physical therapy or takes prescribed medication (but not both). Tyler does not find new hobbies. If Tyler experiences relief, then he either adheres to a treatment plan or changes his lifestyle (but not both). If Layne has resilience, then he either sets realistic goals or practices self-care, but not both. Everyone who seeks medical attention either follows a doctor's advice or adheres to a treatment plan (or both). Tyler suffers an injury. Anyone who has strong support or practices self-care can manage chronic pain. Lubber does not have resilience. Tyler does not find effective medication. Carter receives a proper diagnosis. Tyler has strong support.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Tyler can manage chronic pain, benefit from medication and regain independence.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Tyler has a chronic problem, so he has a medical condition (given). He also suffers an injury, which implies he will undergo physical therapy. Given the XOR rule for those with a medical condition, this means he does not take prescribed medication.
- Tyler does not find effective medication. Combined with not taking prescribed medication, there is no basis for “benefit from medication.”
- Tyler has strong support; anyone with strong support can manage chronic pain. So he can manage chronic pain.
- There is no information implying Tyler regains independence (only Lubber is stated to regain independence).

Conclusion: The statement requires all three parts to hold. While Tyler can manage chronic pain, he does not benefit from medication, and there’s no support that he regains independence. Therefore, the statement is false.

ANSWER: False
