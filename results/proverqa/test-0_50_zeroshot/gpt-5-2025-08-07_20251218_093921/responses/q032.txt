Question ID: 32
Difficulty: test-0_50_zeroshot

Context:
Koa undergoes experimentation. If Koa has complex behavior, then he either responds to stimuli or follows a food source. Koa either forms bonds with his caregivers or displays unexpected behavior, but not necessarily both. Koa does not explore his environment. Koa responds to stimuli or recognizes his hand feeder. Rhea either explores his environment or encounters other fish. If Janiyah is provoked, then he will become aggressive. If Koa receives hormone treatment, then he will either become aggressive or become docile, but not both. If Koa undergoes experimentation, then he either displays unexpected behavior or receives hormone treatment (or both). Koa is swimming near the border of his territory. Koa has complex behavior. Rhea's food is threatened. If Koa recognizes his hand feeder or swims calmly, then he can form bonds with his caregivers. If Koa is swimming near the border of his territory, then he either encounters another fish or has his territory invaded (but not both). Janiyah does not explore his environment. Koa either explores his environment or encounters other fish. Koa's food is threatened. Koa follows a food source. If Janiyah receives hormone treatment, then he will either become aggressive or become docile, but not both. Kasen responds to stimuli or recognizes his hand feeder. Janiyah follows a food source. Every fish that either has its territory invaded or has its food threatened (but not both) is provoked. If Kasen undergoes experimentation, then he either displays unexpected behavior or receives hormone treatment (or both). If Kasen recognizes his hand feeder or swims calmly, then he can form bonds with his caregivers. If Koa is provoked, then he will become aggressive.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Koa does not become docile.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Koa does not explore his environment, and we have “Koa either explores his environment or encounters other fish,” so Koa encounters other fish.
- Koa is near the border; near-border implies “encounters another fish XOR territory invaded.” Since he encounters another fish, he does not have his territory invaded.
- Koa’s food is threatened. Thus, exactly one of {territory invaded, food threatened} holds, so Koa is provoked (by the rule about provocation under XOR).
- If Koa is provoked, then he becomes aggressive. Therefore, Koa becomes aggressive.
- If Koa receives hormone treatment, then he becomes aggressive XOR docile. However, from experimentation we only know “unexpected behavior OR hormone treatment (or both)”; we cannot conclude he received hormone treatment.
- Without established hormone treatment and no general rule that aggressive excludes docile, we cannot conclude that Koa does not become docile.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
