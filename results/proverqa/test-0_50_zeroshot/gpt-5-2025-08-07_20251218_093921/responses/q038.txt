Question ID: 38
Difficulty: test-0_50_zeroshot

Context:
Rowan thinks critically. If Rowan is detail-oriented, then she either estimates the duration of tasks or prioritizes tasks (but not both). Rowan faces challenges. Anyone who solves complex problems or works hard can gain experience. Rowan is detail-oriented. Anyone who breaks down tasks or identifies goals can set priorities. Rowan solves complex problems. Rowan prioritizes tasks. If Rowan either estimates the duration of tasks or allocates resources effectively (but not both), then she manages her time. Everyone who thinks critically either considers alternatives or evaluates options (or both). Rowan allocates resources effectively. If someone sets priorities and manages their time, then they can stay focused. If Rowan either evaluates options or visualizes outcomes (but not both), then she identifies goals. Rowan does not consider alternatives. If Rowan faces challenges, then she either stays focused or works hard (but not both). Rowan is either experienced or intelligent, but not necessarily both. Rowan is intelligent or resourceful (or both). Rowan does not break down tasks. Rowan does not visualize outcomes. If Kamryn faces challenges, then she either stays focused or works hard (but not both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Rowan is resourceful.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From thinks critically and not considering alternatives, Rowan must evaluate options.
- With evaluates options and not visualizing outcomes, the XOR condition implies she identifies goals; thus she sets priorities.
- She also prioritizes tasks; with detail-oriented and the XOR rule, she does not estimate durations.
- She allocates resources effectively; with the XOR rule, she manages her time.
- Setting priorities and managing time implies she stays focused.
- Facing challenges with the XOR rule implies she is not working hard.
- She solves complex problems, so she gains experience.
- Having experience does not determine whether she is intelligent; and “intelligent or resourceful (or both)” does not force resourceful—she could be intelligent and not resourceful.

Therefore, whether Rowan is resourceful cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
