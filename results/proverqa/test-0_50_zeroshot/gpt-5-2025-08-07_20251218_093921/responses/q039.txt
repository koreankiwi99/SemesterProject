Options:

  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Xiomara has extra resources and sees a local need, so she donates to charity (given 5, 12, 22).
- Anyone who donates to charity is active in the community, so Xiomara is active (4).
- Xiomara pursues a hobby and must either pursue a hobby or volunteer but not both, so she does not volunteer regularly (10, 29).
- If Xiomara is active, she either owns a local business or volunteers (but not both). Since she does not volunteer, she owns a local business (25).
- There is no rule that being active or owning a local business makes Xiomara community-minded. The only such implication is stated specifically for Corey (3), not generally.
- From “cares for others or is selfless” and “does not care for others,” we get Xiomara is selfless (7, 17), but “selfless or generous (not necessarily both)” does not imply she is generous (21).
- No rule makes Xiomara kind.

Therefore, none of “kind,” “generous,” or “community-minded” is entailed, and none is disproven.
