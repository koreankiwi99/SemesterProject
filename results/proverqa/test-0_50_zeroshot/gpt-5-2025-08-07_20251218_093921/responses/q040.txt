Question ID: 40
Difficulty: test-0_50_zeroshot

Context:
Cataleya refines flavors or masters blending skills. Cataleya dedicates herself to a craft. Cataleya is an entrepreneur. Cataleya either masters blending skills or develops recipes, but it's possible for her to do both. Cataleya respects tradition. If Cataleya dedicates herself to a craft, then she either gains recognition or builds expertise, but not both. If Cataleya becomes a master distiller, then she either studies distillation techniques or learns aging processes (but not both). Cataleya either perfects batch control or experiments with flavor profiles, but not both. Cataleya gains recognition. Cataleya either values innovation or pursues craftsmanship, but not both. Cataleya learns aging processes. Cataleya develops recipes or perfects batch control. Cataleya does not refine flavors. If Cataleya is an entrepreneur, then she either values innovation or respects tradition, but not both. If Cataleya pursues craftsmanship, then she either becomes a master distiller or builds expertise (or both).

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Cataleya cannot create unique whiskey.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “does not refine flavors” and “refines flavors or masters blending skills,” we get masters blending skills.
- Entrepreneur and “entrepreneur -> (values innovation XOR respects tradition)” with “respects tradition” given implies values innovation is false.
- “values innovation XOR pursues craftsmanship” then forces pursues craftsmanship true.
- Dedicates to a craft and “dedicates -> (gains recognition XOR builds expertise)” with gains recognition given implies builds expertise is false.
- “pursues craftsmanship -> (master distiller or builds expertise)” with builds expertise false implies master distiller true.
- “master distiller -> (studies techniques XOR learns aging)” with learns aging given implies does not study techniques.
- “perfects batch control XOR experiments with flavor profiles” remains unresolved; also “develops recipes or perfects batch control” plus “masters blending skills or develops recipes” leave develops recipes and perfects batch control undetermined.

Nothing in the premises defines or links “creating unique whiskey” to the given predicates (innovation, experimentation, recipes, blending, etc.). Since we cannot derive either that she can or cannot create unique whiskey from the provided information, the truth of the statement is not determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
