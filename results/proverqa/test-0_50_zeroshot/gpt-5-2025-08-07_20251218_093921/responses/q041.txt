Question ID: 41
Difficulty: test-0_50_zeroshot

Context:
Chris sets high goals. Anyone who sets high goals or overcomes challenges has a strong will. Chris either listens to his body or pushes it to the limit, but not both. Everyone who thrives under pressure either pursues challenging activities or seeks an adrenaline rush (or both). If Chris enjoys extreme sports, then he either has a strong will or engages in outdoor activities (but not both). Colt values his health. Chris values his health. If Colt either trains in extreme weather or participates in long-distance events (but not both), then he will develop cooling strategies. Chris does not pursue challenging activities. Chris thrives under pressure. Cecilia competes in ultra-marathons. Colt either engages in outdoor activities or participates in long-distance events. Chris competes in ultra-marathons. Kira either listens to his body or pushes it to the limit, but not both. Chris sets realistic goals. If someone values their health, then they set realistic goals and listen to their body. Chris overcomes challenges. If Chris competes in ultra-marathons and experiences hyperpyrexia, then he will develop cooling strategies. If Chris seeks an adrenaline rush, then he enjoys extreme sports. Chris either engages in outdoor activities or participates in long-distance events.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Chris learns to prioritize safety.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Chris values his health. By the rule “If someone values their health, then they set realistic goals and listen to their body,” Chris sets realistic goals and listens to his body.
- From the XOR “Chris either listens to his body or pushes it to the limit,” and since he listens to his body, he does not push it to the limit.
- Chris thrives under pressure but does not pursue challenging activities; thus, by the rule on thriving under pressure, he seeks an adrenaline rush, which implies he enjoys extreme sports.
- From enjoying extreme sports and the XOR condition with strong will/outdoor activities (and given Chris has a strong will), we infer he is not engaging in outdoor activities, so from the disjunction he participates in long-distance events.

However, none of the given rules equate listening to his body, setting realistic goals, or participating in long-distance events with “learning to prioritize safety,” nor do we have that Chris develops cooling strategies (which would require hyperpyrexia). Therefore, the statement “Chris learns to prioritize safety” is not entailed or contradicted by the premises.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: Uncertain
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: Yes
