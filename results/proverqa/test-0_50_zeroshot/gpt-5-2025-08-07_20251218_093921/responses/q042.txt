Context:
If Madden investigates reptile behavior, then she either analyzes terrestrial ecosystems or explores aquatic habitats, but not both. Madden analyzes terrestrial ecosystems. Kendra cares for animals. If Amoura researches amphibians or explores aquatic habitats, then she focuses on frogs. Kendra either participates in conservations or publishes academic papers, but not both. If Amoura specializes in ecology, then she will research amphibians. Kendra either focuses on frogs or specializes in snakes, but not both. All herpetologists who care for animals love wildlife. Kendra either specializes in snakes or studies Teiidae lizards, but not both. Amoura either specializes in snakes or studies Teiidae lizards, but not both. Kendra analyzes terrestrial ecosystems. If Kendra investigates reptile behavior, then she either analyzes terrestrial ecosystems or explores aquatic habitats, but not both. If Madden loves wildlife, then she will participate in conservation efforts. Amoura specializes in ecology. If Kendra travels extensively, then she collects rare samples and publishes academic papers. If Amoura studies Teiidae lizards, then she can either make groundbreaking discoveries or inspire fellow scientists, but not both. Chipmunk investigates reptile behavior. If Kendra either classifies species or develops conservation plans (but not both), then she inspires fellow scientists. Madden either focuses on frogs or specializes in snakes, but not both. If Kendra researches amphibians or explores aquatic habitats, then she focuses on frogs. If Kendra loves wildlife, then she will participate in conservation efforts. If Kendra studies Teiidae lizards, then she can either make groundbreaking discoveries or inspire fellow scientists, but not both. Kendra investigates reptile behavior. Madden cares for animals. Kendra specializes in ecology. If a herpetologist publishes academic papers, then they do not necessarily inspire fellow scientists, and if a herpetologist inspires fellow scientists, then they do not necessarily publish academic papers. Amoura either participates in conservations or publishes academic papers, but not both. If Kendra specializes in ecology, then she will research amphibians.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Kendra does not make groundbreaking discoveries.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Kendra specializes in ecology, so she researches amphibians.
- If Kendra researches amphibians, then she focuses on frogs. Therefore, Kendra focuses on frogs.
- Kendra either focuses on frogs or specializes in snakes, but not both. Since she focuses on frogs, she does not specialize in snakes.
- Kendra either specializes in snakes or studies Teiidae lizards, but not both. Since she does not specialize in snakes, she studies Teiidae lizards.
- If Kendra studies Teiidae lizards, then she either makes groundbreaking discoveries or inspires fellow scientists, but not both. This gives an exclusive choice: exactly one of “makes groundbreaking discoveries” or “inspires fellow scientists” is true.
- No other given information forces which of the two holds.

Therefore, we cannot determine whether Kendra makes groundbreaking discoveries.

ANSWER: Uncertain

==================================================
Result:
==================================================
Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
