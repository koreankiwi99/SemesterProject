Everyone who explores uncharted territories either seeks challenges or is adventurous (or both). Ada balances her body and mind. If someone embarks on solo journeys, then they either enjoy solitude or seek challenges (or both). Ada either prefers familiar routes or explores uncharted territories, but not both. If Ronin either practices mindfulness or seeks inner peace (but not both), then she values serenity. If Ada either practices mindfulness or seeks inner peace (but not both), then she values serenity. Ada meditates regularly. Truett meditates regularly. If Ada balances her body and mind, then she will engage in yoga. If Ronin meditates regularly, then she either engages in yoga or practices mindfulness (but not both). Ada seeks inner peace.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Ada is not risk-averse.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- Ada meditates and balances body and mind, so she engages in yoga. Given the yoga/mindfulness XOR, she does not practice mindfulness.
- She seeks inner peace; with not-mindfulness, the (mindfulness XOR inner peace) condition holds, so she values serenity.
- She enjoys hiking, so she has outdoor skills; thus (values serenity XOR appreciates nature). Since she values serenity, she does not appreciate nature.
- From “either appreciates nature or embarks on solo journeys (inclusive),” not appreciating nature implies she embarks on solo journeys.
- She does not prefer familiar routes; with the XOR to exploring uncharted territories, she explores uncharted territories.
- Exploring implies (seeks challenges OR adventurous).
- Ada is exactly one of adventurous or risk-averse.

Two consistent possibilities remain:
- Adventurous (then not risk-averse), or
- Risk-averse (then, by exploring, she must seek challenges).

Both satisfy all given constraints. Therefore, whether Ada is not risk-averse cannot be determined.

ANSWER: Uncertain

Ground Truth: False
Prediction: Uncertain
Correct: No
