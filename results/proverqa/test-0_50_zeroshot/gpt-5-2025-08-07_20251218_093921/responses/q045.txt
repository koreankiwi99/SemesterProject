Natasha either leads interdisciplinary teams or excels in an academic environment, but not both. If Natasha is curious, then she is either open-minded or thinks critically (but not both). If Adelaide is curious, then she is either open-minded or thinks critically (but not both). If Natasha reads widely and thinks critically, then she can have expertise. Natasha is not open-minded. Natasha either thrives in remote locations or has a passion for archaeology, but not both. Adelaide pursues new knowledge or makes groundbreaking discoveries. Natasha explores new ideas. If someone seeks knowledge and explores new ideas, then they enjoy learning. Natasha seeks knowledge. All people who enjoy learning ask questions and have curiosity. Natasha works independently. Damari works independently. Natasha asks questions. Natasha either excels in an academic environment or thrives in remote locations, but not both. Adelaide pursues new knowledge.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Natasha has a passion for archaeology or comes from a family of adventurers, then she makes groundbreaking discoveries.

Options:
  True
  False
  Uncertain

==================================================
Model Response:
==================================================
- From “Natasha values cultural heritage” and “Natasha either values cultural heritage or comes from a family of adventurers, but not both,” we get FA(N) is false. So the antecedent “passion for archaeology or family of adventurers” reduces to PA(N).
- Natasha is curious (seeks knowledge and explores new ideas ⇒ enjoys learning ⇒ asks questions and is curious). With “If Natasha is curious, then open-minded XOR thinks critically” and “Natasha is not open-minded,” we conclude she thinks critically.
- “Reads widely and thinks critically ⇒ can have expertise” does not assert she has expertise, so we cannot use the later constraint about expertise to fix other traits.
- XORs: LIT xor EAE, and EAE xor TRL, and TRL xor PA. These allow two consistent cases:
  - Case 1: LIT true, EAE false, TRL true, PA false.
  - Case 2: LIT false, EAE true, TRL false, PA true.
  Hence PA(N) is undetermined.
- No given rule links PA(N) to “makes groundbreaking discoveries” for Natasha. The only statements about groundbreaking discoveries concern Adelaide.

Therefore, the implication “If PA(N) or FA(N) then Natasha makes groundbreaking discoveries” cannot be determined from the premises.

ANSWER: Uncertain
