ANSWER: Yes

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic couldn't automatically resolve the contradiction in the first case branch. The context contained:
- `afford : AffordDownPayment P`
- `given : ¬ AffordDownPayment P`

But `contradiction` didn't handle this automatically. We fix it by explicitly:
1. Using `exfalso` to change the goal to `False`
2. Applying the contradiction `given afford` (which proves `False`)

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom P : Person
axiom SaveAggressively : Person → Prop
axiom AffordDownPayment : Person → Prop
axiom ImproveCredit : Person → Prop
axiom QualifyMortgage : Person → Prop
axiom BuyDreamHome : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ p, SaveAggressively p → AffordDownPayment p
axiom A2 : ∀ p, ImproveCredit p → QualifyMortgage p
axiom A3 : ∀ p, SaveAggressively p ∨ ImproveCredit p
axiom A4 : ∀ p, QualifyMortgage p → BuyDreamHome p
axiom given : ¬ AffordDownPayment P

theorem dream_home_result : BuyDreamHome P := by
  have cases := A3 P
  cases cases with
  | inl save =>
    have afford := A1 P save
    exfalso
    exact given afford
  | inr improve =>
    have qualify := A2 P improve
    exact A4 P qualify
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**
- Since P couldn't afford a down payment (`given`)
- If P saved aggressively (first case), we'd get a contradiction (A1 forces down payment affordability)
- Thus P must have improved their credit (second case)
- By A2 → A4, P buys their dream home

ANSWER: Yes
