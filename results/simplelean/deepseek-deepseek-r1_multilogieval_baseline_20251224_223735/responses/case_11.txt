ANSWER: Yes

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Project : obj
axiom DisplayNice : obj → Prop
axiom JudgesImpressed : obj → Prop
axiom ResearchThorough : obj → Prop
axiom ExpertsTakeSeriously : obj → Prop
axiom ReceiveAward : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, DisplayNice x → JudgesImpressed x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, ResearchThorough x → ExpertsTakeSeriously x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, DisplayNice x ∨ ResearchThorough x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, ExpertsTakeSeriously x → ReceiveAward x

theorem award_received (h : ¬ JudgesImpressed Project) : ReceiveAward Project := by
  have h1 : DisplayNice Project ∨ ResearchThorough Project := A3 Project
  cases h1 with
  | inl h_display =>
    -- If display is nice, judges would be impressed (contradicts ¬JudgesImpressed)
    exact absurd (A1 Project h_display) h
  | inr h_research =>
    -- Since research is thorough, experts take it seriously and award follows
    exact A4 Project (A2 Project h_research)
</lean>
