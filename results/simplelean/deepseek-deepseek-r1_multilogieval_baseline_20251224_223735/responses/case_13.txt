The context provides information about the restaurant using fresh, organic ingredients and the chain of implications: fresh ingredients → amazing taste → positive reviews on social media. However, there is no information connecting these factors to the formation of long lines. The axioms do not establish a relationship between positive reviews and long lines, nor is there any mention of long lines elsewhere in the context. Therefore, it is impossible to prove whether long lines form or not based solely on the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Restaurant : Type
axiom R : Restaurant
axiom UsesFreshOrganic : Restaurant → Prop
axiom TastesAmazing : Restaurant → Prop
axiom PositiveReviewsSpread : Restaurant → Prop
axiom LongLinesForm : Restaurant → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ r : Restaurant, UsesFreshOrganic r → TastesAmazing r
axiom A2 : ∀ r : Restaurant, TastesAmazing r → PositiveReviewsSpread r
axiom Given : UsesFreshOrganic R

-- Prove positive reviews occur (demonstrates chain works)
theorem reviews_spread : PositiveReviewsSpread R :=
  A2 R (A1 R Given)

-- No axiom links positive reviews (or any other predicate) to long lines
-- Thus, LongLinesForm R is unprovable
