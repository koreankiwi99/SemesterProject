The reasoning is based on the given context and the fact that the weather was very hot. The key steps are:

1. If the weather is very hot (H), then children play in sprinklers (P) [Axiom A2].
2. Given H is true, P must be true.
3. The disjunction states: either it rained (R) or children did not play in sprinklers (¬P) [Axiom A3].
4. Since P is true, ¬P is false. Thus, R must be true to satisfy the disjunction.
5. If it rained (R), then grass and plants are watered naturally (W) [Axiom A1].
6. Therefore, W is true.

The Lean code formalizes this reasoning and proves the theorem.

<lean>
variable (H : Prop)
variable (R : Prop)
variable (W : Prop)
variable (P : Prop)
axiom A1 : R → W
axiom A2 : H → P
axiom A3 : R ∨ ¬P

theorem grass_watered (hH : H) : W := by
  have hP : P := A2 hH

  | inl r => exact A1 r
  | inr np => contradiction

The compilation errors occurred because the `variable` declarations were not properly scoped, leading to type mismatches and issues with the `cases` tactic. The corrected approach uses `axiom` to declare the propositions directly, ensuring proper typing and enabling the `cases` tactic to work on the disjunction.

Here is the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom R : Prop
axiom H : Prop
axiom W : Prop
axiom P : Prop
axiom A1 : R → W
axiom A2 : H → P
axiom A3 : R ∨ ¬P

theorem grass_watered (hH : H) : W := by
  have hP : P := A2 hH
  cases A3 with
  | inl r => exact A1 r
  | inr np => contradiction
</lean>

**Explanation of the proof:**
1. **`hP : P`** is derived from `hH : H` and axiom `A2` (if hot, children play in sprinklers).
2. **Case analysis on `A3`** (either rained or children didn't play):
   - **Case 1 (`inl r`):** It rained (`r : R`). By `A1`, this implies `W`.
   - **Case 2 (`inr np`):** Children didn't play (`np : ¬P`). This contradicts `hP : P`, proving `W` by contradiction.

The theorem is successfully proven, confirming that the grass and plants were watered naturally.
