The context provides several logical statements about employees, promotions, influence, and motivation. The key elements are:

1. If an employee works hard, they get a promotion: ∀x, WorkHard x → Promotion x
2. If an employee impresses their boss, they gain influence: ∀x, ImpressBoss x → GainInfluence x
3. Not every employee got promotions or gained influence, meaning ∃x, ¬Promotion x ∧ ¬GainInfluence x
4. If an employee is motivated, they work hard: ∀x, Motivated x → WorkHard x

The question states that Mark impresses his bosses and asks whether Mark is motivated. Given that Mark impresses his bosses, we know Mark gains influence (from axiom A2). However, there is no direct link between impressing bosses and motivation. The axioms do not connect motivation to impressing bosses or influence. Additionally, while motivation implies working hard (A4), and working hard implies promotion (A1), Mark's promotion status is unknown. The existence of some employees without promotions or influence (A3) does not provide information about Mark specifically.

Thus, we cannot prove that Mark is motivated (Motivated Mark) nor can we prove that Mark is not motivated (¬Motivated Mark). The axioms are insufficient to determine Mark's motivation status.

<lean>
axiom Employee : Type
axiom Mark : Employee

axiom WorkHard : Employee → Prop
axiom Promotion : Employee → Prop
axiom ImpressBoss : Employee → Prop
axiom GainInfluence : Employee → Prop
axiom Motivated : Employee → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, WorkHard x → Promotion x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, ImpressBoss x → GainInfluence x
axiom A3 : ∃ x, ¬Promotion x ∧ ¬GainInfluence x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, Motivated x → WorkHard x

axiom mark_impresses : ImpressBoss Mark

-- Mark gains influence by A2
theorem mark_influential : GainInfluence Mark := A2 Mark mark_impresses

-- Cannot prove Motivated Mark or ¬Motivated Mark
