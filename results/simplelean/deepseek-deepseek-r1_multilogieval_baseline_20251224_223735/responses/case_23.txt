The context provides several implications but does not establish a direct link between planning the day and having self-discipline. Specifically:
- Having self-discipline implies waking up early (A4).
- Waking up early implies being energized (A1).
- Planning the day implies being productive (A2).
- There exists someone lacking energy or productivity (A3).

Given that Mark plans his day (MarkPlans), we know he is productive (by A2). However, there is no axiom connecting productivity or planning to self-discipline. The existence of someone lacking energy or productivity (A3) does not provide information about Mark. Therefore, we cannot prove that Mark has self-discipline, nor can we prove that he does not have self-discipline.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Mark : Person
axiom WakesUpEarly : Person → Prop
axiom Energized : Person → Prop
axiom PlansDay : Person → Prop
axiom Productive : Person → Prop
axiom SelfDiscipline : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ p : Person, WakesUpEarly p → Energized p
axiom A2 : ∀ p : Person, PlansDay p → Productive p
axiom A3 : ∃ p : Person, ¬Energized p ∨ ¬Productive p
axiom A4 : ∀ p : Person, SelfDiscipline p → WakesUpEarly p

axiom MarkPlans : PlansDay Mark

-- Attempt to prove SelfDiscipline Mark
theorem mark_self_discipline : SelfDiscipline Mark := 
  by 
    -- No axioms connect PlansDay or Productive to SelfDiscipline.
    -- A4 requires SelfDiscipline to derive WakesUpEarly, but we have no such premise for Mark.
    -- A3 provides an existential but does not constrain Mark specifically.
    sorry -- Proof fails

-- Attempt to prove ¬SelfDiscipline Mark
theorem not_mark_self_discipline : ¬SelfDiscipline Mark := 
  by 
    -- No axioms allow deriving negation of SelfDiscipline for Mark.
    -- MarkPlans and A2 show Productive Mark, but this doesn't contradict SelfDiscipline.
    sorry -- Proof fails
