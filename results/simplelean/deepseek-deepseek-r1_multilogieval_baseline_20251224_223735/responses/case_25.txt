The context does not provide a direct link between giving effective presentations and being perceptive. While perceptiveness leads to building rapport (which leads to trust), and effective presentations lead to sales conversions, there is no stated relationship between effective presentations and perceptiveness. Emma's effective presentations imply she converts sales, but this doesn't necessitate perceptiveness. The existence of salespeople who lack trust or sales conversions doesn't constrain Emma's properties since she converts sales. Thus, we cannot prove Emma is perceptive nor that she isn't.

-- Effective presentations lead to sales conversions
axiom A2 : ∀ s : Salesperson, EffectivePresentations s → ConvertsSales s

-- Not every salesperson builds trust or converts sales
axiom A3 : ∃ s : Salesperson, ¬TrustingRelationships s ∧ ¬ConvertsSales s

-- Perceptiveness leads to building rapport
axiom A4 : ∀ s : Salesperson, Perceptive s → BuildsRapport s

-- Given: Emma gives effective presentations
axiom EmmaEffective : EffectivePresentations Emma

-- We cannot prove Perceptive Emma or ¬Perceptive Emma
