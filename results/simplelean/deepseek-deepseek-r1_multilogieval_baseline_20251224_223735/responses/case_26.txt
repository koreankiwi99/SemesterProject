The context states that losing an important game causes disappointment and losing a big match causes demoralization. The question asks whether the team lost a significant game given that the players are neither disappointed nor demoralized. However, there is no defined relationship between "significant game" and the established concepts of "important game" or "big match" in the context. Therefore, we cannot determine from the given information whether a significant game was lost or not.

axiom Game : Type
axiom Important : Game → Prop
axiom BigMatch : Game → Prop
axiom Significant : Game → Prop
axiom Lose : Game → Prop
axiom Disappointed : Prop
axiom Demoralized : Prop

axiom important_disappoints : ∀ g : Game, Important g → Lose g → Disappointed
axiom bigmatch_demoralizes : ∀ g : Game, BigMatch g → Lose g → Demoralized

-- Given: Players are not disappointed and not demoralized
axiom not_disappointed : ¬Disappointed
axiom not_demoralized : ¬Demoralized

-- We can prove that no important game was lost and no big match was lost
theorem no_important_loss : ∀ g : Game, ¬(Important g ∧ Lose g) := by
  intro g ⟨h_imp, h_lose⟩
  apply not_disappointed
  exact important_disappoints g h_imp h_lose

theorem no_bigmatch_loss : ∀ g : Game, ¬(BigMatch g ∧ Lose g) := by
  intro g ⟨h_big, h_lose⟩
  apply not_demoralized
  exact bigmatch_demoralizes g h_big h_lose

-- But we cannot prove or disprove whether a significant game was lost
-- because there is no axiom linking Significant to Important/BigMatch
