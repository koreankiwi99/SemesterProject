The context provides two implications:
1. If someone suspects identity theft, they should check their credit report.
2. If fraud is suspected (interpreted as identity theft), they should contact their bank.

The given fact states that Ty either did not verify his credit report or did not contact his bank. We need to determine if Ty suspected identity theft.

In Lean, we model:
- `Person` as a type
- `Ty` as a specific person
- Predicates:
  - `SuspectIdentityTheft p`: p suspects identity theft
  - `CheckCreditReport p`: p checks credit report
  - `ContactBank p`: p contacts bank

Axioms:
- `R1`: If someone suspects identity theft, they check their credit report.
- `R2`: If someone suspects identity theft, they contact their bank.
- `Given`: Ty either didn't check his credit report or didn't contact his bank.

We prove that Ty did **not** suspect identity theft (`¬SuspectIdentityTheft Ty`). The proof shows that if Ty had suspected identity theft, he would have both checked his credit report and contacted his bank, contradicting the given disjunction.
