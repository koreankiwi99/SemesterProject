The context describes athletes who aim to improve performance. Key points:
1. Proper training enhances skills
2. Healthy nutrition increases strength
3. Athletes lack skill or strength (or both)
4. Dedication leads to proper training

Given Mark eats healthy, we know:
- Mark has increased strength (from healthy nutrition)

Since all athletes lack skill or strength, Mark must lack skill (because he has strength). Lacking skill means skills are not enhanced, which implies Mark does not train properly (since proper training enhances skills). Therefore, Mark cannot be dedicated (because dedication implies proper training).

Thus, we prove Mark is not dedicated.
