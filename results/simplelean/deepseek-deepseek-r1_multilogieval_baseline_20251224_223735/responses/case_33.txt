The context provides general rules and a specific observation about crops, but does not directly link Bob's crop rotation to being one with nature. 

- **Organic methods → Healthy crops** (A1)
- **Crop rotation → Soil nutrients** (A2)
- **Some farmer had unhealthy crops or nutrient-deficient soil** (A3)
- **Aware farmers: One with nature → Organic methods** (A4)
- **Bob rotates crops** (Bob_rotates) → **Bob has soil nutrients** (by A2)

However:
- No axiom connects soil nutrients to being one with nature.
- Bob's awareness is unknown, so (A4) cannot be applied.
- The disjunction in (A3) is about an unspecified farmer, not necessarily Bob.

Thus, we cannot prove or disprove that Bob is one with nature from the given context.

axiom Farmer : Type
axiom Bob : Farmer
axiom organic : Farmer → Prop
axiom rotate : Farmer → Prop
axiom healthy : Farmer → Prop
axiom nutrients : Farmer → Prop
axiom aware : Farmer → Prop
axiom one_with_nature : Farmer → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ f : Farmer, organic f → healthy f
axiom A2 : ∀ f : Farmer, rotate f → nutrients f
axiom A3 : ∃ f : Farmer, ¬healthy f ∨ ¬nutrients f
axiom A4 : ∀ f : Farmer, aware f → (one_with_nature f → organic f)

axiom Bob_rotates : rotate Bob

theorem nutrients_Bob : nutrients Bob := A2 Bob Bob_rotates

-- Cannot prove `one_with_nature Bob` or `¬one_with_nature Bob`
