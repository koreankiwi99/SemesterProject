The context states that professors were neither experts nor recognized leaders, and that either research wasn't published or collaborations didn't happen. However, Dr. Lee collaborates with top scholars, which directly contradicts the universal claim that no professor collaborates (derived from the context). This contradiction allows any conclusion to be proven, including that Dr. Lee is curious.
