The Lean code models the context with axioms for the propositions: `WeatherNice`, `RelaxOutside`, `PackedEnough`, `ReadBooks`, and `Prepared`. The theorem to prove is whether if Jake cannot relax outside, then he is prepared (`¬RelaxOutside → Prepared`). 

The analysis shows:
- From `¬RelaxOutside` and axiom `R1`, we derive `¬WeatherNice`.
- Axiom `R3` (WeatherNice ∨ ¬PackedEnough) with `¬WeatherNice` gives `¬PackedEnough`.
- Axiom `R2` (ReadBooks → PackedEnough) with `¬PackedEnough` implies `¬ReadBooks` (by contraposition).
- Axiom `R4` (Prepared → ReadBooks) with `¬ReadBooks` implies `¬Prepared` (by contraposition).

Thus, under the assumption `¬RelaxOutside`, we derive `¬Prepared`, meaning the conclusion `Prepared` cannot be proven. However, the negation of the theorem (`¬(¬RelaxOutside → Prepared)`, equivalent to `¬RelaxOutside ∧ ¬Prepared`) cannot be proven unconditionally because the axioms allow scenarios where `RelaxOutside` is true. Therefore, neither the theorem nor its negation is provable.

<lean>
axiom WeatherNice : Prop
axiom RelaxOutside : Prop
axiom PackedEnough : Prop
axiom ReadBooks : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop

axiom R1 : WeatherNice → RelaxOutside
axiom R2 : ReadBooks → PackedEnough
axiom R3 : WeatherNice ∨ ¬ PackedEnough
axiom R4 : Prepared → ReadBooks

theorem thm : ¬ RelaxOutside → Prepared :=
  fun h : ¬ RelaxOutside =>
  have h1 : ¬ WeatherNice := fun wn : WeatherNice => h (R1 wn)
  have h2 : ¬ PackedEnough := by
    cases R3 with
    | inl wn => contradiction
    | inr npe => exact npe
  have h3 : ¬ ReadBooks := fun rb : ReadBooks => h2 (R2 rb)
  have h4 : ¬ Prepared := fun p : Prepared => h3 (R4 p)
  -- We need `Prepared` but have `¬Prepared` → contradiction under the assumption
  -- But the goal is `Prepared`, which cannot be fulfilled here.
  sorry   -- Cannot prove

-- Attempt to prove the negation of the theorem (¬(¬RelaxOutside → Prepared)) also fails
-- as it would require proving `¬RelaxOutside ∧ ¬Prepared` unconditionally, but 
-- `RelaxOutside` might be true in some models consistent with the axioms.
