The context and question are translated into Lean by formalizing the entities and predicates. The car's gas, ability to drive long distances, seeing sights, taking a scenic route, and loving road trips are represented as propositions. Mike is the specific person referenced.

**Key Insights from Context:**
1. If the car has gas, then long distances can be driven: `Gas → DriveLong`.
2. If someone sees the sights, they are taking a scenic route: `SeeSights → ScenicRoute`.
3. Either the car has gas, or Mike is not taking the scenic route (simplified from the disjunction): `Gas ∨ ¬ScenicRoute`.
4. If someone loves road trips, they take the scenic route: `LoveRoadTrips → ScenicRoute`.

**Question Analysis:**  
The question asks: *If they cannot drive long distances, does Mike love road trips?*  
This translates to: Assuming `¬DriveLong`, can we prove `LoveRoadTrips`?  

**Proof Strategy:**
- From `¬DriveLong` and `Gas → DriveLong`, we derive `¬Gas` (contraposition).
- From `¬Gas` and `Gas ∨ ¬ScenicRoute`, we derive `¬ScenicRoute` (disjunction elimination).
- From `¬ScenicRoute` and `LoveRoadTrips → ScenicRoute`, we derive `¬LoveRoadTrips` (contraposition).  
Thus, under `¬DriveLong`, we prove Mike does **not** love road trips. The theorem `¬DriveLong → ¬LoveRoadTrips` is provable.

<lean>
axiom Gas : Prop
axiom DriveLong : Prop
axiom SeeSights : Prop
axiom ScenicRoute : Prop
axiom LoveRoadTrips : Prop

axiom T1 : Gas → DriveLong
axiom T2 : SeeSights → ScenicRoute
axiom T3 : Gas ∨ ¬ScenicRoute
axiom T4 : LoveRoadTrips → ScenicRoute

theorem answer (h : ¬DriveLong) : ¬LoveRoadTrips :=
  fun hLove : LoveRoadTrips =>
    have hScenic : ScenicRoute := T4 hLove
    have hGas : ¬Gas := by
      intro hg
      exact h (T1 hg)
    have hNotScenic : ¬ScenicRoute := by
      cases T3 with
      | inl gas => exact absurd gas hGas
      | inr notScenic => exact notScenic
    show False from hNotScenic hScenic
</lean>

**Conclusion:** The theorem `¬DriveLong → ¬LoveRoadTrips` (Mike does not love road trips if they cannot drive long distances) is proven. The original question asks if Mike loves road trips under this condition, which is disproven.

ANSWER: No
