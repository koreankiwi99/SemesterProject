The context provides several conditional statements and a disjunction. The key elements are:
- If the package arrives on time (ArrivesOnTime), then people can start a new project (StartProject).
- If the office supply store has the special order in stock (InStock), then materials can be picked up (CanPickUp).
- Either ArrivesOnTime or InStock (or both) is true.
- If someone starts the project (StartProject), they learn new skills (LearnSkills).

The question states that Max was unable to pick up the materials (¬CanPickUpMax). From ¬CanPickUpMax and the axiom that InStock implies CanPickUpMax, we derive ¬InStock. Using the disjunction ArrivesOnTime ∨ InStock and ¬InStock, we conclude ArrivesOnTime. Then, from ArrivesOnTime and the axiom that ArrivesOnTime implies CanStartProjectMax, we get CanStartProjectMax (Max is able to start the project).

However, there is no axiom stating that being able to start the project (CanStartProjectMax) implies that Max actually starts it (DoesStartProjectMax). The learning of skills (LearnSkillsMax) depends on DoesStartProjectMax (per axiom A4). Since we have no information about whether Max starts the project, we cannot prove LearnSkillsMax. Similarly, we cannot prove ¬LearnSkillsMax, as Max might learn skills through other means not mentioned in the context.

Thus, neither LearnSkillsMax nor its negation can be proven from the given axioms.

<lean>
axiom ArrivesOnTime : Prop
axiom InStock : Prop
axiom CanPickUpMax : Prop
axiom CanStartProjectMax : Prop
axiom DoesStartProjectMax : Prop
axiom LearnSkillsMax : Prop

axiom A1 : ArrivesOnTime → CanStartProjectMax
axiom A2 : InStock → CanPickUpMax
axiom A3 : ArrivesOnTime ∨ InStock
axiom A4 : DoesStartProjectMax → LearnSkillsMax

axiom Given : ¬CanPickUpMax

theorem not_in_stock : ¬InStock :=
  fun h => Given (A2 h)

theorem arrives : ArrivesOnTime :=
  Or.elim A3 (fun h => h) (fun h => False.elim (not_in_stock h))

theorem can_start_max : CanStartProjectMax := A1 arrives

-- Cannot prove LearnSkillsMax or ¬LearnSkillsMax
