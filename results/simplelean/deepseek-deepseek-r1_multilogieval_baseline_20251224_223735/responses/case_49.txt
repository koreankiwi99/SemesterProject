The context provides several implications and disjunctions. The key is to derive whether the sponge was soapy given that it didn't rain recently. 

1. From "If the driveway is wet, then it must have rained recently" and the fact that it didn't rain, we conclude the driveway is not wet.
2. From "Either the driveway is wet, or no water was used on the car, or the driveway is wet even though no water was used" (simplified to Wet ∨ ¬WaterUsed), and ¬Wet, we get ¬WaterUsed.
3. From "If someone washed their car, then they used water on the driveway" and ¬WaterUsed, we get that no one washed their car.
4. From "If the hose is uncoiled, it means someone was washing their car" and no one washed their car, we get the hose is not uncoiled.
5. From "Either the hose is uncoiled, or the sponge is soapy, or maybe both are true" and ¬Uncoiled, we conclude the sponge was soapy.

Thus, given ¬Rained, we can prove Soapy.
