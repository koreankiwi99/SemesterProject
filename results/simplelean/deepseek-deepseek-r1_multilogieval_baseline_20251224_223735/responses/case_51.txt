The context and question are translated into Lean by defining the necessary types and propositions. The key elements are:
- `Person` as a type representing people
- `mary` as a specific person
- Propositions: `sale` (supermarket has a sale), `payday` (payday was this week), `pricesUp` (prices went up)
- Predicates: `StockUp p` (person p stocks up), `MakesList p` (p makes a list), `PlansWhatToBuy p` (p plans purchases)

Axioms capture the context:
1. Sale causes universal stocking up: `sale → ∀ p, StockUp p`
2. Making a list implies planning: `∀ p, MakesList p → PlansWhatToBuy p`
3. Sale or not everyone plans: `sale ∨ ¬(∀ p, PlansWhatToBuy p)`
4. Payday causes universal list-making: `payday → ∀ p, MakesList p`
5. Payday or price increase (or both): `payday ∨ pricesUp`

The theorem: If Mary didn't stock up, then prices went up (`¬StockUp mary → pricesUp`).

Proof sketch:
- Assume Mary didn't stock up (`¬StockUp mary`).
- By axiom 1, this implies no sale (`¬sale`).
- By axiom 3, since no sale, not everyone plans (`¬∀ p, PlansWhatToBuy p`).
- If payday occurred (per axiom 4), everyone would make lists, hence everyone plans (axiom 2), contradicting the previous step. Thus, payday didn't occur (`¬payday`).
- By axiom 5, since no payday, prices must have gone up (`pricesUp`).

The Lean proof formalizes this reasoning using case analysis and contradiction.
