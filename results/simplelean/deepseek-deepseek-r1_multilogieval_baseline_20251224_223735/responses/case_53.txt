-- If they practiced often, technique improves
axiom A1 : ∀ p : Person, PracticeOften p → ImproveTechnique p
-- If technique improves, artwork stands out
axiom A2 : ∀ p : Person, ImproveTechnique p → StandOut p
-- Either practiced often or took art class (or both)
axiom A3 : ∀ p : Person, PracticeOften p ∨ TakeArtClass p
-- If take art class, learn new methods
axiom A4 : ∀ p : Person, TakeArtClass p → LearnNewMethods p

-- Premise: Mary's artwork did not stand out
axiom Premise : ¬ StandOut mary

theorem mary_learned : LearnNewMethods mary :=
  have no_improve : ¬ ImproveTechnique mary := fun h_improve => Premise (A2 mary h_improve)
  have no_practice : ¬ PracticeOften mary := fun h_practice => no_improve (A1 mary h_practice)
  have took_class : TakeArtClass mary := 
    Or.resolve_left (A3 mary) no_practice
  A4 mary took_class
