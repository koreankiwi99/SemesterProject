The context states that for any student, if they attend lectures regularly, then sufficient revision leads to good exam performance. Priya revised sufficiently but did not perform well. Therefore, Priya must not have attended lectures regularly.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Priya : obj
axiom AttendsRegularly : obj → Prop
axiom SpendsSufficientTime : obj → Prop
axiom PerformsWell : obj → Prop
axiom context : ∀ s, AttendsRegularly s → (SpendsSufficientTime s → PerformsWell s)
axiom fact1 : SpendsSufficientTime Priya
axiom fact2 : ¬ PerformsWell Priya

theorem not_attended : ¬ AttendsRegularly Priya :=
  fun hAttend : AttendsRegularly Priya =>
    have h1 : SpendsSufficientTime Priya → PerformsWell Priya := context Priya hAttend
    have h2 : PerformsWell Priya := h1 fact1
    fact2 h2
</lean>

ANSWER: No
