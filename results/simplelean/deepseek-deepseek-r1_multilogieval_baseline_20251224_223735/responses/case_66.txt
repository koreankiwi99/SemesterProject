The context states: If a company develops an innovative product and markets it effectively, then the product will be commercially successful.  
Given facts:  
- Acme marketed effectively (T1)  
- Acme was not commercially successful (T2)  

Question: Did Acme develop an innovative product?  

Logical analysis:  
Let:  
- `I x`: `x` developed an innovative product  
- `M x`: `x` marketed effectively  
- `S x`: `x` was commercially successful  

Context axiom: `∀x, I x → (M x → S x)`  
This is equivalent to: `∀x, I x ∧ M x → S x`  

Given:  
- `M Acme` (T1)  
- `¬S Acme` (T2)  

To prove: `¬I Acme`  
Proof:  
Assume `I Acme` (for contradiction).  
From axiom: `I Acme → (M Acme → S Acme)`.  
With `I Acme` and `M Acme`, we get `S Acme`.  
But `¬S Acme` (T2) → contradiction.  
∴ `¬I Acme`  

Thus, Acme did **not** develop an innovative product.
