The reasoning involves proving that if the kitchen did not get hot, then Sam ate dinner last night. The formalization in Lean and the proof are as follows:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Sam : Person
axiom StoveOn : Prop
axiom KitchenHot : Prop
axiom UsesStove : Person → Prop
axiom MakesPancakes : Person → Prop
axiom Hungry : Person → Prop
axiom AteDinner : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ (p : Person), MakesPancakes p → UsesStove p
axiom A2 : StoveOn ∨ (∀ p, ¬ UsesStove p)
axiom A3 : ∀ (p : Person), Hungry p → MakesPancakes p
axiom A4 : ¬ AteDinner Sam → Hungry Sam
axiom A5 : StoveOn → KitchenHot

theorem answer : ¬ KitchenHot → AteDinner Sam := by
  intro hNotHot
  have hNotStove : ¬ StoveOn := by
    intro hStove
    apply hNotHot
    exact A5 hStove
  cases A2 with
  | inl hStove => contradiction
  | inr noUse =>
    by_contra hNotEat
    have hHungrySam : Hungry Sam := A4 hNotEat
    have hMakes : MakesPancakes Sam := A3 Sam hHungrySam
    have hUses : UsesStove Sam := A1 Sam hMakes
    exact noUse Sam hUses
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**  
1. Assume the kitchen did not get hot (`¬KitchenHot`).  
2. From `A5` (`StoveOn → KitchenHot`), deduce the stove was not on (`¬StoveOn`).  
3. From `A2` (`StoveOn ∨ ∀p, ¬UsesStove p`), use case analysis:  
   - If `StoveOn` is true, it contradicts `¬StoveOn`.  
   - Thus, we have `∀p, ¬UsesStove p` (no one used the stove).  
4. Now assume Sam did not eat dinner (`¬AteDinner Sam`).  
5. By `A4`, Sam was hungry (`Hungry Sam`).  
6. By `A3`, Sam made pancakes (`MakesPancakes Sam`).  
7. By `A1`, Sam used the stove (`UsesStove Sam`).  
8. This contradicts `∀p, ¬UsesStove p` (specifically `¬UsesStove Sam`).  
9. Thus, Sam must have eaten dinner (`AteDinner Sam`).

I apologize for the compilation errors. The issue was due to the use of `by_contra` without enabling classical reasoning. Here's the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Sam : Person
axiom StoveOn : Prop
axiom KitchenHot : Prop
axiom UsesStove : Person → Prop
axiom MakesPancakes : Person → Prop
axiom Hungry : Person → Prop
axiom AteDinner : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ (p : Person), MakesPancakes p → UsesStove p
axiom A2 : StoveOn ∨ (∀ p, ¬ UsesStove p)
axiom A3 : ∀ (p : Person), Hungry p → MakesPancakes p
axiom A4 : ¬ AteDinner Sam → Hungry Sam
axiom A5 : StoveOn → KitchenHot

theorem answer : ¬ KitchenHot → AteDinner Sam := by
  intro hNotHot
  have hNotStove : ¬ StoveOn := by
    intro hStove
    apply hNotHot
    exact A5 hStove
  cases A2 with
  | inl hStove => contradiction
  | inr noUse =>
    classical  -- Enable classical reasoning for proof by contradiction
    by_contra hNotEat  -- Assume Sam didn't eat dinner
    have hHungrySam : Hungry Sam := A4 hNotEat
    have hMakes : MakesPancakes Sam := A3 Sam hHungrySam
    have hUses : UsesStove Sam := A1 Sam hMakes
    exact noUse Sam hUses  -- Contradiction: Sam used stove but no one used stove
</lean>

**Explanation of the proof:**
1. Assume the kitchen is not hot (premise)
2. Prove the stove is not on (since stove on → kitchen hot)
3. Break down axiom A2 (stove on OR no one used stove)
4. The first case (stove on) contradicts ¬StoveOn
5. In the second case (no one used stove), use classical reasoning to allow proof by contradiction
6. Assume Sam didn't eat dinner
7. Derive that Sam was hungry (A4)
8. Derive that Sam made pancakes (A3)
9. Derive that Sam used the stove (A1)
10. This contradicts "no one used stove" (A2)

The proof shows that if the kitchen didn't get hot, then Sam must have eaten dinner last night.

I apologize for the errors in my previous attempts. The main issue was with the `by_contra` tactic not being available in base Lean 4. Here's the corrected version using `Classical.byContradiction`:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Sam : Person
axiom StoveOn : Prop
axiom KitchenHot : Prop
axiom UsesStove : Person → Prop
axiom MakesPancakes : Person → Prop
axiom Hungry : Person → Prop
axiom AteDinner : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ (p : Person), MakesPancakes p → UsesStove p
axiom A2 : StoveOn ∨ (∀ p, ¬ UsesStove p)
axiom A3 : ∀ (p : Person), Hungry p → MakesPancakes p
axiom A4 : ¬ AteDinner Sam → Hungry Sam
axiom A5 : StoveOn → KitchenHot

theorem answer : ¬ KitchenHot → AteDinner Sam := by
  intro hNotHot
  have hNotStove : ¬ StoveOn := fun hStove => hNotHot (A5 hStove)
  cases A2 with
  | inl hStove => contradiction
  | inr noUse =>
    apply Classical.byContradiction
    intro hNotEat
    have hHungrySam : Hungry Sam := A4 hNotEat
    have hMakes : MakesPancakes Sam := A3 Sam hHungrySam
    have hUses : UsesStove Sam := A1 Sam hMakes
    exact noUse Sam hUses
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**
1. Assume kitchen is not hot (¬KitchenHot)
2. Prove stove is not on (¬StoveOn) because if stove were on, kitchen would be hot (A5)
3. Case analysis on A2:
   - If stove was on: contradiction with ¬StoveOn
   - If no one used stove (∀p, ¬UsesStove p):
        a) Assume Sam didn't eat dinner (¬AteDinner Sam)
        b) Then Sam was hungry (A4)
        c) Then Sam made pancakes (A3)
        d) Then Sam used stove (A1)
        e) Contradiction: Sam used stove but no one used stove
4. Therefore, Sam must have eaten dinner (AteDinner Sam)

The proof shows that if the kitchen didn't get hot, then Sam ate dinner last night.
