The context states that for any player, if they train hard and remain focused, they will perform to the best of their ability. We are given that Lebron remained focused but did not perform to the best of his ability. The goal is to determine whether Lebron trained hard.

Using logical reasoning:
- Assume Lebron trained hard (for contradiction).
- Then, by the context, since he trained hard and remained focused, he should have performed to the best of his ability.
- However, we know he did not perform to the best of his ability.
- This contradicts the assumption, proving that Lebron did not train hard.

Thus, the answer to "Did Lebron train hard?" is **No**.
