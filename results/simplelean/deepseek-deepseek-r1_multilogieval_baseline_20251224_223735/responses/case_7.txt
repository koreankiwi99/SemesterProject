The context provides direct and indirect evidence that the harvest was abundant. The plants grew strong and produced lots of vegetables, which directly establishes that the harvest was abundant. Additionally, the context states that healthy plants yield bigger harvests, and the plants were healthy (from growing strong), which also implies an abundant harvest. The soil enrichment (by adding compost and fertilizer) is part of the narrative but isn't required in the proof since the harvest's abundance is directly observable.
