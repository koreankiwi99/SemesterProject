The context states that it was a sunny day, which is given as an axiom (`T0 : sunny`). The question asks whether, if Alex got sunburnt, the weather was sunny. Since `sunny` is already established as true in the context, the implication `get_burnt Alex → sunny` holds trivially: regardless of whether Alex got sunburnt or not, the weather was sunny. Therefore, the theorem is provable.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Alex : Person
axiom sunny : Prop
axiom pool_water_warm : Prop
axiom apply_sunscreen : Person → Prop
axiom get_burnt : Person → Prop
axiom go_swim : Person → Prop
axiom get_exercise : Person → Prop

axiom T0 : sunny
axiom R1 : ∀ (p : Person), apply_sunscreen p → ¬ get_burnt p
axiom R3 : ∀ (p : Person), go_swim p → get_exercise p
axiom R4 : ∀ (p : Person), apply_sunscreen p ∨ ¬ get_exercise p
axiom R5 : ∀ (p : Person), pool_water_warm → go_swim p
axiom R6 : sunny → pool_water_warm

theorem thm : get_burnt Alex → sunny :=
  fun _ => T0
