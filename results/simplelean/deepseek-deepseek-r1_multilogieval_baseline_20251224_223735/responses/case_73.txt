The context provides a conditional statement: If someone trains with dedication, then if they get adequate rest, they will perform at their peak. The scenario states that Simone got adequate rest but did not perform at her peak. Using logical deduction, we can determine whether Simone trained with dedication.

- **Axioms**:
  - `∀x, T(x) → (R(x) → P(x))`: If an athlete trains with dedication, then adequate rest implies peak performance.
  - `R(Simone)`: Simone got adequate rest.
  - `¬P(Simone)`: Simone did not perform at her peak.

- **Proof**:
  - Assume `T(Simone)` (Simone trained with dedication).
  - By the axiom, `T(Simone)` implies `R(Simone) → P(Simone)`.
  - Given `R(Simone)`, we derive `P(Simone)`.
  - This contradicts `¬P(Simone)`.
  - Therefore, the assumption `T(Simone)` is false, proving `¬T(Simone)`.

Since we proved the negation of the question ("Simone trained with dedication"), the answer is **No**.

axiom Athlete : Type
axiom T : Athlete → Prop   -- Trains with dedication
axiom R : Athlete → Prop   -- Gets adequate rest
axiom P : Athlete → Prop   -- Performs at peak

The compilation error occurred because the `rule` axiom was applied incorrectly in the term-mode proof. The corrected version uses a tactic-mode proof with `by`, which properly handles the implication in the axiom. The proof shows that assuming Simone trained with dedication leads to a contradiction with the given facts.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Athlete : Type
axiom T : Athlete → Prop   -- Trains with dedication
axiom R : Athlete → Prop   -- Gets adequate rest
axiom P : Athlete → Prop   -- Performs at peak

axiom rule : ∀ (a : Athlete), T a → R a → P a

constant simone : Athlete

axiom simone_rest : R simone
axiom not_peak : ¬ P simone

theorem not_trained : ¬ T simone := by
  intro h_train
  have h_peak : P simone := rule simone h_train simone_rest
  exact not_peak h_peak
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**  
1. `intro h_train` assumes Simone trained with dedication.  
2. `rule simone h_train simone_rest` proves she performed at her peak (using the axiom and given rest).  
3. `not_peak h_peak` derives a contradiction since she didn't perform well.  
4. Thus, the assumption `h_train` must be false.

ANSWER: No

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect syntax in the axiom declaration. The original axiom used `T a → (R a → P a)`, which is a Prop, but Lean expected a function type. The corrected axiom uses a curried function `T a → R a → P a`, allowing proper application. The proof is now in term mode without tactics, as required.

<lean>
axiom Athlete : Type
axiom T : Athlete → Prop   -- Trains with dedication
axiom R : Athlete → Prop   -- Gets adequate rest
axiom P : Athlete → Prop   -- Performs at peak

axiom rule : ∀ (a : Athlete), T a → R a → P a

constant simone : Athlete

axiom simone_rest : R simone
axiom not_peak : ¬ P simone

theorem not_trained : ¬ T simone := 
  fun h_train => not_peak (rule simone h_train simone_rest)
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**  
1. Assume `h_train : T simone` (Simone trained with dedication).  
2. Apply `rule` to `simone`, `h_train`, and `simone_rest` to get `P simone`.  
3. Apply `not_peak` to this result to get `False`.  
4. This proves `¬T simone` (Simone did not train with dedication).
