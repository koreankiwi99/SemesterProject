The reasoning involves deriving whether Alex made a to-do list given that he did not relax. The context provides several logical connections:

1. If the weekend comes, Alex relaxes: `WeekendComing → Relax Alex`
2. Finishing tasks implies a clear mind: `∀ p, FinishTasks p → ClearMind p`
3. Either the weekend comes or Alex lacks a clear mind: `WeekendComing ∨ ¬ ClearMind Alex`
4. Being organized implies finishing tasks: `∀ p, Organized p → FinishTasks p`
5. Making a to-do list implies being organized: `∀ p, MakeToList p → Organized p`

Given that Alex did not relax (`¬ Relax Alex`), we derive:
- Since weekend implies relaxation, the weekend cannot be coming: `¬ WeekendComing`
- From the disjunction (3), lacking a clear mind follows: `¬ ClearMind Alex`
- Without a clear mind, tasks aren't finished: `¬ FinishTasks Alex`
- Unfinished tasks imply disorganization: `¬ Organized Alex`
- Disorganization implies no to-do list: `¬ MakeToList Alex`

Thus, we prove Alex did not make a to-do list.
