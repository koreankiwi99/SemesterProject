The context states that for novelists, if a writer develops compelling characters, then if they craft an intriguing plot, their book will connect with readers. This is formalized as:  
∀ w, CC(w) → (IP(w) → CR(w))  

Given:  
- Lauren crafted an intriguing plot (IP(Lauren) is true)  
- Lauren's book did not connect with readers (CR(Lauren) is false)  

We need to determine if Lauren developed compelling characters (CC(Lauren)).  

From the axiom:  
CC(Lauren) → (IP(Lauren) → CR(Lauren))  

Substituting the known facts:  
CC(Lauren) → (true → false)  
This simplifies to:  
CC(Lauren) → false  

Which is equivalent to:  
¬CC(Lauren)  

Thus, Lauren did not develop compelling characters.  

Lean proof:  
<lean>
axiom Writer : Type
axiom Lauren : Writer
axiom CC : Writer → Prop       -- Develops compelling characters
axiom IP : Writer → Prop       -- Crafts intriguing plot
axiom CR : Writer → Prop       -- Book connects with readers
axiom A1 : ∀ w : Writer, CC w → (IP w → CR w)
axiom IP_Lauren : IP Lauren
axiom not_CR_Lauren : ¬ CR Lauren

theorem not_CC_Lauren : ¬ CC Lauren :=
  fun h_cc : CC Lauren =>
  have h_imp : IP Lauren → CR Lauren := A1 Lauren h_cc
  have h_cr : CR Lauren := h_imp IP_Lauren
  not_CR_Lauren h_cr
</lean>

ANSWER: No
