The reasoning involves translating the context into Lean axioms and defining the necessary predicates. The key question is whether, given that John's muscles are not sore today, we can conclude that it rained. 

### Lean Translation:
```lean
axiom Person : Type
axiom John : Person
axiom WorkedOutHard : Person → Prop
axiom Sore : Person → Prop
axiom TakeHotShower : Person → Prop
axiom MusclesRelax : Person → Prop
axiom WeatherCold : Prop
axiom Rains : Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ p, WorkedOutHard p → Sore p
axiom R2 : ∀ p, TakeHotShower p → MusclesRelax p
axiom T3 : WorkedOutHard John ∨ ¬ MusclesRelax John
axiom R3 : ∀ p, WeatherCold → TakeHotShower p
axiom R4 : Rains → WeatherCold

-- The theorem to prove: If John's muscles are not sore, did it rain?
theorem if_not_sore_then_rains : ¬ Sore John → Rains := 
  fun h =>   -- Assume ¬ Sore John
  have no_hard : ¬ WorkedOutHard John := fun hwh => h (R1 John hwh)  -- Contrapositive of R1
  have no_relax : ¬ MusclesRelax John := by  -- From T3 and no_hard
    cases T3 with
    | inl hwh => exact False.elim (no_hard hwh)
    | inr hnr => exact hnr
  have no_shower : ¬ TakeHotShower John := fun hs => no_relax (R2 John hs)  -- Contrapositive of R2
  have not_cold : ¬ WeatherCold := fun wc => no_shower (R3 John wc)  -- Contrapositive of R3
  have not_rain : ¬ Rains := fun r => not_cold (R4 r)  -- Contrapositive of R4
  not_rain  -- We get ¬ Rains, but need Rains → contradiction
```

### Proof Attempt:
The goal is to prove `¬ Sore John → Rains`. However:
1. From `¬ Sore John`, contrapositive of `R1` gives `¬ WorkedOutHard John`.
2. Axiom `T3` states `WorkedOutHard John ∨ ¬ MusclesRelax John`. Since `¬ WorkedOutHard John`, we must have `¬ MusclesRelax John`.
3. Contrapositive of `R2` (`TakeHotShower John → MusclesRelax John`) gives `¬ TakeHotShower John`.
4. Contrapositive of `R3` (`WeatherCold → TakeHotShower John`) gives `¬ WeatherCold`.
5. Contrapositive of `R4` (`Rains → WeatherCold`) gives `¬ Rains`.

This shows `¬ Sore John → ¬ Rains`, not `¬ Sore John → Rains`. Attempting to prove `¬ Sore John → Rains` leads to a contradiction under the assumption, but we **cannot prove the theorem as stated** because:
- The conclusion `Rains` contradicts the derived `¬ Rains`.
- However, we cannot globally prove `¬ (¬ Sore John → Rains)` (i.e., that the implication is false) because it relies on the hypothetical `¬ Sore John` which may not hold in all models.

Since we can prove `¬ Sore John → ¬ Rains` but neither `¬ Sore John → Rains` nor its negation, the theorem `if_not_sore_then_rains` is unprovable.

### Final Answer
ANSWER: Uncertain

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the theorem `if_not_sore_then_rains` was expected to produce a proof of `Rains` given `¬Sore John`, but the proof term `not_rain` has type `¬Rains` (which contradicts the required type). After analyzing the context, I derived that `¬Sore John` implies `¬Rains`, not `Rains`. However, the original theorem requires proving `¬Sore John → Rains`, which cannot be proven from the axioms. Furthermore, the negation of this theorem also cannot be proven absolutely because it depends on the unknown status of `Sore John`.

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom John : Person
axiom WorkedOutHard : Person → Prop
axiom Sore : Person → Prop
axiom TakeHotShower : Person → Prop
axiom MusclesRelax : Person → Prop
axiom WeatherCold : Prop
axiom Rains : Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ p, WorkedOutHard p → Sore p
axiom R2 : ∀ p, TakeHotShower p → MusclesRelax p
axiom T3 : WorkedOutHard John ∨ ¬ MusclesRelax John
axiom R3 : ∀ p, WeatherCold → TakeHotShower p
axiom R4 : Rains → WeatherCold

-- We can prove that ¬Sore John implies ¬Rains
theorem not_sore_implies_not_rain : ¬ Sore John → ¬ Rains := 
  fun h_no_sore : ¬ Sore John =>
  have no_hard : ¬ WorkedOutHard John := fun hwh => h_no_sore (R1 John hwh)
  have no_relax : ¬ MusclesRelax John := by
    cases T3 with
    | inl hwh => exact False.elim (no_hard hwh)
    | inr hnr => exact hnr
  have no_shower : ¬ TakeHotShower John := fun hs => no_relax (R2 John hs)
  have not_cold : ¬ WeatherCold := fun wc => no_shower (R3 John wc)
  fun r : Rains => not_cold (R4 r)

-- The original theorem (¬Sore John → Rains) cannot be proven
-- We also cannot prove its negation (¬(¬Sore John → Rains)) without additional facts
