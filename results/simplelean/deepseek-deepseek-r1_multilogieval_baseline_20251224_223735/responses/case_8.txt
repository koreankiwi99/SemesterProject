The context indicates that if fresh ingredients are used, the food tastes delicious, and fresh ingredients were used. Thus, the food must taste delicious regardless of whether the recipe was complicated. The complication of the recipe affects preparation time but doesn't impact this conclusion.

<lean>
axiom Fresh : Prop
axiom Complicated : Prop
axiom Delicious : Prop
axiom MoreTime : Prop
axiom A1 : Fresh → Delicious
axiom A2 : Complicated → MoreTime
axiom A3 : Fresh
theorem delicious : Delicious := A1 A3
theorem answer : Complicated → Delicious := fun _ => delicious
</lean>

The theorem `answer` is proved: if the chef cooked a complicated recipe, the food tasted delicious. The proof shows `Delicious` holds independently of `Complicated`.

ANSWER: Yes
