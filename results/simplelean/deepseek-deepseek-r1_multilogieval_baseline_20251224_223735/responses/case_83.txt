The reasoning is translated into Lean by defining propositions and axioms based on the context. The goal is to prove that if it was sunny, then the team holds their heads high.

<lean>
axiom Sunny : Prop
axiom PlayAtPark : Prop
axiom PracticesDaily : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop
axiom Confident : Prop
axiom HoldsHeadHigh : Prop

axiom P1 : PracticesDaily → Prepared
axiom P2 : Sunny → PlayAtPark
axiom P3 : PracticesDaily ∨ ¬PlayAtPark
axiom P4 : Prepared → Confident
axiom P5 : Confident → HoldsHeadHigh

theorem sunny_implies_head_high : Sunny → HoldsHeadHigh := by
  intro hSunny
  have hPlay : PlayAtPark := P2 hSunny
  cases P3 with
  | inl hPractice =>
      have hPrepared : Prepared := P1 hPractice
      have hConfident : Confident := P4 hPrepared
      exact P5 hConfident
  | inr notPlay =>
      contradiction
</lean>

The proof works as follows:
1. Assume it is sunny (`hSunny`).
2. By axiom P2, sunny implies children play at the park (`hPlay`).
3. Axiom P3 states that either the team practices daily or children did not play at the park.
4. Case 1: If the team practices daily (`hPractice`), then:
   - By P1, they are prepared (`hPrepared`).
   - By P4, prepared implies confident (`hConfident`).
   - By P5, confident implies holding heads high.
5. Case 2: If children did not play at the park (`notPlay`), this contradicts `hPlay` (from step 2), leading to a contradiction.

Thus, the theorem is proven: sunny weather implies the team holds their heads high.
