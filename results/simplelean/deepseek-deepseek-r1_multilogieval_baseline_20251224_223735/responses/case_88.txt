The reasoning involves determining if the guests will be happy given that the cake batter contained eggs. The context provides several implications and a disjunction:

1. If the oven is set to 350° (Set350), the cake bakes properly (BakeProperly).
2. If the batter contains eggs (ContainsEggs), the cake is fluffy (Fluffy) — though Fluffy is unused in the critical chain.
3. Either the oven is set correctly (Set350) or the batter lacks eggs (¬ContainsEggs).
4. If the cake bakes properly (BakeProperly), it tastes delicious (Tasty).
5. If the cake tastes delicious (Tasty), guests are happy (GuestsHappy).

Assuming ContainsEggs is true, the disjunction (Set350 ∨ ¬ContainsEggs) forces Set350 to be true (since ¬ContainsEggs is false). Then:
- Set350 implies BakeProperly (by axiom A1).
- BakeProperly implies Tasty (by axiom A4).
- Tasty implies GuestsHappy (by axiom A5).

Thus, ContainsEggs → GuestsHappy is provable.

<lean>
axiom Set350 : Prop
axiom BakeProperly : Prop
axiom ContainsEggs : Prop
axiom Fluffy : Prop  -- Unused in proof, but declared for completeness
axiom Tasty : Prop
axiom GuestsHappy : Prop

axiom A1 : Set350 → BakeProperly
axiom A2 : ContainsEggs → Fluffy   -- Unused in the critical chain
axiom A3 : Set350 ∨ ¬ContainsEggs
axiom A4 : BakeProperly → Tasty
axiom A5 : Tasty → GuestsHappy

theorem answer : ContainsEggs → GuestsHappy := by
  intro h_eggs
  cases A3 with
  | inl h_set => 
      have bp : BakeProperly := A1 h_set
      have t : Tasty := A4 bp
      exact A5 t
  | inr no_eggs => 
      contradiction
