The reasoning involves determining if, given the context, the farmer will make a good profit during monsoon season. The key steps are:

1. If it is monsoon season (M), then there are heavy rains (R) by axiom A2.
2. By axiom A3, either the farmer waters daily (W_daily) or there are no heavy rains (¬R). Since we have R (from step 1), ¬R is false, so W_daily must be true.
3. By axiom A6, watering daily (W_daily) implies sufficient watering (W). Thus, W is true.
4. By axiom A1, sufficient watering (W) leads to healthy crops (G), so G is true.
5. By axiom A4, healthy crops (G) lead to a bountiful harvest (B), so B is true.
6. By axiom A5, a bountiful harvest (B) leads to good profit (P), so P is true.

Therefore, M → P is provable.
