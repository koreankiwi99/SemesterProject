The context provides the following information:
1. If someone brings a dish to share, there is enough food for everyone.
2. If it is a birthday party, there will be cake and ice cream.
3. Either someone brought a dish or there was no birthday cake.

Given that it is Sam's birthday party, we can deduce:
- Since it's a birthday party, there must be cake (from axiom 2).
- Because there is cake, the disjunction "either someone brought a dish or there was no cake" forces the first option: someone brought a dish (as the second option is false).
- Since someone brought a dish, there is enough food (from axiom 1).

Thus, Sam has enough food for everyone.
