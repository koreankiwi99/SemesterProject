The reasoning in the context leads to a contradiction when assuming there is no noise. The axioms state that either a party is hosted or drums are practiced (or both), and both activities cause noise. If there is no noise, both activities must be absent, contradicting the disjunction. By the principle of explosion, any statement (including police intervention) follows from a contradiction. Thus, the implication "if no noise then police called" holds.

<lean>
axiom Noisy : Prop
axiom Party : Prop
axiom Drum : Prop
axiom Complain : Prop
axiom Police : Prop

axiom A1 : Party → Noisy
axiom A2 : Drum → Noisy
axiom A3 : Party ∨ Drum
axiom A4 : Party → Complain
axiom A5 : Complain → Police

theorem no_noise_implies_police : ¬Noisy → Police :=
  fun hNoNoise : ¬Noisy =>
  have hNoParty : ¬Party := fun hParty => hNoNoise (A1 hParty)
  have hNoDrum : ¬Drum := fun hDrum => hNoNoise (A2 hDrum)
  have hContra : False :=
    Or.elim A3
      (fun hParty => hNoParty hParty)
      (fun hDrum => hNoDrum hDrum)
  False.elim hContra
