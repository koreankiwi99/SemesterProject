axiom PracticeHard : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop
axiom Injured : Prop
axiom Win : Prop
axiom Celebrate : Prop
axiom CannotPlay : Prop  -- Added for the consequence of injury

-- Context axioms
axiom A1 : PracticeHard → Prepared
axiom A2 : Injured → CannotPlay
axiom A3 : PracticeHard ∨ ¬Injured
axiom A4 : Prepared → Win
axiom A5 : Win → Celebrate

theorem question : Injured → Celebrate := by
  intro hInjured
  cases A3 with
  | inl hPractice => 
      have hPrepared : Prepared := A1 hPractice
      have hWin : Win := A4 hPrepared
      exact A5 hWin
  | inr hNotInjured => 
      contradiction  -- hInjured and hNotInjured contradict

-- The proof shows that under the given axioms, 
-- if the star player is injured, the team will celebrate.
