The reasoning involves translating the context into logical axioms and determining if the query can be proven. The context includes:

1. Studying hard leads to confidence.
2. Severe weather may lead to class cancellation (non-deterministic, so no formal axiom).
3. Alex either studied for biology or class wasn't canceled (on biology day).
4. Confidence leads to good performance.
5. Good performance leads to satisfaction.

The question asks: If there was severe weather (assumed on the history exam day), is Alex satisfied with his history exam?

The formalization includes distinct days and exams. The key observations are:
- The disjunction (axiom T3) only concerns biology and its day.
- No axioms link history exam to severe weather, study habits, or class cancellation.
- Severe weather on history day doesn't provide information about Alex's study for history or class cancellation that day.

Thus, the theorem `SevereWeatherOn historyDay → Satisfied alex history` cannot be proven, nor can its negation, due to insufficient axioms about history.

axiom R1 : ∀ (p : Person) (e : Exam), StudiesHard p e → Confident p e
axiom T3 : StudiesHard alex biology ∨ ¬ ClassCanceledOn biologyDay
axiom R4 : ∀ (p : Person) (e : Exam), Confident p e → PerformsWell p e
axiom R5 : ∀ (p : Person) (e : Exam), PerformsWell p e → Satisfied p e

theorem thm : SevereWeatherOn historyDay → Satisfied alex history :=
