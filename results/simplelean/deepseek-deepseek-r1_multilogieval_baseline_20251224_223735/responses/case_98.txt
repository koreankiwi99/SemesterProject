The reasoning context is translated into Lean by defining propositions and axioms based on the given statements. The goal is to prove whether "If it was very hot outside, the team won" (i.e., `H → Win`).

<lean>
axiom H : Prop       -- It is very hot outside
axiom Post : Prop    -- The game is postponed
axiom P : Prop       -- The team practices hard
axiom Prep : Prop    -- The team is prepared
axiom Well : Prop    -- The team plays well
axiom Win : Prop     -- The team wins

axiom ax1 : P → Prep           -- If practices hard, then prepared
axiom ax2 : H → Post           -- If very hot, then game postponed
axiom ax3 : P ∨ ¬Post          -- Either practiced hard or game not postponed
axiom ax4 : Prep → Well        -- If prepared, then plays well
axiom ax5 : Well → Win         -- If plays well, then wins

theorem answer : H → Win := by
  intro h                       -- Assume H (very hot)
  have post : Post := ax2 h     -- ax2 gives Post (game postponed)
  cases ax3 with                -- Case analysis on ax3 (P ∨ ¬Post)
  | inl p =>                    -- Case 1: P (practiced hard)
    have prep : Prep := ax1 p   -- ax1 gives Prep (prepared)
    have well : Well := ax4 prep -- ax4 gives Well (plays well)
    exact ax5 well              -- ax5 gives Win (wins)
  | inr not_post =>             -- Case 2: ¬Post (game not postponed)
    contradiction               -- Contradiction: not_post and post
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**  
- Assume `H` (it was very hot).  
- By `ax2`, this implies `Post` (game postponed).  
- Consider the disjunction `ax3` (`P ∨ ¬Post`):  
  - If `P` holds (team practiced hard), then `ax1` implies `Prep` (prepared), `ax4` implies `Well` (plays well), and `ax5` implies `Win` (wins).  
  - If `¬Post` holds (game not postponed), this contradicts `Post` (from `ax2` and `H`), proving `Win` by contradiction.  
Thus, in both cases, `Win` follows from `H`, proving `H → Win`.
