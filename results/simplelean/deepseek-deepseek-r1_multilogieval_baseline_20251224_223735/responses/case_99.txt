The context describes a logical scenario involving watering, rain, soil saturation, blooming, fragrance, and attracting butterflies. The goal is to determine if heavy rain implies that the garden attracts butterflies.

### Lean Translation:
- `R`: It rains a lot (heavy rain)
- `S`: Soil becomes saturated
- `W`: Garden is watered routinely
- `B`: Flowers bloom brightly
- `F`: Flowers release fragrance
- `A`: Garden attracts butterflies

Axioms:
1. If watered routinely, flowers bloom (`W → B`)
2. If heavy rain, soil saturated (`R → S`)
3. Either watered routinely or soil not saturated (`W ∨ ¬S`)
4. If flowers bloom, they release fragrance (`B → F`)
5. If fragrance, attracts butterflies (`F → A`)

Theorem: Heavy rain implies the garden attracts butterflies (`R → A`)

Proof:
- Assume heavy rain (`R`). By axiom 2, soil saturated (`S`).
- By axiom 3, either `W` or `¬S`. Since `S` is true, `¬S` is false. Thus, `W` must hold.
- By axiom 1, `W` implies `B`, so flowers bloom.
- By axiom 4, `B` implies `F`, so fragrance released.
- By axiom 5, `F` implies `A`, so butterflies are attracted.

Thus, `R → A` is proven.
