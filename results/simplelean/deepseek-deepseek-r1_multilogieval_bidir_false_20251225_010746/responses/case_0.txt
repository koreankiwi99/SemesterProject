  absurd buy h_buy  -- Contradiction: buy and h_buy cannot both hold

-- But wait: the above proof accidentally proves BuyDreamHome p? Let's check.
-- Actually, we constructed 'buy' as BuyDreamHome p, then tried to contradict with h_buy.
-- However, this is invalid because we have no contradiction with axioms. 
-- The above theorem is flawed.

-- Correct approach: We CANNOT prove ¬BuyDreamHome p. Because:
-- 1. ¬AffordDownPayment p (given)
-- 2. From axiom1+given: ¬SavesAggressively p
-- 3. From axiom3: ImprovesCredit p
-- 4. From axiom2: QualifyMortgage p
-- 5. From axiom4: BuyDreamHome p
-- Thus, we must conclude BuyDreamHome p is true.

-- Therefore, no proof of ¬BuyDreamHome p exists.

The error occurred because I attempted to use `absurd` with two identical propositions instead of a proposition and its negation. The corrected Lean code acknowledges that we cannot prove the negation of "they bought their dream home" because the premises actually entail that they *did* buy it.

axiom given : ¬ AffordDownPayment p

-- Attempt to prove ¬BuyDreamHome p fails because:
-- 1. ¬AffordDownPayment p → ¬SavesAggressively p (contrapositive of axiom1)
-- 2. By axiom3, they must have ImprovedCredit
-- 3. By axiom2 and axiom4, this implies BuyDreamHome p
