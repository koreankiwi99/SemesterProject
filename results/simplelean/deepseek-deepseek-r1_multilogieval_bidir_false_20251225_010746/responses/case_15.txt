The reasoning aims to determine if the student was chosen as class prefect given that they did not excel academically. The premises are:

1. If the student studies diligently, they excel academically: `Study → Excel`.
2. If the student participates actively, they gain leadership skills: `Participate → Leader`.
3. The student either studies diligently or participates actively: `Study ∨ Participate`.
4. If the student is a leader, they are selected as class prefect: `Leader → Prefect`.

Given that the student did not excel academically (`¬Excel`), we need to try to prove that the student was **not** chosen as class prefect (`¬Prefect`).

**Analysis:**
- From `¬Excel` and `Study → Excel`, by contraposition, we get `¬Study`.
- From `¬Study` and `Study ∨ Participate`, we derive `Participate`.
- From `Participate` and `Participate → Leader`, we get `Leader`.
- From `Leader` and `Leader → Prefect`, we conclude `Prefect`.

Thus, the premises and `¬Excel` imply `Prefect`. Therefore, it is impossible to prove `¬Prefect` (i.e., that the student was not chosen as class prefect) because `Prefect` must hold.

**Lean Verification:**
The Lean code formalizes the premises and attempts to prove `¬Excel → ¬Prefect`. The proof shows that `¬Excel` leads to `Prefect`, making `¬Prefect` unprovable. The `sorry` tactic indicates the inability to complete the proof.
