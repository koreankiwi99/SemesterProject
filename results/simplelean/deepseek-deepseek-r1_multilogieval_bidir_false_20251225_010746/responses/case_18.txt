The context provides several premises:
1. If an employee impresses the manager, they get a promotion.
2. If an employee takes on extra responsibilities, they gain experience.
3. Sam either impressed the manager or took on extra responsibilities.
4. If an employee gains experience, they are assigned to lead a new team.

Given that Sam did not get a promotion, we need to determine if Sam was assigned to lead a new team. The goal is to prove that Sam was **not** assigned (i.e., ¬AssignedLead Sam) from the premises. If this can be proven, the answer is "No"; otherwise, it's "Failure".

In Lean:
- Define a type `Person` and Sam as an instance.
- Define predicates for the properties: `ImpressedManager`, `ExtraResponsibilities`, `Promotion`, `GainExperience`, `AssignedLead`.
- Formalize the axioms based on the premises.
- Use the premise that Sam did not get a promotion (`¬Promotion Sam`).

Attempt to prove ¬AssignedLead Sam:
- From premise 3, Sam either impressed the manager or took extra responsibilities.
- If Sam impressed the manager, by premise 1, Sam would get a promotion, contradicting ¬Promotion Sam. Thus, Sam did not impress the manager.
- Therefore, Sam must have taken extra responsibilities (by disjunction elimination).
- By premise 2, taking extra responsibilities implies gaining experience.
- By premise 4, gaining experience implies being assigned to lead a new team.
- Hence, Sam was assigned to lead a new team (AssignedLead Sam).

This shows that AssignedLead Sam is true, making ¬AssignedLead Sam unprovable. Therefore, the attempt to prove the negation fails.

ITERATION 2

The error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic in the `inl` case didn't automatically resolve the conflict between `Promotion Sam` and `¬Promotion Sam`. The proof has been revised to explicitly handle the contradiction using `exfalso` and applying the negation.

ITERATION 3

The error occurred because `exfalso` was not recognized, which is a tactic that changes the current goal to `False`. To resolve this, we use `False.elim` directly to handle contradictions. The corrected proof shows `AssignedLead Sam` is true, making it impossible to prove its negation.
