The context states:
1. If it rains, the grass and plants are watered naturally.
2. If the weather is very hot, children play in sprinklers.
3. Either it rained today or the children did not play in sprinklers.

Given that the weather was very hot, we must determine if the grass and plants did NOT get watered naturally. However:

- From hot weather (axiom 2), children played in sprinklers.
- From the disjunction (axiom 3) and children playing, we deduce it rained.
- From rain (axiom 1), we conclude the grass was watered naturally.

Thus, we CANNOT prove "the grass did NOT get watered naturally" since the axioms imply it WAS watered.

<lean>
axiom Rain : Prop
axiom Watered_naturally : Prop
axiom Hot : Prop
axiom Play_sprinklers : Prop

axiom A1 : Rain → Watered_naturally
axiom A2 : Hot → Play_sprinklers
axiom A3 : Rain ∨ ¬Play_sprinklers

axiom hot_today : Hot

theorem sprinklers_played : Play_sprinklers := A2 hot_today

theorem it_rained : Rain := 
  Or.elim A3 
    (fun r : Rain => r) 
    (fun np : ¬Play_sprinklers => absurd sprinklers_played np)

theorem watered : Watered_naturally := A1 it_rained

-- Attempt to prove ¬Watered_naturally fails because we proved Watered_naturally
