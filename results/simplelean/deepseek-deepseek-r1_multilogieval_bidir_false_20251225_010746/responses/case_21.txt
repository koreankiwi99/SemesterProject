The reasoning context provides two conditional statements about actions taken when cold or feeling a chill. However, the premises do not establish a direct link between being cold and feeling a chill, nor do they enforce that the "should" implies actual behavior. The given disjunction about Linda's actions is insufficient to prove she is not cold, as one branch of the disjunction does not constrain her coldness. 

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Linda : obj
axiom Cold : obj → Prop
axiom PutOnLayers : obj → Prop
axiom FeelsChill : obj → Prop
axiom TurnUpHeat : obj → Prop
axiom R1 : ∀ p : obj, Cold p → PutOnLayers p
axiom R2 : ∀ p : obj, FeelsChill p → TurnUpHeat p
axiom Given : ¬PutOnLayers Linda ∨ ¬TurnUpHeat Linda

-- Attempt to prove ¬Cold Linda fails:
-- Case 1: ¬PutOnLayers Linda implies ¬Cold Linda (by modus tollens on R1).
-- Case 2: ¬TurnUpHeat Linda implies ¬FeelsChill Linda (by modus tollens on R2),
--         but no axiom connects Cold to FeelsChill, leaving Cold Linda possible.
