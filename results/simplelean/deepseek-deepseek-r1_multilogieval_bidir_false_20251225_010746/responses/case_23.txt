The context provides information about the relationships between self-discipline, waking up early, planning, energy, and productivity. However, there is no direct link between planning one's day and having self-discipline. The axioms establish that self-discipline implies waking up early, which implies being energized, and planning implies productivity. But the existence of some people lacking energy or productivity doesn't constrain Mark specifically. Since Mark plans his day, we know he is productive, but this doesn't provide information about his self-discipline status. Attempting to prove that Mark lacks self-discipline fails because there are no premises connecting planning to self-discipline (either positively or negatively).

axiom Person : Type
axiom Mark : Person
axiom WakesUpEarly : Person → Prop
axiom Energized : Person → Prop
axiom PlansDay : Person → Prop
axiom Productive : Person → Prop
axiom SelfDiscipline : Person → Prop

axiom ax1 : ∀ p : Person, WakesUpEarly p → Energized p
axiom ax2 : ∀ p : Person, PlansDay p → Productive p
axiom ax3 : ∃ p : Person, ¬Energized p ∨ ¬Productive p
axiom ax4 : ∀ p : Person, SelfDiscipline p → WakesUpEarly p

-- Given: Mark plans his day
axiom mark_plans : PlansDay Mark

-- Attempt to prove ¬SelfDiscipline Mark
theorem mark_no_self_discipline : ¬SelfDiscipline Mark :=
  fun h : SelfDiscipline Mark =>
  have h1 : WakesUpEarly Mark := ax4 Mark h
  have h2 : Energized Mark := ax1 Mark h1
  -- We know Mark is productive (from planning) but this doesn't contradict anything
  have h3 : Productive Mark := ax2 Mark mark_plans
  -- We have no premise that links planning to lack of self-discipline
  -- or shows Mark lacks energy/productivity. Cannot derive contradiction.
  -- The existential (ax3) doesn't specify Mark, so we cannot use it here.
  -- Proof fails at this point.
  False.elim (by admit)  -- Proof cannot be completed

-- Since the proof requires 'admit', it fails.
