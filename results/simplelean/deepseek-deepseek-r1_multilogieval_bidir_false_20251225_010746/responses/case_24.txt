The textual context provides several premises about the weather conditions and actions related to building snowmen. The key elements are:
- If the temperature drops below freezing (`BelowFreezing`), there is snow on the ground (`SnowOnGround`).
- Building a snowman (`BuildsSnowmen x`) implies there is enough snow (`EnoughSnow`), interpreted as a location-based condition (same outdoor location for all).
- The disjunction: either below freezing, or not enough snow, or both (simplified to `BelowFreezing ∨ ¬EnoughSnow`).
- A general rule: if someone loves winter (`LovesWinter x`), they build snowmen.

The statement to evaluate is: "If there was no snow on the ground, does Mary love winter?" This requires proving that under the assumption of no snow (`¬SnowOnGround`), Mary does not love winter (`¬LovesWinter Mary`).

Using Lean, we formalize the axioms and attempt a proof:
- `BelowFreezing`, `SnowOnGround`, and `EnoughSnow` are propositions about the weather.
- `BuildsSnowmen` and `LovesWinter` are predicates on `Person`.
- Axiom 1 (`A1`): `BelowFreezing → SnowOnGround`
- Axiom 2 (`A2`): Building a snowman by anyone implies enough snow (`∀ x, BuildsSnowmen x → EnoughSnow`), as the context implies the same location.
- Axiom 3 (`A3`): `BelowFreezing ∨ ¬EnoughSnow`
- Axiom 4 (`A4`): Loving winter implies building snowmen (`∀ x, LovesWinter x → BuildsSnowmen x`)

The proof strategy:
1. Assume `¬SnowOnGround`.
2. From `A1` and `¬SnowOnGround`, derive `¬BelowFreezing`.
3. From `A3` and `¬BelowFreezing`, derive `¬EnoughSnow`.
4. Assume (for contradiction) that Mary loves winter (`LovesWinter Mary`).
5. By `A4`, Mary builds a snowman (`BuildsSnowmen Mary`).
6. By `A2`, this implies `EnoughSnow`, contradicting `¬EnoughSnow`.
7. Thus, `¬LovesWinter Mary`.

The Lean code implements this reasoning:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Mary : Person
axiom BelowFreezing : Prop
axiom SnowOnGround : Prop
axiom EnoughSnow : Prop
axiom BuildsSnowmen : Person → Prop
axiom LovesWinter : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : BelowFreezing → SnowOnGround
axiom A2 : ∀ x, BuildsSnowmen x → EnoughSnow
axiom A3 : BelowFreezing ∨ ¬EnoughSnow
axiom A4 : ∀ x, LovesWinter x → BuildsSnowmen x

theorem no_snow_implies_mary_not_love_winter : ¬SnowOnGround → ¬LovesWinter Mary :=
  fun (noSnow : ¬SnowOnGround) =>
  have noFreezing : ¬BelowFreezing := by
    intro freezing
    exact noSnow (A1 freezing)
  have noEnoughSnow : ¬EnoughSnow := by
    cases A3 with
    | inl freezing => exact noFreezing freezing
    | inr notEnough => exact notEnough
  fun (maryLoves : LovesWinter Mary) =>
  have maryBuilds : BuildsSnowmen Mary := A4 Mary maryLoves
  have enough : EnoughSnow := A2 Mary maryBuilds
  noEnoughSnow enough
</lean>

The proof succeeds, establishing that if there is no snow on the ground, Mary does not love winter. Therefore, the answer to the statement is "No".

ANSWER: No

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because in the `inl` branch of the `cases` tactic, `noFreezing freezing` produced a term of type `False`, but the goal was `¬EnoughSnow` (which is `EnoughSnow → False`). The fix uses `False.elim` to convert the `False` value into the required type `¬EnoughSnow` by leveraging that any proposition can be derived from `False`.

Corrected Lean code:
<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Mary : Person
axiom BelowFreezing : Prop
axiom SnowOnGround : Prop
axiom EnoughSnow : Prop
axiom BuildsSnowmen : Person → Prop
axiom LovesWinter : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : BelowFreezing → SnowOnGround
axiom A2 : ∀ x, BuildsSnowmen x → EnoughSnow
axiom A3 : BelowFreezing ∨ ¬EnoughSnow
axiom A4 : ∀ x, LovesWinter x → BuildsSnowmen x

theorem no_snow_implies_mary_not_love_winter : ¬SnowOnGround → ¬LovesWinter Mary :=
  fun (noSnow : ¬SnowOnGround) =>
  have noFreezing : ¬BelowFreezing := fun freezing => noSnow (A1 freezing)
  have noEnoughSnow : ¬EnoughSnow := by
    cases A3 with
    | inl freezing => exact False.elim (noFreezing freezing)
    | inr notEnough => exact notEnough
  fun (maryLoves : LovesWinter Mary) =>
  have maryBuilds : BuildsSnowmen Mary := A4 Mary maryLoves
  have enough : EnoughSnow := A2 Mary maryBuilds
  noEnoughSnow enough
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**
1. Assume no snow (`¬SnowOnGround`)
2. Derive not below freezing (`¬BelowFreezing`):
   - If it were below freezing (`A1`), there would be snow – contradiction
3. Derive not enough snow (`¬EnoughSnow`):
   - Case 1 (below freezing): Contradiction with `¬BelowFreezing` → derive any goal via `False.elim`
   - Case 2 (not enough snow): Directly use the hypothesis
4. Assume Mary loves winter (`LovesWinter Mary`)
5. By `A4`, Mary builds a snowman
6. By `A2`, this implies enough snow – contradicts `¬EnoughSnow`

The proof establishes that if there's no snow, Mary cannot love winter. Thus the answer to "Does Mary love winter if there's no snow?" is **No**.

ANSWER: No
