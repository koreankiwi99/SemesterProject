axiom obj : Type
axiom Jane : obj
axiom Injured : obj → Prop
axiom SeeDoctor : obj → Prop
axiom RestInjury : obj → Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Injured x → SeeDoctor x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Injured x → RestInjury x
axiom S : ¬ SeeDoctor Jane ∨ ¬ RestInjury Jane

theorem jane_not_injured : ¬ Injured Jane := by
  intro h
  have see_doc : SeeDoctor Jane := R1 Jane h
  have rest : RestInjury Jane := R2 Jane h
  cases S
