The context provides conditional statements about actions to take when certain suspicions arise, but it does not establish a logical link between the actions (checking credit reports or contacting banks) and the absence of suspicions. Specifically:

- Premise 1: Suspecting identity theft implies one *should* check their credit report (normative, not descriptive).
- Premise 2: Suspecting fraud implies one *should* contact their bank (normative, not descriptive).

The given statement ("Ty did not verify his credit report or did not contact his bank") describes *actual* inaction. However:
- There is no axiom stating that failing to act implies the absence of suspicion (e.g., one might suspect but neglect to act).
- "Fraud" and "identity theft" are not explicitly equated, so suspecting identity theft does not necessarily imply suspecting fraud (or vice versa).

Thus, we cannot prove that Ty did **not** suspect identity theft from the premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Ty : obj
axiom SuspectsIdentityTheft : obj → Prop
axiom SuspectsFraud : obj → Prop
axiom CheckCreditReport : obj → Prop
axiom ContactBank : obj → Prop

-- Premises (normative; no link to actual actions)
axiom P1 : ∀ x, SuspectsIdentityTheft x → CheckCreditReport x  -- "should" interpreted as implication
axiom P2 : ∀ x, SuspectsFraud x → ContactBank x

-- Given statement: Actual inaction by Ty
axiom T1 : ¬CheckCreditReport Ty ∨ ¬ContactBank Ty

-- No axioms force action when suspicion exists, nor equate identity theft with fraud.
-- Thus, we cannot prove ¬SuspectsIdentityTheft Ty.
