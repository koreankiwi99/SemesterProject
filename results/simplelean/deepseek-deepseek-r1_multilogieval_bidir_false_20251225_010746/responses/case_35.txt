The context states that if a person finds their account hacked, they must reset their password and notify their bank. The given statement indicates that Lucy either did not reset her password or did not notify her bank (or both). 

To answer "Did Lucy's account get hacked?" (meaning was the account compromised, regardless of discovery), we must prove ¬Hacked(Lucy). However, the premises only allow us to prove that if Lucy's account was hacked *and* she discovered it, she would have both reset her password and notified the bank. The given statement contradicts this requirement (since she failed at least one action), so we can conclude she did *not* both have her account hacked *and* discover it. 

But this does not prove the account was never hacked—it could have been hacked without her knowledge. Since we cannot prove the account was uncompromised (¬Hacked(Lucy)), the proof fails.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Lucy : obj
axiom Hacked : obj → Prop      -- Account was compromised
axiom FoundOut : obj → Prop    -- Person discovered the compromise
axiom ResetPassword : obj → Prop
axiom NotifyBank : obj → Prop

-- Context: If account is hacked and discovered, reset password and notify bank
axiom rule1 : ∀ x, Hacked x → FoundOut x → ResetPassword x
axiom rule2 : ∀ x, Hacked x → FoundOut x → NotifyBank x

-- Given: Lucy either didn't reset password or didn't notify bank
axiom given : ¬ResetPassword Lucy ∨ ¬NotifyBank Lucy

-- We prove Lucy did not both have her account hacked AND discover it
theorem no_hack_and_discovery : ¬(Hacked Lucy ∧ FoundOut Lucy) := by
  intro ⟨hacked, found⟩
  have must_reset : ResetPassword Lucy := rule1 Lucy hacked found
  have must_notify : NotifyBank Lucy := rule2 Lucy hacked found
  cases given with
  | inl no_reset => exact no_reset must_reset
  | inr no_notify => exact no_notify must_notify

-- But we cannot prove ¬Hacked Lucy (account was never compromised)
-- Counterexample: Account hacked but Lucy didn't discover it (so no actions required)
