The context provides premises about Jake's vacation scenario. The goal is to determine if we can prove that if Jake cannot relax outside, then he is not prepared. The Lean code models the situation and proves the implication `¬ CanRelaxOutside Jake → ¬ Prepared Jake`.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Jake : obj
axiom WeatherNice : Prop
axiom CanRelaxOutside : obj → Prop
axiom ReadBooks : obj → Prop
axiom PackedEnough : obj → Prop
axiom Prepared : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : WeatherNice → CanRelaxOutside Jake
axiom T2 : ReadBooks Jake → PackedEnough Jake
axiom T3 : WeatherNice ∨ ¬ PackedEnough Jake
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Prepared x → ReadBooks x

theorem jake_not_prepared_if_cannot_relax : ¬ CanRelaxOutside Jake → ¬ Prepared Jake := 
by
  intro no_relax prepared
  have not_weather : ¬ WeatherNice := fun w => no_relax (T1 w)
  cases T3 with
  | inl w => contradiction
  | inr not_packed => 
      have read_jake : ReadBooks Jake := R1 Jake prepared
      have packed_jake : PackedEnough Jake := T2 read_jake
      contradiction
</lean>

The proof proceeds as follows:
1. Assume Jake cannot relax outside (`no_relax`) and is prepared (`prepared`).
2. From `T1`, if weather is nice then Jake can relax, so by contraposition, no relaxing implies weather is not nice (`not_weather`).
3. By `T3`, either weather is nice or Jake did not pack enough. Case analysis:
   - If weather is nice (`w`), this contradicts `not_weather`.
   - If Jake did not pack enough (`not_packed`):
      - Since Jake is prepared, `R1` implies he reads books (`read_jake`).
      - `T2` then implies he packed enough (`packed_jake`), contradicting `not_packed`.
Thus, the assumption that Jake is prepared leads to a contradiction when he cannot relax outside, proving `¬ Prepared Jake`.

ANSWER: No
