The reasoning involves proving that if there was no quiz, then Alex is not good at math. The context provides several premises:
- If it is Monday, there is a quiz.
- If Alex does well on the quiz, they studied hard.
- Either it is Monday, or Alex did not study hard (simplified from the disjunction).
- If Alex is good at math, they do well on quizzes.

Given that there was no quiz, we derive:
- It is not Monday (contraposition of the first premise).
- Since it is not Monday, Alex did not study hard (from the disjunction).
- Since Alex did not study hard, they did not do well on the quiz (contraposition of the second premise).
- Since Alex did not do well, they are not good at math (contraposition of the last premise).

Thus, we can prove that Alex is not good at math under the assumption of no quiz.

The compilation errors occurred due to improper declaration of variables. In Lean 4, `variable` declarations require a surrounding context like a section or namespace. The corrected approach uses `axiom` for all propositions to ensure proper compilation. The proof demonstrates that if there was no quiz, Alex cannot be good at math.

<lean>
axiom Monday : Prop
axiom quiz : Prop
axiom study_hard : Prop

axiom good_at_math : Prop

axiom A1 : Monday → quiz
axiom A2 : do_well → study_hard
axiom A3 : Monday ∨ ¬study_hard
axiom A4 : good_at_math → do_well

theorem no_quiz_implies_not_good : ¬quiz → ¬good_at_math := by
  intro no_quiz
  have no_monday : ¬Monday := fun m => no_quiz (A1 m)
  have no_study : ¬study_hard := by
