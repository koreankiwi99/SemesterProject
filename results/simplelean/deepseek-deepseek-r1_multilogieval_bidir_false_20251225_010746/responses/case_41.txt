The context provides several premises about plant care, drought conditions, and their effects. The key is to determine if we can prove that Priya's plants did **not** wilt and die (i.e., ¬WiltAndDie) given that they did not grow well (¬GrowsWell). 

### Reasoning:
1. **Premises**:
   - `WatersDaily → GrowsWell` (watering daily ensures growth).
   - `Drought → Restrictions` (drought causes water restrictions).
   - `WatersDaily ∨ Drought` (either daily watering or drought occurred).
   - `Restrictions → ¬EnoughWater` (restrictions mean not enough water).
   - `¬EnoughWater → WiltAndDie` (lack of water causes wilting and death).
   - Given: `¬GrowsWell` (Priya's plants did not grow well).

2. **Derivations**:
   - From `¬GrowsWell` and `WatersDaily → GrowsWell`, we get `¬WatersDaily` (contraposition).
   - From `¬WatersDaily` and `WatersDaily ∨ Drought`, we get `Drought` (disjunctive syllogism).
   - From `Drought` and `Drought → Restrictions`, we get `Restrictions`.
   - From `Restrictions` and `Restrictions → ¬EnoughWater`, we get `¬EnoughWater`.
   - From `¬EnoughWater` and `¬EnoughWater → WiltAndDie`, we get `WiltAndDie`.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The premises and given fact imply `WiltAndDie` (the plants wilted and died).
   - Therefore, we **cannot** prove the negation of the conclusion (¬WiltAndDie). Attempting to prove ¬WiltAndDie leads to contradiction.
