-- If watched DIY videos, then gained decorating skills
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, WatchedDIY x → GainedSkills x

-- If gained decorating skills, then could redo living room
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, GainedSkills x → RedidLivingRoom x

-- If read blogs, then got new decorating ideas
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, ReadBlogs x → GotNewIdeas x

-- Matt did not redo his living room
axiom Matt_not_redid : ¬ RedidLivingRoom Matt

-- Prove Matt does not get new decorating ideas? (¬GotNewIdeas Matt)
-- We know from Matt_not_redid and A2 that Matt did not gain skills
theorem Matt_not_skilled : ¬ GainedSkills Matt :=
  fun h : GainedSkills Matt => 
  have hR : RedidLivingRoom Matt := A2 Matt h
  Matt_not_redid hR

-- From A1, if Matt watched DIY videos, he would have skills. Contradiction, so he didn't watch.
theorem Matt_not_watched : ¬ WatchedDIY Matt :=
  fun h : WatchedDIY Matt => 
  have hS : GainedSkills Matt := A1 Matt h
  Matt_not_skilled hS

-- However, we have no information about ReadBlogs Matt. 
-- A3 only gives GotNewIdeas Matt if ReadBlogs Matt, but we cannot prove ¬ReadBlogs Matt.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove ¬GotNewIdeas Matt.
