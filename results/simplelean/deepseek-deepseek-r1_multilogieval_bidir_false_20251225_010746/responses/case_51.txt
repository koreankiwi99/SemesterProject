The context and statement to evaluate are translated into Lean, incorporating the assumption that Mary did not stock up on groceries. The goal is to prove that prices did not go up recently (¬prices_up). However, the axioms lead to a contradiction when assuming ¬prices_up, and instead, prices_up is derived. Therefore, the negation of the conclusion cannot be proven.

axiom mary : Person
axiom sale : Prop
axiom payday : Prop

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `exact h_prices` statement was used incorrectly. In the branch where `A5` is `Or.inr h_prices`, we have `h_prices : prices_up`, but the goal was `False` (to prove `¬prices_up`). However, simply having `prices_up` does not produce a contradiction by itself - we need to combine it with the assumption that `¬prices_up` to derive `False`.

After re-examining the proof:
1. We can prove `prices_up` from the axioms and `not_stock_up_mary`
2. Attempting to prove `¬prices_up` requires showing that `prices_up` leads to a contradiction
3. In the proof attempt, when we reach `h_prices' : prices_up` (from `A5`), we have the assumption `h_prices : ¬prices_up` (which is `prices_up → False`)
4. Applying `h_prices` to `h_prices'` gives `False`

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom mary : Person
axiom sale : Prop
axiom payday : Prop
axiom prices_up : Prop
axiom makes_list : Person → Prop
axiom plan : Person → Prop
axiom stock_up : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : sale → ∀ (p : Person), stock_up p
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person), makes_list p → plan p
axiom A3 : sale ∨ (∀ (p : Person), ¬ plan p)
axiom A4 : payday → ∀ (p : Person), makes_list p
axiom A5 : payday ∨ prices_up

axiom not_stock_up_mary : ¬ stock_up mary

-- Attempt to prove ¬prices_up
theorem try_prove_negation : ¬ prices_up := by
  intro h_prices  -- Assume prices_up
  have no_sale : ¬ sale := fun h_sale => not_stock_up_mary (A1 h_sale mary)
  cases A3 with
  | inl h_sale => exact no_sale h_sale
  | inr no_plan =>
      have no_payday : ¬ payday := fun h_payday =>
        have list_mary : makes_list mary := A4 h_payday mary
        have plan_mary : plan mary := A2 mary list_mary
        no_plan mary plan_mary
      cases A5 with
      | inl h_payday => exact no_payday h_payday
      | inr h_prices' => exact h_prices h_prices'  -- h_prices' : prices_up, h_prices : ¬prices_up → False
</lean>

The proof now correctly derives `False` in the `Or.inr` branch by applying the assumption `h_prices` (which is `¬prices_up`) to the evidence `h_prices'` (which is `prices_up`). This completes the proof of `¬prices_up`.

Since we successfully proved the negation of the conclusion (¬prices_up), the answer is:

ANSWER: No

======================================================================
ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the variable `h_prices` was incorrectly used as a function when it's actually a proposition. After re-examining the proof, it becomes clear that we cannot derive a contradiction from the assumption `prices_up` combined with the premises. Specifically:

1. From `¬stock_up mary` and axiom A1, we derive `¬sale`
2. From `¬sale` and axiom A3, we derive `∀ p, ¬plan p`
3. Axiom A5 gives `payday ∨ prices_up`
4. If `payday` were true, we'd get a contradiction via A4 and A2 with `∀ p, ¬plan p`
5. But if `prices_up` is true (as assumed), there's no contradiction since `payday` could be false

Here's the corrected Lean code showing that the negation cannot be proven:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom mary : Person
axiom sale : Prop
axiom payday : Prop
axiom prices_up : Prop
axiom makes_list : Person → Prop
axiom plan : Person → Prop
axiom stock_up : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : sale → ∀ (p : Person), stock_up p
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person), makes_list p → plan p
axiom A3 : sale ∨ (∀ (p : Person), ¬ plan p)
axiom A4 : payday → ∀ (p : Person), makes_list p
axiom A5 : payday ∨ prices_up

axiom not_stock_up_mary : ¬ stock_up mary

-- Attempt to prove ¬prices_up fails
theorem cannot_prove_negation : ¬prices_up := by
  intro h_prices
  have no_sale : ¬sale := fun h_sale => not_stock_up_mary (A1 h_sale mary)
  cases A3 with
  | inl h_sale => exact no_sale h_sale
  | inr no_plan =>
      have no_payday : ¬payday := fun h_payday =>
        have list_mary : makes_list mary := A4 h_payday mary
        have plan_mary : plan mary := A2 mary list_mary
        no_plan mary plan_mary
      cases A5 with
      | inl h_payday => exact no_payday h_payday
      | inr h_prices' => 
          -- No contradiction: both h_prices and h_prices' prove prices_up
          -- But we need False here with no available contradiction
          admit
