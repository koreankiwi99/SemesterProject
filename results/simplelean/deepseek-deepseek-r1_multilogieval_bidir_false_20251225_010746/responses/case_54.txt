The context provides several premises and the additional information that the crowd did not start cheering loudly (¬C). The goal is to determine if there was a lot of booing (B). Specifically, we attempt to prove that there was no booing (¬B) from the premises. 

The premises are:
1. If the team scores early (S), then the crowd gets pumped up (P): S → P
2. If the crowd gets pumped up (P), then they start cheering loudly (C): P → C
3. Either the team scores early (S), or they play their rival team (R), or both: S ∨ R
4. If the crowd is pumped up (P), then there will be a lot of booing (B): P → B
Given: ¬C (the crowd did not start cheering loudly)

From ¬C and P → C (premise 2), we derive ¬P via modus tollens. From ¬P and S → P (premise 1), we derive ¬S via modus tollens. Using ¬S and S ∨ R (premise 3), we derive R. However, we have no premise linking R or other factors to B. Premise 4 (P → B) only tells us that if P is true, then B is true; since P is false, we cannot determine B's truth value. Thus, ¬B cannot be proven.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect syntax within the `have` tactic block. The `cases` tactic must be used at the top level of the tactic proof, not nested inside a `have` expression. The corrected code properly structures the proof using `cases` directly in the tactic block.

<lean>
axiom S : Prop  -- team scores early
axiom P : Prop  -- crowd gets pumped up
axiom C : Prop  -- crowd cheers loudly
axiom R : Prop  -- play rival team
axiom B : Prop  -- lot of booing

axiom A1 : S → P
axiom A2 : P → C
axiom A3 : S ∨ R
axiom A4 : P → B
axiom given : ¬C  -- given that crowd did not cheer loudly

theorem not_booing : ¬B :=
by
  intro hB  -- assume B is true
  have np : ¬P := fun p => given (A2 p)  -- ¬P from ¬C and A2
  have ns : ¬S := fun s => np (A1 s)     -- ¬S from ¬P and A1
  cases A3 with  -- case analysis on S ∨ R
  | inl s => 
      exact ns s  -- contradiction: S and ¬S
  | inr r => 
      -- Here we have R, but no premises relate R to B or ¬B
      -- A4 (P→B) is vacuously true since ¬P holds
      -- No contradiction can be derived from hB (B) and current knowledge
      sorry      -- proof fails in this branch
</lean>

**Analysis of provability:**
- From `¬C` and `A2: P → C`, we derive `¬P`.
- From `¬P` and `A1: S → P`, we derive `¬S`.
- From `A3: S ∨ R` and `¬S`, we derive `R` in the right branch.
- Premise `A4: P → B` is satisfied since `¬P` makes the implication hold vacuously.
- **No premises** connect `R` (playing rival team) to `B` (booing) or `¬B`.
- The assumption `B` (from `intro hB`) does not contradict any premises when `¬P` and `R` hold.
- Thus, `¬B` **cannot be proven** from the given axioms.
