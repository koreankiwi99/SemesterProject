The reasoning involves translating the context into logical axioms and attempting to prove that no salad was prepared (¬PrepareSalad) given that the stew is not savory (¬Savory). The analysis shows that the premises and ¬Savory actually imply that someone prepared a salad (PrepareSalad), making it impossible to prove ¬PrepareSalad.

<lean>
axiom AddSalt : Prop
axiom StirContinuously : Prop
axiom TasteStew : Prop
axiom PrepareSalad : Prop
axiom Savory : Prop
axiom ThickensPerfectly : Prop

axiom R1 : AddSalt → Savory
axiom R2 : StirContinuously → ThickensPerfectly
axiom R3 : AddSalt ∨ ¬ThickensPerfectly
axiom R4 : TasteStew → StirContinuously
axiom R5 : TasteStew ∨ PrepareSalad

-- Attempt to prove: ¬Savory → ¬PrepareSalad
-- Proof fails because:
-- 1. ¬Savory implies ¬AddSalt (via R1)
-- 2. ¬AddSalt and R3 imply ¬ThickensPerfectly
-- 3. ¬ThickensPerfectly implies ¬StirContinuously (via R2)
-- 4. ¬StirContinuously implies ¬TasteStew (via R4)
-- 5. ¬TasteStew and R5 imply PrepareSalad
-- Thus, ¬Savory entails PrepareSalad, not ¬PrepareSalad.
