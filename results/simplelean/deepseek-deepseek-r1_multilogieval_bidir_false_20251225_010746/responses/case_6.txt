The task is to evaluate whether flooding occurs in Dallas given heavy rainfall, using the provided context. The context states general rules: excessive rain causes reservoirs and dams to overflow, and reservoir overflow causes flooding. The specific instance is heavy rainfall in Dallas.

In Lean, we model:
- A type `City` for cities.
- A constant `Dallas` of type `City`.
- Predicates: `HeavyRain` (heavy rainfall in a city), `ReservoirsOverflow` (reservoirs overflow in a city), `Flooding` (flooding occurs in a city). The dams overflow (from `R1`) is included for completeness but not used in the flooding proof.
- Axioms:
  - `R1`: Heavy rain causes reservoirs and dams to overflow (general rule).
  - `R2`: Reservoir overflow causes flooding (general rule).
  - `T1`: Heavy rain in Dallas (given fact).

We attempt to prove the **negation** of the conclusion ("flooding does not occur in Dallas"). However:
1. From `T1` and `R1`, we get `ReservoirsOverflow Dallas`.
2. From `ReservoirsOverflow Dallas` and `R2`, we prove `Flooding Dallas`.

Thus, we **cannot** prove `¬Flooding Dallas` (the negation); instead, the premises prove flooding *does* occur. The attempt to prove the negation fails.

axiom City : Type
axiom Dallas : City
axiom HeavyRain : City → Prop
axiom ReservoirsOverflow : City → Prop
axiom DamsOverflow : City → Prop
axiom Flooding : City → Prop
axiom R1 : ∀ c : City, HeavyRain c → ReservoirsOverflow c ∧ DamsOverflow c
axiom R2 : ∀ c : City, ReservoirsOverflow c → Flooding c
axiom T1 : HeavyRain Dallas
-- Proving ¬Flooding Dallas is impossible because:
--   h1: ReservoirsOverflow Dallas ∧ DamsOverflow Dallas := R1 Dallas T1
--   h2: ReservoirsOverflow Dallas := h1.left
--   h3: Flooding Dallas := R2 Dallas h2
