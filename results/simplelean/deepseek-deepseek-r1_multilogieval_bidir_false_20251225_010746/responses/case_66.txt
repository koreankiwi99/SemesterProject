After analyzing the compilation error, I realized the `contradiction` tactic failed because it doesn't automatically resolve contradictions involving global axioms. The solution is to explicitly apply the contradictory evidence. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Acme : obj
axiom DevelopsInnovativeProduct : obj → Prop
axiom MarketsEffectively : obj → Prop
axiom CommerciallySuccessful : obj → Prop
axiom premise : ∀ x : obj, DevelopsInnovativeProduct x → MarketsEffectively x → CommerciallySuccessful x
axiom T1 : MarketsEffectively Acme
axiom T2 : ¬ CommerciallySuccessful Acme

theorem not_developed : ¬ DevelopsInnovativeProduct Acme := by
  intro h
  have success : CommerciallySuccessful Acme := premise Acme h T1
  exact T2 success
</lean>

ANSWER: No

**Explanation of the proof:**
1. We assume Acme developed an innovative product (`intro h`)
2. From the premise, this implies commercial success when combined with effective marketing (`premise Acme h T1`)
3. But we know Acme wasn't commercially successful (`T2`)
4. This creates a contradiction that proves the original assumption must be false (`exact T2 success`)

The conclusion is "No" - Acme did not develop an innovative product, as proven from the premises.
