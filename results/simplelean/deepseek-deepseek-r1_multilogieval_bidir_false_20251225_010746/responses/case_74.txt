The reasoning involves proving that James did not plan his schedule well given that he is not going to the party. The axioms are derived from the context:

1. If it's Friday, all students go to the party.
2. If a student finishes homework, they watch the game.
3. Either it's Friday or no student watches the game.
4. If a student studies everyday, they finish homework.
5. If someone plans their schedule well, they study everyday.

Given James is a student and not going to the party, we deduce:
- It cannot be Friday (otherwise James would go to the party).
- Since it's not Friday, no student watches the game (from disjunction).
- James doesn't watch the game.
- James didn't finish homework (otherwise he'd watch the game).
- James didn't study everyday (otherwise he'd finish homework).
- Therefore, James did not plan his schedule well.
