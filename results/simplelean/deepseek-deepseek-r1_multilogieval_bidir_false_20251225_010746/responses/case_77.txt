The goal is to prove the negation of the statement: "If James did not play well, then he was a top player in youth leagues," which translates to `¬PlayWell James → TopPlayer James`. The negation of this statement is `¬PlayWell James ∧ ¬TopPlayer James`. However, after formalizing the context and analyzing the premises, there is no information about James's specific attributes (e.g., whether he played well or not). The premises only provide general rules about relationships between practicing, playing well, talent, and being a top player, but they do not specify any facts about James. Therefore, it is impossible to prove `¬PlayWell James ∧ ¬TopPlayer James`.

axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj
axiom PracticedHard : obj → Prop
axiom PlayWell : obj → Prop
axiom PickedToStart : obj → Prop
axiom Talented : obj → Prop
axiom NaturalAbility : obj → Prop
axiom TopPlayer : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, PracticedHard x → PlayWell x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, PickedToStart x → Talented x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, PracticedHard x ∨ ¬ Talented x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, NaturalAbility x → PickedToStart x
axiom A6 : ∀ x, TopPlayer x → NaturalAbility x

-- We wish to prove: ¬PlayWell James ∧ ¬TopPlayer James
-- However, no premises provide specific information about James.
-- Without knowing ¬PlayWell James, we cannot prove the conjunction.
