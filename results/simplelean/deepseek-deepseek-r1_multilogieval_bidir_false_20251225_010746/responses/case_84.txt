axiom Musician : Type
axiom Sarah : Musician
axiom Practiced : Musician → Prop
axiom Jammed : Musician → Prop
axiom ComposeAlbum : Musician → Prop  -- Assume composing album implies releasing
axiom GainedInspiration : Musician → Prop
axiom CreativityFlourished : Musician → Prop

axiom A3 : ∀ m : Musician, Practiced m → ComposeAlbum m
axiom A4 : ∀ m : Musician, Practiced m ∨ Jammed m
axiom A5 : ∀ m : Musician, Jammed m → GainedInspiration m
axiom A6 : ∀ m : Musician, GainedInspiration m → CreativityFlourished m

-- Attempt to prove: ¬ComposeAlbum Sarah → ¬CreativityFlourished Sarah is impossible?
-- Instead, try to prove the negation of the conditional: ¬(¬ComposeAlbum Sarah → CreativityFlourished Sarah)
-- Which is equivalent to: ¬ComposeAlbum Sarah ∧ ¬CreativityFlourished Sarah

theorem prove_negation : ¬ComposeAlbum Sarah ∧ ¬CreativityFlourished Sarah := by
  have no_album : ¬ComposeAlbum Sarah := by sorry  -- Cannot directly assume this as premise
  have not_flourished : ¬CreativityFlourished Sarah := by sorry  -- Cannot assume
  exact ⟨no_album, not_flourished⟩
-- Proof fails: We cannot construct ¬CreativityFlourished Sarah from the axioms

-- In fact, we can prove the OPPOSITE:
theorem actual_truth : ¬ComposeAlbum Sarah → CreativityFlourished Sarah := by
  intro no_album
  have no_practice : ¬Practiced Sarah := by
    intro h
    exact no_album (A3 Sarah h)
  have must_jam : Jammed Sarah := by
    cases (A4 Sarah) with
    | inl p => exact absurd p no_practice
    | inr j => exact j
  have inspiration : GainedInspiration Sarah := A5 Sarah must_jam
  exact A6 Sarah inspiration

-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation of the conditional
