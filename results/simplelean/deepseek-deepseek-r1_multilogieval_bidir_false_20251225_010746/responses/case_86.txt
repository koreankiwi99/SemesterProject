The reasoning text is translated into Lean code to evaluate the statement: "If there was a big snowstorm, did Priya's parents take her out for ice cream?" The goal is to prove that the answer is "No" (i.e., that there was a snowstorm and Priya did not get ice cream) from the given premises. The Lean code formalizes the context and attempts a proof by contradiction.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Priya : obj
axiom StudiesHard : obj → Prop
axiom GoodGrades : obj → Prop
axiom Snowstorm : Prop
axiom SchoolCanceled : Prop
axiom ProudParents : obj → Prop
axiom IceCream : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, StudiesHard x → GoodGrades x
axiom A2 : Snowstorm → SchoolCanceled
axiom A3 : StudiesHard Priya ∨ ¬ SchoolCanceled
axiom A4 : ∀ x, GoodGrades x → ProudParents x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, ProudParents x → IceCream x

-- Attempt to prove: Snowstorm ∧ ¬ IceCream Priya (the negation of the statement)
theorem disprove : Snowstorm ∧ ¬ IceCream Priya → False :=
  fun ⟨snow, no_ice⟩ =>
    have schoolCanceled : SchoolCanceled := A2 snow
    have sh_or : StudiesHard Priya ∨ ¬ SchoolCanceled := A3
    have sh : StudiesHard Priya :=
      match sh_or with
      | .inl h => h
      | .inr h => False.elim (h schoolCanceled)
    have good : GoodGrades Priya := A1 Priya sh
    have proud : ProudParents Priya := A4 Priya good
    have ice : IceCream Priya := A5 Priya proud
    no_ice ice
</lean>

The proof shows that assuming `Snowstorm ∧ ¬ IceCream Priya` leads to a contradiction:
1. `Snowstorm` implies `SchoolCanceled` (by axiom A2).
2. Axiom A3 states that either Priya studied hard or school was not canceled.
3. Since school was canceled, the case where school was not canceled is false, forcing `StudiesHard Priya`.
4. `StudiesHard Priya` leads to `GoodGrades Priya` (A1), then `ProudParents Priya` (A4), and finally `IceCream Priya` (A5).
5. This contradicts the assumption `¬ IceCream Priya`.

Since the negation leads to a contradiction, it cannot be proven. Therefore, the answer is "Failure".

ANSWER: Failure
