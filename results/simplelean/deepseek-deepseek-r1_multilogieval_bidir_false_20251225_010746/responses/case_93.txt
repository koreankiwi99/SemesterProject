The reasoning follows the premises to determine if the team celebrates when the star player is injured. Premise 3 states that either the team practices hard or the star player is not injured. If the star player is injured, then by disjunctive syllogism, the team must have practiced hard. From premises 1, 4, and 5, practicing hard leads to being prepared, which leads to winning, and finally to celebrating. Thus, injury implies celebration, making it impossible to prove that injury leads to no celebration.

<lean>
axiom PracticeHard : Prop
axiom Injured : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop
axiom Win : Prop
axiom Celebrate : Prop

axiom T1 : PracticeHard → Prepared
axiom T3 : PracticeHard ∨ ¬Injured
axiom T4 : Prepared → Win
axiom T5 : Win → Celebrate

-- Attempt to prove: If injured, then NOT celebrate (to disprove the original implication)
theorem cannot_prove_negation : ¬(Injured ∧ ¬Celebrate) :=
  fun ⟨hInj, hNoCeleb⟩ => 
    have hPractice : PracticeHard := 
      match T3 with
      | Or.inl h => h
      | Or.inr notInj => absurd hInj notInj
    have hPrep : Prepared := T1 hPractice
    have hWin : Win := T4 hPrep
    have hCeleb : Celebrate := T5 hWin
    hNoCeleb hCeleb

-- Since we proved that (Injured ∧ ¬Celebrate) leads to contradiction,
-- we cannot prove the negation of the original statement (Injured → ¬Celebrate).
