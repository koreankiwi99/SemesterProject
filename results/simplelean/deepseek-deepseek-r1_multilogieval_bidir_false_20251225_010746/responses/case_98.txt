ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect usage of `variable` declarations without proper scoping. The code has been revised using `axiom` for all declarations to ensure proper typing and avoid scope issues. The analysis shows that the premises imply that if it is very hot, the team wins. Therefore, it's impossible to prove the negation (that the team did not win when it was very hot).
