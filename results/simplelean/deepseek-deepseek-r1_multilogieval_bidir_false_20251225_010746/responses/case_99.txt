The compilation errors occurred due to redefining `Prop` and incorrect proof tactics. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom RainsALot : Prop
axiom SoilSaturated : Prop
axiom WatersRegularly : Prop
axiom BloomsBrightly : Prop
axiom ReleaseFragrance : Prop
axiom AttractButterflies : Prop

axiom P1 : WatersRegularly → BloomsBrightly
axiom P2 : RainsALot → SoilSaturated
axiom P3 : WatersRegularly ∨ ¬SoilSaturated
axiom P4 : BloomsBrightly → ReleaseFragrance
axiom P5 : ReleaseFragrance → AttractButterflies

theorem disprove : RainsALot → ¬AttractButterflies :=
fun (hR : RainsALot) =>
  have hS : SoilSaturated := P2 hR
  have hW : WatersRegularly := by
    cases P3 with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr nh => exact False.elim (nh hS)
  have hB : BloomsBrightly := P1 hW
  have hF : ReleaseFragrance := P4 hB
  have hA : AttractButterflies := P5 hF
  show ¬AttractButterflies from fun a => 
    -- Cannot derive contradiction from hA and a since both prove AttractButterflies
    False.elim (sorry)  -- Proof fails: no contradiction found
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

**Explanation:**
1. Removed `axiom Prop : Type` since `Prop` is built-in
2. Fixed the proof structure:
   - Derived `AttractButterflies` from `RainsALot`
   - Showed that proving `¬AttractButterflies` requires deriving `False`
   - No contradiction exists between `hA : AttractButterflies` and the assumption `a : AttractButterflies`
3. Used `sorry` to highlight the unprovable step
4. Conclusion: We cannot prove "if there was heavy rain, the garden did NOT attract butterflies" because the premises actually imply that butterflies *are* attracted when it rains heavily.
