The context provides the following premises:
1. The restaurant advertises fresh, organic ingredients.
2. If a restaurant uses fresh, organic ingredients, the food tastes amazing (owner's belief).
3. If the food tastes amazing, positive reviews spread on social media.

The statement to evaluate includes two parts:
- "The new restaurant uses fresh, organic ingredients" (taken as an additional premise)
- "Did long lines form outside?" (the conclusion to prove)

However, there is no information connecting positive reviews on social media to long lines forming outside the restaurant. The chain of reasoning stops at positive reviews, and no link exists to long lines. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be proven from the given premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Restaurant : obj

axiom UsesFreshOrganic : obj → Prop
axiom TastesAmazing : obj → Prop
axiom PositiveReviews : obj → Prop
axiom LongLines : obj → Prop

-- Context premises
axiom advertising : ∀ x : obj, UsesFreshOrganic x  -- Advertising implies use (interpreted)
axiom owner_belief : ∀ x : obj, UsesFreshOrganic x → TastesAmazing x
axiom review_effect : ∀ x : obj, TastesAmazing x → PositiveReviews x

-- Additional premise from the statement
axiom restaurant_uses : UsesFreshOrganic Restaurant

-- Provable: PositiveReviews Restaurant
theorem positive : PositiveReviews Restaurant := 
  review_effect Restaurant (owner_belief Restaurant restaurant_uses)

-- But no axiom links PositiveReviews to LongLines
