ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The initial proof attempt failed because the `contradiction` tactic couldn't automatically resolve the contradiction without explicit use of the premise in the local context. Below is the corrected Lean 4 proof using explicit contradiction resolution:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Alex : obj
axiom AdvertisesCleverly : obj → Prop
axiom OffersDiscounts : obj → Prop
axiom AttractsMoreCustomers : obj → Prop
axiom IncreasesSales : obj → Prop
axiom ExpandsBusiness : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, AdvertisesCleverly x → AttractsMoreCustomers x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, OffersDiscounts x → IncreasesSales x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, AdvertisesCleverly x ∨ OffersDiscounts x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, IncreasesSales x → ExpandsBusiness x

axiom Premise : ¬ AttractsMoreCustomers Alex

theorem AlexExpanded : ExpandsBusiness Alex := by
  cases (A3 Alex) with
  | inl h_clever => 
      have h_attract : AttractsMoreCustomers Alex := A1 Alex h_clever
      exact False.elim (Premise h_attract)  -- Explicit contradiction
  | inr h_discount => 
      have h_sales : IncreasesSales Alex := A2 Alex h_discount
      exact A4 Alex h_sales
</lean>

**Proof Explanation:**  
1. By axiom A3, Alex either advertises cleverly or offers discounts.  
2. **Case 1 (advertises cleverly):**  
   - A1 implies this would attract more customers.  
   - This contradicts the premise that Alex did not attract more customers, so the case is impossible (proven via `False.elim`).  
3. **Case 2 (offers discounts):**  
   - A2 implies this increases sales.  
   - A4 then implies Alex expands his business.  

Since the first case leads to contradiction, the second case must hold, proving the theorem.
