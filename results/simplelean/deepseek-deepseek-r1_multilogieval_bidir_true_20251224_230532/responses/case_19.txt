The reasoning involves propositions about the bookstore's actions and their consequences. Given that the service quality decreased (¬S), and the owner either provides excellent service or hosts events (S ∨ E), it follows that they must host events (E). Hosting events leads to increased customer traffic (C) via E → C, and increased traffic leads to improved revenue (V) via C → V. Thus, we can prove revenue improved.

<lean>
axiom S : Prop -- offer great customer service
axiom E : Prop -- host author events
axiom C : Prop -- customer traffic increases
axiom V : Prop -- revenue improves

-- Premises
axiom event_attracts : E → C
axiom service_or_event : S ∨ E
axiom traffic_boosts_revenue : C → V

-- Given service decreased (¬S)
theorem revenue_improved (service_decreased : ¬S) : V := by
  cases service_or_event with
  | inl great_service => contradiction  -- ¬S and S cannot both hold
  | inr hosted_events => 
      apply traffic_boosts_revenue 
      apply event_attracts 
      exact hosted_events
</lean>

ANSWER: True
