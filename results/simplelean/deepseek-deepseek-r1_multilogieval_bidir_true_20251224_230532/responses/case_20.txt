The context provides several relationships but does not establish a direct link between "impressing bosses" and "being motivated." Specifically:
- Impressing bosses leads to influence (A2), but influence has no defined connection to motivation.
- The ambitious employee's realization (A4) only applies conditionally to that specific employee, not universally to all employees like Mark.
- Mark's trait of impressing bosses (T1) proves his influence (via A2) but does not constrain his motivation state.

Since no axiom connects "impressing bosses" or "influence" to "motivation," and the ambitious employee's case is isolated, Mark's motivation cannot be proven from the premises.

<lean>
axiom employee : Type
axiom Mark : employee
axiom HardWorking : employee → Prop
axiom Promotion : employee → Prop
axiom ImpressesBosses : employee → Prop
axiom Influence : employee → Prop
axiom Motivated : employee → Prop
axiom Ambitious : employee → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ e : employee, HardWorking e → Promotion e
axiom A2 : ∀ e : employee, ImpressesBosses e → Influence e
axiom A3 : (∃ e : employee, ¬ Promotion e) ∨ (∃ e : employee, ¬ Influence e)
axiom A4 : ∃ a : employee, Ambitious a ∧ (Motivated a → HardWorking a)
axiom T1 : ImpressesBosses Mark

-- No axiom links ImpressesBosses/Mark to Motivated Mark
-- A4 is existential and does not apply to Mark without evidence
-- A3 is a disjunction about promotions/influence, unrelated to motivation
-- Hence, Motivated Mark is unprovable
