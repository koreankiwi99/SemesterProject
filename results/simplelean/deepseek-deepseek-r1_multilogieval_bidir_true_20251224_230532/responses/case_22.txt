The given context provides two premises:
1. If a city experiences a drought, authorities implement water restrictions: `∀ c, Drought c → ImplementRestrictions c`
2. Drought conditions require rationing water usage: `∀ c, Drought c → RationWater c`

The statement to evaluate is: "Either the city did not enforce water limits, or it did not ration water usage" (`¬ ImplementRestrictions City ∨ ¬ RationWater City`). We are asked to determine if the city is undergoing a drought (`Drought City`).

However:
- If the city were undergoing a drought, both `ImplementRestrictions City` and `RationWater City` would be true (by premises 1 and 2).
- The given disjunction states that at least one of these is false, which contradicts the conjunction of both being true.
- This implies the city **cannot** be undergoing a drought (`¬ Drought City` is provable).

Since we are asked to prove **`Drought City`** (the city is undergoing a drought), and the axioms actually prove the opposite, we cannot prove the conclusion.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom City : obj
axiom Drought : obj → Prop
axiom ImplementRestrictions : obj → Prop
axiom RationWater : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ c : obj, Drought c → ImplementRestrictions c
axiom P2 : ∀ c : obj, Drought c → RationWater c
axiom P3 : ¬ ImplementRestrictions City ∨ ¬ RationWater City

-- Cannot prove Drought City because:
-- 1. If Drought City were true, P1 and P2 would yield ImplementRestrictions City ∧ RationWater City
-- 2. But P3 states ¬ImplementRestrictions City ∨ ¬RationWater City, leading to contradiction
-- Thus, Drought City must be false, not true.
