-- Context axioms
axiom A1 : ∀ x, WakeUpEarly x → FeelEnergized x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, PlanDay x → Productive x
axiom A3 : ∃ x, (¬ FeelEnergized x) ∨ (¬ Productive x)
axiom A4 : ∀ x, SelfDiscipline x → WakeUpEarly x

-- Specific fact about Mark
axiom Mark : obj
axiom MarkPlans : PlanDay Mark

-- Attempt to prove SelfDiscipline Mark
theorem mark_self_discipline : SelfDiscipline Mark := 
  by 
    -- We know Mark plans his day (MarkPlans), so by A2 he is productive
    have mark_productive : Productive Mark := A2 Mark MarkPlans
    -- We also know A4 gives SelfDiscipline → WakeUpEarly, but we have no link from PlanDay to SelfDiscipline
    -- The context has no axiom connecting planning to waking early or discipline
    -- Attempting to use A3: It states there exists someone lacking energy/productivity, but doesn't constrain Mark
    -- A3 proves that not everyone is both energized and productive, but Mark could still be an exception
    -- No available path from "plans day" to "self-discipline"
    sorry  -- Cannot complete proof
