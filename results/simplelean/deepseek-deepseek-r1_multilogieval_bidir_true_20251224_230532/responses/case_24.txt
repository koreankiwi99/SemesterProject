The reasoning involves evaluating whether the statement "If there was no snow on the ground, then Mary loves winter" follows from the given premises. The analysis shows:

1. **Premises**:
   - Freezing → SnowOnGround
   - BuildsSnowman Person → EnoughSnow (specific to Person)
   - Freezing ∨ ¬EnoughSnow
   - ∀ x, LovesWinter x → BuildsSnowman x (general rule)

2. **Assumption**: ¬SnowOnGround (no snow on ground)
   - From Freezing → SnowOnGround and ¬SnowOnGround, we deduce ¬Freezing.
   - From Freezing ∨ ¬EnoughSnow and ¬Freezing, we deduce ¬EnoughSnow.
   - From BuildsSnowman Person → EnoughSnow and ¬EnoughSnow, we deduce ¬BuildsSnowman Person.

3. **Regarding Mary**:
   - We have no premise linking the snow conditions (SnowOnGround or EnoughSnow) to Mary's actions.
   - The rule ∀ x, LovesWinter x → BuildsSnowman x applies, but without knowing if Mary built a snowman or any connection between global snow conditions and Mary, we cannot derive LovesWinter Mary.
   - ¬SnowOnGround leads to ¬EnoughSnow, but this only prevents Person from building (not Mary, as no global building constraint exists).

4. **Conclusion**: The premises do not provide a path to prove LovesWinter Mary under ¬SnowOnGround. Thus, the statement cannot be proven.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Freezing : Prop
axiom SnowOnGround : Prop
axiom EnoughSnow : Prop
axiom BuildsSnowman : obj → Prop
axiom LovesWinter : obj → Prop
axiom Person : obj
axiom Mary : obj
axiom A1 : Freezing → SnowOnGround
axiom A2 : BuildsSnowman Person → EnoughSnow
axiom A3 : Freezing ∨ ¬EnoughSnow
axiom A4 : ∀ x, LovesWinter x → BuildsSnowman x

-- We cannot prove: ¬SnowOnGround → LovesWinter Mary
-- Since ¬SnowOnGround gives ¬EnoughSnow via A1 and A3, but this only affects Person (A2).
-- For Mary, A4 requires LovesWinter Mary → BuildsSnowman Mary, but we have no link between
-- EnoughSnow and BuildsSnowman Mary. Thus, no proof exists.
