The context provides information about salespersons, including that perceptive salespersons build rapport, which leads to trust, and effective presentations lead to sales conversions. However, there is no direct or indirect link established between giving effective presentations and being perceptive. The fact that Emma gives effective presentations only implies she converts sales (via the general rule), but this does not connect to perceptiveness or rapport-building. The existence of salespersons who neither build trust nor convert sales doesn't provide additional constraints about Emma. Therefore, the conclusion that Emma is perceptive cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Salesperson : Type
axiom Emma : Salesperson
axiom BuildsRapport : Salesperson → Prop
axiom BuildsTrust : Salesperson → Prop
axiom EffectivePresentation : Salesperson → Prop
axiom ConvertsSales : Salesperson → Prop
axiom Perceptive : Salesperson → Prop

axiom rapport_leads_to_trust : ∀ x : Salesperson, BuildsRapport x → BuildsTrust x
axiom effective_presentations_convert_sales : ∀ x : Salesperson, EffectivePresentation x → ConvertsSales x
axiom not_all_salespersons : ∃ x : Salesperson, ¬BuildsTrust x ∧ ¬ConvertsSales x
axiom perceptive_builds_rapport : ∀ x : Salesperson, Perceptive x → BuildsRapport x

-- Given: Emma gives effective presentations
axiom emma_effective : EffectivePresentation Emma

-- Cannot prove Perceptive Emma from the given axioms
