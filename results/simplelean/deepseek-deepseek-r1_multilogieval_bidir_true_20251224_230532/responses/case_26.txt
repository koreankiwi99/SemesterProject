The context provides two premises:
1. If a team loses an important game, the players feel disappointed.
2. If a team loses a big match, the players feel demoralized.

The statement to evaluate is:  
"The players are neither disappointed nor demoralized. Did the team lose a significant game?"

We formalize "significant game" as a game that is either important or big (or both), based on contextual equivalence.  
Given that the players are not disappointed, the team did not lose any important game.  
Given that the players are not demoralized, the team did not lose any big match.  
Therefore, the team did not lose any significant game (i.e., no game that is important or big).

Lean proof:
- Assumes a specific team `t` and games.
- Uses modus tollens on both premises with the given facts (players not disappointed/demoralized).
- Proves no significant game was lost by contradiction.
