The context provides two premises:  
1. If someone gets injured, they should see a doctor.  
2. Getting hurt warrants resting the affected area.  

The statement to evaluate is: "Either Jane did not see a doctor or she did not rest her injury."  
The question is whether Jane got hurt.  

In Lean, we model:  
- `obj` as a type for entities.  
- `Jane` as a specific object.  
- `Hurt` as a predicate indicating someone is hurt (equivalent to injured).  
- `SeeDoctor` and `RestInjury` as predicates for the recommended actions.  
- Axioms:  
  - `P1`: If someone is hurt, they see a doctor.  
  - `P2`: If someone is hurt, they rest the injury.  
  - `P3`: Jane either did not see a doctor or did not rest her injury.  

We attempt to prove `Hurt Jane` (Jane got hurt). However:  
- If Jane were hurt, `P1` and `P2` imply she saw a doctor and rested her injury.  
- `P3` states she did not see a doctor or did not rest her injury, which contradicts the conjunction of seeing a doctor and resting if she were hurt.  
- This contradiction implies Jane cannot be hurt, so we **cannot prove** `Hurt Jane`.  

Thus, the answer is **Failure**.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Jane : obj
axiom Hurt : obj → Prop
axiom SeeDoctor : obj → Prop
axiom RestInjury : obj → Prop
axiom P1 : ∀ x, Hurt x → SeeDoctor x
axiom P2 : ∀ x, Hurt x → RestInjury x
axiom P3 : ¬ SeeDoctor Jane ∨ ¬ RestInjury Jane

-- Attempt to prove Hurt Jane fails:
-- If Hurt Jane, then by P1 and P2: SeeDoctor Jane ∧ RestInjury Jane.
-- But P3 states ¬SeeDoctor Jane ∨ ¬RestInjury Jane, which contradicts the conjunction.
-- Thus, ¬Hurt Jane is provable, but Hurt Jane is not.
