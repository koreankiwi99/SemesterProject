The context provides conditional statements but does not establish a relationship between identity theft and fraud, nor does it confirm that obligations imply actions. The given disjunction about Ty's actions (not verifying credit report or not contacting bank) cannot be used to infer his suspicions because:
1. The conditionals are prescriptive ("should"), not descriptive of actual behavior.
2. There is no axiom linking identity theft suspicion to fraud suspicion.
3. The disjunction does not force identity theft suspicion; it could be explained by other factors.

Thus, we cannot prove Ty suspected identity theft.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Ty : obj
axiom SuspectIdentityTheft : obj → Prop
axiom CheckCreditReport : obj → Prop
axiom SuspectFraud : obj → Prop
axiom ContactBank : obj → Prop
axiom A1 : ∀ x, SuspectIdentityTheft x → CheckCreditReport x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, SuspectFraud x → ContactBank x
axiom Given : ¬ CheckCreditReport Ty ∨ ¬ ContactBank Ty
-- Cannot prove SuspectIdentityTheft Ty:
-- 1. Conditionals describe obligations, not necessarily actions.
-- 2. No link between SuspectIdentityTheft and SuspectFraud.
-- 3. Given disjunction could hold without SuspectIdentityTheft being true.
