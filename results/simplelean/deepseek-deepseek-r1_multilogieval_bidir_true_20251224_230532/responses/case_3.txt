The reasoning involves translating the given context into logical axioms and proving the statement. The context states:

1. If Team A scores more points, they win (so Team B loses): `ScoreMoreA → WinA`.
2. If Team B fumbles multiple times, they lose (so Team A wins): `FumbleB → WinA`.
3. Either Team A scores more points, or Team B fumbles, or both: `ScoreMoreA ∨ FumbleB`.

The statement to evaluate is: "If Team B did not lose, then Team A scored more points."  
- "Team B did not lose" is equivalent to `¬LoseB`. Since losing is equivalent to the opponent winning, `LoseB` is `WinA`. Thus, `¬LoseB` becomes `¬WinA`.  
- The conclusion is `ScoreMoreA`.  
- Therefore, we aim to prove: `¬WinA → ScoreMoreA`.

Proof:  
Assume `¬WinA`. From the disjunction `ScoreMoreA ∨ FumbleB`:  
- If `ScoreMoreA`, the conclusion holds.  
- If `FumbleB`, then by axiom `FumbleB → WinA`, we get `WinA`. This contradicts `¬WinA`, allowing us to derive anything (including `ScoreMoreA`) by explosion.  

Thus, the statement is provable from the axioms.
