The context provides information about athletes, their training, nutrition, and dedication. However, there is no direct or indirect logical connection established between eating a healthy diet (healthy nutrition) and being dedicated to the sport. The axioms allow us to infer that healthy nutrition increases strength, but dedication only leads to proper training (which enhances skills). Since no axiom links nutrition to dedication, we cannot prove that Mark is dedicated based on the given information.

<lean>
axiom Athlete : Type
axiom Mark : Athlete
axiom Dedicated : Athlete → Prop
axiom ProperTraining : Athlete → Prop
axiom EnhanceSkills : Athlete → Prop
axiom HealthyNutrition : Athlete → Prop
axiom IncreaseStrength : Athlete → Prop

axiom ax1 : ∀ a : Athlete, Dedicated a → ProperTraining a
axiom ax2 : ∀ a : Athlete, ProperTraining a → EnhanceSkills a
axiom ax3 : ∀ a : Athlete, HealthyNutrition a → IncreaseStrength a
axiom ax4 : HealthyNutrition Mark

-- No axiom connects HealthyNutrition to Dedicated. Cannot prove Dedicated Mark.
