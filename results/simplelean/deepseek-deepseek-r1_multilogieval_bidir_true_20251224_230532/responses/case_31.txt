The context provides general rules about suspicions of infidelity, but these are normative ("should", "warrants") and do not necessarily describe actual behavior. The statement about Priya describes her actions (she either didn't talk or didn't reassess), but there is no axiom linking the normative rules to actual behavior. Therefore, we cannot prove that Priya suspected infidelity from the given information.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Priya : obj
axiom Suspects : obj → Prop
axiom Talk : obj → Prop
axiom Reassess : obj → Prop

-- Normative context: not directly about actions
-- If someone suspects cheating, they *should* talk (but this doesn't mean they do)
-- Infidelity concerns *warrant* reassessment (but doesn't mean they do it)
-- No axioms connect these norms to Priya's actual actions

-- Statement: Priya did not talk OR did not reassess
axiom A1 : ¬ Talk Priya ∨ ¬ Reassess Priya

-- Goal: Prove Suspects Priya (that she thought her partner was unfaithful)
theorem target : Suspects Priya :=
  -- Cannot prove from given premises. A1 shows she missed at least one action,
  -- but without linking norms to actions, we can't infer suspicion.
  sorry -- Proof fails
