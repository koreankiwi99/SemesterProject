The context provides several premises about the citizens of the town, but none directly link eating nutritious foods to valuing wellness. The key premises are:
1. If someone values wellness, they exercise regularly: `∀ p, ValuesWellness p → ExercisesRegularly p`
2. Eating nutritious foods leads to having energy: `∀ p, EatsNutritious p → HasEnergy p`
3. There exists someone who does not exercise or does not eat well (from the mayor's conclusion).

Jane eats nutritious foods, so she has energy. However, there is no premise stating that eating nutritious foods implies exercising regularly or valuing wellness. The premise about valuing wellness only goes in one direction (valuing wellness → exercise), and Jane's eating habits do not provide information about her exercise habits or values. The existential about some citizen failing in one aspect does not constrain Jane specifically. Therefore, we cannot prove that Jane values wellness.
