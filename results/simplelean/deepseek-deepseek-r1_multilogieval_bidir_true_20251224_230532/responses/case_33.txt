The context does not provide sufficient information to prove that Bob is one with nature. While Bob rotates his crops (leading to nutrient-rich crops), the context states that crops are either unhealthy or lack nutrients. For Bob, nutrient-rich crops imply unhealthy crops, meaning Bob does not use organic methods (as organic methods produce healthy crops). The connection between being one with nature and using organic methods only applies to aware farmers, but there is no information about Bob's awareness. Thus, we cannot conclude that Bob is one with nature.

The compilation errors were due to incorrect handling of the disjunction in the proof of `Bob_not_healthy` and improper use of `constant` instead of `axiom` for declarations. The corrected code uses `axiom` consistently and simplifies the proof by utilizing the `contradiction` tactic when a false case is encountered.

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic couldn't automatically detect the contradiction between `h : ¬NutrientRich Bob` and `Bob_nutrient_rich : NutrientRich Bob`. The proof has been corrected by explicitly handling the disjunction cases and applying the contradictory hypotheses directly.
