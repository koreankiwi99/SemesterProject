The context states that if a person finds their account hacked, they must reset their password, and if they detect unauthorized access, they must notify their bank. The statement indicates that Lucy either did not reset her password or did not notify her bank. However, there is no information connecting account hacking to detection or the absence of actions. Specifically:

1. If Lucy's account was hacked but she didn't detect it, she might not have performed the actions.
2. If her account wasn't hacked, she might legitimately skip these actions.

Thus, we cannot prove Lucy's account was hacked from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Lucy : Person
axiom Hacked : Person → Prop
axiom Detect : Person → Prop
axiom ResetPassword : Person → Prop
axiom NotifyBank : Person → Prop

axiom rule1 : ∀ x : Person, Hacked x ∧ Detect x → ResetPassword x
axiom rule2 : ∀ x : Person, Detect x → NotifyBank x
axiom lucy_action : ¬ ResetPassword Lucy ∨ ¬ NotifyBank Lucy

-- We cannot prove Hacked Lucy because:
-- 1. If Lucy didn't reset, it may be due to lack of detection (even if hacked)
-- 2. If Lucy didn't notify, it also may be due to lack of detection
-- 3. Without detection evidence, we cannot link actions to hacking
