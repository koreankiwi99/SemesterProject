The context provides two implications:
1. If someone has computer problems, they should restart: `∀x, Problems x → Restart x`
2. If someone has computer problems, they should check for updates: `∀x, Problems x → CheckUpdates x`

The statement to evaluate is:  
¬Restart(Mary) ∨ ¬InstallUpdates(Mary)  

We need to prove: `Problems Mary`  

However:
- The context mentions "check for updates" (`CheckUpdates`), not "install updates" (`InstallUpdates`). There is no axiom linking these.
- The disjunction gives two cases:  
  a) If ¬Restart(Mary), then by contraposition of the first axiom, ¬Problems(Mary).  
  b) If ¬InstallUpdates(Mary), we have no connection to `Problems` since `InstallUpdates` isn't mentioned in the axioms.  

Thus, we cannot prove `Problems Mary` from the given information.  

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mary : obj
axiom Problems : obj → Prop
axiom Restart : obj → Prop
axiom CheckUpdates : obj → Prop
axiom InstallUpdates : obj → Prop  -- Not in context, required for statement

axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Problems x → Restart x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Problems x → CheckUpdates x
axiom given_statement : ¬ Restart Mary ∨ ¬ InstallUpdates Mary

-- Cannot prove Problems Mary:
-- 1. ¬Restart Mary implies ¬Problems Mary (contraposition of R1)
-- 2. ¬InstallUpdates Mary has no known relation to Problems Mary
