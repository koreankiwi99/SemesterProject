The context provides several premises, but when attempting to prove that "if there was no quiz, then Alex is good at math" (¬Quiz → GoodAtMath), the premises lead to the opposite conclusion. Specifically:

- From ¬Quiz and the premise "if Monday then quiz" (Monday → Quiz), we derive ¬Monday.
- From ¬Monday and the premise "Monday or not studied hard" (Monday ∨ ¬StudiedHard), we derive ¬StudiedHard.
- From ¬StudiedHard and the premise "if well then studied hard" (Well → StudiedHard), we derive ¬Well (by contraposition).
- From ¬Well and the premise "if good at math then well" (GoodAtMath → Well), we derive ¬GoodAtMath (by contraposition).

Thus, assuming no quiz (¬Quiz) leads to ¬GoodAtMath, meaning Alex is not good at math. Consequently, the statement "if there was no quiz, then Alex is good at math" cannot be proven and is false under the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Monday : Prop
axiom Quiz : Prop
axiom Well : Prop
axiom StudiedHard : Prop
axiom GoodAtMath : Prop

axiom P1 : Monday → Quiz
axiom P2 : Well → StudiedHard
axiom P3 : Monday ∨ ¬StudiedHard
axiom P4 : GoodAtMath → Well

-- Attempt to prove ¬Quiz → GoodAtMath fails because:
-- ¬Quiz leads to ¬Monday (from P1 and contraposition)
-- ¬Monday and P3 (Monday ∨ ¬StudiedHard) imply ¬StudiedHard
-- ¬StudiedHard and P2 (Well → StudiedHard) imply ¬Well (contraposition)
-- ¬Well and P4 (GoodAtMath → Well) imply ¬GoodAtMath (contraposition)
-- Thus, ¬Quiz → ¬GoodAtMath, making ¬Quiz → GoodAtMath unprovable.
