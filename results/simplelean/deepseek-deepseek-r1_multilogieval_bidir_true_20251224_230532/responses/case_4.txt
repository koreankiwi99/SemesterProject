The reasoning involves proving that if sales did not increase, then production costs must have increased. The context provides the following premises:

1. If the company invested in marketing (`InvestMarketing`), they gain more customers (`MoreCustomers`).
2. If they gain more customers, sales increase (`SalesIncrease`).
3. Either they invested in marketing, or production costs increased (`ProdCostIncreased`), or both (represented as `InvestMarketing ∨ ProdCostIncreased`).

Given that sales did not increase (`¬SalesIncrease`), we derive:
- From premises 1 and 2, if they invested in marketing, sales would increase (`InvestMarketing → SalesIncrease`).
- Since sales did not increase, they must not have invested in marketing (`¬InvestMarketing`).
- From premise 3, if they did not invest in marketing, then production costs must have increased (using disjunctive syllogism on `InvestMarketing ∨ ProdCostIncreased` and `¬InvestMarketing`).

Thus, production costs increased is provable from the premises.
