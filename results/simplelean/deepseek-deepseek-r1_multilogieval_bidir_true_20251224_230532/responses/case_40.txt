The reasoning involves proving that James indulged in unhealthy snacks based on the given context and the fact that he was not motivated. The steps are:

1. **Premises**:
   - If James starts a new workout routine, he is motivated: `StartsRoutine → Motivated`
   - If the gym closes, James cannot follow his routine: `GymCloses → CannotFollowRoutine`
   - Either James started a routine, or the gym closed, or both: `StartsRoutine ∨ GymCloses`
   - If James cannot follow his routine, he feels frustrated: `CannotFollowRoutine → Frustrated`
   - If James feels frustrated, he indulges in unhealthy snacks: `Frustrated → Indulge`

2. **Given fact**: James is not motivated (`¬Motivated`).

3. **Proof**:
   - From `¬Motivated` and `StartsRoutine → Motivated`, James did not start a routine (`¬StartsRoutine`).
   - From `¬StartsRoutine` and `StartsRoutine ∨ GymCloses`, the gym must have closed (`GymCloses`).
   - From `GymCloses` and `GymCloses → CannotFollowRoutine`, James cannot follow his routine (`CannotFollowRoutine`).
   - From `CannotFollowRoutine` and `CannotFollowRoutine → Frustrated`, James feels frustrated (`Frustrated`).
   - From `Frustrated` and `Frustrated → Indulge`, James indulges in unhealthy snacks (`Indulge`).

Thus, `Indulge` is provable.
