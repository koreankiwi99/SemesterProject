The reasoning involves proving that if Priya's plants did not grow well, then they wilted and died. The context provides several premises:

1. If Priya waters her plants daily, they grow well.
2. If there is a drought, water restrictions are imposed.
3. Either Priya watered daily, or there was a drought (or both).
4. If water restrictions are imposed, the plants don't get enough water.
5. If the plants lack water, they wilt and die.

Given ¬GrowsWell (plants didn't grow well), we prove WiltAndDie:

- From ¬GrowsWell and premise 1 (WatersDaily → GrowsWell), by contraposition: ¬GrowsWell → ¬WatersDaily. Thus, ¬WatersDaily.
- Premise 3 (WatersDaily ∨ Drought) and ¬WatersDaily imply Drought (by disjunctive syllogism).
- Premise 2 (Drought → Restrictions) and Drought imply Restrictions.
- Premise 4 (Restrictions → ¬EnoughWater) and Restrictions imply ¬EnoughWater.
- Premise 5 (¬EnoughWater → WiltAndDie) and ¬EnoughWater imply WiltAndDie.

Thus, WiltAndDie is provable from the premises and ¬GrowsWell.
