The reasoning context provides information about transit conditions and their implications for commutes, but it does not specify James's mode of transit beyond "he did not take the bus." While the axioms establish that taking the subway or bus leads to being on time, they do not force James to have taken the subway. He might have used another form of transit (e.g., walking, cycling) not covered by the axioms. Thus, we cannot prove he arrived on time.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj
axiom SubwayRunning : Prop
axiom BusHasRoom : Prop
axiom TakeSubway : obj → Prop
axiom TakeBus : obj → Prop
axiom OnTime : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : SubwayRunning → ∃ x, TakeSubway x
axiom A2 : BusHasRoom → ∃ x, TakeBus x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, (TakeSubway x ∨ TakeBus x) → OnTime x
axiom JamesNoBus : ¬ TakeBus James

-- Cannot prove OnTime James: No evidence he took the subway or that other transit modes ensure punctuality.
