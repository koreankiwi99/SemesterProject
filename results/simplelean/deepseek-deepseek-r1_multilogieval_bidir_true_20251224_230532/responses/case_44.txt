The reasoning shows that the garden's failure to thrive follows from the premises and the given fact about Mark. The key steps are:

1. Mark not needing care implies he didn't plant a garden (contrapositive of A1)
2. Since Mark didn't plant a garden, the disjunction (A3) forces there to be a drought
3. Drought implies a watering ban (A2)
4. Watering ban implies Mark's plants don't get enough water (A4)
5. Plants not getting enough water implies garden failure (A5)

Thus, Mark's garden must have failed to thrive.
