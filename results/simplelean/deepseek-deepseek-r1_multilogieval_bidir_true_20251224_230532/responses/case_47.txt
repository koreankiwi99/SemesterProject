The context and statement are translated into Lean by defining the necessary propositions and axioms based on the natural language reasoning. The key elements are:
- `ArrivesOnTime`: The package arrives on time.
- `SpecialOrderInStock`: The office supply store has the special order in stock.
- `CanPickUpMaterials`: Max can pick up the materials he needs.
- `AbleToStart`: Max is able to start the new project (derived from the package arriving on time).
- `StartProject`: Max actually starts the new project.
- `LearnNewSkills`: Max learns new skills.

The premises are:
1. If the package arrives on time, Max is able to start the project (`A1`).
2. If the special order is in stock, Max can pick up the materials (`A2`).
3. The package arrives on time or the special order is in stock (or both) (`A3`).
4. If Max starts the project, he learns new skills (`A4`).

Given: Max was unable to pick up the materials (`T1 : ¬CanPickUpMaterials`).

From `T1` and `A2`, we prove the special order is not in stock (`not_so`). From `A3` and `not_so`, we prove the package arrives on time (`ao`). From `ao` and `A1`, we prove Max is able to start (`able`).

However, **no premise connects `AbleToStart` to `StartProject`**. Being able to start does not guarantee Max actually starts. Since we cannot prove `StartProject`, we cannot prove `LearnNewSkills` via `A4`.

<lean>
axiom ArrivesOnTime : Prop
axiom SpecialOrderInStock : Prop
axiom CanPickUpMaterials : Prop
axiom AbleToStart : Prop
axiom StartProject : Prop
axiom LearnNewSkills : Prop

axiom A1 : ArrivesOnTime → AbleToStart
axiom A2 : SpecialOrderInStock → CanPickUpMaterials
axiom A3 : ArrivesOnTime ∨ SpecialOrderInStock
axiom A4 : StartProject → LearnNewSkills

axiom T1 : ¬CanPickUpMaterials

theorem not_so : ¬SpecialOrderInStock :=
  fun hso : SpecialOrderInStock => T1 (A2 hso)

theorem ao : ArrivesOnTime :=
  Or.elim A3
    (fun ao : ArrivesOnTime => ao)
    (fun so : SpecialOrderInStock => absurd so not_so)

theorem able : AbleToStart := A1 ao

-- Cannot prove StartProject or LearnNewSkills
