The context provides logical relationships, and the question asks whether the sponge was soapy given that it did not rain recently. The reasoning involves deriving contradictions from the premises when combined with the assumption of no rain.

- From "it didn't rain recently" and "if the driveway is wet, then it rained," the driveway cannot be wet.
- The disjunction "driveway wet ∨ no water used ∨ (wet and no water)" simplifies to "driveway wet ∨ no water used" since the third option is redundant. Given the driveway is not wet, water was not used.
- "If someone washed their car, then water was used" implies no car was washed.
- "If the hose is uncoiled, then car washed" implies the hose is not uncoiled.
- Finally, "hose uncoiled ∨ sponge soapy" forces the sponge to be soapy since the hose is not uncoiled.

Thus, the conclusion that the sponge was soapy is provable under the given premises and the assumption of no rain.
