The reasoning can be formalized using predicate logic in Lean. The key steps are:

1. From the context:
   - If someone learns botany, they understand plant needs (∀x, LearnedBotany x → UnderstandNeeds x)
   - If someone understands plant needs, they grow thriving plants (∀x, UnderstandNeeds x → GrowThriving x)
   - Everyone either learns botany or seeks advice (∀x, LearnedBotany x ∨ SoughtAdvice x)

2. Given premise:
   - Mary's plants didn't thrive (¬GrowThriving Mary)

3. Logical deduction:
   - If Mary had learned botany, she would have thriving plants (chain: botany → understand → thrive)
   - But her plants didn't thrive, so she didn't learn botany
   - Therefore, by the disjunction, she must have sought advice
