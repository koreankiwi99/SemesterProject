The reasoning is based on the given context and the premise that Jesse's running form and stamina did not improve. The key steps are:

1. From the disjunction: Jesse either sprinted frequently (S) or took stretching classes (T) (or both).
2. If Jesse sprinted frequently (S), then running form and stamina would improve (R) - but we know R is false. Therefore, S must be false (modus tollens).
3. Since S is false, by disjunctive syllogism, T must be true (from S ∨ T).
4. If T is true (Jesse took stretching classes), then they became more flexible and less prone to injury (F).

Thus, Jesse became more flexible and less prone to injury.
