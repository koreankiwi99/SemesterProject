The given context and premises do not allow us to prove that James not bringing an umbrella entails that he and his friends go out to play. Here's the formalization and reasoning in Lean:

<lean>
axiom ForecastRain : Prop
axiom BigGame : Prop
axiom GetTogether : Prop
axiom HighViewership : Prop
axiom GoOutToPlay : Prop
axiom GoesOutJames : Prop
axiom BringsUmbrellaJames : Prop

-- If forecast predicts rain, people bring umbrellas when going out
axiom UmbrellaRule : ForecastRain → (GoesOutJames → BringsUmbrellaJames)
-- If big game on TV, friends get together to watch
axiom GameRule : BigGame → GetTogether
-- ForecastRain ∨ ¬GetTogether (from disjunction simplification)
axiom Disjunction : ForecastRain ∨ ¬GetTogether
-- High viewership implies big game
axiom ViewershipRule : HighViewership → BigGame
-- HighViewership ∨ GoOutToPlay (from disjunction simplification)
axiom ActivityDisjunction : HighViewership ∨ GoOutToPlay
-- If they go out to play, James goes out
axiom PlayOutRule : GoOutToPlay → GoesOutJames

-- We cannot prove ¬BringsUmbrellaJames → GoOutToPlay
-- Countermodel exists where:
--   HighViewership = true, BigGame = true, GetTogether = true
--   ForecastRain = true, GoOutToPlay = false
--   GoesOutJames = false, BringsUmbrellaJames = false
-- All axioms hold but GoOutToPlay is false
</lean>

**Reasoning**:  
The premises show that when James doesn't bring an umbrella, it could be due to either no rain forecast or James not going out. In a scenario where there's high viewership (implying a big game and friends gathering), rain is forecast, but James doesn't go out, he wouldn't bring an umbrella. This scenario satisfies all premises without requiring them to go out to play. Thus, the lack of umbrella doesn't force the group to go out.

ANSWER: Failure
