The reasoning involves proving that Mary learned new methods and mediums for creating art given the premises and the fact that her artwork did not stand out as high quality. The key steps are:

1. From the premise "if their technique improved, their artwork would stand out as high quality" and the given fact that Mary's artwork did not stand out, we conclude her technique did not improve (using contraposition of A2).
2. From the premise "if they practiced their skills often, their technique would improve" and the lack of technique improvement, we conclude Mary did not practice often (contraposition of A1).
3. The premise states Mary either practiced often, took an art class, or both. Since she did not practice often, she must have taken an art class (disjunctive syllogism on A3).
4. The premise "if someone takes an art class, they learn new methods" directly implies Mary learned new methods (A4).

Thus, the conclusion follows from the premises.
