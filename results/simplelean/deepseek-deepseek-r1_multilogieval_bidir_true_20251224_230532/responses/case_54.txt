ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to the use of `constant` and `premise` keywords, which are not valid in Lean 4 for this context. The corrected code uses `axiom` for all declarations and properly structures the theorems. The analysis shows that while we can prove the team played their rival (since they didn't score early), there is no logical connection between playing the rival and booing. Since the only path to booing (via crowd being pumped up) is blocked, we cannot prove there was a lot of booing.
