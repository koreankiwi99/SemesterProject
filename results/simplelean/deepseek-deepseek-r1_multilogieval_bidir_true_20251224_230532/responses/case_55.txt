The reasoning follows from the premises. Here's the Lean proof:

<lean>
axiom GoodReviews : Prop
axiom ManyPeople : Prop
axiom BigStar : Prop
axiom Sequel : Prop

axiom P1 : GoodReviews → ManyPeople
axiom P3 : GoodReviews ∨ ¬ManyPeople ∨ (GoodReviews ∧ ¬ManyPeople)
axiom P4 : BigStar → GoodReviews
axiom P5 : BigStar ∨ Sequel

theorem low_attendance_implies_sequel : ¬ManyPeople → Sequel := 
  fun hLow : ¬ManyPeople => 
    by
      cases P3
      . -- Case 1: GoodReviews
        exact False.elim (hLow (P1 ‹GoodReviews›))
      . -- Case 2: Either ¬ManyPeople or (GoodReviews ∧ ¬ManyPeople)
        cases ‹_›
        . -- Subcase 2.1: ¬ManyPeople
          have not_GoodReviews : ¬GoodReviews := 
            fun hGr => hLow (P1 hGr)
          have not_BigStar : ¬BigStar := 
            fun hStar => not_GoodReviews (P4 hStar)
          cases P5
          . -- BigStar leads to contradiction
            exact False.elim (not_BigStar ‹BigStar›)
          . -- Sequel directly holds
            assumption
        . -- Subcase 2.2: GoodReviews ∧ ¬ManyPeople
          rcases ‹GoodReviews ∧ ¬ManyPeople› with ⟨hGr, hNotMany⟩
          exact False.elim (hNotMany (P1 hGr))
</lean>

ANSWER: True
