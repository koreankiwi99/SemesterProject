The reasoning involves translating the given context into logical axioms and proving whether John's favorite cereal being sold out follows from the premises and the fact that John did not buy more items.

**Premises:**
1. If the store has a sale, people buy more items: `S → BuyMore`
2. If someone goes grocery shopping, they get everything on their list: `Go → GetEverything`
3. Either sale, or not getting everything, or both: `S ∨ ¬GetEverything` (simplified from the original disjunction)
4. If beginning of the month, people go shopping: `B → Go`
5. Beginning of month or cereal sold out (or both): `B ∨ SoldOut`

**Given:** John did not buy more items (`¬BuyMore`)

**Proof:**
- From `¬BuyMore` and premise 1 (`S → BuyMore`), we get `¬S` (by modus tollens).
- From `¬S` and premise 3 (`S ∨ ¬GetEverything`), we get `¬GetEverything` (disjunction elimination).
- From `¬GetEverything` and premise 2 (`Go → GetEverything`), we get `¬Go` (modus tollens).
- From `¬Go` and premise 4 (`B → Go`), we get `¬B` (modus tollens).
- From `¬B` and premise 5 (`B ∨ SoldOut`), we get `SoldOut` (disjunction elimination).

Thus, John's favorite cereal being sold out (`SoldOut`) is proven.
