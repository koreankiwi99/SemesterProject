The context establishes that heavy rainfall occurred in a city, leading authorities to recognize implications: excessive rain causes reservoirs and dams to overflow, and reservoir overflow causes flooding. However, the statement to evaluate specifically mentions heavy rainfall in Dallas. While the context links excessive rain to reservoir overflow and flooding, it does not explicitly state that heavy rainfall implies excessive rain. Thus, without an axiom connecting `HeavyRainfall` to `ExcessiveRain`, we cannot prove flooding occurs in Dallas based solely on the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Dallas : obj
axiom HeavyRainfall : obj → Prop
axiom ExcessiveRain : obj → Prop
axiom ReservoirOverflow : obj → Prop
axiom Flooding : obj → Prop

axiom heavy_rain_dallas : HeavyRainfall Dallas
axiom excessive_rain_overflow : ∀ x : obj, ExcessiveRain x → ReservoirOverflow x
axiom overflow_flooding : ∀ x : obj, ReservoirOverflow x → Flooding x

-- Missing: No axiom linking HeavyRainfall to ExcessiveRain (e.g., ∀ x, HeavyRainfall x → ExcessiveRain x)
-- Therefore, Flooding Dallas cannot be proven.
