The reasoning involves analyzing the given premises and the conclusion. The context states that for any student, if they attend lectures regularly, then if they study diligently, they will excel in the course. Formally, this is:  
∀x, Attend x → (Study x → Excel x)  

We are given two facts about Priya:  
1. Priya studied diligently (Study Priya).  
2. Priya did not excel in the course (¬Excel Priya).  

The question asks whether Priya attended lectures regularly (Attend Priya).  

To determine if we can prove Attend Priya:  
- Suppose Attend Priya holds.  
- By the context axiom, this implies Study Priya → Excel Priya.  
- Since Study Priya is true, this would require Excel Priya.  
- However, ¬Excel Priya is given, leading to a contradiction.  
- Therefore, the assumption Attend Priya must be false, meaning ¬Attend Priya is provable.  

However, the conclusion we are asked to prove is Attend Priya (the positive statement). Since the premises imply ¬Attend Priya, we cannot prove Attend Priya.  

Lean code formalization:  
<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Priya : obj
axiom Attend : obj → Prop
axiom Study : obj → Prop
axiom Excel : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : Study Priya
axiom T2 : ¬ Excel Priya
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Attend x → (Study x → Excel x)

-- We cannot prove `Attend Priya` from the axioms.
-- In fact, we can prove `¬ Attend Priya` (not required here):
--   `theorem not_attend : ¬ Attend Priya := fun h => T2 (R1 Priya h T1)`
-- But the goal is to prove `Attend Priya`, which is impossible.
