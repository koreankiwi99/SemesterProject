The reasoning problem involves deriving whether Mark introduced himself to classmates given that he did not enjoy the first day of school. The premises are:

1. If someone made friends, they enjoy school: `∀ x, MadeFriends x → EnjoySchool x`
2. If someone joins a club, they are busy: `∀ x, JoinsClub x → Busy x`
3. Either someone made friends or they are not busy: `∀ x, MadeFriends x ∨ ¬ Busy x`
4. If someone is outgoing, they join a club: `∀ x, Outgoing x → JoinsClub x`
5. If someone introduced themselves, they are outgoing: `∀ x, Introduced x → Outgoing x`

To prove: `¬ EnjoySchool Mark → Introduced Mark`

After analysis:
- Assume `¬ EnjoySchool Mark`.
- From premise 1, by contraposition: `¬ EnjoySchool x → ¬ MadeFriends x`, so `¬ MadeFriends Mark`.
- Premise 3 for Mark: `MadeFriends Mark ∨ ¬ Busy Mark`. Since `¬ MadeFriends Mark`, we get `¬ Busy Mark`.
- Premise 2 by contraposition: `¬ Busy x → ¬ JoinsClub x`, so `¬ JoinsClub Mark`.
- Premise 4 by contraposition: `¬ JoinsClub x → ¬ Outgoing x`, so `¬ Outgoing Mark`.
- Premise 5 by contraposition: `¬ Outgoing x → ¬ Introduced x`, so `¬ Introduced Mark`.

Thus, `¬ EnjoySchool Mark` implies `¬ Introduced Mark`, which contradicts the required conclusion `Introduced Mark`. Since the premises lead to the negation of the conclusion, the original implication cannot be proven.

    contradiction

    fun outgoing => not_joins_club (A4 Mark outgoing)
  have not_introduced : ¬ Introduced Mark :=
    fun intro => not_outgoing (A5 Mark intro)
  -- Now we have ¬Introduced Mark, but need Introduced Mark → contradiction
  -- We cannot derive Introduced Mark from the context
  -- The goal is Introduced Mark, which is not provable under the assumption ¬EnjoySchool Mark
  -- Therefore, we cannot complete the proof.
  -- Since we cannot prove Introduced Mark from ¬EnjoySchool Mark and the axioms, we fail.
  -- Note: `contradiction` would require a direct contradiction, which we don't have.
  -- Instead, we have not_introduced and the goal Introduced Mark, but no contradiction in the premises.
