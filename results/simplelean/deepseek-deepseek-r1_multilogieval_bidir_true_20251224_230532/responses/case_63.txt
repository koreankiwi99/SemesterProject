The context states that if someone plants disease-resistant varieties and waters and feeds properly, they will have a bountiful harvest. Linda watered and fed properly but did not have a bountiful harvest. Therefore, Linda must not have planted disease-resistant varieties, as this is the only way to avoid a contradiction with the given context.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Linda : obj
axiom PlantsDiseaseResistant : obj → Prop
axiom WatersAndFeedsProperly : obj → Prop
axiom BountifulHarvest : obj → Prop
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, PlantsDiseaseResistant x → WatersAndFeedsProperly x → BountifulHarvest x
axiom T1 : WatersAndFeedsProperly Linda
axiom T2 : ¬ BountifulHarvest Linda
theorem linda_not_plant : ¬ PlantsDiseaseResistant Linda :=
  fun h : PlantsDiseaseResistant Linda =>
