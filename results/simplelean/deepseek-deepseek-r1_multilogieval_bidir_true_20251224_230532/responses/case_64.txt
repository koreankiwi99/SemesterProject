The context states a general rule: if a student attends lectures regularly, then sufficient revision leads to good exam performance. The facts are: Priya revised sufficiently but did not perform well. We need to determine if Priya attended lectures regularly.

Using the general rule:  
- Let `A` = "Attends lectures regularly"  
- `B` = "Spends sufficient time revising"  
- `C` = "Performs well on exams"  
The rule is: `∀ s, A s → (B s → C s)`  

For Priya:  
- `B Priya` is true (sufficient revision)  
- `C Priya` is false (did not perform well)  

If `A Priya` were true, then by the rule, `B Priya → C Priya`. Since `B Priya` is true, this would imply `C Priya`, which contradicts the fact that `¬C Priya`. Therefore, `A Priya` must be false.  

We can prove that Priya did **not** attend lectures regularly (`¬AttendsRegularly Priya`).

axiom Student : Type
axiom Priya : Student
axiom AttendsRegularly : Student → Prop
axiom SpendsSufficientTime : Student → Prop
axiom PerformsWell : Student → Prop
axiom R1 : ∀ s : Student, AttendsRegularly s → (SpendsSufficientTime s → PerformsWell s)
axiom T1 : SpendsSufficientTime Priya
axiom T2 : ¬ PerformsWell Priya

theorem Priya_not_attend : ¬ AttendsRegularly Priya :=
  fun hA : AttendsRegularly Priya =>
    have H : SpendsSufficientTime Priya → PerformsWell Priya := R1 Priya hA
    have H2 : PerformsWell Priya := H T1
    show False from T2 H2

ANSWER: True
