The reasoning involves proving that the wood used was not of high quality based on the given premises. The context states that if the wood is of high quality and the joints are cut precisely, then the finished product will be sturdy and long-lasting. However, the bookshelf was shaky (not sturdy) and fell apart quickly (not long-lasting), despite the joints being cut precisely. This contradiction implies that the wood could not have been of high quality.
