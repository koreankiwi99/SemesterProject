The reasoning involves proving that Acme Inc. did not develop an innovative product based on the given premises. The general rule states that if a company develops an innovative product and markets it effectively, the product will be commercially successful. For Acme's gadget, we know it was marketed effectively but not commercially successful. Therefore, by contraposition of the rule, Acme's gadget cannot be innovative.

<lean>
axiom Product : Type
axiom acme_gadget : Product
axiom innovative : Product → Prop
axiom marketed_effectively : Product → Prop
axiom successful : Product → Prop
axiom rule : ∀ p : Product, innovative p → marketed_effectively p → successful p
axiom T1 : marketed_effectively acme_gadget
axiom T2 : ¬ successful acme_gadget

theorem not_innovative : ¬ innovative acme_gadget :=
  fun h : innovative acme_gadget =>
    have H_success : successful acme_gadget := rule acme_gadget h T1
    show False from T2 H_success
</lean>

The proof shows that assuming Acme's gadget is innovative leads to a contradiction with the fact that it was not successful, given effective marketing. Thus, the conclusion that Acme did not develop an innovative product is proven.
