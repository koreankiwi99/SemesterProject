The context states a general belief: if a student studies hard, then getting enough sleep before an exam implies they will ace it. The given facts are: Emma got enough sleep but did not ace her biology exam. The question is whether Emma studied hard.

To prove that Emma did not study hard:
1. Assume Emma studied hard (for contradiction).
2. By the belief, if Emma studied hard and got enough sleep, she should have aced the exam.
3. However, Emma did not ace the exam, contradicting the assumption.
4. Therefore, the assumption is false; Emma did not study hard.

This is a valid application of modus tollens on the contrapositive of the belief.

<lean>
variable Student : Type
variable Exam : Type
variable Emma : Student
variable biology_exam : Exam
variable StudyHard : Student → Exam → Prop
variable EnoughSleep : Student → Exam → Prop
variable AceTest : Student → Exam → Prop

axiom belief : ∀ (s : Student) (e : Exam), StudyHard s e → EnoughSleep s e → AceTest s e
axiom sleep_fact : EnoughSleep Emma biology_exam
axiom not_ace_fact : ¬ AceTest Emma biology_exam

theorem emma_did_not_study_hard : ¬ StudyHard Emma biology_exam := by
  intro assume_study_hard
  have : AceTest Emma biology_exam := belief Emma biology_exam assume_study_hard sleep_fact
  exact not_ace_fact this

After analyzing the compilation errors, I identified the main issues:
1. Missing declarations for foundational types and constants
2. The `variable` keyword requires proper scoping (section/namespace) but wasn't used correctly
3. Function application syntax was misinterpreted

Here's the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom Student : Type
axiom Exam : Type
axiom Emma : Student
axiom biology_exam : Exam
axiom StudyHard : Student → Exam → Prop
axiom EnoughSleep : Student → Exam → Prop
axiom AceTest : Student → Exam → Prop

axiom belief : ∀ (s : Student) (e : Exam), StudyHard s e → EnoughSleep s e → AceTest s e
axiom sleep_fact : EnoughSleep Emma biology_exam
axiom not_ace_fact : ¬ AceTest Emma biology_exam

theorem emma_did_not_study_hard : ¬ StudyHard Emma biology_exam := by
  intro h_study
  apply not_ace_fact
  exact belief Emma biology_exam h_study sleep_fact
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**
1. We declare all necessary types, constants, and predicates as axioms
2. The theorem assumes Emma studied hard (`h_study`)
3. Applying the belief to `h_study` and `sleep_fact` proves Emma should have aced the exam
4. This contradicts `not_ace_fact`, proving the negation

The logical structure is valid modus tollens:
- Belief: StudyHard → (EnoughSleep → AceTest)
- Given: EnoughSleep ∧ ¬AceTest
- Therefore: ¬StudyHard

ANSWER: True
