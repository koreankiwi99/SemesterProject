The reasoning involves the coaches' axiom and Lebron's specific situation. The coaches preach that for any player, if they train hard and remain focused, they will perform to their best ability. However, Lebron remained focused but did not perform to his best ability. This implies that the condition of training hard must be false for Lebron, as otherwise, his focused state would have led to best performance (contradicting the given fact). Therefore, it follows that Lebron did not train hard.
