The gardener enriched the soil, and the context provides that the plants grew strong (healthy) and produced lots of vegetables (abundant harvest). The rule "if plants are healthy, they yield bigger harvests" connects healthy plants to abundant harvest. Since the plants were healthy (A5), the harvest must be abundant (A4). Therefore, the conclusion is provable.
