The reasoning involves modus tollens and implication. The context states that properly planted seeds with adequate conditions lead to growth. Farmer Joe had adequate conditions but no growth, so he must not have planted properly.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom FarmerJoe : obj
axiom PlantsProperly : obj → Prop
axiom AdequateSunWater : obj → Prop
axiom GrowsLargePlentiful : obj → Prop
axiom Context : ∀ x : obj, PlantsProperly x → (AdequateSunWater x → GrowsLargePlentiful x)
axiom A2 : AdequateSunWater FarmerJoe
axiom A3 : ¬ GrowsLargePlentiful FarmerJoe

theorem not_planted_properly : ¬ PlantsProperly FarmerJoe :=
  fun h : PlantsProperly FarmerJoe =>
  have growth : GrowsLargePlentiful FarmerJoe := Context FarmerJoe h A2
  show False from A3 growth
</lean>

ANSWER: True
