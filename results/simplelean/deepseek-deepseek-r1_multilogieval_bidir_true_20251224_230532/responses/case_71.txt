The context states that it was a sunny day, establishing `Sunny` as a premise. The conclusion is a conditional: "If Alex got sunburnt, then was the weather sunny?" Since `Sunny` is true regardless of Alex's sunburn status, the implication `GetBurnt alex → Sunny` holds because the consequent `Sunny` is always true. This is proven in Lean by ignoring the antecedent and directly using the axiom `A1` (which asserts `Sunny`).

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom alex : Person
axiom Sunny : Prop
axiom WarmPool : Prop
axiom ApplySunscreen : Person → Prop
axiom GetBurnt : Person → Prop
axiom GoSwimming : Person → Prop
axiom Exercise : Person → Prop
axiom A1 : Sunny
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person), ApplySunscreen p → ¬ GetBurnt p
axiom A3 : ∀ (p : Person), GoSwimming p → Exercise p
axiom A4 : ∀ (p : Person), ApplySunscreen p ∨ ¬ Exercise p
axiom A5 : WarmPool → ∀ (p : Person), GoSwimming p
axiom A6 : Sunny → WarmPool

theorem sunburn_implies_sunny : GetBurnt alex → Sunny :=
  fun _ => A1
