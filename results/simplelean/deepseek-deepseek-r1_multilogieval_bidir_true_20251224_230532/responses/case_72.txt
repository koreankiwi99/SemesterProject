The context and premises do not provide sufficient information to conclude that if Sam starts cooking, then the pantry is empty. Here's the Lean formalization and reasoning:

<lean>
axiom CloseToDinner : Prop
axiom StartCooking : Prop
axiom GoShopping : Prop
axiom MakeDinner : Prop
axiom FridgeEmpty : Prop
axiom PantryEmpty : Prop

axiom P1 : CloseToDinner → StartCooking
axiom P2 : GoShopping → MakeDinner
axiom P3 : CloseToDinner ∨ ¬MakeDinner
axiom P4 : FridgeEmpty → GoShopping
axiom P5 : PantryEmpty → FridgeEmpty

-- We attempt to prove: StartCooking → PantryEmpty
theorem target : StartCooking → PantryEmpty :=
  fun hSC : StartCooking =>
  -- We need to show PantryEmpty. Possible paths:
  -- 1. PantryEmpty → FridgeEmpty (P5) → GoShopping (P4) → MakeDinner (P2)
  -- 2. StartCooking comes from CloseToDinner (P1), but P3 gives a disjunction:
  --    Case 1: CloseToDinner holds. No link to PantryEmpty.
  --    Case 2: ¬MakeDinner holds. Then ¬MakeDinner → ¬GoShopping (contra P2) → ¬FridgeEmpty (contra P4) → ¬PantryEmpty (contra P5).
  -- In the case where CloseToDinner is true (consistent with StartCooking via P1),
  -- PantryEmpty might be false without contradiction. Example:
  --   Let CloseToDinner = true, StartCooking = true (from P1).
  --   Let PantryEmpty = false, then FridgeEmpty could be false (P5 holds as false → false).
  --   Then GoShopping could be false (P4 holds as false → false).
  --   MakeDinner could be false (P2 holds as false → false).
  --   P3 holds: CloseToDinner ∨ ¬MakeDinner = true ∨ true = true.
  -- All axioms hold, but PantryEmpty is false while StartCooking is true.
  -- Hence, we cannot prove StartCooking → PantryEmpty.

    -- No proof found; tactics would fail to close the goal.
    sorry -- Signifies unprovable in Lean
