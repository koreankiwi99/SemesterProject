The reasoning follows from the given premises. By assuming James planned his schedule well, we derive that he must be going to the party, contradicting the fact that he is not. Thus, the assumption must be false, proving James did not plan his schedule well.

axiom A3 : Friday ∨ (∀ s, Student s → ¬ watch_game s)
axiom A4 : ∀ s, Student s → study_everyday s → finish_homework s
axiom A5 : ∀ s, Student s → plan_schedule_well s → study_everyday s
