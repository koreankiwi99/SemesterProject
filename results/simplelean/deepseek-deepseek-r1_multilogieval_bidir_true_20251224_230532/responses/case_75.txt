The context states that if preventive maintenance is done and quality parts are used, then the car will have a long service life. Given that quality parts were used in Liz's car but it did not have a long service life, we can conclude that preventive maintenance was not done. This is proven by contradiction in Lean.

<lean>
axiom Car : Type
axiom lizCar : Car
axiom PM : Car → Prop
axiom QP : Car → Prop
axiom LL : Car → Prop
axiom mechanics : ∀ c : Car, PM c → QP c → LL c
axiom QP_liz : QP lizCar
axiom not_LL_liz : ¬ LL lizCar

theorem no_PM : ¬ PM lizCar := by
  intro h
  have LL_liz : LL lizCar := mechanics lizCar h QP_liz
  exact not_LL_liz LL_liz
</lean>

ANSWER: True
