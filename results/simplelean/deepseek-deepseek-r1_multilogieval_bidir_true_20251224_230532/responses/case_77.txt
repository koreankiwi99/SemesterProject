The textual context provides several premises about a generic individual and then asks about a specific individual, James. The goal is to determine if the statement "If James did not play well, then he was a top player in youth leagues" follows logically from the premises. 

The premises are:
1. If someone practices hard, they play well: `∀x, P x → W x`
2. If someone is picked to start, they are talented: `∀x, S x → T x`
3. Either someone practices hard or they are not talented: `∀x, P x ∨ ¬T x`
4. If someone has natural ability, they get picked to start: `∀x, N x → S x`
5. If someone was a top youth player, they have natural ability: `∀x, Y x → N x`

The conclusion is: `¬W James → Y James`

**Analysis**:
- Assume `¬W James` (James did not play well).
- From premise 1, by contraposition: `¬W x → ¬P x`, so `¬P James`.
- From premise 3: `P James ∨ ¬T James`. Since `¬P James`, we have `¬T James`.
- From premise 2, by contraposition: `¬T x → ¬S x`, so `¬S James`.
- From premise 4, by contraposition: `¬S x → ¬N x`, so `¬N James`.
- From premise 5, by contraposition: `¬N x → ¬Y x`, so `¬Y James`.

This shows `¬W James` leads to `¬Y James`, which contradicts the consequent `Y James` in the conclusion. Thus, the implication `¬W James → Y James` **cannot be proven** from the premises.

axiom A5 : ∀ x, Y x → N x

-- The theorem ¬W James → Y James cannot be proven.
-- Proof attempt fails because ¬W James leads to ¬Y James.
