The context states a conditional rule for novelists: if a writer develops compelling characters and crafts an intriguing plot, their book connects with readers. The given statements are that Lauren crafted an intriguing plot but her book did not connect with readers. The question is whether Lauren developed compelling characters.

Using logical reasoning:
- Let \(D(w)\): writer \(w\) develops compelling characters.
- Let \(P(w)\): writer \(w\) crafts an intriguing plot.
- Let \(C(w)\): \(w\)'s book connects with readers.
- The context rule: \(\forall w, (D(w) \to (P(w) \to C(w)))\), which is equivalent to \(\forall w, (D(w) \land P(w)) \to C(w)\).
- For Lauren: \(P(\text{Lauren})\) is true, \(C(\text{Lauren})\) is false.
- If \(D(\text{Lauren})\) were true, then \((D(\text{Lauren}) \land P(\text{Lauren})) \to C(\text{Lauren})\) would imply \(C(\text{Lauren})\), contradicting \(¬C(\text{Lauren})\).
- Therefore, \(D(\text{Lauren})\) must be false.

Lean formalization proves \(¬D(\text{Lauren})\):

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Lauren : obj
axiom DevelopsCompelling : obj → Prop
axiom CraftsIntriguingPlot : obj → Prop
axiom ConnectsWithReaders : obj → Prop

-- General rule: if a writer develops compelling characters and crafts an intriguing plot, the book connects.
axiom R1 : ∀ w : obj, DevelopsCompelling w → CraftsIntriguingPlot w → ConnectsWithReaders w

-- Given facts about Lauren
axiom T1 : CraftsIntriguingPlot Lauren
axiom T2 : ¬ ConnectsWithReaders Lauren

-- Proof that Lauren did not develop compelling characters
theorem not_develops : ¬ DevelopsCompelling Lauren := by
  intro h_develop  -- Assume Lauren develops compelling characters
  have h_connect : ConnectsWithReaders Lauren := R1 Lauren h_develop T1
  exact T2 h_connect  -- Contradiction with T2
</lean>

The proof shows \(¬D(\text{Lauren})\) follows from the premises.

ANSWER: True
