ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After analyzing the context and attempting to prove the statement, I realize the initial approach was incorrect. The goal is to prove "If John's muscles are not sore today, then it rained" (¬SoreToday John → Raining). However, from the premises, we can actually derive the opposite implication: ¬SoreToday John leads to ¬Raining. Specifically:

1. If John isn't sore today, he didn't work out hard (since hard work causes soreness)
2. Since he either worked hard or his muscles didn't relax, his muscles must not have relaxed
3. If his muscles didn't relax, he didn't take a hot shower (since showers cause relaxation)
4. If he didn't take a shower, the weather wasn't cold (since cold weather causes showers)
5. If the weather wasn't cold, it didn't rain (since rain causes cold weather)

This shows ¬SoreToday John → ¬Raining, which contradicts the desired conclusion. Therefore, the original statement cannot be proven from the given premises.

Here's the corrected Lean code representing the context and the failed proof attempt:
