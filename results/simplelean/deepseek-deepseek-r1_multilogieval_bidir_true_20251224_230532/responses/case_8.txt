The context states that chefs know that using fresh ingredients makes the food delicious. It also states that if a chef cooks a complicated recipe, preparation takes more time. Critically, the context explicitly states that the chef used fresh ingredients. Since fresh ingredients guarantee delicious food (according to the chefs' knowledge), the food must taste delicious regardless of whether a complicated recipe was cooked. Therefore, even if the chef cooked a complicated recipe, the food still tasted delicious.

ANSWER: True

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to an incorrect axiom for R2. The original code had `(obj → Prop)` as the conclusion, which is a type, not a proposition. The context "if they cook a complicated recipe, it takes more time to prepare" requires introducing a new predicate `TakesMoreTime` to properly represent the time aspect. The proof remains valid since the conclusion depends only on the chef using fresh ingredients (T1) and the relationship between fresh ingredients and delicious food (R1), regardless of recipe complexity.
