axiom R : Prop  -- it rains today
axiom S : Prop  -- softball team has game
axiom P : Prop  -- swimming pool is open
axiom K : Prop  -- kids go for swim
axiom E : Prop  -- players enjoy playing
axiom M : Prop  -- players have smiles

-- Axioms from context
axiom A1 : ¬R → S
axiom A2 : P → K
axiom A3 : ¬R ∨ P
axiom A4 : S → E
axiom A5 : E → M

-- Theorem: If kids didn't swim, players had smiles (¬K → M)
theorem players_smile_if_no_swim : ¬K → M := by
  intro hNK  -- Assume ¬K (kids didn't swim)
  have hNP : ¬P := by  -- Prove pool not open (contrapositive of A2)
    intro hP
    have hK : K := A2 hP
    contradiction
  cases A3 with  -- Case analysis on ¬R ∨ P
  | inl hNR =>  -- Case 1: ¬R
    have hS : S := A1 hNR
    have hE : E := A4 hS
    exact A5 hE
  | inr hP =>  -- Case 2: P
    contradiction  -- Contradicts hNP
