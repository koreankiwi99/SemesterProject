ITERATION 3

The compilation errors occurred due to the use of `cases'` which is not a valid tactic in Lean 4. Additionally, `mt` is not a tactic but a function, and its usage in tactic mode was incorrect. The corrected proof uses explicit case handling with `cases` and manually resolves contradictions.

Here's the corrected Lean 4 code:

axiom obj : Type
axiom Amy : obj
axiom practiced_chords : obj → Prop
axiom develop_muscle_memory : obj → Prop
axiom play_simple_songs : obj → Prop
axiom learning_music_theory : obj → Prop
axiom knowledge_song_structure : obj → Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ p : obj, practiced_chords p → develop_muscle_memory p
axiom R2 : ∀ p : obj, develop_muscle_memory p → play_simple_songs p
axiom R3 : ∀ p : obj, practiced_chords p ∨ learning_music_theory p
axiom R4 : ∀ p : obj, learning_music_theory p → knowledge_song_structure p

theorem answer : ¬play_simple_songs Amy → knowledge_song_structure Amy := by
  intro h  -- Assume Amy cannot play simple songs
  have no_memory : ¬develop_muscle_memory Amy := 
    fun hm => h (R2 Amy hm)  -- Contrapositive of R2
  have no_practice : ¬practiced_chords Amy := 
    fun hp => no_memory (R1 Amy hp)  -- Contrapositive of R1
  cases R3 Amy with  -- Case split on practice/theory disjunction
  | inl hp => exact False.elim (no_practice hp)  -- Contradiction: practice but not practicing
  | inr hl => exact R4 Amy hl  -- Directly get song structure knowledge
</lean>

ANSWER: True

**Explanation of proof:**
1. We assume Amy cannot play simple songs (`¬play_simple_songs Amy`)
2. Using contrapositives on rules R2 and R1, we derive:
   - Amy has not developed muscle memory (`no_memory`)
   - Amy does not practice chords (`no_practice`)
3. By axiom R3, Amy either practices chords or learns music theory
4. In the left branch (practice chords):
   - We get a contradiction between `hp` (she practices) and `no_practice` (she doesn't practice)
   - `False.elim` resolves this by proving anything (including our goal)
5. In the right branch (learns theory):
   - R4 directly gives our conclusion: knowledge of song structure

The conclusion follows validly from the premises.
