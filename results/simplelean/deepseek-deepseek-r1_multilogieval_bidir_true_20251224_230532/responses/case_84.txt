The reasoning involves proving that if Sarah did not release an album, her creativity flourished, based on the given context. The key steps are:

1. **Premises**:
   - Practicing melodies daily (P) expands repertoire (R): ∀x, P x → R x
   - More material (R) enables composing an album (A): ∀x, R x → A x
   - Thus, practicing implies composing an album: ∀x, P x → A x
   - Sarah either practiced (P), jammed with friends (J), or both: P Sarah ∨ J Sarah
   - Jamming inspires (I): ∀x, J x → I x
   - Inspiration boosts creativity (F): ∀x, I x → F x

2. **Proof of ¬A Sarah → F Sarah**:
   - Assume Sarah did not release an album (¬A Sarah).
   - If she practiced (P Sarah), she would have released an album (A Sarah), contradicting ¬A Sarah. Thus, ¬P Sarah.
   - Since ¬P Sarah and P Sarah ∨ J Sarah, she must have jammed (J Sarah).
   - Jamming leads to inspiration (I Sarah) and then creativity flourishing (F Sarah).

Therefore, the conclusion follows from the premises.
