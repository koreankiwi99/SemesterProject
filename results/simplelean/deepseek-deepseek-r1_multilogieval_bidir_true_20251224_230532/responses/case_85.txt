The context does not define "soil high quality" explicitly, nor is there a direct link between the absence of bees/butterflies and soil quality being high. While we can derive that John's soil quality improves (due to organic fertilizer usage), this does not entail "high quality" without additional axioms. The conclusion cannot be proven from the given premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom John : obj
axiom WaterAdequately : obj → Prop
axiom BloomBrightly : obj → Prop
axiom AttractBeesButterflies : obj → Prop
axiom UseOrganicFertilizers : obj → Prop
axiom SoilQualityImproves : obj → Prop
axiom GrowHealthier : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, WaterAdequately x → BloomBrightly x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, BloomBrightly x → AttractBeesButterflies x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, WaterAdequately x ∨ UseOrganicFertilizers x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, UseOrganicFertilizers x → SoilQualityImproves x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, SoilQualityImproves x → GrowHealthier x
axiom John_premise : ¬ AttractBeesButterflies John

-- Prove John doesn't water adequately
theorem John_no_water : ¬ WaterAdequately John := by
  intro h
  have bloom : BloomBrightly John := A1 John h
  have attract : AttractBeesButterflies John := A2 John bloom
  exact John_premise attract

-- Prove John uses organic fertilizers
theorem John_organic : UseOrganicFertilizers John := by
  have disj : WaterAdequately John ∨ UseOrganicFertilizers John := A3 John
  cases disj with
  | inl water => exact False.elim (John_no_water water)
  | inr org => exact org

-- Prove John's soil quality improves
theorem John_soil_improves : SoilQualityImproves John := A4 John John_organic

-- But "soil high quality" is undefined and cannot be proven
