The context provides premises about office events, but the reasoning does not allow us to conclude that John had a productive afternoon from the fact that he did not bring treats. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Premises**:
   - If someone finishes their project early, they take a long lunch (`∀p, ProjectDoneEarly p → TakeLongLunch p`).
   - If it's a birthday, everyone brings treats (`∀p, Birthday → BringTreats p`).
   - Either at least one person finishes a project early, or it's a birthday, or both (`(∃p, ProjectDoneEarly p) ∨ Birthday`).
   - Taking a long lunch leads to feeling recharged (`∀p, TakeLongLunch p → Recharged p`).
   - Feeling recharged leads to a productive afternoon (`∀p, Recharged p → ProductiveAfternoon p`).

2. **Given**: John did not bring treats (`¬BringTreats John`).

3. **From `¬BringTreats John` and `∀p, Birthday → BringTreats p`**:
   - We deduce `¬Birthday` (if it were a birthday, John would bring treats).

4. **From `¬Birthday` and `(∃p, ProjectDoneEarly p) ∨ Birthday`**:
   - We deduce `∃p, ProjectDoneEarly p` (there exists at least one person who finished early).

5. **Problem**: The existence of some person finishing early does not imply that *John* finished early. Without knowing John finished early, we cannot prove he took a long lunch, got recharged, or had a productive afternoon.

Thus, we cannot prove that John had a productive afternoon.
