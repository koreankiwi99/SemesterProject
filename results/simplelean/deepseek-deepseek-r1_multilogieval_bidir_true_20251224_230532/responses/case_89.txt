The reasoning involves proving that if it is monsoon season, the farmer will make a good profit selling his crops. The premises are:

1. If the farmer waters his crops, they grow healthy and strong.
2. If it is monsoon season, there are heavy rains.
3. Either the farmer waters daily or there are no heavy monsoon rains.
4. If crops grow strong, the harvest is bountiful.
5. If the harvest is bountiful, the farmer makes a good profit.

The key deduction is:
- Monsoon season implies heavy rains (from premise 2).
- Heavy rains imply the farmer must water daily (from the disjunction in premise 3: if there are heavy rains, the "no heavy rains" option is false, so watering daily must be true).
- Watering daily implies the crops are watered (implicit: daily watering entails watering).
- Watering implies crops grow healthy and strong (premise 1).
- Healthy crops imply a bountiful harvest (premise 4).
- A bountiful harvest implies a good profit (premise 5).

Thus, monsoon season leads to a good profit. The Lean code formalizes this reasoning using a single object (the farm) and predicates. The proof shows that assuming monsoon season leads to a contradiction unless watering occurs, triggering the chain to good profit.
