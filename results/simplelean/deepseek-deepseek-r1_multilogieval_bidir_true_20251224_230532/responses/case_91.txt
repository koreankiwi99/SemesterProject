The context establishes that noise is inevitable due to either a party or drum practice. If we assume no noise occurred, this contradicts the premises, leading to a logical contradiction. In classical logic, from a contradiction, any conclusion follows, including that the police were called. Thus, the statement "if there was no noise, the police were called" holds under the given axioms.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom h : obj
axiom hosts_party : obj → Prop
axiom practices_drums : obj → Prop
axiom noise_up : obj → Prop
axiom neighbors_complain : obj → Prop
axiom police_called : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, hosts_party x → noise_up x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, practices_drums x → noise_up x
axiom A3 : hosts_party h ∨ practices_drums h
axiom A4 : ∀ x, hosts_party x → neighbors_complain x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, neighbors_complain x → police_called x

theorem police_called_if_no_noise : ¬ noise_up h → police_called h :=
  fun h_no_noise : ¬ noise_up h =>
    have noise_inevitable : noise_up h := by
      cases A3 with
      | inl party => exact A1 h party
      | inr drums => exact A2 h drums
    False.elim (h_no_noise noise_inevitable)
