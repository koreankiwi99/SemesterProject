The reasoning text involves a field, crops, pests, and a farmer's actions and outcomes. The goal is to prove whether, if pests invaded the field, the farmer made good profit. The premises provide logical relationships that can be modeled in Lean.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom field : obj
axiom farmer : obj

-- Predicates
axiom EnoughWater : obj → Prop
axiom CropsGrowWell : obj → Prop
axiom PestsInvade : obj → Prop
axiom CropsDestroyed : obj → Prop
axiom BountifulHarvest : obj → Prop
axiom GoodProfit : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from context
axiom A1 : ∀ x, EnoughWater x → CropsGrowWell x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, PestsInvade x → CropsDestroyed x
axiom A3 : EnoughWater field ∨ ¬ CropsDestroyed field ∨ (EnoughWater field ∧ CropsDestroyed field)
axiom A4 : ∀ x, CropsGrowWell x → BountifulHarvest x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, BountifulHarvest x → GoodProfit x

-- Theorem: If pests invaded the field, the farmer made good profit.
theorem result (hP : PestsInvade field) : GoodProfit farmer :=
  have hDestroyed : CropsDestroyed field := A2 field hP
  have hEnoughWater : EnoughWater field := by
    rcases A3 with hEnough | hNoDestroy | ⟨hEnough, _⟩
    · exact hEnough
    · contradiction  -- hNoDestroy contradicts hDestroyed
    · exact hEnough
  have hGrowWell : CropsGrowWell field := A1 field hEnoughWater
  have hBountiful : BountifulHarvest field := A4 field hGrowWell
  show GoodProfit farmer from A5 field hBountiful
</lean>

The proof shows that assuming pests invade the field (`hP`), we derive crop destruction via `A2`. Using the disjunction in `A3` and the fact that crops are destroyed, we eliminate the disjuncts to conclude there is enough water. Then, chaining implications through `A1`, `A4`, and `A5` establishes that the farmer makes good profit.
