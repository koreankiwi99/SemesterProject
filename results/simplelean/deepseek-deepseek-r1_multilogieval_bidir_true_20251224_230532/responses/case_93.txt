The reasoning context provides several premises that can be formalized in Lean. The key is to determine if "injured → celebrate" follows logically from the given axioms. 

- A1: Hard practice leads to preparation (`practices_hard → prepared`)
- A2: Injury prevents playing (`injured → cannot_play`), though this is unused in the proof
- A3: Either hard practice or no injury (`practices_hard ∨ ¬injured`)
- A4: Preparation leads to winning (`prepared → wins`)
- A5: Winning leads to celebration (`wins → celebrate`)

Proof strategy for `injured → celebrate`:
1. Assume `injured` is true.
2. From A3 (`practices_hard ∨ ¬injured`), the right branch (`¬injured`) contradicts the assumption, leaving only `practices_hard`.
3. Apply A1 to get `prepared`.
4. Apply A4 to get `wins`.
5. Apply A5 to get `celebrate`.

Thus, the statement is provable.

<lean>
axiom practices_hard : Prop
axiom prepared : Prop
axiom wins : Prop
axiom celebrate : Prop
axiom injured : Prop
axiom cannot_play : Prop

axiom A1 : practices_hard → prepared
axiom A2 : injured → cannot_play
axiom A3 : practices_hard ∨ ¬ injured
axiom A4 : prepared → wins
axiom A5 : wins → celebrate

theorem injury_implies_celebration : injured → celebrate :=
  fun h_inj : injured =>
    have h_ph : practices_hard := by
      cases A3 with
      | inl ph => exact ph
      | inr not_inj => contradiction
    have h_prep : prepared := A1 h_ph
    have h_win : wins := A4 h_prep
    show celebrate from A5 h_win
</lean>
