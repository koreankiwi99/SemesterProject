axiom obj : Type
axiom Lauren : obj

-- Define predicates
axiom TrainedHard : obj → Prop          -- Did sprint workouts several times a week
axiom SpeedImproved : obj → Prop        -- Speed improved
axiom RunFaster : obj → Prop            -- Can run races faster
axiom Stretched : obj → Prop            -- Stretched regularly after runs
axiom TookRecoverySeriously : obj → Prop-- Took recovery seriously
axiom FocusOnFlexibility : obj → Prop   -- Focused on flexibility to prevent injury

-- Premises
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, TrainedHard x → SpeedImproved x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, SpeedImproved x → RunFaster x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, TrainedHard x ∨ Stretched x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Stretched x → TookRecoverySeriously x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, TookRecoverySeriously x → FocusOnFlexibility x

-- Prove: If Lauren does not run races faster, then she focuses on flexibility
theorem result : ¬ RunFaster Lauren → FocusOnFlexibility Lauren := by
  intro h_not_faster
  -- Contrapositive of A2: ¬RunFaster → ¬SpeedImproved
  have h_not_improved : ¬ SpeedImproved Lauren := by
    intro h_improved
    exact h_not_faster (A2 Lauren h_improved)
  -- Contrapositive of A1: ¬SpeedImproved → ¬TrainedHard
  have h_not_trained : ¬ TrainedHard Lauren := by
    intro h_trained
    exact h_not_improved (A1 Lauren h_trained)
  -- By A3, Lauren either trained hard or stretched
  cases (A3 Lauren) with
  | inl h_trained => 
      -- Contradiction since ¬TrainedHard and TrainedHard
      exact False.elim (h_not_trained h_trained)
  | inr h_stretched =>
      -- If stretched, then took recovery seriously
      have h_recovery : TookRecoverySeriously Lauren := A4 Lauren h_stretched
      -- Therefore, focused on flexibility
      exact A5 Lauren h_recovery
