The reasoning in the context allows us to prove the statement. The key steps are:

1. From premise 2: If Mary finishes errands, she meets friends (FinishErrands → MeetFriends)
2. Contrapositive: If Mary didn't meet friends, she didn't finish errands (¬MeetFriends → ¬FinishErrands)
3. Premise 3 states: Either weather clears up OR errands get done (ClearUp ∨ FinishErrands)
4. With ¬FinishErrands, we must have ClearUp (from disjunction)
5. Premise 1: ClearUp → GameOn
6. Premise 4: GameOn → Cheer
7. Premise 5: Cheer → ExcitingNight
8. Thus, ¬MeetFriends → ExcitingNight

Lean proof:

<lean>
axiom ClearUp : Prop
axiom GameOn : Prop
axiom FinishErrands : Prop
axiom MeetFriends : Prop
axiom Cheer : Prop
axiom ExcitingNight : Prop

axiom P1 : ClearUp → GameOn
axiom P2 : FinishErrands → MeetFriends
axiom P3 : ClearUp ∨ FinishErrands
axiom P4 : GameOn → Cheer
axiom P5 : Cheer → ExcitingNight

theorem answer : ¬MeetFriends → ExcitingNight := by
  intro hnm
  have hnf : ¬FinishErrands := fun hfe => hnm (P2 hfe)
  cases P3 with
  | inl hClear => 
    exact P5 (P4 (P1 hClear))
  | inr hFe => 
    contradiction
</lean>

ANSWER: True
