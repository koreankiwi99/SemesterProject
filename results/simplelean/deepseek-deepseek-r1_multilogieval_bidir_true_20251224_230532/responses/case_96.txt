axiom Person : Type
axiom Exam : Type
axiom Alex : Person
axiom bio : Exam
axiom hist : Exam
axiom StudiesHard : Person → Exam → Prop
axiom Confident : Person → Exam → Prop
axiom Well : Person → Exam → Prop
axiom Satisfied : Person → Exam → Prop
axiom SevereWeather : Prop
axiom Canceled : Prop  -- Represents class cancellation due to weather

-- Premise 1: If someone studies hard for an exam, they feel confident
axiom R1 : ∀ (p : Person) (e : Exam), StudiesHard p e → Confident p e

-- Premise 2: Not directly usable (uses "may" implying possibility, not certainty)

-- Premise 3: Alex studied for bio ∨ class not canceled
axiom T3 : StudiesHard Alex bio ∨ ¬ Canceled

-- Premise 4: Confidence leads to good performance
axiom R4 : ∀ (p : Person) (e : Exam), Confident p e → Well p e

-- Premise 5: Good performance leads to satisfaction
axiom R5 : ∀ (p : Person) (e : Exam), Well p e → Satisfied p e

-- Attempted proof for: SevereWeather → Satisfied Alex hist
theorem goal : SevereWeather → Satisfied Alex hist := 
fun hsw =>  -- Assume SevereWeather
  -- We need to show Satisfied Alex hist
  -- No axioms connect SevereWeather to Canceled (Premise 2 is non-deterministic)
  -- T3 only provides information about bio exam, not hist
  -- No premises mention Alex's history exam preparation
  sorry  -- No valid path to conclusion
