The reasoning involves proving the implication: if the kids are not hyper, then they had lots of homework. The premises provide the necessary logical connections:

1. Substitute implies goofing off: `sub → goof_off`  
2. Pizza implies hyper: `pizza → hyper`  
3. Either substitute, pizza, or both: `sub ∨ pizza`  
4. Goofing off implies not learning much: `goof_off → ¬learn_much`  
5. Not learning much implies lots of homework: `¬learn_much → lots_of_homework`  

To prove `¬hyper → lots_of_homework`:  
- Assume `¬hyper`.  
- Case analysis on `sub ∨ pizza`:  
  - If `sub`, then `goof_off` (from 1), then `¬learn_much` (from 4), then `lots_of_homework` (from 5).  
  - If `pizza`, then `hyper` (from 2), contradicting `¬hyper`. By explosion, conclude `lots_of_homework`.  
Thus, in both cases, `lots_of_homework` follows from `¬hyper`.
