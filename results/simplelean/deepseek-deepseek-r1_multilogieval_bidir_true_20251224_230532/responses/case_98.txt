The reasoning involves proving that if it was very hot outside, then the team won. The premises are analyzed as follows:

- **Premise 1**: If the team practices hard, they are prepared.  
  `Practice team → Prepared team`
- **Premise 2**: If it is very hot, the game is postponed.  
  `Hot weather → Postponed game`
- **Premise 3**: Either the team practiced hard, or the game was not postponed.  
  `Practice team ∨ ¬Postponed game` (equivalent to `Postponed game → Practice team`)
- **Premise 4**: If the team is prepared, they play well.  
  `Prepared team → PlayWell team`
- **Premise 5**: If the team plays well, they win.  
  `PlayWell team → Win team`

To prove `Hot weather → Win team`:
1. Assume `Hot weather`.
2. By Premise 2, `Postponed game`.
3. By Premise 3, `Postponed game` implies `Practice team`.
4. By Premise 1, `Practice team` implies `Prepared team`.
5. By Premise 4, `Prepared team` implies `PlayWell team`.
6. By Premise 5, `PlayWell team` implies `Win team`.

Thus, the conclusion follows from the premises.
