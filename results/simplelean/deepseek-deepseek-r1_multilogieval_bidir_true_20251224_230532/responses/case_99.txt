The reasoning involves proving that if there was heavy rain, then butterflies were attracted. Using the provided premises:

1. Watering the garden leads to blooming: `Watered → Bloom`
2. Heavy rain causes saturated soil: `Rain → Saturated`
3. Either the garden is watered or the soil is not saturated: `Watered ∨ ¬Saturated` (equivalent to `Saturated → Watered`)
4. Blooming produces fragrance: `Bloom → Fragrance`
5. Fragrance attracts butterflies: `Fragrance → Butterflies`

Proof chain:
- Assume `Rain`.
- By premise 2: `Saturated`.
- By premise 3: `Saturated → Watered`, so `Watered`.
- By premise 1: `Bloom`.
- By premise 4: `Fragrance`.
- By premise 5: `Butterflies`.

This proves `Rain → Butterflies`.
