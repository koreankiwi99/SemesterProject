The reasoning shows that despite not affording the down payment, the person still buys their dream home due to the disjunctive premise and the mortgage qualification path. Here's the formal Lean proof:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom P : obj  -- Represents the person
axiom SaveAggressively : obj → Prop
axiom ImproveCredit : obj → Prop
axiom AffordDownPayment : obj → Prop
axiom QualifyForMortgage : obj → Prop
axiom BuyDreamHome : obj → Prop

-- Premises:
axiom T1 : ∀ x, SaveAggressively x → AffordDownPayment x
axiom T2 : ∀ x, ImproveCredit x → QualifyForMortgage x
axiom T3 : ∀ x, SaveAggressively x ∨ ImproveCredit x
axiom T4 : ∀ x, QualifyForMortgage x → BuyDreamHome x

-- Given: ¬AffordDownPayment P
theorem conclusion (h_down : ¬ AffordDownPayment P) : BuyDreamHome P := by
  have h_no_save : ¬ SaveAggressively P := fun s => h_down (T1 P s)
  have h_credit : ImproveCredit P := by
    cases T3 P with
    | inl s => contradiction
    | inr imp => exact imp
  have h_mortgage : QualifyForMortgage P := T2 P h_credit
  exact T4 P h_mortgage
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes
