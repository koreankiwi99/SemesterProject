The reasoning involves proving that if the Lakers did not limit inside scoring, then they forced many turnovers. The context provides:

1. If strong perimeter defense, then force many turnovers.
2. If protect the paint, then limit inside scoring.
3. Either strong perimeter defense or protect the paint (or both).

Given that the Lakers did not limit inside scoring, we must show they forced many turnovers. By axiom 2, not limiting inside scoring implies they did not protect the paint. By axiom 3, they must have had strong perimeter defense. Then, by axiom 1, strong perimeter defense implies forcing many turnovers. Thus, the conclusion follows.

<lean>
axiom Team : Type
axiom Lakers : Team
axiom StrongPerimeterDefense : Team → Prop
axiom ForceManyTurnovers : Team → Prop
axiom ProtectPaint : Team → Prop
axiom LimitInsideScoring : Team → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ t : Team, StrongPerimeterDefense t → ForceManyTurnovers t
axiom A2 : ∀ t : Team, ProtectPaint t → LimitInsideScoring t
axiom A3 : ∀ t : Team, StrongPerimeterDefense t ∨ ProtectPaint t

theorem lakers_turnover : ¬ LimitInsideScoring Lakers → ForceManyTurnovers Lakers :=
  fun h : ¬ LimitInsideScoring Lakers =>
  have h1 : ¬ ProtectPaint Lakers := 
    fun hp : ProtectPaint Lakers => 
    h (A2 Lakers hp)
  have h2 : StrongPerimeterDefense Lakers := 
    Or.resolve_right (A3 Lakers) h1
  A1 Lakers h2
