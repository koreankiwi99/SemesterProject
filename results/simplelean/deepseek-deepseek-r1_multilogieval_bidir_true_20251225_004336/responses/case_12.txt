The reasoning shows that if James does not gain confidence, then he must watch cooking shows. The premises state that for any chef, they either follow recipes precisely or watch cooking shows (or both). If James had followed recipes, he would have had dishes turn out well and gained confidence, contradicting the given fact that he does not gain confidence. Thus, the only remaining possibility is that he watches cooking shows.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj
axiom FollowRecipes : obj → Prop
axiom DishesWell : obj → Prop
axiom GainConfidence : obj → Prop
axiom WatchShows : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x, FollowRecipes x → DishesWell x
axiom P2 : ∀ x, DishesWell x → GainConfidence x
axiom P3 : ∀ x, FollowRecipes x ∨ WatchShows x
axiom James_no_conf : ¬ GainConfidence James

theorem watches_shows : WatchShows James := by
  have h_cases : FollowRecipes James ∨ WatchShows James := P3 James
  cases h_cases with
  | inl h_follow =>
      have h_dishes : DishesWell James := P1 James h_follow

The error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic did not automatically detect the global axiom `James_no_conf` in the local context. To fix this, we explicitly use `absurd` to show the contradiction between `h_conf` (GainConfidence James) and the axiom `James_no_conf` (¬GainConfidence James). This allows us to prove the goal in the left branch of the case analysis.

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj
axiom FollowRecipes : obj → Prop
axiom DishesWell : obj → Prop
axiom GainConfidence : obj → Prop
axiom WatchShows : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x, FollowRecipes x → DishesWell x
axiom P2 : ∀ x, DishesWell x → GainConfidence x
axiom P3 : ∀ x, FollowRecipes x ∨ WatchShows x
axiom James_no_conf : ¬ GainConfidence James

theorem watches_shows : WatchShows James := by
  have h_cases : FollowRecipes James ∨ WatchShows James := P3 James
  cases h_cases with
  | inl h_follow =>
      have h_dishes : DishesWell James := P1 James h_follow
      have h_conf : GainConfidence James := P2 James h_dishes
      exact absurd h_conf James_no_conf
  | inr h_watch => exact h_watch
</lean>
