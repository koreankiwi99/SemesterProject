The context provides information about the restaurant's advertising and the owner's beliefs, but does not establish any connection between positive reviews and long lines forming. The premises allow us to infer that positive reviews will spread on social media (since the restaurant uses fresh, organic ingredients → food tastes amazing → positive reviews spread). However, there is no information linking positive reviews or any other factor to the formation of long lines. Therefore, the formation of long lines cannot be proven from the given premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Restaurant : obj
axiom UsesFreshOrganic : obj → Prop
axiom TastesAmazing : obj → Prop
axiom PositiveReviewsSpread : obj → Prop
axiom LongLinesForm : obj → Prop

axiom uses_fresh : UsesFreshOrganic Restaurant
axiom owner_belief : ∀ x : obj, UsesFreshOrganic x → TastesAmazing x
axiom review_rule : ∀ x : obj, TastesAmazing x → PositiveReviewsSpread x

-- Prove positive reviews spread
theorem positive_reviews : PositiveReviewsSpread Restaurant := 
  review_rule Restaurant (owner_belief Restaurant uses_fresh)

-- Cannot prove LongLinesForm Restaurant (no premise connects reviews/quality to long lines)
