The context describes a specific student and their actions. We define propositions for the student's attributes and actions. The key points are:
- If the student studies diligently, they excel academically (StudyDiligently → ExcelAcademically)
- If they participate actively, they gain leadership skills (ParticipateActively → LeadershipSkills)
- The student either studies diligently or participates actively (StudyDiligently ∨ ParticipateActively)
- Leadership implies selection as class prefect (LeadershipSkills → SelectedAsPrefect)
- Given premise: ¬ExcelAcademically

We prove that despite not excelling academically (meaning they didn't study diligently), they must have participated actively (due to the disjunction). This leads to leadership skills and thus selection as prefect.

<lean>
axiom StudyDiligently : Prop
axiom ExcelAcademically : Prop
axiom ParticipateActively : Prop
axiom LeadershipSkills : Prop
axiom SelectedAsPrefect : Prop

axiom A1 : StudyDiligently → ExcelAcademically
axiom A2 : ParticipateActively → LeadershipSkills
axiom A3 : StudyDiligently ∨ ParticipateActively
axiom A4 : LeadershipSkills → SelectedAsPrefect

axiom given : ¬ ExcelAcademically

theorem chosen : SelectedAsPrefect := by
  cases A3 with
  | inl study =>
    have excel := A1 study
    contradiction  -- Contradicts given ¬ExcelAcademically
  | inr participate =>
    have leader := A2 participate
    exact A4 leader
</lean>

ITERATION 2

After analyzing the compilation error, I found that the `contradiction` tactic failed because it couldn't automatically detect the global axiom `given` in the local context. Here's the corrected proof using explicit false elimination:

<lean>
axiom StudyDiligently : Prop
axiom ExcelAcademically : Prop
axiom ParticipateActively : Prop
axiom LeadershipSkills : Prop
axiom SelectedAsPrefect : Prop

axiom A1 : StudyDiligently → ExcelAcademically
axiom A2 : ParticipateActively → LeadershipSkills
axiom A3 : StudyDiligently ∨ ParticipateActively
axiom A4 : LeadershipSkills → SelectedAsPrefect

axiom given : ¬ ExcelAcademically

theorem chosen : SelectedAsPrefect := by
  cases A3 with
  | inl study =>
      have excel : ExcelAcademically := A1 study
      exact False.elim (given excel)  -- Explicit contradiction
  | inr participate =>
      have leader : LeadershipSkills := A2 participate
      exact A4 leader
</lean>

The proof works because:
1. By disjunction elimination (`A3`), we consider both cases
2. In the diligent study case:
   - We derive academic excellence (`excel`)
   - This directly contradicts `given ¬ExcelAcademically`
   - Using `False.elim` explicitly resolves this contradiction
3. In the active participation case:
   - We derive leadership skills
   - Which directly implies selection as prefect via `A4`

Since the lack of academic excellence forces us into the participation case (where leadership and selection follow), we can conclude the student was selected as prefect.
