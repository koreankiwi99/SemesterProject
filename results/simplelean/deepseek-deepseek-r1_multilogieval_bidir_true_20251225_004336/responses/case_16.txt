The reasoning involves proving that Sarah listens attentively to music given that she cannot learn songs faster, based on the provided context. The context states:

1. If someone practices guitar scales and chords daily, their technique improves (`∀ p, PracticesDaily p → TechniqueImproves p`).
2. If technique improves, they learn songs faster (`∀ p, TechniqueImproves p → LearnFaster p`).
3. To progress, they either practice daily, listen attentively, or both (`∀ p, PracticesDaily p ∨ ListensAttentively p`).

Given that Sarah cannot learn songs faster (`¬ LearnFaster Sarah`), we derive:

- If Sarah cannot learn faster, her technique does not improve (contrapositive of axiom 2).
- If her technique does not improve, she does not practice daily (contrapositive of axiom 1).
- Since she does not practice daily, by axiom 3 (disjunction), she must listen attentively to music.

Thus, the conclusion follows logically.

The error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic did not automatically resolve the contradiction in the `inl` branch. This was fixed by explicitly using `False.elim` with the contradictory hypotheses (`h_learn` and `given`). The proof now correctly shows that Sarah must listen attentively to music given that she cannot learn songs faster.
