The reasoning involves logical implications and disjunctions. The key steps are:
1. If James cannot speak confidently (¬SpeakConfidently James), then by contraposition of T2, he does not feel prepared (¬FeelPrepared James).
2. If he does not feel prepared, by contraposition of T1, he did not practice thoroughly (¬PracticeThoroughly James).
3. Since T3 states he must have either practiced thoroughly or joined the club (or both), and he didn't practice, he must have joined the club.

-- Axioms from context

The compilation errors occurred due to the use of the `premise` keyword, which is not valid in Lean 4. Instead, the premise should be included as a hypothesis in the theorem statement. Additionally, the proof has been rewritten using tactic mode for clarity.

Here's the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj
axiom PracticeThoroughly : obj → Prop
axiom FeelPrepared : obj → Prop
axiom SpeakConfidently : obj → Prop
axiom JoinClub : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x : obj, PracticeThoroughly x → FeelPrepared x
axiom T2 : ∀ x : obj, FeelPrepared x → SpeakConfidently x
axiom T3 : ∀ x : obj, PracticeThoroughly x ∨ JoinClub x

theorem must_join_club (not_confident : ¬ SpeakConfidently James) : JoinClub James := by
  have not_prepared : ¬ FeelPrepared James := by
    intro h_prep
    exact not_confident (T2 James h_prep)
  have not_practiced : ¬ PracticeThoroughly James := by
    intro h_prac
    exact not_prepared (T1 James h_prac)
  cases T3 James with
  | inl practiced => exact False.elim (not_practiced practiced)
  | inr joined => exact joined
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**
1. From `¬ SpeakConfidently James` and axiom T2, we derive `¬ FeelPrepared James`
2. From `¬ FeelPrepared James` and axiom T1, we derive `¬ PracticeThoroughly James`
3. Axiom T3 gives a disjunction: either James practiced thoroughly or joined the club (or both)
4. The first case (`PracticeThoroughly James`) contradicts `¬ PracticeThoroughly James`
5. The second case (`JoinClub James`) directly proves the theorem

ANSWER: Yes
