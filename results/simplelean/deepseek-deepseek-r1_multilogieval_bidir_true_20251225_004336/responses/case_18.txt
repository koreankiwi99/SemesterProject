ANSWER: Yes

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic requires both a proposition and its negation to be present in the context. In the original code, when Sam impressed the manager (`Impress Sam`), we had:
- `h2 : Impress Sam → Promotion Sam`
- `imp : Impress Sam`
- `not_promoted : ¬ Promotion Sam`

But we never actually derived `Promotion Sam` from `h2` and `imp`. The fix is to explicitly derive a contradiction by first obtaining `Promotion Sam` via `h2 imp`, making the contradiction explicit.

Here is the corrected Lean 4 code:

axiom Employee : Type
axiom Sam : Employee
axiom Impress : Employee → Prop
axiom Promotion : Employee → Prop
axiom ExtraResponsibility : Employee → Prop
axiom Experience : Employee → Prop
axiom LeadTeam : Employee → Prop

axiom premise1 : ∀ e : Employee, Impress e → Promotion e
axiom premise2 : ∀ e : Employee, ExtraResponsibility e → Experience e
axiom premise3 : ∀ e : Employee, Impress e ∨ ExtraResponsibility e
axiom premise4 : ∀ e : Employee, Experience e → LeadTeam e
axiom not_promoted : ¬ Promotion Sam

theorem assigned_team : LeadTeam Sam := by
  have h1 := premise3 Sam   -- Sam either impressed or took extra work
  have h2 := premise1 Sam   -- If impressed then promoted
  have h3 := premise2 Sam   -- If extra work then experience
  have h4 := premise4 Sam   -- If experience then lead team
  cases h1 with
  | inl imp => 
    have promoted := h2 imp  -- Sam is promoted if he impressed
    contradiction            -- Contradiction with not_promoted
  | inr ex => 
    have experience := h3 ex -- Sam gains experience
    exact h4 experience      -- Therefore leads team
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic requires a direct contradiction between two hypotheses, but the contradiction between `promoted` and `not_promoted` wasn't being used to close the goal. To fix this, we explicitly use `False.elim` with the contradiction to prove the goal (since anything follows from false).

Here's the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom Employee : Type
axiom Sam : Employee
axiom Impress : Employee → Prop
axiom Promotion : Employee → Prop
axiom ExtraResponsibility : Employee → Prop
axiom Experience : Employee → Prop
axiom LeadTeam : Employee → Prop

axiom premise1 : ∀ e : Employee, Impress e → Promotion e
axiom premise2 : ∀ e : Employee, ExtraResponsibility e → Experience e
axiom premise3 : ∀ e : Employee, Impress e ∨ ExtraResponsibility e
axiom premise4 : ∀ e : Employee, Experience e → LeadTeam e
axiom not_promoted : ¬ Promotion Sam

theorem assigned_team : LeadTeam Sam := by
  have h1 := premise3 Sam   -- Sam either impressed or took extra work
  have h2 := premise1 Sam   -- If impressed then promoted
  have h3 := premise2 Sam   -- If extra work then experience
  have h4 := premise4 Sam   -- If experience then lead team
  cases h1 with
  | inl imp => 
    have promoted := h2 imp  -- Sam is promoted
    exact False.elim (not_promoted promoted)  -- Explicit contradiction handling
  | inr ex => 
    have experience := h3 ex -- Sam gains experience
    exact h4 experience      -- Therefore leads team
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes
