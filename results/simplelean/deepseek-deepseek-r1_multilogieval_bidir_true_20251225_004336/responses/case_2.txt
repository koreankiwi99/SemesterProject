The context provides several premises:
1. If it rains, the grass and plants are watered naturally.
2. If the weather is very hot, children play in sprinklers.
3. Either it rained today or the children did not play in sprinklers.

Given that the weather was very hot, we must determine if the grass and plants were watered naturally.

**Proof:**
- From premise 2 and the given hot weather, children played in sprinklers.
- Premise 3 states: rained ∨ ¬played. Since children played (¬played is false), rained must be true (by disjunctive syllogism).
- From premise 1, rained implies grass watered naturally.

Thus, the conclusion follows.

<lean>
axiom GrassWatered : Prop
axiom Rained : Prop
axiom Hot : Prop
axiom PlayedInSprinklers : Prop

axiom A1 : Rained → GrassWatered
axiom A2 : Hot → PlayedInSprinklers
axiom A3 : Rained ∨ ¬ PlayedInSprinklers

axiom hot_today : Hot

theorem grass_watered_today : GrassWatered := by
  have played : PlayedInSprinklers := A2 hot_today
  have rained : Rained := by
    cases A3 with
    | inl r => exact r
    | inr not_play => exact False.elim (not_play played)
  exact A1 rained
</lean>
