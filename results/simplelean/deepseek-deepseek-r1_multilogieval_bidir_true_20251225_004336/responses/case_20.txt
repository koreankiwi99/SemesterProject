The context provides several implications but lacks a direct link between impressing bosses and being motivated. The ambitious employee's realization establishes that motivation leads to hard work, but there's no statement that impressing bosses requires motivation. Mark impresses his bosses, so he gains influence, but this doesn't necessitate motivation. The existence of employees without promotions or influence doesn't provide information about Mark's motivation. Thus, motivation cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Employee : Type
axiom Mark : Employee
axiom WorkHard : Employee → Prop
axiom GetPromotion : Employee → Prop
axiom ImpressBoss : Employee → Prop
axiom GainInfluence : Employee → Prop
axiom Motivated : Employee → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ e : Employee, WorkHard e → GetPromotion e
axiom A2 : ∀ e : Employee, ImpressBoss e → GainInfluence e
axiom A3 : ∃ e : Employee, ¬GetPromotion e ∧ ¬GainInfluence e
axiom A4 : ∀ e : Employee, Motivated e → WorkHard e
axiom T5 : ImpressBoss Mark

-- We try to prove Motivated Mark
theorem mark_motivated : Motivated Mark := by 
  -- We have A4: Motivated Mark would imply WorkHard Mark, but T5 only gives ImpressBoss Mark → GainInfluence Mark (A2).
  -- There's no axiom connecting ImpressBoss to Motivated or WorkHard.
  -- A3 shows there exists some employee without promotion/influence, but doesn't relate to Mark's motivation.
  -- Without additional links, the proof fails.
  admit  -- Proof cannot be completed

-- Since the proof requires 'admit', the theorem is unprovable
