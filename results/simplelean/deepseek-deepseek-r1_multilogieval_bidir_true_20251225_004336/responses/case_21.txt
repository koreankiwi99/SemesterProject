The context provides two conditional statements:
1. If someone is cold, they should put on more layers: ∀x, Cold x → PutOnLayers x
2. If someone feels a chill, they should turn up the heat: ∀x, FeelsChill x → TurnUpHeat x

The statement to evaluate is: "Linda is either not adding layers or not adjusting the thermostat" (¬PutOnLayers Linda ∨ ¬TurnUpHeat Linda). The question asks whether Linda is feeling cold (Cold Linda).

Analysis:
- The first axiom (R1) links being cold to putting on layers, but not to adjusting the thermostat.
- The second axiom (R2) links feeling a chill to turning up the heat, but there's no connection between feeling cold and feeling a chill.
- The given disjunction (¬PutOnLayers Linda ∨ ¬TurnUpHeat Linda) doesn't force Cold Linda to be true:
  - If Linda isn't putting on layers, the contrapositive of R1 implies she isn't cold (¬Cold Linda).
  - If Linda isn't turning up the heat, it only implies she doesn't feel a chill (per R2), which doesn't relate to being cold.
- Since the disjunction doesn't specify which case holds, and one case directly contradicts Cold Linda, we cannot prove Cold Linda.

Lean verification:

axiom obj : Type
axiom Linda : obj
axiom Cold : obj → Prop
axiom PutOnLayers : obj → Prop
axiom FeelsChill : obj → Prop
axiom TurnUpHeat : obj → Prop
axiom R1 : ∀ x, Cold x → PutOnLayers x
axiom R2 : ∀ x, FeelsChill x → TurnUpHeat x
axiom Given : ¬ PutOnLayers Linda ∨ ¬ TurnUpHeat Linda

-- No proof exists for Cold Linda since:
-- 1. If ¬PutOnLayers Linda, contrapositive of R1 gives ¬Cold Linda
-- 2. If ¬TurnUpHeat Linda, we only get ¬FeelsChill Linda (via R2), which doesn't imply ¬Cold Linda
-- But the disjunction doesn't force Cold Linda to be true, and one branch disproves it.
