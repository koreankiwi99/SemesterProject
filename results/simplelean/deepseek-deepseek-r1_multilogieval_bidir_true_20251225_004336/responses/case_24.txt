ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was used incorrectly. The context contained a proof of `¬LovesWinter Mary` while the goal was to prove `LovesWinter Mary`, which is not a direct contradiction in the hypotheses. The proof attempt showed that the premises and the assumption of no snow imply that Mary cannot love winter, making the original goal unprovable.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Mary : Person
axiom Freezing : Prop
axiom SnowOnGround : Prop
axiom EnoughSnow : Prop
axiom BuildSnowman : Person → Prop
axiom LovesWinter : Person → Prop

axiom temp_rule : Freezing → SnowOnGround
axiom build_rule : ∀ p, BuildSnowman p → EnoughSnow
axiom certainty : Freezing ∨ ¬EnoughSnow
axiom friend_rule : ∀ p, LovesWinter p → BuildSnowman p

-- Attempt to prove Mary loves winter when there's no snow
example (h : ¬SnowOnGround) : LovesWinter Mary := by
  -- Prove freezing cannot occur
  have not_freezing : ¬Freezing := fun hf => h (temp_rule hf)
  -- Derive not enough snow from certainty
  have not_enough : ¬EnoughSnow := by
    cases certainty with
    | inl freezing => contradiction  -- contradicts not_freezing
    | inr not_enough => exact not_enough
  -- Show love would lead to enough snow (contradiction)
  have : ¬LovesWinter Mary := by
    intro h_love
    have build := friend_rule Mary h_love
    exact not_enough (build_rule Mary build)
  -- Cannot prove LovesWinter Mary (goal remains unsolved)
  admit  -- Explicitly mark unprovable point
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

Explanation:
1. The proof demonstrates that `¬SnowOnGround` leads to `¬LovesWinter Mary`
2. The goal `LovesWinter Mary` is therefore unprovable (and actually false)
3. The `admit` tactic explicitly marks the unprovable state
4. All premises are correctly represented per the natural language context

The answer is Failure since we cannot prove "Mary loves winter" from the given premises and the assumption of no snow.
