The reasoning involves analyzing the premises and the given statement about Ty. The premises state:
1. If someone suspects identity theft, they check their credit report.
2. If fraud is suspected, they contact their bank.

The statement about Ty is: Either Ty did not check his credit report or did not contact his bank.

The question is whether Ty suspected identity theft.

In Lean, we model:
- `obj` as the type of individuals.
- `Ty` as a specific individual.
- Predicates:
  - `SuspectsIdentityTheft` for suspecting identity theft.
  - `ChecksCreditReport` for checking the credit report.
  - `SuspectsFraud` for suspecting fraud (a broader category than identity theft).
  - `ContactsBank` for contacting the bank.

Premises:
- `P1`: Suspecting identity theft implies checking the credit report.
- `P2`: Suspecting fraud implies contacting the bank.
- `Ty_fact`: Ty either didn't check his credit report or didn't contact his bank.

We aim to prove `SuspectsIdentityTheft Ty`.

However, the disjunction in `Ty_fact` only provides:
- If Ty didn't check his credit report, by contraposition of `P1`, he did not suspect identity theft.
- If Ty didn't contact his bank, by contraposition of `P2`, he did not suspect fraud. But fraud is broader than identity theft, and we have no axiom linking identity theft to fraud. Thus, this case gives no information about identity theft.

Since in one case we deduce non-suspicion and in the other no relevant information, we cannot prove suspicion. The answer is Failure.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Ty : obj
axiom SuspectsIdentityTheft : obj → Prop
axiom ChecksCreditReport : obj → Prop
axiom SuspectsFraud : obj → Prop
axiom ContactsBank : obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, SuspectsIdentityTheft x → ChecksCreditReport x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, SuspectsFraud x → ContactsBank x
axiom Ty_fact : ¬ ChecksCreditReport Ty ∨ ¬ ContactsBank Ty

-- We cannot prove SuspectsIdentityTheft Ty
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure
