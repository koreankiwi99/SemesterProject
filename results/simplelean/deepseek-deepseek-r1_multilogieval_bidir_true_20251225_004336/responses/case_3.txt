The reasoning involves proving that if Team B did not lose, then Team A scored more points. The context provides:

1. If Team A scores more points, they win: `MorePoints_A → Win_A`
2. If Team B fumbles multiple times, they lose: `Fumbles_B → Lose_B`
3. Either Team A scores more points or Team B fumbles (or both): `MorePoints_A ∨ Fumbles_B`

To prove: `¬Lose_B → MorePoints_A`

Assume `¬Lose_B`. From axiom 3, we have `MorePoints_A ∨ Fumbles_B`. If `MorePoints_A` holds, we're done. If `Fumbles_B` holds, then by axiom 2, `Lose_B` must be true, contradicting `¬Lose_B`. Thus, `Fumbles_B` is impossible, leaving `MorePoints_A` as the only possibility. Therefore, the statement is provable.
