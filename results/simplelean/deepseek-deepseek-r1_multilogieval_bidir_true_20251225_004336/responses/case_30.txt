The context discusses professional athletes and their conditions, but it does not specify that Mark is an athlete. The given information states that Mark eats a healthy diet, which implies he has increased strength (not deficient in strength). However, there is no direct link between healthy nutrition and dedication. Dedication leads to proper training, which enhances skills, but without knowing Mark's athlete status or training habits, we cannot prove he is dedicated. The general observation about athletes (lacking skill or deficient strength) does not apply to Mark without confirmation he is an athlete. Thus, the conclusion that Mark is dedicated cannot be proven from the context.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Mark : Person
axiom Athlete : Person → Prop
axiom Dedicated : Person → Prop
axiom TrainProperly : Person → Prop
axiom HealthyNutrition : Person → Prop
axiom LackingSkill : Person → Prop
axiom DeficientStrength : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ p : Person, Dedicated p → TrainProperly p
axiom A2 : ∀ p : Person, TrainProperly p → ¬ LackingSkill p
axiom A3 : ∀ p : Person, HealthyNutrition p → ¬ DeficientStrength p
axiom A4 : ∀ p : Person, Athlete p → (LackingSkill p ∨ DeficientStrength p)

axiom MarkHealthy : HealthyNutrition Mark

-- Cannot prove Dedicated Mark: No information that Mark is an athlete, and healthy diet alone does not imply dedication.
