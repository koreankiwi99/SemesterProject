The context provides several premises:
1. If someone exercises regularly, they are active (fit).
2. If someone eats nutritious foods, they are energetic.
3. Not everyone is active or energetic (i.e., there exists someone who is neither).
4. If someone values wellness, they exercise regularly.
5. Jane eats nutritious foods.

We need to determine if Jane values wellness. While Jane's nutritious eating implies she is energetic (from premise 2), there is no premise linking eating nutritious foods to exercising regularly or valuing wellness. The existence of someone who is neither active nor energetic does not provide information about Jane specifically. Premise 4 states that valuing wellness implies exercising, but we have no information about Jane's exercise habits. Thus, we cannot prove that Jane values wellness.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Jane : obj
axiom Exercises : obj → Prop
axiom EatsNutritious : obj → Prop
axiom Energetic : obj → Prop
axiom ValuesWellness : obj → Prop
axiom active : obj → Prop  -- Represents being active/fit

axiom exercise_implies_active : ∀ x, Exercises x → active x
axiom nutritious_implies_energetic : ∀ x, EatsNutritious x → Energetic x
axiom exists_inactive_nonenergetic : ∃ x, ¬active x ∧ ¬Energetic x
axiom wellness_implies_exercise : ∀ x, ValuesWellness x → Exercises x
axiom jane_eats_nutritious : EatsNutritious Jane

-- Jane is energetic due to her nutritious eating
theorem jane_energetic : Energetic Jane := nutritious_implies_energetic Jane jane_eats_nutritious

-- We cannot prove ValuesWellness Jane because:
-- 1. No premise links EatsNutritious to Exercises or ValuesWellness
-- 2. wellness_implies_exercise requires Exercises Jane to infer ValuesWellness Jane, which we lack
-- 3. exists_inactive_nonenergetic does not provide information about Jane
