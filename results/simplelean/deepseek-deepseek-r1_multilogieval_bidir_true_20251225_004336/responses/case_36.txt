The context provides two implications about computer problems:
1. If someone has computer problems, they should restart their computer.
2. If someone has computer problems, they should check for software updates.

The statement to evaluate is: "Either Mary did not restart her computer or she did not install the latest updates." The question is whether Mary was having computer problems.

In Lean, we formalize:
- `obj` as the type of entities.
- `Mary` as a specific object.
- `Problems` to indicate if an entity has computer problems.
- `Restarted` to indicate if an entity restarted their computer.
- `Updated` to indicate if an entity installed software updates.
- `ShouldRestart` and `ShouldUpdate` for the recommendations (though these are not directly used in the proof).

Premises:
1. `A1`: If someone has problems, they should restart. (∀x, Problems x → ShouldRestart x)
2. `A2`: If someone has problems, they should update. (∀x, Problems x → ShouldUpdate x)

Given statement:
- `Given`: Mary either didn't restart or didn't update. (¬Restarted Mary ∨ ¬Updated Mary)

We aim to prove: `Problems Mary`.

**Analysis**:
- The premises only state what should be done when problems exist, not that failing to take these actions implies problems.
- There is no link between the "should" recommendations and actual actions (e.g., no axiom that "should restart" implies "did restart" or vice versa).
- The given disjunction (¬Restarted ∨ ¬Updated) does not force problems to exist, as Mary might lack problems and still not restart/update.

Since no axioms connect recommendations to actions or provide contrapositives, we cannot prove `Problems Mary`.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mary : obj
axiom Problems : obj → Prop
axiom Restarted : obj → Prop
axiom Updated : obj → Prop
axiom ShouldRestart : obj → Prop
axiom ShouldUpdate : obj → Prop

-- Premises from context
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Problems x → ShouldRestart x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Problems x → ShouldUpdate x

-- Given statement about Mary
axiom Given : ¬ Restarted Mary ∨ ¬ Updated Mary

-- Cannot prove Problems Mary from the axioms
