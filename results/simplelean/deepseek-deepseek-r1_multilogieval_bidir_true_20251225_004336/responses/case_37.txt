ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The error in the original code occurred because the theorem was attempting to prove the negation of the desired conclusion. After re-evaluating the context, we need to prove that if Jake cannot relax outside, then he is prepared (¬ RelaxOutside Jake → Prepared Jake). However, the premises actually lead to the opposite conclusion.

The key steps are:
1. From ¬ RelaxOutside Jake and A1, we derive ¬ WeatherNice Jake
2. From A3, we get cases: WeatherNice Jake (contradiction), or ¬ PackedEnough Jake, or both
3. The ¬ PackedEnough Jake case leads to ¬ ReadBooks Jake (via A2 contrapositive)
4. Then to ¬ Prepared Jake (via A4 contrapositive)
5. This directly contradicts the goal of proving Prepared Jake

Thus, we cannot prove Prepared Jake under these premises. The Lean code demonstrates this by having an unresolved goal in the critical case.
