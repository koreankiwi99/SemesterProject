The context and statement are translated into Lean propositions. The axioms are set based on the context:

- `Monday` and `Quiz` represent whether it is Monday and if there is a quiz.
- `StudyHard` and `DoWell` represent whether the person studied hard and did well on the quiz.
- `GoodAtMath` represents whether Alex is good at math.
- Axioms:
  - `A1`: If it's Monday, there is a quiz (`Monday → Quiz`).
  - `A2`: Doing well on the quiz implies studying hard (`DoWell → StudyHard`).
  - `A3`: Either Monday, or not studying hard (the disjunction reduces to `Monday ∨ ¬StudyHard`).
  - `A4`: Being good at math implies doing well on quizzes (`GoodAtMath → DoWell`).

The goal is to prove `GoodAtMath` under the assumption of no quiz (`¬Quiz`). 

From `¬Quiz` and `A1`, we derive `¬Monday`. Using `A3` and `¬Monday`, we get `¬StudyHard`. From `A2` and `¬StudyHard`, we derive `¬DoWell`. Finally, `A4` and `¬DoWell` yield `¬GoodAtMath`. This proves that Alex is not good at math under the assumption of no quiz, which contradicts the goal of proving `GoodAtMath`. Therefore, the theorem `alex_good` cannot be proven.

axiom Monday : Prop
axiom Quiz : Prop
axiom StudyHard : Prop
axiom DoWell : Prop
axiom GoodAtMath : Prop

axiom A1 : Monday → Quiz
axiom A2 : DoWell → StudyHard
axiom A3 : Monday ∨ ¬ StudyHard
axiom A4 : GoodAtMath → DoWell

theorem alex_good (no_quiz : ¬ Quiz) : GoodAtMath :=
  have not_monday : ¬ Monday := fun m => no_quiz (A1 m)
  have not_study_hard : ¬ StudyHard :=
    match A3 with
    | Or.inl m => absurd m not_monday
    | Or.inr nsh => nsh
  have not_do_well : ¬ DoWell := fun dw => not_study_hard (A2 dw)
  have not_good : ¬ GoodAtMath := fun g => not_do_well (A4 g)
  not_good (by assumption) -- Contradiction, cannot prove GoodAtMath

The compilation error occurred because the code attempted to prove `GoodAtMath` by deriving a contradiction, but the contradiction only produced `False` instead of the required `GoodAtMath`. The proof shows that under the assumption of no quiz (`¬Quiz`), we can derive `¬GoodAtMath`, making it impossible to prove the original goal `GoodAtMath`.

Here is the corrected Lean analysis:

<lean>
axiom Monday : Prop
axiom Quiz : Prop
axiom StudyHard : Prop
axiom DoWell : Prop
axiom GoodAtMath : Prop

axiom A1 : Monday → Quiz
axiom A2 : DoWell → StudyHard
axiom A3 : Monday ∨ ¬ StudyHard
axiom A4 : GoodAtMath → DoWell

-- Proof that under ¬Quiz, Alex is NOT good at math
theorem alex_not_good (no_quiz : ¬ Quiz) : ¬ GoodAtMath :=
  fun g =>  -- Assume GoodAtMath
  have dw : DoWell := A4 g
  have sh : StudyHard := A2 dw
  have not_monday : ¬ Monday := fun m => no_quiz (A1 m)
  match A3 with
  | Or.inl m => not_monday m
  | Or.inr nsh => nsh sh

-- Original goal: Prove GoodAtMath under ¬Quiz is impossible
-- We cannot prove GoodAtMath because we've proved its negation
</lean>
