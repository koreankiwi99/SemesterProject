The reasoning involves translating the given context into logical propositions and proving whether the children sleep well at night given that flu season started. The context provides the following premises:

1. If the weather is sunny, children will play outside: `Sunny → Play`
2. If flu season begins, many children get sick: `FluSeason → Sick`
3. Either it is sunny, or not many kids get the flu, or it was sunny and many kids did not get sick: `Sunny ∨ ¬Sick ∨ (Sunny ∧ ¬Sick)`
4. If children play outside, they sleep well: `Play → SleepWell`

Given that flu season started (`FluSeason`), we derive `Sick` from premise 2. Using premise 3 and `Sick`, the disjunction simplifies: `¬Sick` and `(Sunny ∧ ¬Sick)` both contradict `Sick`, leaving `Sunny` as the only feasible case. Then, `Sunny` implies `Play` (premise 1), and `Play` implies `SleepWell` (premise 4). Thus, the children sleep well.

Lean proof:
<lean>
axiom FluSeason : Prop
axiom Sunny : Prop
axiom Sick : Prop
axiom Play : Prop
axiom SleepWell : Prop

axiom P1 : Sunny → Play
axiom P2 : FluSeason → Sick
axiom P3 : Sunny ∨ ¬Sick ∨ (Sunny ∧ ¬Sick)
axiom P4 : Play → SleepWell

axiom Fact : FluSeason

theorem children_sleep_well : SleepWell := by
  have hSick : Sick := P2 Fact
  cases P3 with
  | inl hSunny => 
      exact P4 (P1 hSunny)
  | inr hrest => 
      cases hrest with
      | inl hNotSick => contradiction
      | inr hSunnyNotSick => contradiction
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic failed to automatically detect the contradiction in the `inr.inr` branch. This was due to the presence of a conjunction (`Sunny ∧ ¬Sick`) where the contradictory hypothesis (`¬Sick`) needed to be extracted explicitly. 

The corrected proof:
1. Uses `False.elim` with explicit contradictions:
   - In `inr.inl`: `hNotSick hSick` proves `False`
   - In `inr.inr`: `hSunnyNotSick.2 hSick` proves `False`
2. Directly eliminates the `False` to prove the goal `SleepWell`

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom FluSeason : Prop
axiom Sunny : Prop
axiom Sick : Prop
axiom Play : Prop
axiom SleepWell : Prop

axiom P1 : Sunny → Play
axiom P2 : FluSeason → Sick
axiom P3 : Sunny ∨ ¬Sick ∨ (Sunny ∧ ¬Sick)
axiom P4 : Play → SleepWell

axiom Fact : FluSeason

theorem children_sleep_well : SleepWell := by
  have hSick : Sick := P2 Fact
  cases P3 with
  | inl hSunny => 
      exact P4 (P1 hSunny)
  | inr hrest => 
      cases hrest with
      | inl hNotSick => 
          exact False.elim (hNotSick hSick)
      | inr hSunnyNotSick => 
          exact False.elim (hSunnyNotSick.2 hSick)
</lean>
