The context provides information about transit conditions and their implications for commuters, but it does not specify whether James took the subway or any other form of transit. The premises establish that if someone takes the subway or bus, they arrive on time, but James's mode of transportation is unknown except that he did not take the bus. Without evidence that James took the subway, we cannot conclude he arrived on time. The Lean formalization reflects this gap, as no proof of `OnTime James` is possible from the given axioms.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person
axiom SubwayRunning : Prop
axiom BusHasRoom : Prop
axiom TakeSubway : Person → Prop
axiom TakeBus : Person → Prop
axiom OnTime : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : SubwayRunning → ∃ p, TakeSubway p
axiom A2 : BusHasRoom → ∃ p, TakeBus p
axiom A3 : ∀ p, (TakeSubway p ∨ TakeBus p) → OnTime p
axiom A4 : ∀ p, TakeSubway p → OnTime p
axiom notTakeBusJames : ¬ TakeBus James

-- No proof for OnTime James: We know James didn't take the bus, but have no information about him taking the subway.
