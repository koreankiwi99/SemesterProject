The reasoning involves proving that Mark's garden failed to thrive given the premises and the fact that Mark did not need to care for garden plants. The key steps are:

1. From "If someone plants a garden, they will need to water and care for the plants" and "Mark did not need to care for garden plants", we infer Mark did not plant a garden (¬PlantsGarden).
2. From "Either they plant a garden, or there is a drought, or both" and ¬PlantsGarden, we infer there is a drought (Drought).
3. From "If there is a drought, there will be a ban on watering gardens" and Drought, we infer a ban (Ban).
4. From "If there is a watering ban, the plants will not get enough water" and Ban, we infer not enough water (NotEnoughWater).
5. From "If the plants don't get watered, the garden will fail to thrive" and NotEnoughWater, we infer the garden failed to thrive (FailThrive).

This chain of reasoning is formalized in Lean, proving the conclusion.

<lean>
axiom PlantsGarden : Prop
axiom NeedsWaterCare : Prop
axiom Drought : Prop
axiom Ban : Prop
axiom NotEnoughWater : Prop
axiom FailThrive : Prop

axiom T1 : PlantsGarden → NeedsWaterCare
axiom T2 : Drought → Ban
axiom T3 : PlantsGarden ∨ Drought
axiom T4 : Ban → NotEnoughWater
axiom T5 : NotEnoughWater → FailThrive

axiom given : ¬NeedsWaterCare

theorem garden_fails : FailThrive := by
  cases T3 with
  | inl pg => exact False.elim (given (T1 pg))
  | inr d => exact T5 (T4 (T2 d))
</lean>
