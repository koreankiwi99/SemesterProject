The reasoning involves proving that if Casey adopts a pet, she feels fulfillment. Adopting a pet means she provides a home (premise 2). The third premise states that for every person, either they volunteer or they don't provide a home. Since Casey provides a home, she must volunteer (by disjunctive syllogism). Volunteering leads to helping the community (premise 1), and helping leads to fulfillment (premise 4). Thus, Casey feels fulfillment.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Casey : obj
axiom Volunteers : obj → Prop
axiom AdoptsPet : obj → Prop
axiom ProvidesHome : obj → Prop
axiom HelpsCommunity : obj → Prop
axiom FeelsFulfillment : obj → Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ x, Volunteers x → HelpsCommunity x
axiom R2 : ∀ x, AdoptsPet x → ProvidesHome x
axiom R3 : ∀ x, Volunteers x ∨ ¬ProvidesHome x
axiom R4 : ∀ x, HelpsCommunity x → FeelsFulfillment x

theorem casey_fulfilled : AdoptsPet Casey → FeelsFulfillment Casey :=
  fun hAdopt : AdoptsPet Casey =>
  have hHome : ProvidesHome Casey := R2 Casey hAdopt
  have hVolunteer : Volunteers Casey := 
    Or.elim (R3 Casey) 
      (fun vol => vol)
      (fun noHome => absurd hHome noHome)
  have hHelp : HelpsCommunity Casey := R1 Casey hVolunteer
  show FeelsFulfillment Casey from R4 Casey hHelp
