The context and question are analyzed using logical propositions:

- **A**: Package arrives on time.
- **O**: Special order is ready (in stock).
- **P**: They (including Max) can pick up materials.
- **S**: People (including Max) start a new project.
- **L**: They (including Max) learn new skills.

**Premises:**
1. If A then S: `A → S`
2. If O then P: `O → P`
3. A or O (or both): `A ∨ O`
4. If S then L: `S → L`
5. Max was unable to pick up materials: `¬P`

**Proof:**
- From `¬P` and `O → P`, we derive `¬O` (contrapositive).
- From `¬O` and `A ∨ O`, we derive `A` (disjunctive syllogism).
- From `A` and `A → S`, we derive `S` (modus ponens).
- From `S` and `S → L`, we derive `L` (modus ponens).

Thus, we prove that Max learned new skills (L is true).
