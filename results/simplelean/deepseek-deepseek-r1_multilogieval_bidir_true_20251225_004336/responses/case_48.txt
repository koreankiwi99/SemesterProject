ANSWER: Yes

The proof shows that the youngest kids laughed loudly follows necessarily from the premises:
1. From ¬E (energy not high) and A2 (G → E), we derive ¬G (crowd didn't gasp)
2. From ¬G and A1 (F → G), we derive ¬F (trapeze artist didn't flip)
3. From ¬F and A3 (F ∨ C), we must have C (clowns came out)
4. From C and A4 (C → L), we conclude L (kids laughed)

The compilation errors occurred due to using the non-existent `premise` keyword instead of `axiom` for the given premise. Here's the corrected Lean code:

ANSWER: Yes

**Explanation of proof:**
1. From ¬E (energy not high) and A2 (G → E), we derive ¬G (crowd didn't gasp) via modus tollens
2. From ¬G and A1 (F → G), we derive ¬F (trapeze artist didn't flip) via modus tollens
3. From ¬F and A3 (F ∨ C), we must have C (clowns came out) by disjunctive syllogism
4. From C and A4 (C → L), we conclude L (kids laughed) via modus ponens

The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.
