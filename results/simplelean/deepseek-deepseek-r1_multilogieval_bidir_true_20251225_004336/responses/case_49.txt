The reasoning involves proving that the sponge was soapy given that it didn't rain recently, based on the provided premises. The Lean proof demonstrates this by deriving contradictions from the negated premises step by step.

<lean>
axiom Rained : Prop
axiom Wet : Prop
axiom UsedWater : Prop
axiom Washed : Prop
axiom Uncoiled : Prop
axiom Soapy : Prop

axiom A1 : Wet → Rained
axiom A2 : Washed → UsedWater
axiom A3 : Wet ∨ ¬UsedWater
axiom A4 : Uncoiled → Washed
axiom A5 : Uncoiled ∨ Soapy

theorem sponge_soapy (no_rain : ¬Rained) : Soapy := by
  have not_wet : ¬Wet := fun h_wet => no_rain (A1 h_wet)
  have not_used_water : ¬UsedWater := by
    cases A3 with
    | inl wet => exact absurd wet not_wet
    | inr no_water => exact no_water
  have not_washed : ¬Washed := fun h_washed => not_used_water (A2 h_washed)
  have not_uncoiled : ¬Uncoiled := fun h_uncoiled => not_washed (A4 h_uncoiled)
  cases A5 with
  | inl u => exact False.elim (not_uncoiled u)
  | inr s => exact s
