The reasoning involves Mary's situation based on the premises. The key steps are:

1. If Mary learned botany (B), she would understand plant needs (U), leading to thriving plants (T).
2. Mary's plants did not thrive (¬T), so she couldn't have learned botany (¬B) because that would imply T (contradiction).
3. The premise states that for any homeowner, they either learned botany or sought advice (B ∨ A).
4. Since Mary didn't learn botany (¬B), she must have sought advice (A).

This reasoning is formalized in Lean:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mary : obj
axiom B : obj → Prop
axiom U : obj → Prop
axiom T : obj → Prop
axiom A : obj → Prop

axiom Premise1 : ∀ x : obj, B x → U x
axiom Premise2 : ∀ x : obj, U x → T x
axiom Premise3 : ∀ x : obj, B x ∨ A x
axiom Mary_not_thrive : ¬ T Mary

theorem Mary_sought_advice : A Mary := by
  have not_B_Mary : ¬ B Mary := by
    intro h_B
    have h_U : U Mary := Premise1 Mary h_B
    have h_T : T Mary := Premise2 Mary h_U
    exact Mary_not_thrive h_T
  cases (Premise3 Mary) with
  | inl h_B => contradiction
  | inr h_A => exact h_A
</lean>

ANSWER: Yes
