-- Given that crowd did not start cheering loudly for the game
theorem booing_question (g : Game) (h : ¬crowd_cheering_loudly g) : lot_of_booing g :=
  have not_pumped : ¬crowd_pumped_up g :=
    fun hp : crowd_pumped_up g => h (pumped_imp_cheering g hp)
  -- At this point, we know ¬crowd_pumped_up g
  -- We have the disjunction: scores_early g ∨ play_rival g
  -- From ¬crowd_pumped_up and score_early_imp_pumped, we get ¬scores_early g
  have not_early : ¬scores_early g :=
    fun se : scores_early g => not_pumped (score_early_imp_pumped g se)
  -- Thus by disjunction, we must have play_rival g
  have rival : play_rival g :=
    Or.elim (disjunction g)
      (fun se : scores_early g => False.elim (not_early se))
      (fun pr : play_rival g => pr)
  -- However, we have NO axiom connecting play_rival directly to lot_of_booing
  -- The only booing axiom requires crowd_pumped_up, which we don't have
  -- Therefore, we cannot prove lot_of_booing g
  sorry  -- Proof incomplete

-- Since the proof requires 'sorry', we cannot prove the statement
