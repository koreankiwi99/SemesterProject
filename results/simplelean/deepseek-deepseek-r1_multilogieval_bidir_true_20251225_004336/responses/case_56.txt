The reasoning can be formalized in Lean as follows. We define a type `Person` and the relevant predicates based on the context. The key steps are:

1. If no real conversations → no fluency improvement (contrapositive of premise 2)
2. No fluency improvement → no daily speaking (contrapositive of premise 1)
3. No daily speaking → must listen to podcasts (by disjunction in premise 3)
4. Listening to podcasts → gains listening comprehension (premise 4)

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Emma : Person
axiom SpeaksDaily : Person → Prop
axiom ImprovesFluency : Person → Prop
axiom RealConversations : Person → Prop
axiom ListensPodcasts : Person → Prop
axiom GainsListening : Person → Prop

-- If speak daily → improve fluency
axiom P1 : ∀ x, SpeaksDaily x → ImprovesFluency x
-- If improve fluency → real conversations
axiom P2 : ∀ x, ImprovesFluency x → RealConversations x
-- Speak daily OR listen to podcasts (or both)
axiom P3 : ∀ x, SpeaksDaily x ∨ ListensPodcasts x
-- Listen to podcasts → gain listening comprehension
axiom P4 : ∀ x, ListensPodcasts x → GainsListening x

-- Prove: ¬RealConversations Emma → GainsListening Emma
theorem emma_result : ¬ RealConversations Emma → GainsListening Emma := by
  intro h_no_conversation
  -- From P2 and contrapositive: no real conversations → no fluency improvement
  have h_no_fluency : ¬ ImprovesFluency Emma :=
    fun h_fluency => h_no_conversation (P2 Emma h_fluency)
  -- From P1 and contrapositive: no fluency improvement → no daily speaking
  have h_no_speak : ¬ SpeaksDaily Emma :=
    fun h_speak => h_no_fluency (P1 Emma h_speak)
  -- From P3: must listen to podcasts since no daily speaking
  cases P3 Emma with
  | inl h_speak => contradiction  -- Contradicts h_no_speak
  | inr h_listen => exact P4 Emma h_listen  -- Directly proves listening comprehension
