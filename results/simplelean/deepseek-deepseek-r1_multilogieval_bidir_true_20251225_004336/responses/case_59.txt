The reasoning involves proving whether Emma gains knowledge of music theory given that she cannot entertain friends with the guitar. From the context:

1. If Emma learned basic chords and strumming patterns, she could play simple songs (`LearnedBasic Emma → PlaysSimpleSongs Emma`).
2. If she could play simple songs, she could entertain friends (`PlaysSimpleSongs Emma → EntertainFriends Emma`).
3. Either she learned basic chords, took lessons, or both (`LearnedBasic Emma ∨ TookLessons Emma`).
4. If she took lessons, she gains music theory knowledge (`TookLessons Emma → GainsMusicTheory Emma`).

Given that Emma cannot entertain friends (`¬EntertainFriends Emma`), by contrapositive on the second premise, she cannot play simple songs (`¬PlaysSimpleSongs Emma`). By contrapositive on the first premise, this means she did not learn basic chords (`¬LearnedBasic Emma`). Using the disjunction premise, since she did not learn basic chords, she must have taken lessons (`TookLessons Emma`). Finally, by the fourth premise, taking lessons implies she gains music theory knowledge. Thus, the conclusion is proven.
