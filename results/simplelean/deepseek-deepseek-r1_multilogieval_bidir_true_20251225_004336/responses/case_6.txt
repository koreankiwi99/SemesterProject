The context provides general rules about excessive rain leading to reservoir overflow and reservoir overflow causing flooding. However, the statement about Dallas specifically mentions only "heavy rainfall," not "excessive rain." While "heavy rainfall" and "excessive rain" might be used interchangeably in everyday language, the logical formulation requires explicit equivalence. Without an axiom linking `HeavyRain` to `ExcessiveRain`, we cannot prove flooding occurs in Dallas.

<lean>
axiom City : Type
axiom Dallas : City
axiom HeavyRain : City → Prop
axiom ExcessiveRain : City → Prop
axiom ReservoirsOverflow : City → Prop
axiom Flooding : City → Prop

axiom dallas_rain : HeavyRain Dallas
axiom excessive_implies_overflow : ∀ c : City, ExcessiveRain c → ReservoirsOverflow c
axiom overflow_implies_flood : ∀ c : City, ReservoirsOverflow c → Flooding c

-- Missing axiom: HeavyRain c → ExcessiveRain c
-- Cannot prove Flooding Dallas from given premises
