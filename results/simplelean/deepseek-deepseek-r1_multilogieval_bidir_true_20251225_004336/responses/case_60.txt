The context provides logical premises about the events of the first day of school. The statement to evaluate is whether John went to bed late, given that John knows it is not time to get ready. The premises are:

1. If the alarm went off, then it is time to get ready: `AlarmWentOff → TimeToGetReady`
2. If John missed the bus, then he is late for school: `MissedBus → LateForSchool`
3. Either the alarm went off or John is not late for school: `AlarmWentOff ∨ ¬LateForSchool`
4. If John got up late, then he missed the bus: `GotUpLate → MissedBus`
5. If John went to bed late, then he got up late: `WentToBedLate → GotUpLate`

Additionally, we are given that John knows it is not time to get ready: `¬TimeToGetReady`.

We need to prove that John went to bed late (`WentToBedLate`). However, using the premises, we can derive:

- From `¬TimeToGetReady` and `AlarmWentOff → TimeToGetReady`, by modus tollens, `¬AlarmWentOff`.
- From `¬AlarmWentOff` and `AlarmWentOff ∨ ¬LateForSchool`, by disjunctive syllogism, `¬LateForSchool`.
- From `¬LateForSchool` and `MissedBus → LateForSchool`, by modus tollens, `¬MissedBus`.
- From `¬MissedBus` and `GotUpLate → MissedBus`, by modus tollens, `¬GotUpLate`.
- From `¬GotUpLate` and `WentToBedLate → GotUpLate`, by modus tollens, `¬WentToBedLate`.

Thus, we have proven that John did *not* go to bed late (`¬WentToBedLate`). Therefore, we cannot prove `WentToBedLate`.
