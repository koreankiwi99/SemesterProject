The reasoning involves proving that Linda did not plant disease-resistant varieties based on the given context and facts. The context states that if someone plants disease-resistant varieties and waters/feeds properly, they will have a bountiful harvest. Linda watered and fed properly but did not have a bountiful harvest. Therefore, Linda must not have planted disease-resistant varieties.
