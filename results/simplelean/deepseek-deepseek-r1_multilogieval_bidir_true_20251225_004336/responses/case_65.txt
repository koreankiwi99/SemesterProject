The context states that if the wood is of high quality, then precisely cut joints lead to a sturdy product. The premises are that the joints were cut precisely, but the bookshelf was not sturdy (shaky and fell apart quickly). The question is whether the wood was of high quality.

Logically:
- Let `high_quality` represent "wood is of high quality".
- Let `precise_joints` represent "joints are cut precisely".
- Let `sturdy` represent "finished product is sturdy and long-lasting".

From the context:  
`high_quality → (precise_joints → sturdy)`  

Given premises:  
1. `precise_joints` (joints cut precisely).  
2. `¬sturdy` (bookshelf not sturdy).  

We wish to prove `high_quality` (wood was high quality).  

However:  
- Assume `high_quality`. Then by the context axiom, `precise_joints → sturdy`.  
- Since `precise_joints` is true, we get `sturdy`.  
- But `¬sturdy` is given, leading to a contradiction.  
- Thus, `high_quality` must be false (i.e., `¬high_quality`).  

**This proves that the wood was NOT high quality**, but it does NOT prove `high_quality` (the conclusion we need). Since we cannot prove `high_quality` from the axioms, the result is Failure.

axiom high_quality : Prop
axiom precise_joints : Prop
axiom sturdy : Prop
axiom context : high_quality → (precise_joints → sturdy)
axiom precise : precise_joints
axiom not_sturdy : ¬ sturdy

-- Attempt to prove high_quality fails, as premises imply ¬high_quality.
