The context provides a conditional rule: if a company develops an innovative product and markets it effectively, then the product will be commercially successful. The given statements are that Acme Inc. marketed their gadget effectively, but it was not commercially successful. The question asks whether Acme Inc. developed an innovative product.

To answer this, we model the scenario in Lean:
- Define a type `Company` for companies.
- Define `Acme` as a specific company.
- Define predicates: `develops_innovative` (did the company develop an innovative product?), `markets_effectively` (did they market it effectively?), and `commercially_successful` (was the product commercially successful?).
- The context rule: if any company develops an innovative product and markets it effectively, then it will be commercially successful.
- Given facts: Acme marketed effectively, but was not commercially successful.

We attempt to prove that Acme developed an innovative product. However, from the given facts:
1. Acme marketed effectively (`fact1`).
2. Acme was not commercially successful (`fact2`).
3. The rule implies that if Acme had developed an innovative product and marketed effectively, it would have been successful.

Using contraposition:  
- The rule `∀ c, develops_innovative c → markets_effectively c → commercially_successful c` is logically equivalent to:  
  `∀ c, ¬ commercially_successful c → ¬ (develops_innovative c ∧ markets_effectively c)`.  
- Applying `fact2` (¬ commercially_successful Acme) gives: `¬ (develops_innovative Acme ∧ markets_effectively Acme)`.  
- With `fact1` (markets_effectively Acme), we conclude `¬ develops_innovative Acme` (De Morgan’s law).  

Thus, we have proof that Acme did **not** develop an innovative product. Since the question asks for proof of the affirmative (that they *did* develop one), and we cannot prove it (we proved the opposite), we return `Failure`.

<lean>
axiom Company : Type
axiom Acme : Company
axiom develops_innovative : Company → Prop
axiom markets_effectively : Company → Prop
axiom commercially_successful : Company → Prop
axiom context_rule : ∀ c : Company, 
  develops_innovative c → 
  markets_effectively c → 
  commercially_successful c
axiom fact1 : markets_effectively Acme
axiom fact2 : ¬ commercially_successful Acme

-- Attempt to prove `develops_innovative Acme` fails because:
-- 1. `context_rule Acme` requires success if both innovative and effective marketing hold.
-- 2. `fact2` contradicts the success required if `develops_innovative Acme` were true.
-- Instead, we can prove the negation (not required for the question):
theorem not_innovative : ¬ develops_innovative Acme :=
  fun h : develops_innovative Acme =>
    have : commercially_successful Acme := context_rule Acme h fact1
    show False from fact2 this
-- Thus, `develops_innovative Acme` is unprovable from the axioms.
