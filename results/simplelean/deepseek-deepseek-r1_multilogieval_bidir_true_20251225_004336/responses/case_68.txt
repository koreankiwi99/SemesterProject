The reasoning context and statements are translated into Lean to evaluate if it can be proven that Emma studied hard. The general belief is formalized as a universal axiom, and the specific statements about Emma are given as axioms. 

The goal is to prove `StudiesHard emma biology`. However, from the axioms:
- If Emma studied hard and got enough sleep, she would ace the exam (by `R1`).
- Emma got enough sleep (`T1`).
- Emma did not ace the exam (`T2`).

This implies that Emma studying hard would lead to a contradiction (since it would require her to ace the exam). Therefore, it is impossible to prove `StudiesHard emma biology`. The negation can be proven, but the positive statement cannot. Hence, the proof attempt fails.

<lean>
axiom Student : Type
axiom Exam : Type
axiom emma : Student
axiom biology : Exam
axiom StudiesHard : Student → Exam → Prop
axiom GetsEnoughSleep : Student → Exam → Prop
axiom Aces : Student → Exam → Prop
axiom R1 : ∀ (s : Student) (e : Exam), StudiesHard s e → GetsEnoughSleep s e → Aces s e
axiom T1 : GetsEnoughSleep emma biology
axiom T2 : ¬ Aces emma biology

-- Attempt to prove StudiesHard emma biology fails:
-- Assuming StudiesHard emma biology leads to Aces emma biology (via R1 and T1), contradicting T2.
-- Thus, StudiesHard emma biology is unprovable.
