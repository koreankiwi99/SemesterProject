The context provides several facts:
1. The gardener enriched the soil (by adding compost and fertilizer).
2. The plants grew strong (indicating they were healthy).
3. The plants produced lots of vegetables (indicating an abundant harvest).
4. A general rule: If plants are healthy, they yield bigger harvests (which implies healthy plants lead to abundant harvests).

The statement to evaluate is: Given that the gardener enriched the soil, was the harvest abundant?

From the context:
- The plants were healthy (premise T2).
- Healthy plants lead to abundant harvests (rule R1).
- Therefore, the harvest was abundant (theorem answer).

The enriched soil (T1) is not directly used in the proof because the health of the plants (T2) and the rule (R1) are sufficient to prove the harvest was abundant. The direct observation of abundant harvest (from "produced lots of vegetables") also supports this conclusion.

axiom obj : Type
axiom enriched_soil : Prop
axiom plants_healthy : Prop
axiom harvest_abundant : Prop

axiom T1 : enriched_soil
axiom T2 : plants_healthy
axiom R1 : plants_healthy → harvest_abundant

theorem answer : harvest_abundant := R1 T2

ANSWER: Yes
