The reasoning involves proving that Farmer Joe did not plant the tomato seeds properly based on the given context and facts. The context states that proper planting implies adequate sunlight and watering lead to large plentiful tomatoes. Given that Farmer Joe provided adequate sunlight and watering but the tomatoes did not grow large and plentiful, it logically follows that the seeds were not planted properly.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom FarmerJoe : obj
axiom PlantedProperly : obj → Prop
axiom AdequateSunlightWatering : obj → Prop
axiom GrowLargePlentiful : obj → Prop
axiom context : ∀ x : obj, PlantedProperly x → (AdequateSunlightWatering x → GrowLargePlentiful x)
axiom given_sun_water : AdequateSunlightWatering FarmerJoe
axiom given_no_grow : ¬ GrowLargePlentiful FarmerJoe
theorem not_planted_properly : ¬ PlantedProperly FarmerJoe :=
  fun h_planted : PlantedProperly FarmerJoe =>
    have h_grow : GrowLargePlentiful FarmerJoe := context FarmerJoe h_planted given_sun_water
    given_no_grow h_grow
</lean>

The proof shows that assuming Farmer Joe planted properly leads to a contradiction with the given facts. Therefore, the conclusion that he did not plant properly is valid.
