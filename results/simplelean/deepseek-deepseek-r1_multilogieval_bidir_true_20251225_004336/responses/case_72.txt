The reasoning involves evaluating whether the pantry must be empty if Sam starts cooking, given the premises. The premises are:

1. If close to dinnertime (`D`), then start cooking (`C`): `D → C`
2. If go shopping (`S`), then make dinner (`M`): `S → M`
3. Either close to dinnertime or won't make dinner: `D ∨ ¬M`
4. If fridge empty (`F`), then go shopping: `F → S`
5. If pantry empty (`P`), then fridge empty: `P → F`

The goal is to prove `C → P` (if Sam starts cooking, the pantry is empty).

However, analysis shows:
- When `D` is true (case 1), `C` holds (by premise 1), but `P` may be false (e.g., pantry not empty) without contradicting premises.
- When `¬M` is true (case 2), `¬S` and `¬F` follow (contrapositives of premises 2 and 4), leading to `¬P` (contrapositive of premise 5). Thus, `P` is false in this case.

Since case 1 allows `C` true and `P` false, `C → P` cannot be proven. The counterexample is:
- `D = true`, `C = true`, `P = false`, `F = false`, `S = false`, `M = false`
- All premises hold, but `C` is true while `P` is false.

Thus, the proof fails.

<lean>
axiom D : Prop -- Close to dinnertime
axiom C : Prop -- Start cooking
axiom S : Prop -- Go shopping
axiom M : Prop -- Make dinner
axiom F : Prop -- Fridge empty
axiom P : Prop -- Pantry empty

axiom A1 : D → C
axiom A3 : S → M
axiom A4 : D ∨ ¬M
axiom A5 : F → S
axiom A6 : P → F

-- Cannot prove C → P: Counterexample exists where C is true and P is false
