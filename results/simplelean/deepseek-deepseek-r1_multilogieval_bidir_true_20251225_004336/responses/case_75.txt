The context states that if preventive maintenance is done and quality parts are used, then the car will have a long service life. For Liz's car, quality parts were used, but it did not have a long service life. The goal is to prove that preventive maintenance was done (the positive conclusion).

In Lean:
- Define a type for objects (cars).
- Define Liz's car as a constant.
- Define predicates for preventive maintenance, quality parts, and long service life.
- Axiom: If preventive maintenance is done, then using quality parts implies a long service life (equivalent to: preventive maintenance and quality parts imply long service life).
- Axiom: Quality parts were used for Liz's car.
- Axiom: Liz's car did not have a long service life.

Attempt to prove `PreventiveMaintenance lizCar`:
- From the axioms, we can derive that if preventive maintenance was done, then Liz's car would have a long service life (using the mechanics axiom with the quality parts axiom). However, this contradicts the axiom that Liz's car did not have a long service life. This implies that preventive maintenance was not done.
- There is no way to prove `PreventiveMaintenance lizCar` (the positive conclusion) from the given axioms. In fact, the axioms prove the negation.

Since the positive conclusion (preventive maintenance was done) cannot be proven, the result is Failure.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom lizCar : obj
axiom PreventiveMaintenance : obj → Prop
axiom QualityParts : obj → Prop
axiom LongServiceLife : obj → Prop

axiom mechanics : ∀ x : obj, PreventiveMaintenance x → (QualityParts x → LongServiceLife x)
axiom highQuality : QualityParts lizCar
axiom notLongLife : ¬ LongServiceLife lizCar

-- Attempt to prove PreventiveMaintenance lizCar fails
-- Proof of ¬ PreventiveMaintenance lizCar (not required, but for clarity):
theorem not_preventive : ¬ PreventiveMaintenance lizCar := 
  fun h : PreventiveMaintenance lizCar =>
    have h1 : QualityParts lizCar → LongServiceLife lizCar := mechanics lizCar h
    have h2 : LongServiceLife lizCar := h1 highQuality
    notLongLife h2

-- But the required theorem for the positive conclusion is unprovable
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure
