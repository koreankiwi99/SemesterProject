The context states a conditional rule for novelists: if a novelist develops compelling characters and crafts an intriguing plot, then their book connects with readers. The premises are: Lauren crafted an intriguing plot, and her book did not connect with readers. The question is whether Lauren developed compelling characters.

To prove that Lauren developed compelling characters, we would need to show that `DevelopsCompellingCharacters Lauren` follows from the axioms. However, the rule `R1` only applies to novelists, and we are not given that Lauren is a novelist. Without knowing `Novelist Lauren`, we cannot apply the rule to her. Therefore, we cannot derive a contradiction or any conclusion about her character development from the premises. The premises do not provide enough information to prove that Lauren developed compelling characters.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Lauren : obj
axiom Novelist : obj → Prop
axiom DevelopsCompellingCharacters : obj → Prop
axiom CraftsIntriguingPlot : obj → Prop
axiom BookConnectsWithReaders : obj → Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ w : obj, Novelist w → (DevelopsCompellingCharacters w → (CraftsIntriguingPlot w → BookConnectsWithReaders w))
axiom T1 : CraftsIntriguingPlot Lauren
axiom T2 : ¬ BookConnectsWithReaders Lauren

-- Cannot prove DevelopsCompellingCharacters Lauren without knowing Novelist Lauren.
