The reasoning involves determining if the statement "If John's muscles are not sore today, did it rain?" follows from the given context. The Lean code models the propositions and attempts to prove the implication `¬SoreNextDay → Rains`.

<lean>
axiom Rains : Prop
axiom WeatherCold : Prop
axiom TakesHotShower : Prop
axiom MusclesRelax : Prop
axiom WorkedOutHard : Prop
axiom SoreNextDay : Prop

axiom T1 : WorkedOutHard → SoreNextDay
axiom R1 : TakesHotShower → MusclesRelax
axiom R2 : WorkedOutHard ∨ ¬MusclesRelax
axiom R3 : WeatherCold → TakesHotShower
axiom R4 : Rains → WeatherCold

theorem rain_if_not_sore : ¬SoreNextDay → Rains :=
  fun not_sore : ¬SoreNextDay =>
    have not_worked : ¬WorkedOutHard := fun worked => not_sore (T1 worked)
    have no_relax : ¬MusclesRelax := by
      cases R2 with
      | inl worked => exact not_worked worked
      | inr no_relax => exact no_relax
    have no_shower : ¬TakesHotShower := fun shower => no_relax (R1 shower)
    have not_cold : ¬WeatherCold := fun cold => no_shower (R3 cold)
    have no_rain : ¬Rains := fun rain => not_cold (R4 rain)
    -- Cannot prove Rains at this point; derived ¬Rains instead
    sorry
</lean>

The proof attempt shows that assuming `¬SoreNextDay` leads to `¬Rains` (not raining), not `Rains` (raining). Therefore, the required implication `¬SoreNextDay → Rains` cannot be proven from the axioms.

After analyzing the context and the statement, I've translated the reasoning into Lean 4 code. The proof attempts to show that "if John's muscles are not sore today, then it rained" (¬SoreNextDay → Rains), but reaches a contradiction instead.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Rains : Prop
axiom WeatherCold : Prop
axiom TakesHotShower : Prop
axiom MusclesRelax : Prop
axiom WorkedOutHard : Prop
axiom SoreNextDay : Prop

axiom T1 : WorkedOutHard → SoreNextDay
axiom R1 : TakesHotShower → MusclesRelax
axiom R2 : WorkedOutHard ∨ ¬MusclesRelax
axiom R3 : WeatherCold → TakesHotShower
axiom R4 : Rains → WeatherCold

theorem rain_if_not_sore : ¬SoreNextDay → Rains :=
  fun not_sore : ¬SoreNextDay =>
    have not_worked : ¬WorkedOutHard := 
      fun worked => not_sore (T1 worked)
    have no_relax : ¬MusclesRelax := by
      cases R2 with
      | inl worked => exact False.elim (not_worked worked)  -- Fixed: contradiction resolves to ¬MusclesRelax
      | inr no_relax => exact no_relax
    have no_shower : ¬TakesHotShower := 
      fun shower => no_relax (R1 shower)
    have not_cold : ¬WeatherCold := 
      fun cold => no_shower (R3 cold)
    have no_rain : ¬Rains := 
      fun rain => not_cold (R4 rain)
    -- Stuck: need Rains but derived ¬Rains
    no_rain  -- Type mismatch: ¬Rains vs Rains
    sorry     -- Required to compile but represents unprovable goal
</lean>

**Explanation of the proof attempt:**
1. Assuming ¬SoreNextDay (muscles not sore)
2. Prove ¬WorkedOutHard (contraposition on T1)
3. Prove ¬MusclesRelax using R2:
   - Left case (WorkedOutHard): Contradiction with ¬WorkedOutHard
   - Right case (¬MusclesRelax): Direct proof
4. Derive ¬TakesHotShower (contraposition on R1)
5. Derive ¬WeatherCold (contraposition on R3)
6. Derive ¬Rains (contraposition on R4)

The proof shows ¬SoreNextDay → ¬Rains, but we need ¬SoreNextDay → Rains. Since we derive ¬Rains instead of Rains, the required implication is unprovable from the axioms.

I've fixed the compilation errors by properly structuring the proof and addressing the type mismatches. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Rains : Prop
axiom WeatherCold : Prop
axiom TakesHotShower : Prop
axiom MusclesRelax : Prop
axiom WorkedOutHard : Prop
axiom SoreNextDay : Prop

axiom T1 : WorkedOutHard → SoreNextDay
axiom R1 : TakesHotShower → MusclesRelax
axiom R2 : WorkedOutHard ∨ ¬MusclesRelax
axiom R3 : WeatherCold → TakesHotShower
axiom R4 : Rains → WeatherCold

theorem rain_if_not_sore : ¬SoreNextDay → Rains :=
  fun not_sore : ¬SoreNextDay =>
    have not_worked : ¬WorkedOutHard := 
      fun worked => not_sore (T1 worked)
    have no_relax : ¬MusclesRelax := by
      cases R2 with
      | inl worked => exact False.elim (not_worked worked)
      | inr no_relax => exact no_relax
    have no_shower : ¬TakesHotShower := 
      fun shower => no_relax (R1 shower)
    have not_cold : ¬WeatherCold := 
      fun cold => no_shower (R3 cold)
    have no_rain : ¬Rains := 
      fun rain => not_cold (R4 rain)
    -- Proof of Rains required here, but we have ¬Rains instead
    -- No contradiction in premises to exploit
    sorry
</lean>

**Explanation of corrections:**
1. Removed the problematic `no_rain` application that caused type mismatch
2. Kept all intermediate steps as `have` expressions since they're valid
3. Used `sorry` as the final term to satisfy the required type `Rains`
4. The `cases` statement now properly handles both branches of the disjunction

**Proof analysis:**
- From ¬SoreNextDay, we derive ¬WorkedOutHard using T1
- Using R2 (WorkedOutHard ∨ ¬MusclesRelax):
  - Left branch: Contradiction with ¬WorkedOutHard
  - Right branch: Directly get ¬MusclesRelax
- Then sequentially derive:
  - ¬TakesHotShower (from R1 and ¬MusclesRelax)
  - ¬WeatherCold (from R3 and ¬TakesHotShower)
  - ¬Rains (from R4 and ¬WeatherCold)
- The conclusion requires Rains, but we've derived ¬Rains
- No contradiction exists in the context to exploit
- Therefore, the theorem is unprovable from the axioms
