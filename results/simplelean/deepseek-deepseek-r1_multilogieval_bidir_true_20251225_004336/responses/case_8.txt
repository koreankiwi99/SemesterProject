The context provides:
1. A universal rule: If a chef uses fresh ingredients, the food will be delicious.
2. A fact: The chef used fresh ingredients (interpreted from "Either the chef used fresh ingredients" as a singular fact due to incomplete disjunction).
3. An irrelevant rule about complicated recipes taking more time (not needed for the question).

The question asks: If the chef cooked a complicated recipe, did the food taste delicious?  
Since we know the chef used fresh ingredients (fact), and fresh ingredients imply delicious food (universal rule), the food must be delicious regardless of whether the recipe was complicated. Thus, the conditional "if complicated recipe then delicious" holds.
