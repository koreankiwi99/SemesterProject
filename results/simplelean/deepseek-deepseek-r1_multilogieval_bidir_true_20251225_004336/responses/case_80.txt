The reasoning involves proving that if the kids did not go for a swim, then the players had smiles on their faces. The key steps are:
1. From "if swimming pool is open, kids swim" (A2) and "kids did not swim" (¬KidsSwim), we get that the pool is not open (¬PoolOpen) by contraposition.
2. From "either no rain or pool open" (A3) and ¬PoolOpen, we get that it did not rain (¬Rain) by disjunctive syllogism.
3. From "if no rain, game scheduled" (A1) and ¬Rain, we get the game was scheduled (GameScheduled).
4. From "if game scheduled, players enjoy" (A4) and GameScheduled, we get they enjoyed (EnjoyPlaying).
5. From "if enjoy, smiles" (A5) and EnjoyPlaying, we get smiles (Smiles).

Thus, ¬KidsSwim → Smiles is provable.

The compilation errors were due to the way the contradiction was handled in the `have h1` and `have h2` blocks. The `contradiction` tactic wasn't able to resolve the goals automatically. The corrected code uses explicit function applications to handle the contradictions.
