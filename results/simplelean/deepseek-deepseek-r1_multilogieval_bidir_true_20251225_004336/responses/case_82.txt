The context provides several premises, but the conclusion that the house felt homey and cozy given that James did not celebrate cannot be proven. Here's why:

1. **Premises Analysis**:
   - If peaches are available at the market, someone bakes a pie (`MarketHasPeaches → ∃ p, BakesPie p`).
   - If someone wins a contest, they celebrate (`∀ p, WonContest p → Celebrate p`).
   - Peaches are in season, or someone won a contest, or both (`InSeason ∨ ∃ p, WonContest p`).
   - If someone bakes a pie, the house smells amazing (`(∃ p, BakesPie p) → HouseSmellAmazing`).
   - If the house smells amazing, it feels homey and cozy (`HouseSmellAmazing → HomeyCozy`).

2. **Assumption**: James did not celebrate (`¬ Celebrate James`).  
   From the second premise, this implies James did not win the contest (`¬ WonContest James`). However, this does not prevent someone else from winning.

3. **Disjunction Cases**:
   - **Case 1: Peaches are in season (`InSeason`)**. This does not imply peaches are at the market (`MarketHasPeaches`), so we cannot prove someone baked a pie.
   - **Case 2: Someone won a contest (`∃ p, WonContest p`)**. The winner (possibly not James) celebrates, but this does not provide information about baking or peaches.

4. **Conclusion**: There is no path to prove `HomeyCozy` under the assumption `¬ Celebrate James`. The disjunction does not force peaches to be at the market, and winning a contest does not trigger baking.
