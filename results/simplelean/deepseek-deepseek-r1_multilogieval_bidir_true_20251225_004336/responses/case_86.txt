The reasoning involves proving that if there was a snowstorm, Priya's parents took her out for ice cream. The key steps are:
1. Snowstorm implies school is canceled (premise 2).
2. Either Priya studied hard or school was not canceled (premise 3). Since snowstorm causes school cancellation, the "school not canceled" option is false, so Priya must have studied hard.
3. Priya studying hard implies she gets good grades (premise 1).
4. Good grades imply her parents are proud (premise 4).
5. Proud parents imply they take her out for ice cream (premise 5).

Thus, snowstorm leads to ice cream for Priya. The Lean proof formalizes this logic.
