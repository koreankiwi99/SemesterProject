The reasoning involves proving that if the fans are not emotionally invested, then the atmosphere was electric. The premises are:

1. If the home team is winning, the crowd is loud and energized.
2. If it's a rivalry game, fans are emotionally invested.
3. Either the home team is winning, or it's a rivalry game, or both.
4. If the crowd is loud and energized, the atmosphere is electric.
5. If the atmosphere is electric, it's an unforgettable game (not directly needed).

Given ¬emotionally_invested:
- From premise 2 (rivalry → emotionally_invested), by contraposition, ¬emotionally_invested → ¬rivalry.
- Thus, ¬rivalry.
- From premise 3 (home_winning ∨ rivalry), with ¬rivalry, we get home_winning.
- From premise 1 (home_winning → loud ∧ energized), with home_winning, we get loud and energized.
- From premise 4 (loud ∧ energized → electric), we get electric.

Therefore, ¬emotionally_invested implies electric, proving the statement.
