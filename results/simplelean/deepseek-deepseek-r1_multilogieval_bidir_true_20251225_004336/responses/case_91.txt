The reasoning involves evaluating if, given there was no noise, the police were called. The context provides several premises:

1. If there's a party, the house is noisy (`P → N`).
2. If drums are played, noise levels go up (`D → N`).
3. There is either a party, drums being played, or both (`P ∨ D`).
4. If the house is noisy due to a party, neighbors complain (`P → C`).
5. If neighbors complain, the police are called (`C → PC`).

The statement to evaluate is: "If there was no noise, were the police called?" i.e., `¬N → PC?`.

From the premises:
- `P → N` and `¬N` imply `¬P` (by contraposition).
- `D → N` and `¬N` imply `¬D` (by contraposition).
- However, `P ∨ D` (premise 3) is now contradicted by `¬P ∧ ¬D`.
- This contradiction (`False`) allows proving any conclusion, including `PC`, through explosion (ex falso quodlibet).

Thus, `¬N → PC` is provable. The Lean code formalizes this reasoning.

axiom P : Prop   -- Party hosted
axiom D : Prop   -- Drums being practiced
axiom N : Prop   -- Noise level up
axiom C : Prop   -- Neighbors complain
axiom PC : Prop  -- Police called

axiom A1 : P → N  -- Party causes noise
axiom A2 : D → N  -- Drums cause noise
axiom A3 : P ∨ D  -- Either party, drums, or both
axiom A4 : P → C  -- Noise from party causes complaints
axiom A5 : C → PC -- Complaints lead to police intervention

theorem police_called_when_no_noise : ¬N → PC :=
  fun hn : ¬N => by
    exfalso        -- Assume False to prove by contradiction
    cases A3 with  -- Cases on P ∨ D
    | inl p => exact hn (A1 p)  -- Party case contradicts ¬N
    | inr d => exact hn (A2 d)  -- Drums case contradicts ¬N
