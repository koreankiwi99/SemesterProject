-- If did sprint workouts (trained hard) then speed improves
axiom A2 : ∀ p : Person, TrainedHard p → SpeedImprove p
-- If speed improves then can run races faster
axiom A3 : ∀ p : Person, SpeedImprove p → RunRacesFaster p
-- Trained hard or stretched (or both)
axiom A5 : ∀ p : Person, TrainedHard p ∨ Stretched p
-- If stretched then took recovery seriously
axiom A6 : ∀ p : Person, Stretched p → RecoverySerious p
-- If took recovery seriously then focused on flexibility
axiom A7 : ∀ p : Person, RecoverySerious p → FocusOnFlexibility p

theorem answer : ¬ RunRacesFaster Lauren → FocusOnFlexibility Lauren :=
  fun h : ¬ RunRacesFaster Lauren =>
  have no_fast_imp_no_train : ¬ TrainedHard Lauren :=
    fun train : TrainedHard Lauren =>
    have speed_imp : SpeedImprove Lauren := A2 Lauren train
    have fast : RunRacesFaster Lauren := A3 Lauren speed_imp
    h fast
  have stretch_case : Stretched Lauren :=
    Or.elim (A5 Lauren)
      (fun train => False.elim (no_fast_imp_no_train train))
      (fun stretch => stretch)
  have recovery : RecoverySerious Lauren := A6 Lauren stretch_case
  show FocusOnFlexibility Lauren from A7 Lauren recovery
