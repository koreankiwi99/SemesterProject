The reasoning involves proving that if Mary did not meet her friends for dinner, it was an exciting night at the ballpark. The context provides:

1. `Clear → GameOn` (If weather clears, game goes on)
2. `ErrandsDone → MeetFriends` (If errands done, Mary meets friends)
3. `Clear ∨ ErrandsDone` (Weather clears or errands done)
4. `GameOn → Cheer` (If game on, fans cheer)
5. `Cheer → Exciting` (If fans cheer, it's exciting)

If Mary did not meet friends (`¬MeetFriends`), by contraposition on axiom 2, we get `¬ErrandsDone`. With axiom 3 (`Clear ∨ ErrandsDone`), eliminating `ErrandsDone` forces `Clear` to be true. Axiom 1 then gives `GameOn`, leading to `Cheer` (axiom 4) and finally `Exciting` (axiom 5). Thus, `¬MeetFriends → Exciting` is provable.

axiom Cheer : Prop
axiom Exciting : Prop

axiom A1 : Clear → GameOn
