======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the `variable` declarations were not appropriately managed, leading to missing identifiers and incorrect theorem typing. To resolve this, all propositions are explicitly declared as axioms of type `Prop`, and the proof structure remains valid, utilizing a case analysis that leads to either direct implication or contradiction.
