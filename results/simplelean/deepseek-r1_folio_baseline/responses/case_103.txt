The reasoning involves translating the given context into Lean axioms and analyzing the statement about Luke. The context defines relationships between being born in a multiple birth, having siblings born together, complaining about siblings, living at home, and living with strangers. Luke's situation is given as a disjunction between two scenarios. The question asks whether Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings.

The Lean code formalizes the predicates and axioms based on the context. The disjunction about Luke is represented as an axiom. The theorem to prove is that Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings. However, the axioms do not provide enough information to prove this statement or its negation. Specifically:
- If Luke is not born in a multiple birth, then he does not complain (from `Complain p → MultipleBirth p` via axioms).
- But Luke's birth status (multiple birth or not) cannot be determined from the disjunction and axioms alone, as both cases are possible without contradiction.
- Complaining status depends on birth status but cannot be independently verified.

Thus, the statement about Luke is uncertain.

axiom A3 : ∀ p, Complain p → HasSiblingsBornTogether p
axiom A4 : ∀ p, LiveAtHome p → ¬ LiveWithStrangers p
axiom A5 : ∀ p, SpendsTime p → LiveAtHome p

axiom Luke_disj :

  (¬ (Baby Luke ∧ MultipleBirth Luke) ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke)

theorem goal : ¬ MultipleBirth Luke ∧ ¬ Complain Luke := by 
  -- Cannot be proven: Luke's birth status is undetermined
  sorry

theorem neg_goal : ¬ (¬ MultipleBirth Luke ∧ ¬ Complain Luke) := by 
  -- Negation also cannot be proven
  sorry
