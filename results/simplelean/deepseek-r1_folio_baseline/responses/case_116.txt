Based on the given context, we need to determine whether Peter can block Windy's shooting. Let's translate the reasoning into Lean and then attempt to prove the statement.

### Key Facts from Context:
1. Blocking rule for men: If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
   - `∀ x y, Man x → Man y → Taller x y → CanBlockShootingOf x y`
2. Michael is a man taller than everyone else in his class (but the class composition is unknown).
3. Taller is transitive.
4. Peter is a man taller than Michael.
5. Michael can block any shooting from a person who does not jump.
   - `∀ x, ¬ JumpsWhenShooting x → CanBlockShootingOf Michael x`
6. Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
   - `¬ CanBlockShootingOf Michael Windy`
7. Jumpers are great shooters (but this doesn't affect blocking rules).

### Critical Deductions:
- From (5) and (6): Windy must jump when shooting (since Michael can't block), so `JumpsWhenShooting Windy`.
- To apply the blocking rule to Peter blocking Windy, we need:
  - Windy must be a man: Unknown.
  - Peter must be taller than Windy: Unknown (we only know Peter > Michael, but Michael's height vs. Windy is unknown).
- The blocking rule (1) does not mention jumping, so jumping doesn't necessarily prevent blocking by others (only Michael's blocking is jump-dependent).

### Lean Representation:
We model the entities and axioms. Because Windy's gender and height relative to Peter are unknown, we cannot prove or disprove the statement.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Michael : Person
axiom Peter : Person
axiom Windy : Person

axiom Man : Person → Prop
axiom MichaelMan : Man Michael
axiom PeterMan : Man Peter

-- Taller is transitive
axiom Taller : Person → Person → Prop
axiom Taller_Trans : ∀ x y z, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z

axiom PeterTallerMichael : Taller Peter Michael

axiom CanBlockShootingOf : Person → Person → Prop
axiom JumpsWhenShooting : Person → Prop

-- Blocking rule for men: taller can block shorter
axiom BlockRule : ∀ x y, Man x → Man y → Taller x y → CanBlockShootingOf x y

-- Michael can block non-jumpers
axiom MichaelBlocksNonJumpers : ∀ x, ¬ JumpsWhenShooting x → CanBlockShootingOf Michael x

-- Michael cannot block Windy
axiom MichaelCannotBlockWindy : ¬ CanBlockShootingOf Michael Windy

-- From MichaelCannotBlockWindy and MichaelBlocksNonJumpers, Windy jumps
theorem WindyJumps : JumpsWhenShooting Windy := 
  fun h : ¬JumpsWhenShooting Windy => 
    MichaelCannotBlockWindy (MichaelBlocksNonJumpers Windy h)

-- Jumpers are great shooters (not used in proof)
axiom JumpersAreGreat : ∀ x, JumpsWhenShooting x → GreatShooter x
axiom GreatShooter : Person → Prop  -- Placeholder, unused

-- The question: Can Peter block Windy?
-- This rests on two unknowns:
--    1. Man Windy?
--    2. Taller Peter Windy?
-- No axioms provide this information.

</lean>

### Conclusion:
- We cannot prove `CanBlockShootingOf Peter Windy` because:
  - Missing proof that Windy is a man (`Man Windy`).
  - Missing proof that Peter is taller than Windy (`Taller Peter Windy`).
- We cannot disprove it because:
  - Windy jumping doesn't prevent blocking by Peter (only Michael's blocking is affected).
  - There's no contradiction in Windy being a man and Peter taller than her, or alternative scenarios.

Thus, the statement is uncertain.

ANSWER: Uncertain

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors were due to two issues:
1. The proof of `WindyJumps` used a lambda expression that produced double negation instead of direct proof
2. The `GreatShooter` predicate was declared after its use in `JumpersAreGreat`

The corrected code:
- Uses `Classical.byContradiction` for the proof of Windy jumping
- Declares `GreatShooter` before `JumpersAreGreat`
- Maintains all context information while addressing compilation errors

The main question ("Peter can block Windy's shooting") remains uncertain because:
1. We don't know if Windy is a man (required by BlockRule)
2. We don't know if Peter is taller than Windy (required by BlockRule)
3. Windy's jumping status doesn't affect Peter's blocking ability (only Michael's)
4. No axioms connect Peter's height to Windy or specify Windy's gender

ANSWER: Uncertain
