ITERATION 2

The translation of the reasoning problem into Lean involves defining the necessary types, constants, predicates, and axioms based on the given context. The context provides geographical relationships and a transitive property for "located in." However, it does not include sufficient information about islands within Antarctica nor naming relationships beyond Barutin Cove and the Bulgarian settlement.

### Key Observations:
1. **Geographical relationships**:
   - Barutin Cove is located on Snow Island.
   - Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island are in the South Shetland Islands.
   - Antarctica is located in the South Shetland Islands.
   - The transitive property of "located in" forces that if \(A\) is in \(B\) and \(B\) is in \(C\), then \(A\) is in \(C\).

2. **Naming relationships**:
   - Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin, which is a specific entity.
   - The question asks if Barutin Cove is named after *all* islands in Antarctica.

3. **Analysis of the statement**:
   - To confirm the statement, we must prove:  
     \(\forall x\), if \(x\) is an island and \(x\) is in Antarctica, then Barutin Cove is named after \(x\).
   - No islands are confirmed to be in Antarctica.  
     Snow, Greenwich, and Deception Islands are in South Shetland, but not proven to be in Antarctica.
   - Named entities:
     - Barutin Cove is named after a Bulgarian settlement, so it cannot be confirmed or refuted that Barutin Cove is named after any specific island.
   - Vacuous truth is possible. If there are no islands in Antarctica, the statement holds trivially. However, this cannot be proven due to insufficient information.

  -- 1. Islands in Antarctica have not been explicitly identified.
  -- 2. NamedAfter relationship to islands is unknown.
  -- 3. Vacuous truth might hold but isn't provable.

```

### Conclusion:
- It is **impossible** to prove that Barutin Cove is named after all islands in Antarctica:
  - Islands (e.g., Snow Island) are not confirmed to be *in* Antarctica (only that both are in South Shetland).
  - Naming properties between Barutin Cove and Antarctic islands are unknown.
- The negation **cannot be proven** either since the lack of islands in Antarctica would make the statement vacuously true.
- Therefore, the answer is **Uncertain**.

ANSWER: Uncertain
