The given context provides information about the locations of Barutin Cove, Snow Island, the South Shetland Islands, and Antarctica, along with a transitive rule for "located in". However, the relationship between Antarctica and the South Shetland Islands is stated as "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands", which uses the phrase "located on" instead of "located in". The transitive rule only applies to "located in", and there is no axiom linking "located on" to "located in". Therefore, the relationship between Antarctica and the South Shetland Islands cannot be used in the transitive chain.

Barutin Cove is located in Snow Island (by being on its coast), and Snow Island is located in the South Shetland Islands. By transitivity, Barutin Cove is located in the South Shetland Islands. However, without a defined relationship (using "located in") between the South Shetland Islands and Antarctica, it is impossible to determine whether Barutin Cove is located in Antarctica or not. Consequently, the statement "Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica" cannot be proven true or false from the given information.

axiom Place : Type
axiom BarutinCove : Place
axiom SnowIsland : Place
axiom SouthShetland : Place
axiom Antarctica : Place

axiom LocatedIn : Place → Place → Prop
axiom trans : ∀ (A B C : Place), LocatedIn A B → LocatedIn B C → LocatedIn A C

axiom BC_in_Snow : LocatedIn BarutinCove SnowIsland
axiom Snow_in_SS : LocatedIn SnowIsland SouthShetland

-- No axiom for "Antarctica is located in SouthShetland" or vice versa using "LocatedIn"
-- The statement "Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands" is not translated to "LocatedIn" due to "on"

-- Cannot prove LocatedIn BarutinCove Antarctica or ¬LocatedIn BarutinCove Antarctica
