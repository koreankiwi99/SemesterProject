axiom obj : Type
axiom Affection : obj → Prop
axiom Love : obj → Prop
axiom Positive : obj → Prop

axiom some_affection_love : ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Love x
axiom some_love_positive : ∃ x, Love x ∧ Positive x

-- We cannot prove ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x from the given axioms
-- because the objects witnessing the existentials might be different.
-- Similarly, we cannot disprove it since the object with Affection and Love
-- might be the same as the one with Love and Positive (but we don't know).
