The context provides information about Peter's pets, including Rock. The key axioms are:
- All mammals among Peter's pets are animals.
- All monkeys are mammals.
- Every pet is either a monkey or a bird.
- Birds can fly.
- Animals that are pets can breathe.
- Pets that can fly have wings.
- Rock is a pet.
- Rock either can fly, is a bird, or cannot breathe.

To determine if Rock is a monkey:
- If Rock is a monkey, then Rock is a mammal (A2) and thus an animal (A1), so Rock can breathe (A5). Then axiom A8 reduces to "CanFly Rock ∨ Bird Rock" (since ¬CanBreathe Rock is false).
- If Rock is not a monkey, then by A3, Rock must be a bird.

However:
- There is no axiom stating monkeys cannot be birds (i.e., no disjointness), so Rock could be both a monkey and a bird.
- If Rock is a monkey (and possibly a bird), axiom A8 is satisfied if Rock is a bird or can fly. Monkeys flying is not contradicted, as no axiom prohibits monkeys from flying or having wings.
- If Rock is not a monkey, it must be a bird (from A3), which satisfies A8 via "Bird Rock".

No contradiction arises in either case. The axioms allow Rock to be a monkey (with or without being a bird) or exclusively a bird. Thus, it is uncertain whether Rock is a monkey.
