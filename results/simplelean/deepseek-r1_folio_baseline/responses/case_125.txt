Based on the given context, we translate the reasoning into Lean 4. The key predicates are: `Pet` (Peter's pet), `Mammal`, `Animal`, `Monkey`, `Bird`, `Fly`, `Breathe`, `Wings`. The entity is `Rock`.

-- All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.

-- All monkeys are mammals.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Monkey x → Mammal x
-- Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds.

-- Peter's birds can fly.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Pet x ∧ Bird x → Fly x
-- All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x ∧ Pet x → Breathe x
-- If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Pet x ∧ Fly x → Wings x
-- Rock is Peter's pet.

-- Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.

**Proof Explanation:**  
- Since Rock is Peter's pet (A7), by A3, Rock is either a monkey or a bird.  
- **Case 1 (Monkey)**:  
  - A2 implies Rock is a mammal.  
  - A1 (with Pet and Mammal) implies Rock is an animal.  
  - A5 (with Animal and Pet) implies Rock breathes.  
  - A8 states: Fly Rock ∨ Bird Rock ∨ ¬Breathe Rock. Since Rock breathes and isn't a bird (in this branch), Fly Rock must hold.  
  - A6 (with Pet and Fly) gives Wings Rock.  
- **Case 2 (Bird)**:  
  - A4 (with Pet and Bird) implies Fly Rock.  
  - A6 (with Pet and Fly) directly gives Wings Rock.  

Thus, Wings Rock is provable in all cases.  

ANSWER: True
