The reasoning from the context leads to the conclusion that Rock must have wings. Here's the step-by-step logic:

1. **Rock is Peter's pet** (given).
2. **Peter's pets are either monkeys or birds** (given). So Rock is a monkey or a bird.
3. **If Rock is a monkey**:
   - All monkeys are mammals (given), so Rock is a mammal.
   - All mammals that are Peter's pets are animals (given), so Rock is an animal.
   - All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe (given), so Rock can breathe.
   - The disjunction "Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe" (given) simplifies to "Rock can fly" (since Rock is not a bird in this case and can breathe).
   - If Rock can fly and is a pet, then Rock has wings (given).
4. **If Rock is a bird**:
   - Peter's birds can fly (given), so Rock can fly.
   - If Rock can fly and is a pet, then Rock has wings (given).
5. **In both cases (monkey or bird), Rock has wings**.

Therefore, the statement "Rock does not have wings" is **false**.
