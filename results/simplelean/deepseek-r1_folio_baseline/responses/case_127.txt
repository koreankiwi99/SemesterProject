The context provides several axioms about wedding planning, engagement, invitations, and family size, specifically regarding John. The key points are:
- There exists someone with a well-attended wedding and a larger family.
- John's engagement implies he does not both invite friends and make wedding plans.
- John having a larger family implies he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends.

However, no axiom forces John to have or not have a larger family. Models exist where John has a larger family (e.g., by inviting friends without being engaged) and where he does not (e.g., by having no well-attended wedding and not inviting friends). Thus, the statement about John's family size is uncertain.

axiom obj : Type
axiom John : obj
axiom Engaged : obj → Prop
axiom WeddingPlans : obj → Prop
axiom InviteOthers : obj → Prop
axiom WellAttendedWedding : obj → Prop
axiom LargerFamily : obj → Prop
axiom InviteFriends : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, WeddingPlans x → Engaged x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, InviteOthers x → WeddingPlans x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, WellAttendedWedding x → InviteOthers x
axiom A4 : ∃ x, WellAttendedWedding x ∧ LargerFamily x
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InviteFriends John ∧ WeddingPlans John)
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → WellAttendedWedding John ∨ InviteFriends John

-- Cannot prove LargerFamily John or ¬LargerFamily John from the axioms
