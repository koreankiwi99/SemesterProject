The context provides several statements about what sucks and what doesn't. Crucially, it states that a duster is a household appliance that does not suck. This directly contradicts the universal claim that "if something is a household appliance, it sucks," because the duster serves as a counterexample. Therefore, the statement is false.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Suck : obj → Prop
axiom HouseholdAppliance : obj → Prop
axiom Duster : obj
axiom duster_ha : HouseholdAppliance Duster
axiom duster_no_suck : ¬ Suck Duster

theorem household_appliance_not_always_suck : ¬ (∀ x, HouseholdAppliance x → Suck x) :=
  fun h => duster_no_suck (h Duster duster_ha)

ANSWER: False
