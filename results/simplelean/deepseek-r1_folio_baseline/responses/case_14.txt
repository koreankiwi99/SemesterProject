The context provides information about the Legend of Zelda and general rules about games. The key points are:
- The Legend of Zelda was created by a Japanese game company.
- All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese companies.
- Any game selling over one million copies is included in the Top 10 list.
- The Legend of Zelda sold over one million copies.

The question asks whether "The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list" is true, false, or uncertain.

From the axioms:
1. Selling over one million copies implies inclusion in the Top 10 list (axiom `over_million_top10`).
2. The Legend of Zelda sold over one million copies (axiom `zelda_sales`).
Therefore, the Legend of Zelda must be on the Top 10 list (`zelda_on_top10`).

The statement "The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list" is false because it directly contradicts the proven fact that the game is on the list.

<lean>
axiom Game : Type
axiom zelda : Game
axiom JapaneseMade : Game → Prop
axiom OnTop10 : Game → Prop
axiom SellsOverMillion : Game → Prop

axiom created : JapaneseMade zelda
axiom top10_japanese : ∀ g : Game, OnTop10 g → JapaneseMade g
axiom over_million_top10 : ∀ g : Game, SellsOverMillion g → OnTop10 g
axiom zelda_sales : SellsOverMillion zelda

theorem zelda_on_top10 : OnTop10 zelda := 
  over_million_top10 zelda zelda_sales

-- The question's statement: ¬OnTop10 zelda
-- We prove its negation (equivalent to OnTop10 zelda) to show the statement is false
theorem neg_question_statement : ¬ (¬ OnTop10 zelda) := 
  fun h => h zelda_on_top10

ANSWER: False
