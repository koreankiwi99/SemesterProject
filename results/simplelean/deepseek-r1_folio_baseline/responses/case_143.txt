Based on the provided context, I'll analyze the logical structure and translate it into Lean. The key elements are:

1. Breeding back involves selective breeding of domestic animals
2. Heck cattle were bred back to resemble aurochs
3. Heck cattle and aurochs are both animals
4. Some bred-back animals resemble extinct animals

The question asks whether aurochs are extinct.

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom BredBack : Animal → Prop
axiom Resemble : Animal → Animal → Prop
axiom Extinct : Animal → Prop

axiom heck_cattle : Animal
axiom aurochs : Animal

axiom bred_back_heck : BredBack heck_cattle
axiom resemble_heck_aurochs : Resemble heck_cattle aurochs
axiom some_resemble_extinct : ∃ (a : Animal), BredBack a ∧ ∃ (e : Animal), Extinct e ∧ Resemble a e

-- The question: Is aurochs extinct? (Extinct aurochs)

-- We cannot prove Extinct aurochs because:
-- 1. The existence of some bred-back animal resembling an extinct animal doesn't specify which extinct animal
-- 2. Heck cattle resemble aurochs, but this doesn't require aurochs to be extinct
-- 3. No information confirms or denies aurochs' extinction status

-- We also cannot prove ¬Extinct aurochs because:
-- 1. The context doesn't provide any information about aurochs still existing
-- 2. The resemblance to an extinct animal could potentially include aurochs but isn't specified

-- Therefore, we cannot prove either the statement or its negation
</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

Explanation: While Heck cattle resemble aurochs and some bred-back animals resemble extinct animals, this doesn't necessarily mean aurochs are extinct. The extinct animal referenced in the last premise could be different from aurochs. The context provides no direct information about aurochs' extinction status, making the claim unprovable with the given information.
