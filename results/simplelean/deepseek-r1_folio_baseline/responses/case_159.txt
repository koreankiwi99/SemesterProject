The reasoning involves translating the given statements into logical axioms and proving whether James takes the database course based on those axioms.

### Key Steps:
1. **Axioms Interpretation**:
   - No library workers are CS students: `∀x, WorksInLibrary x → ¬FromCS x`
   - Part-time job holders work in the library: `∀x, HasPTJob x → WorksInLibrary x`
   - Database course takers are CS students: `∀x, TakesDatabase x → FromCS x`
   - Students with Professor David take the database course: `∀x, TakesClassWithDavid x → TakesDatabase x`
   - Lab workers take classes with Professor David: `∀x, WorksInLab x → TakesClassWithDavid x`
   - James works in the lab: `WorksInLab James`
   - James does not work in the lab **or** does not have a part-time job: `¬WorksInLab James ∨ ¬HasPTJob James`

2. **Resolution of Disjunction**:
   - Since `WorksInLab James` is true (from axiom), the disjunction `¬WorksInLab James ∨ ¬HasPTJob James` forces `¬HasPTJob James` to be true (as the first disjunct is false). However, this is not needed for the proof.

3. **Proof Path**:
   - James works in the lab (`WorksInLab James`).
   - Lab workers take classes with Professor David (axiom): `TakesClassWithDavid James`.
   - Students with Professor David take the database course (axiom): `TakesDatabase James`.

4. **Contradiction Check**:
   - No axioms link James to library work (since he lacks a part-time job), so no conflict with `FromCS James` (derived from `TakesDatabase James`).

axiom TakesClassWithDavid : Student → Prop
axiom WorksInLab : Student → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, WorksInLibrary x → ¬ FromCS x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, HasPTJob x → WorksInLibrary x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, TakesDatabase x → FromCS x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, TakesClassWithDavid x → TakesDatabase x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, WorksInLab x → TakesClassWithDavid x
axiom A6 : WorksInLab James
axiom A7 : ¬ WorksInLab James ∨ ¬ HasPTJob James

theorem james_takes_database : TakesDatabase James := by
  apply A4  -- Uses A4: TakesClassWithDavid James → TakesDatabase James
  apply A5  -- Uses A5: WorksInLab James → TakesClassWithDavid James
