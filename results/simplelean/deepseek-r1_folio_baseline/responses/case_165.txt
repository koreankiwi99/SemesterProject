The reasoning shows that Breaking Bad cannot give out roses because it would lead to a contradiction. If roses were given out during Breaking Bad, then by the given axioms, Breaking Bad would be an episode of The Bachelor (from axiom R1). Since The Bachelor portrays real people (axiom R2), it would be a reality TV show (axiom R3). However, Breaking Bad is explicitly stated not to be a reality TV show (axiom T2), creating a contradiction. Therefore, the antecedent "roses are given out during Breaking Bad" is always false, making the entire implication "if roses are given out during Breaking Bad, then it is on Monday at 8 pm" vacuously true.

axiom Rose : obj → Prop
axiom Monday8 : obj → Prop
axiom Bachelor : obj → Prop
axiom PortraysReal : obj → Prop
axiom Reality : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∃ x, Monday8 x ∧ Rose x
axiom R1 : ∀ x, Rose x → Bachelor x
axiom R2 : ∀ x, Bachelor x → PortraysReal x
axiom R3 : ∀ x, PortraysReal x → Reality x
axiom T2 : ¬Reality breakingBad

theorem breakingBad_rose_implies_monday8 : Rose breakingBad → Monday8 breakingBad :=
  fun h_rose =>
    have H_bachelor : Bachelor breakingBad := R1 breakingBad h_rose
    have H_portrays : PortraysReal breakingBad := R2 breakingBad H_bachelor
    have H_reality : Reality breakingBad := R3 breakingBad H_portrays
