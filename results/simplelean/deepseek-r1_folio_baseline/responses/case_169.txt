The context provides information about deadly diseases, severe cancers, bile duct cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, mild flu, and colorectal cancer. The key points are:
- Deadly diseases have low survival rates.
- Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
- Bile duct cancer is a severe cancer.
- Cholangiocarcinoma is a type of bile duct cancer.
- Mild flu has a low survival rate (but is not necessarily a deadly disease).
- Colorectal cancer is not both bile duct cancer and low survival rate.

The question asks whether colorectal cancer is a severe cancer. From the axioms:
- If colorectal cancer were severe, it would have low survival rate (from severe → deadly → low survival rate). Then axiom 6 implies it cannot be bile duct cancer. However, there's no requirement that severe cancers must be bile duct cancers, so this is consistent but not enforced.
- If colorectal cancer is not severe, this is also consistent since no axiom forces it to be severe. Mild flu shows low survival rates can occur without severe cancer.

Neither `SevereCancer colorectal_cancer` nor its negation can be proven from the given axioms.

axiom obj : Type

axiom colorectal_cancer : obj
axiom mild_flu : obj

axiom DeadlyDisease : obj → Prop
axiom LowSurvivalRate : obj → Prop
axiom SevereCancer : obj → Prop
axiom BileDuctCancer : obj → Prop
axiom Cholangiocarcinoma : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, DeadlyDisease x → LowSurvivalRate x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, SevereCancer x → DeadlyDisease x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x
axiom A5 : LowSurvivalRate mild_flu
axiom A6 : ¬ (BileDuctCancer colorectal_cancer ∧ LowSurvivalRate colorectal_cancer)

-- Cannot prove or disprove SevereCancer colorectal_cancer
