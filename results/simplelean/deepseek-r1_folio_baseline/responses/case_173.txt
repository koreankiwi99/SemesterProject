The reasoning text is translated into Lean code to analyze the statement about Taylor. The context provides several logical relationships and a disjunction about Taylor's background. The key steps are:

1. The disjunction about Taylor: She either (a) grew up in a health-conscious home and disregards her physical well-being, or (b) did neither.
2. Case (a) leads to a contradiction: 
   - If Taylor has a health-conscious home, she eats salads regularly (Axiom 2), making her health-conscious (Axiom 1).
   - But if she disregards her well-being, she is not health-conscious (Axiom 4), creating a contradiction.
3. Thus, case (b) must hold: Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious home and does not disregard her well-being.
4. Now, consider the gym statement: If Taylor visited the gym daily, she would fulfill her nutritional intake (Axiom 5), implying she grew up in a health-conscious home (Axiom 3).
5. But we know she did not grow up in a health-conscious home, so she cannot visit the gym daily.

Therefore, the statement "Taylor visits the gym at least once a day" is false.
