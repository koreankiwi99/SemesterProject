The reasoning involves deducing Rockie's attributes from the given context. Rockie is spotted near the campus and calm. The only animals spotted are rabbits or squirrels. If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish (since all spotted squirrels are skittish), and skittish animals are not calm, contradicting Rockie's calmness. Thus, Rockie must be a rabbit. All spotted rabbits are cute, so Rockie is cute. Therefore, "Rockie is a turtle or cute" is true because Rockie is cute.
