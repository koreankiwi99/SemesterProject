axiom Person : Type
axiom Tom : Person
axiom Grumpy : Person → Prop
axiom Mean : Person → Prop
axiom Nice : Person → Prop
axiom AnimalLover : Person → Prop
axiom PetOwner : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, Nice x → ¬ Mean x
axiom A2 : ∃ x, Grumpy x ∧ Mean x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, AnimalLover x → Nice x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, PetOwner x → AnimalLover x
axiom A5 : PetOwner Tom

-- Derive known facts about Tom
theorem Tom_AnimalLover : AnimalLover Tom := A4 Tom A5
theorem Tom_Nice : Nice Tom := A3 Tom Tom_AnimalLover
theorem Tom_not_Mean : ¬ Mean Tom := A1 Tom Tom_Nice

-- We cannot prove Grumpy Tom or ¬Grumpy Tom
example : Grumpy Tom → False := by
  intro h
  -- We know Tom isn't mean, but no contradiction with grumpiness alone
  -- A2 shows existence of some grumpy+mean person, not that all grumpy are mean
  sorry  -- Cannot prove

example : ¬ Grumpy Tom → False := by
  intro h
  -- No axiom prevents Tom from being grumpy while not being mean
  sorry  -- Cannot prove
