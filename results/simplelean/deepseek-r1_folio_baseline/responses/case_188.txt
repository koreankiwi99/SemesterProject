The reasoning establishes that if Yuri were a professional basketball player, then he would activate his leg muscles. However, given that he does not activate his leg muscles, he cannot be a professional basketball player. Therefore, regardless of whether Yuri is American, he cannot be an American professional basketball player. This makes the statement "Yuri is not an American professional basketball player" true.

The compilation errors occurred because the axioms `A2`, `A3`, and `A4` require both an object of type `obj` and a proof of the premise. In the original code, only the premise proof was provided without specifying the object (`Yuri`). The corrected code explicitly applies each axiom to `Yuri` followed by the premise proof.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Yuri : obj
axiom ProfessionalBasketballPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom American : obj → Prop
axiom JumpShots : obj → Prop
axiom LeapAir : obj → Prop
axiom ActivateLegMuscles : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∃ x, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x ∧ ¬ American x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x → JumpShots x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, JumpShots x → LeapAir x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, LeapAir x → ActivateLegMuscles x
axiom A5 : ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri

theorem Yuri_not_pro_basketball : ¬ ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri := 
  fun hPlayer : ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri =>
    have hJump : JumpShots Yuri := A2 Yuri hPlayer
    have hLeap : LeapAir Yuri := A3 Yuri hJump
    have hActivate : ActivateLegMuscles Yuri := A4 Yuri hLeap
    absurd hActivate A5

theorem Yuri_not_American_pro : ¬ (ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri) := 
  fun ⟨hPlayer, _⟩ => Yuri_not_pro_basketball hPlayer
</lean>

The proof shows:
1. If Yuri were a professional basketball player (`hPlayer`), then by `A2` he could do jump shots (`hJump`).
2. By `A3`, jump shots imply leaping straight into the air (`hLeap`).
3. By `A4`, leaping implies activating leg muscles (`hActivate`).
4. This contradicts `A5` (Yuri doesn't activate leg muscles), proving Yuri cannot be a professional basketball player (`Yuri_not_pro_basketball`).
5. Thus, Yuri cannot be both a professional basketball player and American (`Yuri_not_American_pro`).

The statement "Yuri is not an American professional basketball player" is **true** because Yuri cannot be a professional basketball player at all (regardless of nationality).
