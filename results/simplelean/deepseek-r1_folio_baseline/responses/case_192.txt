The context states that events are either happy or sad (inclusive or, meaning an event could be both) and that at least one event is happy. The question asks whether all events are sad. 

- **Inclusive "or" interpretation**: An event can be happy, sad, or both. Since there is at least one happy event, it might also be sad (allowing the possibility that all events are sad if every event, including the happy one, is sad). However, there might exist an event that is happy but not sad, which would contradict "all events are sad." Without information forcing mutual exclusivity or specifying that the happy event is not sad, neither the statement nor its negation can be proven.

- **Formalization**: 
  - `Event` is the type of events.
  - `Happy` and `Sad` are properties of events.
  - Axiom 1: Every event is happy or sad (or both).
  - Axiom 2: There exists at least one happy event.
  - The statement "all events are sad" (`∀ e, Sad e`) cannot be proven or disproven from these axioms.

<lean>
axiom Event : Type
axiom Happy : Event → Prop
axiom Sad : Event → Prop
axiom A1 : ∀ e : Event, Happy e ∨ Sad e
axiom A2 : ∃ e : Event, Happy e

-- Cannot prove ∀ e, Sad e because the happy event might also be sad (allowing all events to be sad).
-- Cannot prove ¬(∀ e, Sad e) because there might be no event that is exclusively happy (not sad).
-- Example consistent model 1 (all events sad): one event that is both happy and sad.
-- Example consistent model 2 (not all sad): one happy-not-sad event and one sad event.
