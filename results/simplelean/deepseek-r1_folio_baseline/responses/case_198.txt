The context states that Ailton Silva is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Náutico. This directly contradicts the statement "No one playing for Nautico is Brazilian," as Ailton Silva is both Brazilian and plays for Náutico. Therefore, the statement is false.

<lean>
axiom Player : Type
axiom Club : Type
axiom ailton : Player
axiom nautico : Club
axiom Brazilian : Player → Prop
axiom playsFor : Player → Club → Prop

axiom T1 : Brazilian ailton
axiom T2 : playsFor ailton nautico

theorem not_no_Brazilian_at_Nautico : ¬ (∀ p : Player, playsFor p nautico → ¬ Brazilian p) :=
  fun H => 
    have H1 : playsFor ailton nautico → ¬ Brazilian ailton := H ailton
    have H2 : ¬ Brazilian ailton := H1 T2
    H2 T1

ANSWER: False
