The context states that Ailton was loaned out to Braga and that Braga is a football club. Therefore, Ailton was loaned out to a football club (Braga). The statement "Ailton was not loaned out to a football club" is false.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Ailton : obj
axiom Braga : obj
axiom FootballClub : obj → Prop
axiom LoanedTo : obj → obj → Prop
axiom loaned_to_braga : LoanedTo Ailton Braga
axiom braga_club : FootballClub Braga

theorem disprove_statement : ¬¬∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedTo Ailton c :=
  fun h => h (by exists Braga; exact ⟨braga_club, loaned_to_braga⟩)

-- The original statement is: ¬∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedTo Ailton c
-- We have proved ¬¬∃ c, ... which refutes the original statement.

ANSWER: False
