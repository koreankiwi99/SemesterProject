Based on the context, we can prove that Djokovic lives in a tax haven using the provided information. Here's the formalization and proof in Lean:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Djokovic : Person
axiom GrandSlamChampion : Person → Prop
axiom OscarNominatedActor : Person → Prop
axiom ProfessionalTennisPlayer : Person → Prop
axiom Celebrity : Person → Prop
axiom Athlete : Person → Prop
axiom WellPaid : Person → Prop
axiom Famous : Person → Prop
axiom LivesInTaxHaven : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ p : Person, GrandSlamChampion p ∨ OscarNominatedActor p
axiom A2 : ∀ p : Person, GrandSlamChampion p → ProfessionalTennisPlayer p
axiom A3 : ∀ p : Person, OscarNominatedActor p → Celebrity p
axiom A4 : ∀ p : Person, ProfessionalTennisPlayer p → Athlete p
axiom A5 : ∀ p : Person, Celebrity p → WellPaid p
axiom A6 : ∀ p : Person, Athlete p → Famous p
axiom A7 : ∀ p : Person, WellPaid p → LivesInTaxHaven p
axiom A8 : (Famous Djokovic ∧ Athlete Djokovic) → WellPaid Djokovic

theorem djokovic_tax_haven : LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic := by
  have h1 := A1 Djokovic
  cases h1 with
  | inl gsc =>
    have ptp := A2 Djokovic gsc
    have ath := A4 Djokovic ptp
    have fam := A6 Djokovic ath
    have wp := A8 ⟨fam, ath⟩
    exact A7 Djokovic wp
  | inr ona =>
    have cel := A3 Djokovic ona
    have wp := A5 Djokovic cel
    exact A7 Djokovic wp
</lean>

ANSWER: True
