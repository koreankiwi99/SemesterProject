The Lean code formalizes the given context and checks the statement "A design by Max is evocative and dreamy." The context provides information only about designs that Max adores, but the statement does not specify whether the design is adored by Max. Without this information, and since the context does not provide any properties for designs not adored by Max, it is impossible to prove or disprove the existential statement about a design by Max being evocative and dreamy. The Lean code reflects this by showing no axioms relate `ByMax` to `Evocative` or `Dreamy` without `Adores`.

<lean>
axiom Design : Type
axiom ZahaStyle : Design → Prop
axiom KellyStyle : Design → Prop
axiom Brutalist : Design → Prop
axiom InterestingGeometry : Design → Prop
axiom Evocative : Design → Prop
axiom Dreamy : Design → Prop
axiom Adores : Design → Prop
axiom ByMax : Design → Prop

axiom axiom1 : ∀ x, ZahaStyle x ∧ Adores x → InterestingGeometry x
axiom axiom2 : ∀ x, Brutalist x ∧ Adores x → ¬ InterestingGeometry x
axiom axiom3 : ∀ x, Adores x → ZahaStyle x ∨ KellyStyle x
axiom axiom4 : ∀ x, KellyStyle x ∧ Adores x → Evocative x
axiom axiom5 : ∀ x, KellyStyle x ∧ Adores x → Dreamy x
axiom axiom6 : ∀ x, ByMax x ∧ Adores x ∧ InterestingGeometry x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- The statement: ∃ x, ByMax x ∧ Evocative x ∧ Dreamy x
-- Cannot be proven or disproven because:
-- 1. The context only provides properties for designs adored by Max.
-- 2. There is no information about designs by Max that are not adored.
-- 3. The axioms do not constrain properties of non-ador designs.
