Based on the provided context and question, I've translated the reasoning into Lean 4 syntax. The analysis shows that Coco Gauff must be among the most active players.

<lean>
axiom Player : Type
axiom Coco : Player
axiom RankedHighWTA : Player → Prop
axiom MostActive : Player → Prop
axiom LostToIga : Player → Prop
axiom LostToRafa : Player → Prop
axiom Female : Player → Prop
axiom Male : Player → Prop
axiom AtRG2022 : Player → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, RankedHighWTA x → MostActive x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, LostToIga x → RankedHighWTA x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, (Female x ∧ AtRG2022 x) → LostToIga x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, AtRG2022 x → Female x ∨ Male x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, (Male x ∧ AtRG2022 x) → LostToRafa x
axiom A6 : (RankedHighWTA Coco ∨ LostToRafa Coco) → ¬(Male Coco ∧ AtRG2022 Coco)
axiom A7 : AtRG2022 Coco

theorem Coco_active : MostActive Coco := by
  have gender := A4 Coco A7
  cases gender with
  | inl female =>
    apply A1 Coco
    apply A2 Coco
    exact A3 Coco ⟨female, A7⟩
  | inr male =>
    have rafa_loss := A5 Coco ⟨male, A7⟩
    have not_male := A6 (Or.inr rafa_loss)
    have male_at : Male Coco ∧ AtRG2022 Coco := ⟨male, A7⟩
    contradiction

ANSWER: True
