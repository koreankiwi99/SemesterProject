The reasoning involves cities and states in the U.S. Butte is in Montana (given explicitly). St Pierre is not in Montana (given explicitly). Additionally, the rule states that a city can only be in one state unless it is an exception (Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma, or Union City). Butte and St Pierre are not listed as exceptions, so each must be in exactly one state. Since Butte is in Montana and St Pierre is not in Montana, they cannot be in the same state. Therefore, the statement "Butte and St Pierre are in the same state" is false.

ITERATION 2

The compilation errors occurred due to missing type annotations for the state variables in the uniqueness axioms. The corrected code explicitly types `s1` and `s2` as `State` in the uniqueness axioms for Butte and St Pierre. The proof demonstrates that Butte and St Pierre cannot be in the same state because:
1. Butte is in Montana (`butte_in_montana`)
2. St Pierre is not in Montana (`st_pierre_not_in_montana`)
3. Butte can only be in one state (`unique_state_for_butte`)
4. If they shared a state, that state would have to be Montana (contradicting St Pierre's location)

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the constants and axioms were not properly structured, and the type system had difficulty inferring types. The corrected code uses a single type `obj` to represent both cities and states, with predicates to distinguish between them. The proof demonstrates that Butte and St Pierre cannot be in the same state because:
1. Butte is in Montana (`butte_in_montana`)
2. St Pierre is not in Montana (`st_pierre_not_in_montana`)
3. Butte can only be in one state (`unique_state_for_butte`)
4. If they shared a state, that state would have to be Montana (contradicting St Pierre's location)
