The information provided does not mention Bismarck at all. We know St Pierre is not in Montana, but we have no information about Bismarck's state. Without any details linking Bismarck to St Pierre or to any state that would confirm or deny they share the same state, it is impossible to determine the truth value of the statement.

ANSWER: Uncertain

The compilation error occurred because the equality direction from `city_in_one_state` was not handled correctly. The axiom `city_in_one_state` produces `Montana = s` when applied to Butte, but we needed `s = Montana` for rewriting. This was fixed by using `Eq.symm` to reverse the equality.

However, the main issue remains: there is no information about Bismarck's state. We know St Pierre is not in Montana, but without knowing Bismarck's state, we cannot determine if they share a state.
