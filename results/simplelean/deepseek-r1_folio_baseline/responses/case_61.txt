Based on the context, we analyze the logical structure:

1. All international students have either F1 or J1 visa (exclusive? Context doesn't specify mutual exclusivity, but doesn't prohibit both either)
2. F1 students must apply for CPT/OPT to work
3. Mike is an international student
4. Mike must apply for CPT to work

The key point: While we know Mike must apply for CPT to work, this requirement is explicitly stated for F1 students. However:
- For F1 students: CPT requirement satisfies the "CPT or OPT" condition
- For J1 students: No information about work requirements exists in the context

Thus:
- Mike could be F1 (consistent with CPT requirement)
- Mike could be J1 (CPT requirement doesn't contradict any known rules)

Therefore, we cannot prove Mike has a J1 visa, nor can we prove he doesn't have one.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Mike : obj
axiom InternationalStudent : obj → Prop
axiom F1 : obj → Prop
axiom J1 : obj → Prop
axiom WantsToWork : obj → Prop
axiom CPT : obj → Prop
axiom OPT : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, InternationalStudent x → F1 x ∨ J1 x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, (InternationalStudent x ∧ F1 x) → (WantsToWork x → (CPT x ∨ OPT x))
axiom A3 : InternationalStudent Mike
axiom A4 : ∀ (h : WantsToWork Mike), CPT Mike

-- Cannot prove J1 Mike nor ¬J1 Mike
-- Case 1: Mike has F1 visa
--   Then A2 applies: WantsToWork Mike → CPT Mike ∨ OPT Mike
--   But A4 gives CPT Mike which satisfies the disjunction
-- Case 2: Mike has J1 visa
--   Then A2 doesn't apply, and A4 stands without contradiction
