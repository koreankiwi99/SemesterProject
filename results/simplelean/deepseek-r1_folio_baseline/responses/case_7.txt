Based on the context, we need to determine if "No one gets the flu" is true, false, or uncertain. The relevant information includes:
- Monkeypox symptoms include tiredness
- People feel tired when they get the flu
- No information connects Monkeypox to flu causation
- No information about actual flu occurrences

Lean modeling:
- Define `Being` as the type of entities
- Predicates for properties: `MonkeypoxVirusOccurs`, `GetsMonkeypox`, `Animal`, `Mammal`, `Human`, `Tired`, `GetsFlu`
- Axioms based on context:
  1. Monkeypox causes tiredness
  2. Flu causes tiredness in humans
  3. Humans are mammals, mammals are animals
  4. Monkeypox virus occurs in some animals
- No axioms about flu occurrence

<lean>
axiom Being : Type
axiom MonkeypoxVirusOccurs : Being → Prop
axiom GetsMonkeypox : Being → Prop
axiom Animal : Being → Prop
axiom Mammal : Being → Prop
axiom Human : Being → Prop
axiom Tired : Being → Prop
axiom GetsFlu : Being → Prop

-- If Monkeypox virus occurs, being may get Monkeypox (interpreted as implication)
axiom Ax1 : ∀ b : Being, MonkeypoxVirusOccurs b → GetsMonkeypox b
-- Monkeypox virus occurs in some animals
axiom Ax2 : ∃ b : Being, Animal b ∧ MonkeypoxVirusOccurs b
-- Humans are mammals and mammals are animals
axiom Ax3 : ∀ b : Being, Human b → Mammal b
axiom Ax4 : ∀ b : Being, Mammal b → Animal b
-- Monkeypox causes tiredness
axiom Ax5 : ∀ b : Being, GetsMonkeypox b → Tired b
-- Flu causes tiredness in humans
axiom Ax6 : ∀ b : Being, Human b → GetsFlu b → Tired b

-- Statement: No one gets the flu (∀ b, ¬GetsFlu b)
-- No axioms provide information about flu occurrence
</lean>

Analysis:
- We have no axioms stating that anyone gets the flu
- We have no axioms stating that no one gets the flu
- The tiredness connection is irrelevant to flu occurrence
- Therefore, we can neither prove "no one gets the flu" nor its negation

ANSWER: Uncertain
