The given context leads to an inconsistency in the premises, specifically regarding Hannah's need to earn money. On one hand, axiom R1 and the first part of T7 imply that Hannah needs to earn money because she works a student job. On the other hand, the implication in T7 (the second part) leads to a contradiction if Hannah needs money, forcing the conclusion that she does not need money. This contradiction means we can prove both that Hannah needs money and that she does not need money from the premises. Therefore, the truth value of the statement "Hannah needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition" cannot be consistently determined.

axiom Person : Type
axiom WorksJob : Person → Prop
axiom NeedsMoney : Person → Prop
axiom OrdersTakeout : Person → Prop
axiom EnjoysDining : Person → Prop
axiom PickyEater : Person → Prop
axiom SpendsTimeEating : Person → Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ p : Person, WorksJob p → NeedsMoney p
axiom R2 : ∀ p : Person, OrdersTakeout p → WorksJob p
axiom R3 : ∀ p : Person, OrdersTakeout p ∨ EnjoysDining p
axiom R4 : ∀ p : Person, EnjoysDining p → ¬ PickyEater p
axiom R5 : ∀ p : Person, EnjoysDining p → SpendsTimeEating p

axiom Hannah : Person

axiom T7 : WorksJob Hannah ∧ (NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah))

-- Proof that Hannah needs money (from R1 and T7)
theorem needs_money : NeedsMoney Hannah := R1 Hannah T7.1

-- Proof that Hannah does not need money (from T7)
theorem not_needs_money : ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah := 
  fun h => 
    have h2 := T7.2 h
    h2.2 h

-- Contradiction arising from the premises
theorem contradiction : False := not_needs_money needs_money

-- Since we can prove both the statement and its negation, the premises are inconsistent.
