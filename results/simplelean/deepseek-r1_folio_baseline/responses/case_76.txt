The given context leads to a contradiction when combined with the information about Hannah. Specifically:

- From axiom A1 and Hannah being at Mary's school (A6) and working a student job (A7.left), we deduce that Hannah needs money: `NeedsMoney Hannah`.
- From axiom A7, if Hannah needs money, then she is not picky and does not need money: `NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬Picky Hannah ∧ ¬NeedsMoney Hannah)`.
- Applying this to `NeedsMoney Hannah` gives `¬NeedsMoney Hannah`, which contradicts `NeedsMoney Hannah`.

This contradiction makes the entire axiom set inconsistent. In an inconsistent system, any statement (including the one about Hannah) can be proven true using the principle of explosion. Therefore, the statement "Hannah is at Mary's school and she is not a picky eater and spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls" is provable from the given axioms.

axiom WorksJob : Person → Prop
axiom NeedsMoney : Person → Prop
axiom OrderTakeout : Person → Prop
axiom EnjoysDining : Person → Prop
axiom Picky : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ p, MarysSchool p → (WorksJob p → NeedsMoney p)
axiom A2 : ∀ p, MarysSchool p → (OrderTakeout p → WorksJob p)
axiom A3 : ∀ p, MarysSchool p → (OrderTakeout p ∨ EnjoysDining p)
axiom A4 : ∀ p, MarysSchool p → (EnjoysDining p → ¬ Picky p)
axiom A5 : ∀ p, MarysSchool p → (EnjoysDining p → SpendsTime p)
axiom A6 : MarysSchool Hannah
axiom A7 : WorksJob Hannah ∧ (NeedsMoney Hannah → (¬ Picky Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah))

theorem hannah_statement : MarysSchool Hannah ∧ ¬ Picky Hannah ∧ SpendsTime Hannah := by
  have H1 : NeedsMoney Hannah := A1 Hannah A6 A7.left
  have H2 : ¬ NeedsMoney Hannah := (A7.right H1).right
  contradiction
