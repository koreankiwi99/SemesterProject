The context provides information about Monkeypox symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness. It also states that people feel tired when they get the flu, but this does not relate to Monkeypox symptoms. There is no mention of coughing being a symptom of Monkeypox, nor is there any information indicating that the provided list of symptoms is exhaustive. Therefore, we cannot prove that coughing is a symptom of Monkeypox, nor can we prove that it is not.
