The context states that "Books contain tons of knowledge," which universally quantifies that all books contain knowledge. Since Walden is explicitly referred to as "the book Walden," it is a book. Therefore, Walden must contain knowledge.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Book : Type
axiom Harry : Person
axiom Walden : Book
axiom ContainsKnowledge : Book → Prop
axiom Read : Person → Book → Prop
axiom GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop
axiom BecomeSmarter : Person → Prop

-- Books contain tons of knowledge (all books contain knowledge)
axiom A1 : ∀ b : Book, ContainsKnowledge b
-- Reading a book causes the person to gain knowledge
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), Read p b → GainsKnowledge p
-- Gaining knowledge causes the person to become smarter
axiom A3 : ∀ p : Person, GainsKnowledge p → BecomeSmarter p
-- Harry read Walden
axiom A4 : Read Harry Walden

-- Prove Walden contains knowledge
theorem walden_has_knowledge : ContainsKnowledge Walden := by
  apply A1  -- Since Walden is a book, A1 directly applies
