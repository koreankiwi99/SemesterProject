The reasoning involves proving that the statement "The Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations and is a private company" is false. This is achieved by showing that assuming the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company leads to a contradiction with the given axioms. Specifically:

1. If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is a private company (assumption), then by axiom A3, it is a company.
2. By axiom A2, being a company implies it is a business organization.
3. By axiom A1, being a business organization implies it is a legal entity.
4. By axiom A4, being a legal entity implies it is created under law.
5. By axiom A6, being created under law implies it is not a private company.
6. This contradicts the initial assumption, proving that the Harvard Weekly Book Club cannot be a private company.

Since the second conjunct ("is a private company") is false, the entire conjunction is false. The Lean code formalizes this reasoning and proves the negation of the statement.
