The Lean formalization captures the given context and the question about Harry. The axioms are:

1. Every animal is either an invertebrate or a vertebrate.
2. Any entity with a backbone reproduces by mating.
3. Vertebrate animals have a backbone.
4. Bees do not reproduce by mating.
5. Queen bees are bees.
6. Harry is a bee.

The query is whether Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee. The reasoning shows:

- If Harry were a vertebrate, it would have a backbone (by axiom 3) and thus reproduce by mating (by axiom 2). However, Harry is a bee and does not reproduce by mating (by axiom 4), leading to a contradiction. Thus, Harry cannot be a vertebrate.
- For Harry to be an invertebrate, Harry must be an animal (by axiom 1). However, the context does not state that bees are animals. Without this link, we cannot confirm Harry is an animal, hence cannot conclude Harry is an invertebrate.
- Harry is a bee (by axiom 6), but there is no information that Harry is a queen bee (axiom 5 only states queen bees are bees, not vice versa).

Thus, the disjunction (invertebrate or queen bee) cannot be proven true or false from the axioms. Both possibilities remain consistent with the axioms, so the statement is uncertain.

axiom A1 : ∀ x, Animal x → (Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x)
axiom A2 : ∀ x, HasBackbone x → ReproduceByMating x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, Animal x → (Vertebrate x → HasBackbone x)
axiom A4 : ∀ x, Bee x → ¬ ReproduceByMating x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, QueenBee x → Bee x
axiom A6 : Bee Harry

-- The theorem to prove: Invertebrate Harry ∨ QueenBee Harry
-- Cannot be proven due to missing link between Bee and Animal.
-- Counterexample: Harry is a bee but not an animal and not a queen bee.
-- Thus, neither the statement nor its negation is provable.
