The context explicitly states that the GRE test costs $205 and that this amount is cheaper than $300. The question asks whether it costs below $300 to take the GRE test. Since $205 is less than $300, this statement is directly supported by the given information. The additional details about Tom and financial aid are irrelevant to the base cost of the test.

axiom cost_gre : gre_cost = 205
theorem cost_below_300 : gre_cost < 300 := by rw [cost_gre]; decide
