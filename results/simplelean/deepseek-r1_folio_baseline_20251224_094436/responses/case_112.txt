The context states that the Picuris Mountains are located in either New Mexico or Texas. Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains, which contain the donated Harding Pegmatite Mine. However, the last axiom asserts that no mountain ranges in Texas have mines that have been donated. This leads to a contradiction if the Picuris Mountains were in Texas, as it would imply a donated mine in Texas. Therefore, the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico.

While Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains, which are in New Mexico, there is no information about visits to other mountain ranges in Texas. The context does not preclude the possibility that Juan de Onate also visited a mountain range in Texas that does not possess a donated mine, nor does it confirm that such visits occurred. Thus, neither the statement nor its negation can be proven with the given information.

</lean>

ANSWER: Uncertain

Explanation:
- We proved Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico (not Texas)
- Juan visited Picuris Mountains, but this doesn't count for Texas
- There's no information about Juan visiting other mountain ranges in Texas
- The last axiom only prevents Texas ranges with donated mines, but doesn't prevent:
  - Texas ranges without mines
  - Texas ranges with mines that weren't donated
  - Juan visiting such ranges
Thus we cannot determine if Juan visited a Texas mountain range.
