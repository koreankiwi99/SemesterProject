The context states that the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico or Texas, the Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in these mountains and was donated, and that no mountain range in Texas has donated mines. 

If the Picuris Mountains were in Texas, they would contradict the given axiom since the mine is donated. Therefore, the mountains must be in New Mexico. Thus, the mine is located in a mountain range in New Mexico, making the statement false.
