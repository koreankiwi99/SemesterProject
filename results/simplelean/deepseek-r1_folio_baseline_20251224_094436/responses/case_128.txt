The context provides information about wedding-related actions and family size, but does not directly specify John's situation. The axioms establish relationships between engagement, wedding planning, invitations, attendance, and family size. However:

1. Axiom 4 confirms that *some* people with well-attended weddings have larger families, but this doesn't necessarily include John.
2. Axiom 6 states that if John has a larger family, he either has a well-attended wedding or invites friends. Neither outcome leads to a contradiction:
   - If John has a well-attended wedding, the chain (A3→A2→A1) implies he is engaged, and A5 prevents him from both inviting friends and making plans. Since he must make plans (via A3/A2), he cannot invite friends—but this is consistent.
   - If John invites friends, A5 only restricts him if he's engaged, but engagement isn't forced in this case.
3. No axiom forces John to have a larger family or its negation. The existential in A4 doesn't constrain John specifically.

Thus, we can neither prove that John has a larger family nor that he doesn't.

axiom Engaged : Person → Prop
axiom InviteOthers : Person → Prop
axiom WellAttendedWedding : Person → Prop

axiom InviteFriends : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, WeddingPlans x → Engaged x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, InviteOthers x → WeddingPlans x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, WellAttendedWedding x → InviteOthers x
axiom A4 : ∃ x : Person, WellAttendedWedding x ∧ LargerFamily x
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InviteFriends John ∧ WeddingPlans John)
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttendedWedding John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- Cannot prove ¬LargerFamily John or LargerFamily John
