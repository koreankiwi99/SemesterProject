The context provides information about the Legend of Zelda and general rules about games, but does not mention FIFA 22. Specifically:
- The Legend of Zelda was created by a Japanese company and sold over one million copies.
- Any game selling over one million copies is on the Top 10 list.
- All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese companies.

However, there is no information about FIFA 22's sales, Top 10 status, or manufacturer. Thus, we cannot determine whether FIFA 22 is made by a Japanese company based solely on the given information.
