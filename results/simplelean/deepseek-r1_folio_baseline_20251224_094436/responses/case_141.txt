The context provides information about films and their properties, including "Hachi: A Dog's Tale". The key deductions are:
1. "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" is either family-friendly animated or appropriate for all ages (from context 7).
2. If family-friendly animated, it is rated General Audience (context 4), hence appropriate for all ages (context 3).
3. Thus, "Hachi" is appropriate for all ages in both cases.
4. Therefore, children can watch it without guidance (context 1).
5. This implies it does not contain excessive erotic and violent content (context 2, by contraposition).

However, there is no information about whether "Hachi" is in the "Frozen" series. Context 5 states that all "Frozen" films are family-friendly animated, but not the converse. Thus:
- The first part of the statement ("Hachi" contains excessive content and is in "Frozen") is false (since it lacks excessive content).
- The second part ("Hachi" lacks excessive content and is not in "Frozen") depends on the unknown status of its inclusion in "Frozen".
- The entire disjunction is equivalent to "Hachi is not in the Frozen series" (since excessive content is false), which cannot be proven or disproven.

Therefore, the truth value of the statement is uncertain.

  contradiction

-- Target statement: (ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi ∧ InFrozenSeries Hachi) ∨ (¬ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi ∧ ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi)
-- We know ¬ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi, so the statement simplifies to ¬InFrozenSeries Hachi.
-- But we have no information about InFrozenSeries Hachi.
-- Thus, we cannot prove the target statement or its negation.
