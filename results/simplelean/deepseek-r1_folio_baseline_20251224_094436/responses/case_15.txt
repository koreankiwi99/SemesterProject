The reasoning follows a classic syllogism: since all squares are four-sided and all four-sided things are shapes, it logically follows that all squares are shapes. This is provable in Lean using the given axioms.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Square : obj → Prop
axiom FourSided : obj → Prop
axiom Shape : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : ∀ x : obj, Square x → FourSided x
axiom T2 : ∀ x : obj, FourSided x → Shape x
theorem squares_are_shapes : ∀ x : obj, Square x → Shape x :=
  fun x h => T2 x (T1 x h)
</lean>

ANSWER: True
