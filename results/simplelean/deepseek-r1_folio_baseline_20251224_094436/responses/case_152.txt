The mixture's carbon content cannot be determined from the given information. While organic compounds must contain carbon, the mixture is proven not to be a chemical compound (and therefore not organic), but no axioms link non-organic entities to carbon presence or absence.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Hydrocarbon : obj → Prop
axiom OrganicCompound : obj → Prop
axiom Alkane : obj → Prop
axiom ChemicalCompound : obj → Prop
axiom ContainsCarbon : obj → Prop
axiom ContainsOnlyOneElement : obj → Prop
axiom Mixture : obj

axiom A1 : ∀ x, Hydrocarbon x → OrganicCompound x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Alkane x → Hydrocarbon x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, OrganicCompound x → ChemicalCompound x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, OrganicCompound x → ContainsCarbon x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, ChemicalCompound x → ¬ ContainsOnlyOneElement x
axiom A6 : (ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture) ∨ (¬ ChemicalCompound Mixture ∧ ¬ ContainsOnlyOneElement Mixture)

theorem mixture_not_chemical : ¬ ChemicalCompound Mixture := by
  intro h
  have h5 := A5 Mixture h
  cases A6
  case inl h1 => exact h5 h1.2
  case inr h2 => exact h2.1 h

-- No proof for ContainsCarbon Mixture

-- No proof against ContainsCarbon Mixture
example : ¬ ContainsCarbon Mixture := by sorry  -- Cannot prove
