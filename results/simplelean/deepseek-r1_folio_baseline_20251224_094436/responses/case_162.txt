The context states that a hawk never swims and some birds are hawks. The question asks whether all birds swim. 

In Lean, we define a type for creatures and predicates for being a bird, a hawk, and swimming. The axioms are:
1. If a creature is a hawk, it does not swim (`∀ x, Hawk x → ¬ Swims x`).
2. There exists a creature that is both a bird and a hawk (`∃ x, Bird x ∧ Hawk x`).

The statement "All birds swim" (`∀ x, Bird x → Swims x`) is false because there exists a hawk that is a bird (by axiom 2) and this hawk does not swim (by axiom 1). Thus, we can prove the negation of the statement.

<lean>
axiom Creature : Type
axiom Bird : Creature → Prop
axiom Hawk : Creature → Prop
axiom Swims : Creature → Prop

axiom hawk_never_swims : ∀ x, Hawk x → ¬ Swims x
axiom some_birds_are_hawks : ∃ x, Bird x ∧ Hawk x

theorem not_all_birds_swim : ¬ (∀ x, Bird x → Swims x) := by
  intro h
  rcases some_birds_are_hawks with ⟨w, h_bird, w_hawk⟩
  have w_not_swim := hawk_never_swims w w_hawk
  have w_swim := h w h_bird
  contradiction
