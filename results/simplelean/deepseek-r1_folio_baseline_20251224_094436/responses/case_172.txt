The context provides several logical statements about health habits and Taylor's background. The key points are:

1. Eating salads regularly implies being health conscious.
2. Growing up in a health-conscious home implies eating salads regularly.
3. Fulfilling daily nutrition implies growing up in a health-conscious home.
4. Disregarding physical well-being implies not being health conscious.
5. Visiting the gym daily implies fulfilling daily nutrition.
6. Taylor either (grew up health-conscious and disregards well-being) or (did neither).

The disjunction in point 6 leads to two cases. The first case (grew up health-conscious and disregards well-being) results in a contradiction: if Taylor grew up health-conscious, she eats salads regularly (point 2), making her health conscious (point 1). But disregarding well-being implies she is not health conscious (point 4), which is inconsistent. Thus, this case is impossible.

Therefore, the second case must hold: Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious home and does not disregard her well-being. However, this does not determine whether Taylor eats salads regularly. Point 2 only states that growing up health-conscious implies eating salads, not the converse. There might be other reasons for Taylor to eat salads. No other axioms force a conclusion about her salad-eating habits.

Thus, the statement "Taylor eats salads regularly" is uncertain.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `impossible_case` theorem returns `False` (a contradiction), but the `must_be_second_case` theorem expects a conjunction `¬GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor ∧ ¬DisregardWellBeing Taylor`. The fix involves using `False.elim` to derive the conjunction from the contradiction in the first case.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

axiom Taylor : Person

axiom EatsSaladsRegularly : Person → Prop
axiom HealthConscious : Person → Prop
axiom GrewUpHealthConscious : Person → Prop
axiom FulfillsNutrition : Person → Prop
axiom DisregardWellBeing : Person → Prop
axiom VisitsGymDaily : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, EatsSaladsRegularly x → HealthConscious x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, GrewUpHealthConscious x → EatsSaladsRegularly x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, FulfillsNutrition x → GrewUpHealthConscious x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, DisregardWellBeing x → ¬ HealthConscious x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, VisitsGymDaily x → FulfillsNutrition x
axiom A6 : (GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor ∧ DisregardWellBeing Taylor) ∨ (¬ GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor ∧ ¬ DisregardWellBeing Taylor)

theorem impossible_case : ¬ (GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor ∧ DisregardWellBeing Taylor) :=
  fun h =>
    have h_grew : GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor := h.left
    have h_disregard : DisregardWellBeing Taylor := h.right
    have h_eats : EatsSaladsRegularly Taylor := A2 Taylor h_grew
    have h_health : HealthConscious Taylor := A1 Taylor h_eats
    have h_not_health : ¬ HealthConscious Taylor := A4 Taylor h_disregard
    h_not_health h_health

theorem must_be_second_case : ¬ GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor ∧ ¬ DisregardWellBeing Taylor :=
  by
    cases A6 with
    | inl h => exact False.elim (impossible_case h)
    | inr h => exact h

-- From must_be_second_case, we have:
--   ¬GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor
--   ¬DisregardWellBeing Taylor
-- Axiom A2 states: ∀x, GrewUpHealthConscious x → EatsSaladsRegularly x
-- Since we have ¬GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor, we cannot prove EatsSaladsRegularly Taylor.
-- There are no axioms linking ¬GrewUpHealthConscious to ¬EatsSaladsRegularly.
-- Thus, EatsSaladsRegularly Taylor is undecidable.
