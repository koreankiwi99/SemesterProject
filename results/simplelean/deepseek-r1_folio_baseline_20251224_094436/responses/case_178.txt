The context states that all horses have hooves and no humans have hooves. The question asks whether some humans are horses. 

From the axioms:
1. If something is a horse, it has hooves.
2. If something is a human, it does not have hooves.

Suppose there exists an entity that is both human and horse. By axiom 1, it would have hooves. By axiom 2, it would not have hooves. This is a contradiction. Therefore, no such entity can exist. The statement "Some humans are horses" is false.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Horse : obj → Prop
axiom HasHooves : obj → Prop

axiom all_horses_have_hooves : ∀ x, Horse x → HasHooves x
axiom no_humans_have_hooves : ∀ x, Human x → ¬ HasHooves x

theorem no_human_horse : ¬ ∃ x, Human x ∧ Horse x := 
  by
    intro ⟨x, hx_human, hx_horse⟩
    have h_hooves : HasHooves x := all_horses_have_hooves x hx_horse
    have h_no_hooves : ¬ HasHooves x := no_humans_have_hooves x hx_human
    exact h_no_hooves h_hooves

ANSWER: False
