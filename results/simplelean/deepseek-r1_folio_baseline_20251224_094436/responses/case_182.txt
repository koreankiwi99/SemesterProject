The reasoning involves the following steps:

1. From the context:
   - "All pet owners love animals" implies all pet owners are animal lovers
   - "All animal lovers are nice to animals"
   - Therefore, Tom (as a pet owner) is nice to animals
   - "No one nice to animals is also mean to animals" implies anyone nice to animals isn't mean to animals
   - Thus Tom cannot be mean to animals

2. The conclusion "Tom is not both a grumpy person and mean to animals" must be true because:
   - The "mean to animals" part is always false for Tom
   - Therefore the conjunction must be false regardless of whether Tom is grumpy

The Lean proof establishes:
- Tom is not mean to animals (via axioms)
- Therefore ¬(Grumpy Tom ∧ MeanToAnimals Tom) holds since MeanToAnimals Tom is false
