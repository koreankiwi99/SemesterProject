The context explicitly states that Steinhauer was the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic. The additional information about Descampe and the six-way tie on the leaderboard does not contradict this fact, as the tie could be for a position other than first place. Therefore, the statement "Steinhauer was not the winner" is directly contradicted by the given context.

-- The statement "Steinhauer was not the winner" is ¬Winner Steinhauer
-- Since we have proven Winner Steinhauer, the statement is false.
