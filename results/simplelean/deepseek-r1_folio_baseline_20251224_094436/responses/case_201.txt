The context provides information about Ailton Silva's association with Braga (via loan) and Náutico (current club), but mentions Fluminense only as a separate club without any connection to Ailton Silva. There is no evidence that Ailton Silva played for Fluminense, nor is there explicit information ruling out past associations. Therefore, the statement's truth value cannot be determined from the given information.
