The context provides information about individuals at a mixer, including Djokovic. The reasoning shows that regardless of whether Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor, he must be well-paid and therefore live in a tax haven. The proof in Lean formalizes the axioms and demonstrates that Djokovic lives in a tax haven, making the statement "Djokovic does not live in a tax haven" false.
