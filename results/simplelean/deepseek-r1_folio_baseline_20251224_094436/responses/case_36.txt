The context provides that Beethoven wrote Symphony No. 9, which is a music piece, and that composers write music pieces. However, there is no axiom stating that anyone who writes a music piece must be a composer. Beethoven leads the Vienna Music Society (an orchestra), and orchestras are led by conductors, so Beethoven is a conductor. Yet, being a conductor does not imply being a composer, and there is no information linking writing music pieces exclusively to composers. Therefore, we cannot prove that Beethoven is a composer, nor can we prove that he is not a composer.

-- Cannot prove Composer Beethoven: 
-- A3 shows Beethoven wrote a music piece, but A2 does not provide the converse (i.e., writing a music piece implies being a composer).
-- No axioms force or prevent Beethoven from being a composer.
