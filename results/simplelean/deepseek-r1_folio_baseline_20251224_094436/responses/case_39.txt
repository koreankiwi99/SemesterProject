The context provides information about designs that Max adores, but the question asks about "a design by Max" without specifying whether Max adores it. The axioms only constrain designs that Max adores, leaving designs by Max that he does not adore unconstrained. Therefore, we cannot determine whether any arbitrary design by Max is a brutalist building.

<lean>
axiom Design : Type
axiom AdoresMax : Design → Prop
axiom InterestingGeometries : Design → Prop
axiom BrutalistBuilding : Design → Prop
axiom ZahaHadidStyle : Design → Prop
axiom KellyWearstlerStyle : Design → Prop
axiom Evocative : Design → Prop
axiom Dreamy : Design → Prop
axiom ByMax : Design → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ d, (ZahaHadidStyle d ∧ AdoresMax d) → InterestingGeometries d
axiom A2 : ∀ d, (BrutalistBuilding d ∧ AdoresMax d) → ¬ InterestingGeometries d
axiom A3 : ∀ d, AdoresMax d → (ZahaHadidStyle d ∨ KellyWearstlerStyle d)
axiom A4 : ∀ d, (KellyWearstlerStyle d ∧ AdoresMax d) → Evocative d
axiom A5 : ∀ d, (KellyWearstlerStyle d ∧ AdoresMax d) → Dreamy d
axiom A6 : ∀ d, (ByMax d ∧ AdoresMax d ∧ InterestingGeometries d) → BrutalistBuilding d ∧ Evocative d

-- The statement "A design by Max is a brutalist building" could mean:
--   (1) ∀ d, ByMax d → BrutalistBuilding d  (universal)
--   (2) ∃ d, ByMax d ∧ BrutalistBuilding d  (existential)

-- For (1): We have no axioms about designs by Max that he does not adore.
--          Even for designs he adores, KellyWearstlerStyle designs might not be brutalist.
--          Thus, we cannot prove ∀ d, ByMax d → BrutalistBuilding d.

-- For (2): We know that if Max adores a design by himself with interesting geometries, 
--          it must be brutalist (A6). However, we have no axiom guaranteeing the existence 
--          of any design by Max, let alone one he adores with interesting geometries.
--          Thus, we cannot prove ∃ d, ByMax d ∧ BrutalistBuilding d.

-- Similarly, we cannot disprove the statement because:
--   - A6 allows brutalist designs by Max (if adored and with interesting geometries).
--   - Non-adorable designs by Max are unconstrained.

-- Therefore, the truth value is uncertain.
