The reasoning follows the given context to determine the truth value of the statement about Coco Gauff. The key steps are:

1. Coco Gauff is at Roland Garros 2022 (given).
2. All tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are either female or male (given).
3. Considering the cases:
   - If Coco is female: 
     - All female tennis players at RG2022 lost to Iga Świątek, so Coco lost to Iga.
     - Anyone who lost to Iga is ranked highly by WTA.
     - Anyone ranked highly by WTA is an active player.
     - Thus, Coco is both a player who lost to Iga and an active player.
   - If Coco is male:
     - All male tennis players at RG2022 lost to Rafael Nadal, so Coco lost to Nadal.
     - The implication states that if Coco is ranked highly or lost to Nadal, then Coco cannot be male and at RG2022. But since Coco is at RG2022, this implies Coco is not male—a contradiction.
     - Thus, the male case is impossible.
4. Therefore, Coco must be female, and the statement "Coco is not both lost to Iga and active" is false.

-- Since AtRG2022 coco, simplifies to not male.
