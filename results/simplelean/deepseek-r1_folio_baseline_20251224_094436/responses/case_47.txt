The context provides information about seasons and students' favorite seasons and vacation preferences. The key points are:
- There are four seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter
- Students wanting long vacations must have Summer as their favorite season
- Emma's favorite season is Summer
- Mia's favorite season differs from Emma's (so Mia's favorite ≠ Summer)
- James wants a long vacation (so his favorite is Summer)

The question asks whether Mia's favorite season is Spring. Since Mia's favorite is not Summer, it must be one of Spring, Fall, or Winter. However, there is no information specifying which of these three seasons Mia prefers. Therefore, we cannot prove that Mia's favorite is Spring, nor can we prove that it is not Spring (as it could be Spring, Fall, or Winter).

The compilation error occurred because the `rw` tactic was applied directly to the axiom `mia_not_emma`, which is not allowed in Lean. Instead, we should use the axiom to derive a contradiction by assuming Mia's favorite season is summer. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
inductive Season where
  | Spring
  | Summer
  | Fall
  | Winter

inductive Student where
  | Emma
  | Mia
  | James

axiom favorite : Student → Season
axiom LongVacation : Student → Prop

axiom all_long_vacation_summer : ∀ s, LongVacation s → favorite s = Season.Summer
axiom emma_summer : favorite Student.Emma = Season.Summer
axiom mia_not_emma : favorite Student.Mia ≠ favorite Student.Emma
axiom james_long : LongVacation Student.James

theorem james_summer : favorite Student.James = Season.Summer := 
  all_long_vacation_summer Student.James james_long

theorem mia_not_summer : favorite Student.Mia ≠ Season.Summer := by
  intro h
  have : favorite Student.Mia = favorite Student.Emma := by rw [h, emma_summer]
  exact mia_not_emma this

-- Cannot prove Mia's favorite is Spring since:
-- 1. We know it's not Summer (mia_not_summer)
-- 2. But it could be Spring, Fall, or Winter
-- No axioms constrain Mia's season choice further
