The reasoning involves analyzing the given context and the statement about James. The context provides several axioms about employees, meetings, lunch locations, remote work, and managers. The statement to evaluate is a biconditional: James is either a manager or in other countries if and only if he does not have lunch at home and does not work remotely from home.

The Lean code models the context with axioms:
- All employees who schedule a meeting go to the company building.
- Employees lunching in the building schedule meetings.
- Employees lunch either in the building or at home.
- Lunch at home implies remote work.
- Employees in other countries work remotely.
- Managers do not work remotely.
- James appears in the company if and only if he is a manager.

The biconditional statement for James is:
`(Manager James ∨ InOtherCountries James) ↔ (¬LunchAtHome James ∧ ¬RemoteFromHome James)`

Analysis shows:
- **If James is a manager**: He cannot work remotely (A6). By A3, he must lunch in the building (since lunch at home implies remote work, contradicting A6). Thus, ¬LunchAtHome James and ¬RemoteFromHome James hold, satisfying the right-hand side.
- **If James is in other countries**: He must work remotely (A5). Thus, ¬RemoteFromHome James is false. However, the right-hand side requires ¬RemoteFromHome James, which fails. The left-hand side is true, but the right-hand side is false, so the biconditional fails.
- **If James is neither**: The left-hand side is false. By A3 and A7, he must lunch at home and work remotely, making the right-hand side false. Thus, false ↔ false holds.

The biconditional holds when James is a manager or neither, but fails when he is in other countries. The context does not specify James's status (manager, in other countries, or neither), so the truth value depends on unknown factors. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven or disproven from the axioms alone.

axiom GoesToBuilding : Employee → Prop
axiom LunchInBuilding : Employee → Prop
axiom LunchAtHome : Employee → Prop
axiom RemoteFromHome : Employee → Prop
axiom InOtherCountries : Employee → Prop
axiom Manager : Employee → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ e : Employee, SchedulesMeeting e → GoesToBuilding e
axiom A2 : ∀ e : Employee, LunchInBuilding e → SchedulesMeeting e
axiom A3 : ∀ e : Employee, LunchInBuilding e ∨ LunchAtHome e
axiom A4 : ∀ e : Employee, LunchAtHome e → RemoteFromHome e
axiom A5 : ∀ e : Employee, InOtherCountries e → RemoteFromHome e
axiom A6 : ∀ e : Employee, Manager e → ¬ RemoteFromHome e
axiom A7 : GoesToBuilding James ↔ Manager James

theorem target : (Manager James ∨ InOtherCountries James) ↔ (¬ LunchAtHome James ∧ ¬ RemoteFromHome James) := by 
  -- The theorem cannot be proven from the axioms alone, as its truth depends on James's status.
  -- Similarly, its negation cannot be proven.
