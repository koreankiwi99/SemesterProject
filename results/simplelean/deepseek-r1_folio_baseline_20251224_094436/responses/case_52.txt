The reasoning problem involves determining if German is a Romance language based on the given context. The Lean formalization models languages and relationships using predicates. Key axioms state that Romance languages are Indo-European, form a language family (so all Romance languages are related), French and Spanish are Romance, German is related to Spanish, and Basque is unrelated to any other language. There is no axiom stating that being related to a Romance language implies being Romance. Thus, while German is related to Spanish (a Romance language), this does not necessitate German being Romance. Conversely, there is no contradiction if German were Romance. Therefore, the statement "German is a Romance language" cannot be proven or disproven.

axiom Language : Type
axiom French : Language
axiom Spanish : Language
axiom German : Language
axiom Basque : Language
axiom Romance : Language → Prop
axiom IndoEuropean : Language → Prop
axiom Related : Language → Language → Prop

axiom all_romance_indo_european : ∀ l, Romance l → IndoEuropean l
axiom romance_family : ∀ l1 l2, Romance l1 → Romance l2 → Related l1 l2
axiom french_romance : Romance French
axiom spanish_romance : Romance Spanish
axiom german_related_spanish : Related German Spanish
axiom basque_isolated : ∀ l, l ≠ Basque → ¬Related Basque l

-- Attempt to prove German is Romance
theorem german_romance : Romance German := by 
  -- No axiom forces German to be Romance just because it's related to Spanish
  admit

-- Attempt to prove German is not Romance
theorem not_german_romance : ¬Romance German := by
  -- No information contradicts German being Romance
  admit

-- Neither theorem can be proven
