The context provides information about Robert Lewandowski being a striker, strikers being soccer players, him leaving Bayern Munchen, and the rule that leaving a team means no longer playing for that team. However, there is no mention of the property "star" or any axioms connecting the given predicates to being a star. Therefore, the truth value of "Robert Lewandowski is a star" cannot be determined from the given context.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom RobertLewandowski : obj
axiom BayernMunchen : obj
axiom Striker : obj → Prop
axiom SoccerPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom Left : obj → obj → Prop
axiom PlaysFor : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Star : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : Striker RobertLewandowski
axiom T2 : ∀ x : obj, Striker x → SoccerPlayer x
axiom T3 : Left RobertLewandowski BayernMunchen
axiom R1 : ∀ (player team : obj), Left player team → ¬ PlaysFor player team

-- No axioms relate Striker/SoccerPlayer/Left/PlaysFor to Star
-- Cannot prove Star RobertLewandowski or ¬Star RobertLewandowski
