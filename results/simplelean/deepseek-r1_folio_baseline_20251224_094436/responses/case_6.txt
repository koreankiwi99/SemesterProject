The context states: "Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals." This implies there exists at least one animal in which the Monkeypox virus can occur. Therefore, we can conclude that there is an animal. The other statements (e.g., about humans being mammals, mammals being animals) are not needed for this conclusion, as the existence of animals is directly implied by the statement about Monkeypox virus occurring in certain animals.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom MonkeypoxVirusOccursIn : obj → Prop
axiom T2 : ∃ x : obj, Animal x ∧ MonkeypoxVirusOccursIn x

theorem exists_animal : ∃ x : obj, Animal x := by
  obtain ⟨x, hAnimal, _⟩ := T2
  exact ⟨x, hAnimal⟩

ANSWER: True
