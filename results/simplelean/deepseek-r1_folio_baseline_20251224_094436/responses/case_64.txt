The reasoning involves evaluating the statement: "If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet." Given the context:

- All Brown Swiss cattle are cows.
- Some pets are Brown Swiss cattle (but this is existential and does not specify Ted).
- All cows are domesticated animals.
- Alligators are not domesticated animals.
- Ted is an alligator.

Assuming Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle leads to a contradiction:
- Ted would be a cow (from "all Brown Swiss cattle are cows").
- Ted would be a domesticated animal (from "all cows are domesticated animals").
- But Ted is an alligator, and alligators are not domesticated animals, so Ted cannot be domesticated.

This contradiction (Ted being both domesticated and not domesticated) implies that the assumption "Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle" must be false. However, the statement to evaluate is an implication: "If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet." In logic, if the antecedent (Ted being Brown Swiss cattle) leads to a contradiction, the entire implication is true (vacuously or by explosion), regardless of the consequent. Specifically:
- The contradiction proves that "BrownSwiss Ted" implies anything, including "¬ Pet Ted".
- Therefore, the implication holds.

The Lean formalization and proof confirm this:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Ted : obj
axiom BrownSwiss : obj → Prop
axiom Cow : obj → Prop
axiom DomesticatedAnimal : obj → Prop
axiom Alligator : obj → Prop
axiom Pet : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BrownSwiss x → Cow x
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Pet x ∧ BrownSwiss x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Cow x → DomesticatedAnimal x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Alligator x → ¬ DomesticatedAnimal x
axiom A5 : Alligator Ted

theorem statement : BrownSwiss Ted → ¬ Pet Ted :=
  fun hBS => 
    have hCow : Cow Ted := A1 Ted hBS
    have hDom : DomesticatedAnimal Ted := A3 Ted hCow
    have hNotDom : ¬ DomesticatedAnimal Ted := A4 Ted A5
    fun _ => hNotDom hDom
</lean>

The proof shows that assuming `BrownSwiss Ted` leads to a contradiction (via `hDom` and `hNotDom`), which allows deriving `¬ Pet Ted` (by explosion, ignoring the unused `Pet Ted` assumption). Thus, the statement is true.

ANSWER: True
