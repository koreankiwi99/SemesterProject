The reasoning involves determining if Tom's license plate is from Istanbul based on the given context. The key points are:
- All Istanbul plates begin with 34: ∀p, Istanbul p → BeginsWith34 p
- Plates not beginning with 34 are not from Istanbul: ∀p, ¬BeginsWith34 p → ¬Istanbul p (equivalent to the contrapositive of the first statement)
- Tom's plate begins with 35: BeginsWith35 Tom
- Plates beginning with 35 do not begin with 34: ∀p, BeginsWith35 p → ¬BeginsWith34 p

Since Tom's plate begins with 35, it follows that it does not begin with 34. Therefore, Tom's plate is not from Istanbul. The statement "Tom's license plate is from Istanbul" is false.
