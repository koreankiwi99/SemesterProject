Based on the given information, we formalize the reasoning in Lean 4. The context defines:

- No baked sweets are spicy: ∀x, BakedSweets x → ¬Spicy x
- All cupcakes are baked sweets: ∀x, Cupcake x → BakedSweets x
- All mala hotpots are spicy: ∀x, MalaHotpot x → Spicy x
- All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes: ∀x, ProductOfBakedByMelissa x → Cupcake x
- Dried Thai chilies condition: ∀x, DriedThaiChilies x → (Spicy x ∨ MalaHotpot x ∨ ¬BakedSweets x)

The conclusion to evaluate is: ∀x, DriedThaiChilies x → ProductOfBakedByMelissa x

After formalizing the axioms, we find that:
- If there are no objects satisfying DriedThaiChilies, the universal conclusion holds vacuously.
- If such objects exist, they cannot satisfy ProductOfBakedByMelissa without contradiction (since baked sweets cannot be spicy, which conflicts with the Dried Thai chilies condition when combined with product/cupcake axioms).

However, the axioms do not require existence of Dried Thai chilies. Thus, the truth of the statement cannot be definitively proven or refuted from the given information.

axiom obj : Type

axiom BakedSweets : obj → Prop
axiom Spicy : obj → Prop
axiom Cupcake : obj → Prop
axiom MalaHotpot : obj → Prop
axiom ProductOfBakedByMelissa : obj → Prop
axiom DriedThaiChilies : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, BakedSweets x → ¬Spicy x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Cupcake x → BakedSweets x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, MalaHotpot x → Spicy x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, ProductOfBakedByMelissa x → Cupcake x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, DriedThaiChilies x → Spicy x ∨ MalaHotpot x ∨ ¬BakedSweets x

-- The theorem cannot be proven as we cannot assume existence of DriedThaiChilies
-- Example model 1 (no objects): ∀x, DriedThaiChilies x → ProductOfBakedByMelissa x holds vacuously
-- Example model 2 (with non-product DriedThaiChilies object): The statement fails
