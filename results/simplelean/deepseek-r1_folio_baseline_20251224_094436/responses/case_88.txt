Based on the context, we can formalize the reasoning as follows:

1. Introduce types for objects, persons, and books.
2. Define Harry and Walden as specific objects.
3. Establish that Harry is a person and Walden is a book.
4. Define relations: Reads (between a person and book), GainsKnowledge (for a person), and Smarter (for a person).
5. Axioms:
   - If a person reads a book, they gain knowledge.
   - If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.
   - Harry read Walden.

The theorem states that Harry is smarter, which follows directly from the axioms.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Person : obj → Prop
axiom Book : obj → Prop
axiom Harry : obj
axiom Walden : obj
axiom Harry_person : Person Harry
axiom Walden_book : Book Walden
axiom Reads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom GainsKnowledge : obj → Prop
axiom Smarter : obj → Prop
axiom R1 : ∀ (p b : obj), Person p → Book b → Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p
axiom R2 : ∀ (p : obj), GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p
axiom T_read : Reads Harry Walden

theorem harry_smarter : Smarter Harry := 
  R2 Harry (R1 Harry Walden Harry_person Walden_book T_read)
</lean>

The proof shows:
1. Harry (a person) read Walden (a book), so by R1, Harry gains knowledge.
2. Since Harry gains knowledge, by R2, Harry becomes smarter.

Thus, the statement "Harry is smarter than before" is true.

ANSWER: True
