The statement "A smarter person has gained knowledge" is existential: there exists a person who is smarter and has gained knowledge. From the context:

1. Harry read "Walden" (a book).
2. Reading any book causes a person to gain knowledge (universal rule).
3. Gaining knowledge causes a person to become smarter (universal rule).

Thus:
- Harry gained knowledge (from reading "Walden").
- Harry became smarter (from gaining knowledge).

Harry serves as a witness proving the existential statement. The Lean code formalizes this reasoning and proves the theorem.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Book : Type
axiom Harry : Person
axiom Walden : Book
axiom reads : Person → Book → Prop
axiom gains_knowledge : Person → Prop
axiom smarter : Person → Prop
axiom read_rule : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), reads p b → gains_knowledge p
axiom gain_rule : ∀ (p : Person), gains_knowledge p → smarter p
axiom harry_read : reads Harry Walden

theorem smarter_has_gained : ∃ p, smarter p ∧ gains_knowledge p :=
  ⟨Harry, 
   gain_rule Harry (read_rule Harry Walden harry_read), 
   read_rule Harry Walden harry_read⟩

ANSWER: True
