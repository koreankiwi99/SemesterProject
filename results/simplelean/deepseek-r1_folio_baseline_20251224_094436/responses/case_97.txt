The reasoning involves translating the given context into Lean axioms and proving the statement about the Harvard Weekly Book Club (HWBC). The context provides:

1. All business organizations are legal entities.
2. All companies are business organizations.
3. All private companies are companies.
4. All legal entities are created under law.
5. All legal entities have legal obligations.
6. If HWBC is created under law, then it is not a private company.

The statement to evaluate is:  
"If HWBC is a private company, then it either has legal obligations or is created under law."

In Lean, we represent the predicates and axioms. Assuming `HWBC` is a private company, we derive:
- It is a company (from axiom A3).
- Then a business organization (A2).
- Then a legal entity (A1).
- Therefore, it has legal obligations (A5).

Thus, the left disjunct (has legal obligations) holds, proving the implication. The conditional axiom A6 is not needed for this proof. The statement is true.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HWBC : obj
axiom BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : obj → Prop
axiom Company : obj → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : obj → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom A6 : CreatedUnderLaw HWBC → ¬ PrivateCompany HWBC

theorem statement : PrivateCompany HWBC → (HasLegalObligations HWBC ∨ CreatedUnderLaw HWBC) :=
  fun h => 
    have comp : Company HWBC := A3 HWBC h
    have bus : BusinessOrganization HWBC := A2 HWBC comp
    have leg : LegalEntity HWBC := A1 HWBC bus
    Or.inl (A5 HWBC leg)
