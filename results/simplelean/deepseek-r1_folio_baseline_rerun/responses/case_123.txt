The given context does not provide sufficient information to determine whether John's car is not a Solo EV. The reasoning is as follows:

1. **Key definitions and implications**:
   - If a car transports multiple passengers, it cannot be a one-seater (A1).
   - All Tesla Model 3 cars transport multiple passengers (A2).
   - All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters (A3).
   - All Solo EVs are single-seat electric cars (A4).

2. **Analysis of John's car**:
   - If John's car is a Tesla Model 3 (A2 → TransportMultiple), then it cannot be a one-seater (A1). This means it cannot be a single-seat electric car (A3) and thus cannot be a Solo EV (A4). Therefore, ¬SoloEV(johnsCar) would hold.
   - If John's car is a Solo EV (A4 → SingleSeatElectricCar → A3 → OneSeater), then it cannot transport multiple passengers (A1). Since Tesla Model 3 cars transport multiple passengers (A2), it cannot be a Tesla Model 3. However, this does not contradict any axiom.
   - John's car could also be neither a Tesla Model 3 nor a Solo EV (e.g., another type of car), in which case ¬SoloEV(johnsCar) would hold, but we have no information forcing this.

3. **Tautological axiom (A5)**:
   - The statement "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car" is logically always true (since P → P∨Q is a tautology). It adds no new constraints.

4. **Uncertainty**:
   - There is no axiom specifying what type of car John's car is. It could be a Tesla Model 3 (implying ¬SoloEV), a Solo EV (implying SoloEV), or neither. Thus, we cannot prove ¬SoloEV(johnsCar) nor its negation.
