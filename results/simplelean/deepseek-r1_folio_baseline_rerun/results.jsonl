Finally, `disprove_target` proves the original statement (implication) is false by combining these results.\n\nANSWER: False", "reasoning_content": "We are going to formalize the context and the question in Lean.\n\n First, we define the necessary types and predicates.\n\n Let:\n   `Person` : Type for people in the club.\n   `Bonnie : Person`\n\n Predicates:\n   `PerformsOften : Person \u2192 Prop`   -- performs in school talent shows often\n   `AttendsEngaged : Person \u2192 Prop`   -- attends and is very engaged with school events\n   `InactiveDisint : Person \u2192 Prop`   -- inactive and disinterested community members\n\n   `Chaperones : Person \u2192 Prop`       -- chaperones high school dances\n   `Student : Person \u2192 Prop`          -- is a student who attends the school\n\n   `YoungChildOrTeen : Person \u2192 Prop` -- is a young child or teenager\n   `WishFurther : Person \u2192 Prop`      -- wishes to further academic career and educational opportunities\n\n Note: The last two are combined in the conclusion: \"young child or teenager who wishes to further ...\"\n\n Now, the context:\n\n 1. \"People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.\"\n    This means: \u2200 p, PerformsOften p \u2192 AttendsEngaged p\n\n 2. \"People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.\"\n    This means: \u2200 p, PerformsOften p \u2228 InactiveDisint p\n\n 3. \"People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.\"\n    \u2200 p, Chaperones p \u2192 \u00ac Student p\n\n 4. \"All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\"\n    \u2200 p, InactiveDisint p \u2192 Chaperones p\n\n 5. \"All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\"\n    \u2200 p, YoungChildOrTeen p \u2192 WishFurther p \u2192 Student p\n\n 6. \"Bonnie is in this club and she either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school or is not someone who both attends and is very engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\"\n\n    This is a bit complex. Let us break it down:\n\n    Let A = AttendsEngaged Bonnie\n    Let S = Student Bonnie\n\n    The statement: (A \u2227 S) \u2228 \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acS)\n\n    But note: \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acS) is equivalent to (A \u2192 S) (by implication)\n\n    Alternatively, we can write it as: (A \u2227 S) \u2228 (A \u2192 S)\n\n    However, note that the disjunction is actually an exclusive one? But the text says \"either ... or ...\".\n\n    Actually, it says: \"she either both ... and ... or ...\". It might be that the \"or\" is inclusive? But let's look at the structure:\n\n        (A \u2227 S) \u2228 [\u00ac (someone)]\n\n    The \"someone\" is described as \"not someone who both attends and is very engaged and is not a student\".\n\n    That is, it's \u00ac (A \u2227 \u00acS). So:\n\n        (A \u2227 S) \u2228 \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acS)\n\n    But note that \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acS) is equivalent to (A \u2192 S). So:\n\n        (A \u2227 S) \u2228 (A \u2192 S)\n\n    However, note that (A \u2192 S) is always true except when A is true and S is false. But in the first disjunct we have (A \u2227 S). \n    Actually, the whole expression is always true? Because:\n        If A is true, then if S is true then we have the first disjunct. If S is false, then (A \u2192 S) is false, but note that when A is true and S is false, we don't have the first disjunct and the second disjunct is \u00ac(true \u2227 true) = false? \n        Alternatively, let's compute:\n          When A is true and S is false: \n            (A \u2227 S) = false\n            \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acS) = \u00ac(true \u2227 true) = \u00actrue = false\n          So the entire disjunction is false? That can't be.\n\n    Let me re-read: \n        \"Bonnie ... either both attends and is very engaged ... and is a student ... OR is not someone who both attends and is very engaged and is not a student.\"\n\n    The \"not someone who both attends and is very engaged and is not a student\" is the same as \"it is not the case that (attends and is very engaged and is not a student)\", i.e., \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acS).\n\n    But note: the first part is (A \u2227 S). The second part is \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acS).\n\n    However, observe that (A \u2227 S) implies \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acS) because if A and S are true, then A and \u00acS is false. Therefore, the disjunction (A \u2227 S) \u2228 \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acS) is equivalent to just \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acS) because the first part is a special case of the second? Actually, no.\n\n    But note that (A \u2227 \u00acS) is the only case where the disjunction fails? Let us check:\n\n        A | S | (A \u2227 S) | \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acS) | (A \u2227 S) \u2228 \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acS)\n        --------------------------------------------------\n        T | T |   T     |     T      |     T\n        T | F |   F     |     F      |     F   -> problem\n        F | T |   F     |     T      |     T\n        F | F |   F     |     T      |     T\n\n    But the context says Bonnie is such that either ... or ... and we see when A is true and S is false, the disjunction is false. \n    Therefore, the statement about Bonnie is actually equivalent to: \u00ac (A \u2227 \u00acS) is required to be true? \n\n    However, the context says she is one or the other? The way it's stated is as a disjunction. But by the truth table, the disjunction is false only when A is true and S is false.\n\n    Therefore, the context is telling us that it is not the case that (A is true and S is false). So we can write:\n\n        \u00ac (AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2227 \u00ac Student Bonnie)\n\n    Which is equivalent to: AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2192 Student Bonnie.\n\n    So we can write:\n        axiom Bonnie_ax : AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2192 Student Bonnie\n\n    But wait, the text says \"she either both ... and ... or ...\", and we see that when A is true and S is false the disjunction is false. So the context must be asserting the disjunction, meaning that the disjunction is true. Therefore, we exclude the case A=true and S=false.\n\n    However, note that in the truth table, the disjunction is true in all cases except the (true, false) case. So the context is saying that we do not have (A=true and S=false). Therefore, we can take:\n\n        \u00ac (AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2227 \u00ac Student Bonnie)\n\n    which is equivalent to: AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2192 Student Bonnie.\n\n    So axiom: \n        Bonnie_ax : \u2200 (Bonnie : Person), AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2192 Student Bonnie\n\n    But note: the context says \"Bonnie is in this club\", and we are only talking about Bonnie. So we can write:\n\n        axiom Bonnie_ax : AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2192 Student Bonnie\n\n    But wait, the original statement is about Bonnie and the disjunction is stated as a fact. So we must have that the disjunction holds for Bonnie.\n\n    Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        axiom Bonnie_ax : (AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2227 Student Bonnie) \u2228 \u00ac(AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2227 \u00ac Student Bonnie)\n\n    But as we saw, this is equivalent to:\n\n        \u00ac (AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2227 \u00ac Student Bonnie)\n\n    So we'll go with:\n\n        axiom Bonnie_ax : AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2192 Student Bonnie\n\n    However, note that the disjunction also includes the case (AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2227 Student Bonnie). But since if that case holds, then the implication holds? It is redundant. The important thing is that the implication is the minimal requirement that covers both cases. Actually, the implication is equivalent to the disjunction? Not exactly: the disjunction is always true except when A and not-S, and the implication is false only when A and not-S. So they are equivalent? \n\n        \u00ac(A \u2227 \u00acS)  \u21d4 (A \u2192 S)\n\n    So we can safely use: \n        axiom Bonnie_ax : AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2192 Student Bonnie\n\n Now, the question:\n\n    \"If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\"\n\n    We break the premise:\n\n        Premise: Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or (if she does not chaperone, then she performs often).\n\n        Let C = Chaperones Bonnie\n        Let P = PerformsOften Bonnie\n\n        The premise: C \u2228 (\u00ac C \u2192 P)\n\n        Note: (\u00ac C \u2192 P) is equivalent to (C \u2228 P). So the entire premise becomes: C \u2228 (C \u2228 P) = C \u2228 P.\n\n        But wait: \n          C \u2228 (\u00acC \u2192 P) \n          = C \u2228 (\u00ac(\u00acC) \u2228 P)    [since \u00acC \u2192 P is equivalent to \u00ac(\u00acC) \u2228 P = C \u2228 P]\n          = C \u2228 (C \u2228 P)\n          = (C \u2228 C) \u2228 P\n          = C \u2228 P\n\n        So the premise is equivalent to: C \u2228 P.\n\n    Conclusion: \n        (YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie \u2227 WishFurther Bonnie) \u2227 InactiveDisint Bonnie\n\n    So the implication: \n        (C \u2228 P) \u2192 (YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie \u2227 WishFurther Bonnie \u2227 InactiveDisint Bonnie)\n\n Now, we want to know if this is true, false, or uncertain.\n\n We will set up the axioms and try to prove the implication or its negation.\n\nNote: We have not introduced Bonnie explicitly as a constant? We'll add it.\n\nLet us define:\n\n    axiom Person : Type\n    axiom Bonnie : Person\n\n    -- Predicates\n    axiom PerformsOften : Person \u2192 Prop\n    axiom AttendsEngaged : Person \u2192 Prop\n    axiom InactiveDisint : Person \u2192 Prop\n    axiom Chaperones : Person \u2192 Prop\n    axiom Student : Person \u2192 Prop\n    axiom YoungChildOrTeen : Person \u2192 Prop\n    axiom WishFurther : Person \u2192 Prop\n\n    -- Axioms from context\n\n    -- 1. People who perform often are engaged.\n    axiom A1 : \u2200 p, PerformsOften p \u2192 AttendsEngaged p\n\n    -- 2. Every person either performs often or is inactive.\n    axiom A2 : \u2200 p, PerformsOften p \u2228 InactiveDisint p\n\n    -- 3. Chaperones are not students.\n    axiom A3 : \u2200 p, Chaperones p \u2192 \u00ac Student p\n\n    -- 4. Inactive members chaperone.\n    axiom A4 : \u2200 p, InactiveDisint p \u2192 Chaperones p\n\n    -- 5. Young child/teen with wish to further are students.\n    axiom A5 : \u2200 p, YoungChildOrTeen p \u2192 WishFurther p \u2192 Student p\n\n    -- 6. For Bonnie: if she is engaged then she is a student.\n    axiom A6 : AttendsEngaged Bonnie \u2192 Student Bonnie\n\nAnd we have the statement to prove:\n    theorem T : (Chaperones Bonnie \u2228 PerformsOften Bonnie) \u2192 \n              (YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie \u2227 WishFurther Bonnie \u2227 InactiveDisint Bonnie)\n\nBut note: We can also try to disprove it by proving the negation? Or show it's not always true.\n\nWe might consider if we can get a contradiction? Or we might try to see if we can find conditions that make the premise true but the conclusion false.\n\nLet us denote:\n   Let C = Chaperones Bonnie\n   Let P = PerformsOften Bonnie\n   Let I = InactiveDisint Bonnie\n\nFrom A2: P \u2228 I must hold for Bonnie.\n\nFrom A4: I \u2192 C.\n\nNow, if Bonnie is inactive, then by A4 she chaperones, so C. So if inactive, then both I and C hold.\n\nIf she is not inactive, then by A2 she must perform often, so P holds.\n\nBut also note, if she is inactive, then by A3 and A4, she chaperones and therefore she is not a student.\n\nIf she is not inactive, then she performs often. Then by A1, she is engaged. Then by A6, she must be a student.\n\nSo:\n\n   I \u2192 (C \u2227 \u00acStudent)   [from A4 and A3]\n   \u00acI \u2192 P               [from A2 and excluded middle?]\n        and then P \u2192 AttendsEngaged \u2192 Student   [A1 and A6]\n\nSo if inactive, she is not a student, and if not inactive, she is a student.\n\nNow, the conclusion requires:\n   YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie \u2227 WishFurther Bonnie \u2227 InactiveDisint Bonnie\n\nSo it requires that Bonnie is inactive (I) and also YoungChildOrTeen and WishFurther.\n\nBut if she is inactive, we have that she is not a student. Now, look at A5: \n   If she is YoungChildOrTeen and has WishFurther, then she must be a student (A5). But we have that if she is inactive, she is not a student. Therefore, if she is inactive, she cannot be both YoungChildOrTeen and WishFurther? Because that would require her to be a student, but she isn't.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion (YoungChildOrTeen and WishFurther and InactiveDisint) leads to a contradiction? Because:\n\n   InactiveDisint Bonnie \u2192 \u00acStudent Bonnie   [via A4 and A3]\n   YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie \u2227 WishFurther Bonnie \u2192 Student Bonnie   [by A5]\n   So we have both Student and \u00acStudent \u2192 contradiction.\n\nBut the conclusion is part of the implication. The implication might be false if the premise is true but the conclusion false.\n\nAlternatively, can we have (C \u2228 P) true and the conclusion false?\n\nThe premise (C \u2228 P) is always true? Because from A2: either P or I and if I then C (from A4), so if I then C, so C \u2228 P? \n   Case 1: P holds -> then C \u2228 P holds.\n   Case 2: I holds -> then C holds -> then C \u2228 P holds.\n\nSo actually, (C \u2228 P) must hold for Bonnie. Therefore, the premise is always true.\n\nBut the conclusion must then be true? However, we just argued that the conclusion is inconsistent: because it requires Bonnie to be inactive (so not a student) but also YoungChildOrTeen and WishFurther (which by A5 requires her to be a student). Hence, the conclusion is false.\n\nTherefore, the implication (which says that if the premise is true then the conclusion is true) must be false? Because the premise is true and the conclusion is false.\n\nBut wait, we must check: can we have that the conclusion is false? \n\nYes, because we don't have any axiom that forces Bonnie to be YoungChildOrTeen or WishFurther. And we have that Bonnie is either inactive (and not a student) or active (and a student). \n\nNow, if she is active (i.e., not inactive), then she performs often, is engaged, and is a student. But we don't know if she is a young child/teen or wishes to further.\n\nIf she is inactive, then she cannot be YoungChildOrTeen and WishFurther without contradiction? But actually, if she is inactive, then she is not a student. But A5 says that if she were YoungChildOrTeen and had WishFurther, then she would have to be a student. Since she is not a student, it is not the case that (YoungChildOrTeen and WishFurther). So the conclusion (which requires both) is false in the inactive case? Actually, the conclusion requires all three: YoungChildOrTeen, WishFurther, and inactive. But the inactive condition causes the other two to be false? Not necessarily. The problem is that A5 only says: YoungChildOrTeen and WishFurther together imply student. If she is inactive (and hence not a student), then she cannot have both YoungChildOrTeen and WishFurther. So at least one of them must be false. Therefore, in the inactive case, the conclusion (which requires both) is false. \n\nIn the active case (non-inactive), there is no requirement that she be YoungChildOrTeen or WishFurther. So the conclusion might be false.\n\nTherefore, we have that the premise (C \u2228 P) is true, and the conclusion is false? But we need to confirm that the conclusion is indeed false. \n\nThe conclusion is: (YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie) \u2227 (WishFurther Bonnie) \u2227 InactiveDisint Bonnie.\n\nIs this ever true? We argued that if InactiveDisint Bonnie is true, then we require YoungChildOrTeen and WishFurther, but that leads to Student and \u00acStudent (since inactive implies \u00acStudent and YoungChildOrTeen and WishFurther imply Student). Therefore, it is impossible for the conclusion to be true? Because it leads to a contradiction. \n\nSo the conclusion is always false. And the premise (C \u2228 P) is always true (as we argued). Therefore, the implication: (premise) \u2192 (conclusion) is equivalent to: true \u2192 false, which is false.\n\nTherefore, the statement in the question is false.\n\nWe can formalize this in Lean.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. We note that by A2, for Bonnie: PerformsOften Bonnie \u2228 InactiveDisint Bonnie.\n   If InactiveDisint Bonnie then by A4, we have Chaperones Bonnie -> so Chaperones Bonnie \u2228 PerformsOften Bonnie? Well, we have Chaperones Bonnie, so the disjunction holds? Actually, we don't need to worry about if PerformsOften holds? Because if inactive, then chaperones, so the premise (C \u2228 P) holds.\n\n2. Now, the conclusion requires InactiveDisint Bonnie and (YoungChildOrTeen and WishFurther). But if InactiveDisint Bonnie, then by A4, Chaperones Bonnie, and by A3, \u00ac Student Bonnie.\n\n   But by A5: YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie \u2192 WishFurther Bonnie \u2192 Student Bonnie.\n\n   Therefore, if we have YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie and WishFurther Bonnie, then we get Student Bonnie, which contradicts \u00acStudent Bonnie.\n\n   So to have the conclusion true, we need:\n\n        InactiveDisint Bonnie \u2227 YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie \u2227 WishFurther Bonnie\n\n        but also Student Bonnie (by A5) and \u00acStudent Bonnie (by A3 and A4) -> contradiction.\n\n   Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\n3. So the implication is false.\n\nBut note: the premise is always true? We have to prove that (Chaperones Bonnie \u2228 PerformsOften Bonnie) is always true.\n\nProof for the premise being true:\n\n    By A2, PerformsOften Bonnie \u2228 InactiveDisint Bonnie.\n\n    Case 1: PerformsOften Bonnie -> then the premise holds (right disjunct? In this case, P holds, so C \u2228 P holds).\n\n    Case 2: InactiveDisint Bonnie -> then by A4, we have Chaperones Bonnie, so C holds, and thus C \u2228 P holds.\n\nTherefore, the premise always holds.\n\nBut the conclusion is always false? Actually, the conclusion might be false, but we don't know that? The point is that the conclusion leads to a contradiction, so it cannot be true. Therefore, the implication is false.\n\nTherefore, we can construct a theorem that the negation of the question's statement is true? Actually, the question is: \"is the following statement true, false, or uncertain?\" and the statement is the implication. We have that the implication is false.\n\nSo we write a theorem that shows:\n\n    \u00ac ((Chaperones Bonnie \u2228 PerformsOften Bonnie) \u2192 \n              (YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie \u2227 WishFurther Bonnie \u2227 InactiveDisint Bonnie))\n\nBut note: the premise is true and the conclusion is false, so the implication is false. Therefore, we have:\n\n    have H_premise : Chaperones Bonnie \u2228 PerformsOften Bonnie := ...   -- we can prove this\n    have H_conclusion_false : \u00ac (YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie \u2227 WishFurther Bonnie \u2227 InactiveDisint Bonnie) := ... -- because if conclusion were true we get a contradiction\n\n    Then the implication fails at Bonnie.\n\nSo in Lean we can prove:\n\n    theorem premise_true : Chaperones Bonnie \u2228 PerformsOften Bonnie := by\n        have h1 := A2 Bonnie\n        cases h1 with\n        | inl p => exact Or.inr p\n        | inr i => \n            have c : Chaperones Bonnie := A4 Bonnie i\n            exact Or.inl c\n\n    theorem conclusion_false : \u00ac (YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie \u2227 WishFurther Bonnie \u2227 InactiveDisint Bonnie) := by\n        intro h\n        have y := h.left\n        have w := h.right.left\n        have i := h.right.right\n        have c : Chaperones Bonnie := A4 Bonnie i\n        have not_student : \u00ac Student Bonnie := A3 Bonnie c\n        have must_be_student : Student Bonnie := A5 Bonnie y w\n        contradiction\n\n    With these, we have shown that the implication (premise \u2192 conclusion) is equivalent to True \u2192 False? Actually, we have:\n        H_premise : true (because we proved the premise)\n        H_not_conclusion : \u00ac conclusion   -> meaning the conclusion is false.\n\n        Therefore, the implication is false.\n\n    We can express the statement we want to check as:\n\n        S : Prop := (Chaperones Bonnie \u2228 PerformsOften Bonnie) \u2192 \n              (YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie \u2227 WishFurther Bonnie \u2227 InactiveDisint Bonnie)\n\n    And we have \u00ac S because we have the premise true and the conclusion false.\n\n    So we can write:\n\n        theorem answer : \u00ac ((Chaperones Bonnie \u2228 PerformsOften Bonnie) \u2192 \n              (YoungChildOrTeen Bonnie \u2227 WishFurther Bonnie \u2227 InactiveDisint Bonnie)) := by\n          intro H_imp\n          have H_premise : Chaperones Bonnie \u2228 PerformsOften Bonnie := premise_true\n          have H_concl := H_imp H_premise\n          exact conclusion_false H_concl\n\n    But wait, in the above we assume the implication, then we get the conclusion, but we've already proved that the conclusion is false, so we get a contradiction? Actually, that proves that the implication must be false.\n\n    Alternatively, we can show:\n\n        theorem answer : \u00ac (S) :=\n          fun H => conclusion_false (H premise_true)\n\n    Or we can also do:\n\n        theorem answer : False := ?   -- but we are not asked for the negation? We are just to see if the statement is true, false, or uncertain.\n\n    Actually, we are to determine if the statement (which is the implication) is true, false, or uncertain.

Therefore, we output:\n\nANSWER: False\n\nWait, the question is: \"is the following statement true, false, or uncertain?\" and the statement we are checking is the entire implication. We proved that the implication is false? In the context of the formalization, we have shown the implication does not hold. But we must be cautious: we have not assumed any additional axioms. We only used the provided context.\n\nTherefore, our answer is False.\n\nBut note: in the example, we have:\n\n    Example 3: the Context said the cat is blue and if blue then not red. The question was: the cat is red? And we proved not red, so the answer was False (meaning the statement \"the cat is red\" is false). \n\nBut here, the statement in question is the big implication.

And we break it into three parts. That is correct.\n\nBut in Lean, we wrote the theorem `statement` as the negation of the implication? That is because we proved the implication to be false. Alternatively, we could have done:\n\n    theorem not_holds : False := ...   but that's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, we can just note that we have proved the implication fails?

{"prediction": "Uncertain", "parse_status": "SUCCESS", "ground_truth": "True", "correct": false, "model": "deepseek-r1", "iterations": [{"iteration": 1, "llm_response": "The given context does not provide sufficient information to determine whether John's car is not a Solo EV. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. **Key definitions and implications**:\n   - If a car transports multiple passengers, it cannot be a one-seater (A1).\n   - All Tesla Model 3 cars transport multiple passengers (A2).\n   - All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters (A3).\n   - All Solo EVs are single-seat electric cars (A4).\n\n2. **Analysis of John's car**:\n   - If John's car is a Tesla Model 3 (A2 \u2192 TransportMultiple), then it cannot be a one-seater (A1). This means it cannot be a single-seat electric car (A3) and thus cannot be a Solo EV (A4). Therefore, \u00acSoloEV(johnsCar) would hold.\n   - If John's car is a Solo EV (A4 \u2192 SingleSeatElectricCar \u2192 A3 \u2192 OneSeater), then it cannot transport multiple passengers (A1). Since Tesla Model 3 cars transport multiple passengers (A2), it cannot be a Tesla Model 3. However, this does not contradict any axiom.\n   - John's car could also be neither a Tesla Model 3 nor a Solo EV (e.g., another type of car), in which case \u00acSoloEV(johnsCar) would hold, but we have no information forcing this.\n\n3. **Tautological axiom (A5)**:\n   - The statement \"If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car\" is logically always true (since P \u2192 P\u2228Q is a tautology). It adds no new constraints.\n\n4. **Uncertainty**:\n   - There is no axiom specifying what type of car John's car is. It could be a Tesla Model 3 (implying \u00acSoloEV), a Solo EV (implying SoloEV), or neither. Thus, we cannot prove \u00acSoloEV(johnsCar) nor its negation.\n\n<lean>\naxiom obj : Type\naxiom johnsCar : obj\naxiom TransportMultiple : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom OneSeater : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom TeslaModel3 : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom SingleSeatElectricCar : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom SoloEV : obj \u2192 Prop\n\naxiom A1 : \u2200 x, TransportMultiple x \u2192 \u00ac OneSeater x\naxiom A2 : \u2200 x, TeslaModel3 x \u2192 TransportMultiple x\naxiom A3 : \u2200 x, SingleSeatElectricCar x \u2192 OneSeater x\naxiom A4 : \u2200 x, SoloEV x \u2192 SingleSeatElectricCar x\naxiom A5 : \u00ac TeslaModel3 johnsCar \u2192 (\u00ac TeslaModel3 johnsCar \u2228 SingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)\n\n-- Cannot prove \u00acSoloEV johnsCar or SoloEV johnsCar from the axioms\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "reasoning_content": "We are given several statements and need to determine whether \"John's car is not a Solo EV\" is true, false, or uncertain.\n\nFirst, let's formalize the context:\n\n1. If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\n   \u2200x, TransportMultiple(x) \u2192 \u00acOneSeater(x)\n\n2. All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.\n   \u2200x, TeslaModel3(x) \u2192 TransportMultiple(x)\n\n3. All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\n   \u2200x, SingleSeatElectricCar(x) \u2192 OneSeater(x)\n\n4. All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.\n   \u2200x, SoloEV(x) \u2192 SingleSeatElectricCar(x)\n\n5. If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.\n   This is a bit tricky. Let J be John's car.\n   \u00acTeslaModel3(J) \u2192 (\u00acTeslaModel3(J) \u2228 SingleSeatElectricCar(J))\n\n   But note: P \u2192 (P \u2228 Q) is always true regardless of Q? Actually, if P is false, then the implication holds. If P is true, then P\u2228Q is true. So this statement is always true? That doesn't add new information.\n\n   Alternatively, let me read carefully: \"If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.\"\n\n   This can be rewritten as:\n      \u00acTeslaModel3(J) \u2192 (\u00acTeslaModel3(J) \u2228 SingleSeatElectricCar(J))\n\n   But note: the consequent is a disjunction. However, if we break it down, if \u00acTeslaModel3(J) is true, then the disjunction is true because the first disjunct is true. So this statement is always true? That means it doesn't constrain anything.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe it's meant to be: \n      \u00acTeslaModel3(J) \u2192 (\u00acTeslaModel3(J) \u2227 \u00acSingleSeatElectricCar(J))   ??? \n\n   But the text says \"or\", not \"and\". So let's stick to the given.\n\n   Actually, the statement as given is a tautology because for any proposition P and Q, P \u2192 (P \u2228 Q) is true. Therefore, this statement does not provide any new information. We can ignore it.\n\nSo effectively, we have:\n\n1. \u2200x, TransportMultiple(x) \u2192 \u00acOneSeater(x)\n2. \u2200x, TeslaModel3(x) \u2192 TransportMultiple(x)\n3. \u2200x, SingleSeatElectricCar(x) \u2192 OneSeater(x)\n4. \u2200x, SoloEV(x) \u2192 SingleSeatElectricCar(x)\n\nAnd we have John's car, let's call it j.\n\nWe are to determine: \u00acSoloEV(j)\n\nBut note: We don't have any direct information about John's car? Except that we have the tautological statement which we ignored.\n\nSo what do we know about John's car?\n\nWe don't have any axiom that tells us whether John's car is a Tesla Model 3 or a Solo EV or anything else.\n\nTherefore, without any information about John's car, we cannot conclude that it is not a Solo EV.\n\nBut let's see if we can derive any constraints.\n\nSuppose John's car is a Solo EV. Then by axiom 4, it is a SingleSeatElectricCar. Then by axiom 3, it is a OneSeater. Then by axiom 1, it cannot transport multiple passengers. But we don't have any information that would contradict this.\n\nSuppose John's car is a Tesla Model 3. Then by axiom 2, it can transport multiple passengers. Then by axiom 1, it is not a one-seater. Then by axiom 3, it cannot be a single-seat electric car (because if it were, it would be a one-seater). Then by axiom 4, it cannot be a Solo EV.\n\nSo if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a Solo EV.\n\nBut what if John's car is neither a Tesla Model 3 nor a Solo EV? Then the statement \"John's car is not a Solo EV\" would be true, but we don't know if it is a Tesla Model 3 or not.\n\nWe have no information that forces John's car to be a Tesla Model 3. Therefore, it could be a Solo EV? But wait, if it is a Solo EV, then we have:\n\n  SoloEV(j) \u2192 SingleSeatElectricCar(j) \u2192 OneSeater(j) \u2192 \u00acTransportMultiple(j)\n\nBut we don't have any axiom that says Tesla Model 3 is the only car? Or that John's car must be one of these.\n\nThe context doesn't say that every car is either a Tesla Model 3 or a Solo EV. There might be other cars.\n\nTherefore, we have two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: John's car is a Tesla Model 3 -> then it is not a Solo EV (as above).\n\nCase 2: John's car is a Solo EV -> then it is a Solo EV, so the statement \"John's car is not a Solo EV\" is false.\n\nCase 3: John's car is neither -> then the statement \"John's car is not a Solo EV\" is true.\n\nBut we don't know which case holds.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"John's car is not a Solo EV\" is uncertain.\n\nHowever, note that we have the tautological statement:\n\n   \u00acTeslaModel3(j) \u2192 (\u00acTeslaModel3(j) \u2228 SingleSeatElectricCar(j))\n\nBut as we said, this is always true and doesn't add information.\n\nSo we cannot prove \u00acSoloEV(j) nor can we prove SoloEV(j).\n\nThus, the answer is Uncertain.\n\nBut wait: let me check if there is a contradiction if John's car is a Solo EV and also a Tesla Model 3? \n\nSuppose j is both TeslaModel3 and SoloEV.\n\nThen:\n  TeslaModel3(j) \u2192 TransportMultiple(j) \u2192 \u00acOneSeater(j)\n  SoloEV(j) \u2192 SingleSeatElectricCar(j) \u2192 OneSeater(j)\n\nSo we get \u00acOneSeater(j) and OneSeater(j) -> contradiction.\n\nTherefore, no car can be both a Tesla Model 3 and a Solo EV.\n\nBut that doesn't tell us what John's car is.\n\nWe still don't know whether John's car is a Tesla Model 3 or a Solo EV or neither.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine the truth value of \"John's car is not a Solo EV\".\n\nSo we will output Uncertain.\n\nNow, let's write the Lean code accordingly.\n\nWe'll define:\n- `obj` as a type (since we have cars and John's car)\n- Predicates:\n   `TransportMultiple : obj \u2192 Prop`\n   `OneSeater : obj \u2192 Prop`\n   `TeslaModel3 : obj \u2192 Prop`\n   `SingleSeatElectricCar : obj \u2192 Prop`\n   `SoloEV : obj \u2192 Prop`\n\nAnd John's car as a constant `johnsCar : obj`\n\nAxioms:\n1. `axiom A1 : \u2200 x, TransportMultiple x \u2192 \u00ac OneSeater x`\n2. `axiom A2 : \u2200 x, TeslaModel3 x \u2192 TransportMultiple x`\n3. `axiom A3 : \u2200 x, SingleSeatElectricCar x \u2192 OneSeater x`\n4. `axiom A4 : \u2200 x, SoloEV x \u2192 SingleSeatElectricCar x`\n\nAnd the fifth statement: `axiom A5 : \u00ac TeslaModel3 johnsCar \u2192 (\u00ac TeslaModel3 johnsCar \u2228 SingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)`\n\nBut note: as discussed, A5 is a tautology and doesn't add information. However, we include it because it's in the context.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can prove `\u00ac SoloEV johnsCar` or `SoloEV johnsCar`.\n\nWe cannot prove either, so we leave it without a theorem and output Uncertain.\n\nBut note: we can prove that it's impossible for `johnsCar` to be both `TeslaModel3` and `SoloEV`? But that doesn't help.\n\nSo in Lean, we write:\n\n<lean>\naxiom obj : Type\naxiom johnsCar : obj\naxiom TransportMultiple : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom OneSeater : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom TeslaModel3 : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom SingleSeatElectricCar : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom SoloEV : obj \u2192 Prop\n\naxiom A1 : \u2200 x, TransportMultiple x \u2192 \u00ac OneSeater x\naxiom A2 : \u2200 x, TeslaModel3 x \u2192 TransportMultiple x\naxiom A3 : \u2200 x, SingleSeatElectricCar x \u2192 OneSeater x\naxiom A4 : \u2200 x, SoloEV x \u2192 SingleSeatElectricCar x\naxiom A5 : \u00ac TeslaModel3 johnsCar \u2192 (\u00ac TeslaModel3 johnsCar \u2228 SingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)\n\n-- We cannot prove \u00acSoloEV johnsCar nor SoloEV johnsCar\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n", "prediction": "Uncertain", "parse_status": "SUCCESS", "lean_code": "axiom obj : Type\naxiom johnsCar : obj\naxiom TransportMultiple : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom OneSeater : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom TeslaModel3 : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom SingleSeatElectricCar : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom SoloEV : obj \u2192 Prop\n\naxiom A1 : \u2200 x, TransportMultiple x \u2192 \u00ac OneSeater x\naxiom A2 : \u2200 x, TeslaModel3 x \u2192 TransportMultiple x\naxiom A3 : \u2200 x, SingleSeatElectricCar x \u2192 OneSeater x\naxiom A4 : \u2200 x, SoloEV x \u2192 SingleSeatElectricCar x\naxiom A5 : \u00ac TeslaModel3 johnsCar \u2192 (\u00ac TeslaModel3 johnsCar \u2228 SingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)\n\n-- Cannot prove \u00acSoloEV johnsCar or SoloEV johnsCar from the axioms", "lean_verification": {"success": true, "env": 1, "errors": [], "warnings": [], "all_messages": []}, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 696, "completion_tokens": 2519, "total_tokens": 3215}}], "num_iterations": 1, "lean_code": "axiom obj : Type\naxiom johnsCar : obj\naxiom TransportMultiple : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom OneSeater : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom TeslaModel3 : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom SingleSeatElectricCar : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom SoloEV : obj \u2192 Prop\n\naxiom A1 : \u2200 x, TransportMultiple x \u2192 \u00ac OneSeater x\naxiom A2 : \u2200 x, TeslaModel3 x \u2192 TransportMultiple x\naxiom A3 : \u2200 x, SingleSeatElectricCar x \u2192 OneSeater x\naxiom A4 : \u2200 x, SoloEV x \u2192 SingleSeatElectricCar x\naxiom A5 : \u00ac TeslaModel3 johnsCar \u2192 (\u00ac TeslaModel3 johnsCar \u2228 SingleSeatElectricCar johnsCar)\n\n-- Cannot prove \u00acSoloEV johnsCar or SoloEV johnsCar from the axioms", "lean_verification": {"success": true, "env": 1, "errors": [], "warnings": [], "all_messages": []}, "total_tokens": {"prompt_tokens": 696, "completion_tokens": 2519, "total_tokens": 3215}, "story_id": 315, "example_id": 788, "case_idx": 123}
