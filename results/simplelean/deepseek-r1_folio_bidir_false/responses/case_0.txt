The reasoning involves analyzing the premises to determine if we can prove that Bonnie does not perform in school talent shows often. The premises provide information about club members, their activities, and Bonnie's specific situation. However, after careful examination, it is not possible to derive a contradiction from assuming Bonnie performs, nor can we definitively prove she does not perform. Both scenarios (Bonnie performing or being inactive) remain consistent with the premises. Therefore, we cannot prove the negation of the statement.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Bonnie : obj

axiom InClub : obj → Prop
axiom Perform : obj → Prop
axiom Attend : obj → Prop
axiom Engaged : obj → Prop
axiom InactiveDisinterested : obj → Prop
axiom Chaperone : obj → Prop
axiom StudentAttend : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x, InClub x → (Perform x → (Attend x ∧ Engaged x))
axiom P2 : ∀ x, InClub x → (Perform x ∨ InactiveDisinterested x)
axiom P3 : ∀ x, InClub x → (Chaperone x → ¬ StudentAttend x)
axiom P4 : ∀ x, InClub x → (InactiveDisinterested x → Chaperone x)
axiom P6 : InClub Bonnie ∧ 
            ((Attend Bonnie ∧ Engaged Bonnie ∧ StudentAttend Bonnie) ∨ 
             (¬ (Attend Bonnie ∧ Engaged Bonnie) ∧ ¬ StudentAttend Bonnie))

-- Cannot prove ¬Perform Bonnie from the given axioms
