The reasoning involves formalizing the given context and the statement about Bonnie, then attempting to prove that the statement is false (i.e., proving the negation of the implication). The Lean code below defines the necessary predicates and axioms based on the context. The statement to evaluate is an implication (P → Q), where:
- P: Bonnie is either (both a young child/teenager who wishes to further her career and chaperones dances) or (neither a young child/teenager who wishes to further her career).
- Q: Bonnie is either a student or an inactive and disinterested member.

The negation of the implication is P ∧ ¬Q. After formalizing the axioms and attempting to prove P ∧ ¬Q, it is found that the premises do not provide enough information to conclusively prove this negation. Specifically:
- P is a tautology (always true) because it is a disjunction of a condition and its negation.
- Q's truth value depends on Bonnie's properties: if Bonnie is inactive and disinterested, Q is true; if Bonnie performs and is not a student, Q could be false, but there is no axiom forcing Bonnie to be a non-student when performing.
- Axiom A5 only constrains young children/teenagers who wish to further their careers to be students, but Bonnie could avoid this by not being in that category.
- No contradiction arises when assuming ¬Q, but the premises do not entail ¬Q.

Thus, the negation (P ∧ ¬Q) cannot be proven from the given premises.

axiom Bonnie : Person

axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x → (Perform x → (AttendEvents x ∧ Engaged x))
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x → (Perform x ∨ (Inactive x ∧ Disinterested x))
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x → (Chaperone x → ¬ Student x)
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x → ((Inactive x ∧ Disinterested x) → Chaperone x)
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, InClub x → ((YoungChild x ∨ Teenager x) ∧ WishFurther x → Student x)
axiom A6 : InClub Bonnie

def A : Prop := (YoungChild Bonnie ∨ Teenager Bonnie) ∧ WishFurther Bonnie
def P : Prop := (A ∧ Chaperone Bonnie) ∨ ¬A
def Q : Prop := Student Bonnie ∨ (Inactive Bonnie ∧ Disinterested Bonnie)

-- Attempt to prove ¬(P → Q) (i.e., P ∧ ¬Q) fails due to insufficient constraints
-- Example: Bonnie could be performing (not inactive/disinterested) and not a student, making ¬Q hold (since ¬Student Bonnie and not inactive/disinterested)
-- But premises do not force this scenario; Bonnie could also be inactive/disinterested (making Q true)
-- Thus, P ∧ ¬Q is not provable
