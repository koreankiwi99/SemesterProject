ANSWER: False

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the axioms and variables were not properly declared with explicit types. Specifically, the quantifiers in the axioms lacked type annotations for the variable `p`, leading to type mismatches. Additionally, the `cases` tactic was applied correctly, but the pattern matching syntax needed adjustment for clarity.

Here is the corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>

axiom Luke : Person
axiom MB : Person → Prop
axiom HasSibBornTogether : Person → Prop
axiom Complain : Person → Prop
axiom LiveAtHome : Person → Prop
axiom LiveWithStrangers : Person → Prop

axiom R2 : ∀ (p : Person), HasSibBornTogether p → MB p
axiom R3 : ∀ (p : Person), Complain p → HasSibBornTogether p
axiom R4 : ∀ (p : Person), LiveAtHome p → ¬ LiveWithStrangers p
axiom R5 : ∀ (p : Person), SpendTime p → LiveAtHome p
axiom LukeExclusiveOr : (MB Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) ∨ (¬ MB Luke ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke)

  | inr h => exact h.1 hMB
</lean>

ANSWER: False

**Explanation:**  
The theorem `disprove_Complain_Luke` proves that Luke cannot complain about annoying siblings (`¬ Complain Luke`) under the given premises. The proof shows:
1. If Luke complains, he must have siblings born together (via `R3`).
2. This implies Luke was born in a multiple birth (`R2`).
3. Thus, Luke spends time with siblings (`R1`) and lives at home (`R5`).
4. Living at home means Luke cannot live with strangers (`R4`).
5. Luke's exclusive or condition forces a contradiction:
   - If Luke was born in a multiple birth *and* lives with strangers, this contradicts `hNoStranger`.
   - If Luke was *not* born in a multiple birth, this contradicts `hMB`.

Since the statement "Luke complains often about annoying siblings" leads to a contradiction, its negation is proven. Thus, the answer is **False**.
