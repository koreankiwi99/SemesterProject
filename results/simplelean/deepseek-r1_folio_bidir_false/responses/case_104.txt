The context provides conditions for ETS providing financial aid: GRE applicants who prove economic hardship receive aid. Economic hardship can be proven by living in a single-parent family or having few resources. Tom is a GRE applicant living in a single-parent family with few resources. Thus, Tom proves economic hardship and should receive financial aid. Attempting to prove the negation (¬FinancialAid Tom) fails because the premises support the opposite conclusion.

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because I incorrectly applied a term of type `FinancialAid Tom` as if it were a function. After re-examining the logic:

1. The premises show Tom qualifies for financial aid:
   - Tom is a GRE applicant (T3)
   - Tom lives in a single-parent family (T1) → proves economic hardship (R2)
   - GRE applicants with economic hardship receive aid (R1)

2. Therefore, `FinancialAid Tom` is provable from the axioms
3. Attempting to prove `¬FinancialAid Tom` leads to:
   - Assuming `h : FinancialAid Tom`
   - Deriving `H_aid : FinancialAid Tom` from axioms
   - No contradiction exists since both terms prove the same proposition

Corrected Lean code:

axiom GREApplicant : obj → Prop
axiom FinancialAid : obj → Prop
axiom ProveEconomicHardship : obj → Prop
axiom SingleParentFamily : obj → Prop
axiom FewResources : obj → Prop

axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, SingleParentFamily x ∨ FewResources x → ProveEconomicHardship x
axiom T1 : SingleParentFamily Tom
axiom T2 : FewResources Tom
axiom T3 : GREApplicant Tom

-- Prove FinancialAid Tom is true
theorem Tom_gets_aid : FinancialAid Tom :=
  have H_spf_or_fr : SingleParentFamily Tom ∨ FewResources Tom := Or.inl T1
  have H_hardship : ProveEconomicHardship Tom := R2 Tom H_spf_or_fr
  have H_applicant_hardship : GREApplicant Tom ∧ ProveEconomicHardship Tom := And.intro T3 H_hardship
  R1 Tom H_applicant_hardship

-- Attempt to prove negation fails
theorem cannot_prove_negation : ¬FinancialAid Tom → False :=
  fun h => h Tom_gets_aid  -- Contradiction: h claims ¬FinancialAid Tom but Tom_gets_aid proves it

-- But note: This proves that ¬FinancialAid Tom is contradictory, 
-- meaning we CANNOT successfully prove ¬FinancialAid Tom from the axioms.
