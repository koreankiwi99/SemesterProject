The goal is to prove the negation of the statement: "No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something." This negation is: "There exists someone taking the GRE test who has financial aid." However, the context does not provide evidence that any applicant actually takes the test, only that they apply. Tom is an applicant with financial aid, but there is no axiom linking being an applicant to taking the test. Therefore, we cannot prove that Tom (or anyone) takes the test and has financial aid, so the negation cannot be proven.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Applicant : Person → Prop
axiom TakesTest : Person → Prop
axiom SingleParentFamily : Person → Prop
axiom FewResources : Person → Prop
axiom ProveEconomicHardship : Person → Prop
axiom FinancialAid : Person → Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ p, Applicant p → ProveEconomicHardship p → FinancialAid p
axiom R2 : ∀ p, SingleParentFamily p ∨ FewResources p → ProveEconomicHardship p

axiom Tom : Person
axiom Tom_applicant : Applicant Tom
axiom Tom_single_parent : SingleParentFamily Tom
axiom Tom_few_resources : FewResources Tom

-- Prove Tom has financial aid
theorem Tom_has_aid : FinancialAid Tom := by
  apply R1 Tom Tom_applicant
  apply R2 Tom
  left
  exact Tom_single_parent

-- Cannot prove ∃ p, TakesTest p ∧ FinancialAid p
-- No axiom connects Applicant to TakesTest
