The goal is to prove that the statement "Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in New Mexico" is false. However, from the premises:

1. The Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico or Texas.
2. Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.
3. The Harding Pegmatite Mine (located in the Picuris Mountains) was donated.
4. There are no mountain ranges in Texas that have donated mines.

We deduce:
- If the Picuris Mountains were in Texas, then having a donated mine (Harding Pegmatite Mine) would contradict premise 4. Thus, the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas.
- Therefore, the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico (from premise 1).
- Since Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains (premise 2), he did visit a mountain range in New Mexico.

This means the statement is true, so its negation cannot be proven from the premises.

axiom A5 : ∀ (m : MountainRange), InTexas m → ¬ ∃ (mine : Mine), LocatedIn mine m ∧ Donated mine

-- Prove Picuris cannot be in Texas (contradiction with A3, A4, A5)
theorem not_in_Texas : ¬ InTexas Picuris :=
  fun h : InTexas Picuris =>
  have H : ¬ ∃ mine, LocatedIn mine Picuris ∧ Donated mine := A5 Picuris h
  have exists_mine : ∃ mine, LocatedIn mine Picuris ∧ Donated mine := ⟨HardingMine, A3, A4⟩
  H exists_mine

-- Therefore, Picuris must be in New Mexico
theorem in_NM : InNewMexico Picuris :=
  Or.elim A1
    (fun inNM : InNewMexico Picuris => inNM)
    (fun inTX : InTexas Picuris => absurd inTX not_in_Texas)

-- Thus, Juan visited a mountain range in New Mexico (Picuris)
theorem visited_NM : ∃ m, InNewMexico m ∧ Visited m := ⟨Picuris, in_NM, A2⟩

-- We are asked to prove the negation: ¬ ∃ m, InNewMexico m ∧ Visited m
-- But we have proven the positive, so the negation is unprovable
