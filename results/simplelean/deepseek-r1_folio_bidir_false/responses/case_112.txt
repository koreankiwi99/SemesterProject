The reasoning attempts to prove that Juan de Onate did not visit a mountain range in Texas. The premises establish:
1. Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico or Texas.
2. Juan visited Picuris Mountains.
3. Harding Mine (in Picuris Mountains) was donated.
4. No Texas mountain range has a donated mine.

Using these, we prove Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas (since it contains a donated mine, violating premise 4). Thus, Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico. However, the conclusion requires proving Juan visited *no* Texas mountain range. While Picuris is in New Mexico, premises do not preclude Juan from visiting *other* Texas mountain ranges (which could exist without donated mines). Thus, the negation cannot be proven.
