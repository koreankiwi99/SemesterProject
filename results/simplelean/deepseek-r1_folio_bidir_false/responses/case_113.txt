The reasoning involves proving that the statement "The Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico" is false based on the given premises. 

Premises:
1. The Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico or Texas.
2. The Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in the Picuris Mountains and was donated.
3. There are no mountain ranges in Texas that have donated mines.

Analysis:
- The mine is in the Picuris Mountains (premise 2).
- If the Picuris Mountains were in Texas, this would contradict premise 3 (since the mine is donated and located there).
- Therefore, by disjunctive syllogism, the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico.
- Thus, the mine is located in a mountain range in New Mexico, making the target statement false.

Lean formalization:
- `MountainRange` type for ranges
- `Mine` type for mines
- `PicurisMountains : MountainRange`
- `HPM : Mine`
- Predicates for location states and donation
- Axioms encoding the premises
- Proof that the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico
- Final theorem showing the target statement is false

-- Statement: "The Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico"
-- This is equivalent to: ¬∃ r, InNM r ∧ LocatedIn HPM r
-- But since HPM is located in PicurisMountains and we proved InNM PicurisMountains, 
-- we have ∃ r (namely PicurisMountains) satisfying the condition.

theorem statement_false : 
    ¬(¬∃ (r : MountainRange), InNM r ∧ LocatedIn HPM r) := by
  intro h
  apply h
  exists PicurisMountains
  exact ⟨picuris_in_nm, mine_in_picuris⟩

-- Alternatively, directly prove the negation of the statement:
theorem mine_in_nm_range : ∃ (r : MountainRange), InNM r ∧ LocatedIn HPM r :=
  ⟨PicurisMountains, ⟨picuris_in_nm, mine_in_picuris⟩⟩

-- Thus the original statement is false
