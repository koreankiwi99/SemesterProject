  --   Right disjunct (¬SingleSeatElectricCar) contradicts h1, but we don't know which disjunct holds
  -- Since A5 only gives a disjunction and we don't have additional information to force the right disjunct,
  -- we cannot complete the proof in the non-Tesla case.

-- The proof above fails to close the non-Tesla case, so we cannot prove ¬IsSoloEV JohnCar
-- Therefore, we output Failure

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the original translation of axiom A5 was incorrect. The natural language statement "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car" should be interpreted as "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is not the case that John's car is either a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car" (¬P → ¬(P ∨ Q)). The corrected axiom leads to a contradiction in both cases when we assume John's car is a Solo EV.

Here is the corrected Lean code:
