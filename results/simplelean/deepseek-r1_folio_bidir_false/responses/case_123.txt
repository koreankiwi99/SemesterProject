The goal is to prove that the conclusion "John's car is not a Solo EV" is false, i.e., to prove that John's car is a Solo EV (SoloEV JohnCar) from the given premises. The Lean code formalizes the context and attempts this proof.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom JohnCar : obj
axiom TransportMultiple : obj → Prop
axiom OneSeater : obj → Prop
axiom TeslaModel3 : obj → Prop
axiom SingleSeatElectricCar : obj → Prop
axiom SoloEV : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x, TransportMultiple x → ¬ OneSeater x
axiom T2 : ∀ x, TeslaModel3 x → TransportMultiple x
axiom T3 : ∀ x, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x
axiom T4 : ∀ x, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x
axiom T5 : ¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar → ¬ SingleSeatElectricCar JohnCar

-- Attempt to prove SoloEV JohnCar (negation of the conclusion)
theorem prove_negation : SoloEV JohnCar := by 
  -- No axioms directly assert SoloEV JohnCar. 
  -- Attempt to derive a contradiction from the premises, but no contradiction arises.
  -- T5 requires knowing TeslaModel3 status, which is unknown.
  -- Without information about TeslaModel3 JohnCar or SingleSeatElectricCar JohnCar, 
  -- we cannot construct a proof of SoloEV JohnCar.
  sorry  -- Proof fails
</lean>

The proof attempt for `SoloEV JohnCar` fails because:
- Premises describe general properties but lack specific information about John's car.
- T5's contrapositive (`SingleSeatElectricCar JohnCar → TeslaModel3 JohnCar`) leads to a contradiction *if* John's car is a single-seat electric car, but we cannot prove it is (or isn't).
- No premise forces John's car to be a Solo EV. Thus, `SoloEV JohnCar` is unprovable.

ANSWER: Failure
