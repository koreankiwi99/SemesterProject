The goal is to prove that the statement "Platypuses are reptiles" is false using the given premises. The premises are:
1. Some mammals have teeth (∃ mammal with teeth).
2. Platypuses have no teeth (∀ platypus, ¬HasTeeth).
3. Platypuses are mammals (∀ platypus, Mammal).
4. Humans have teeth (∀ human, HasTeeth).

The statement to disprove is: Platypuses are reptiles (∀ platypus, Reptile).

However, the premises provide no information about reptiles or the relationship between mammals and reptiles. Specifically:
- There is no axiom stating that mammals cannot be reptiles.
- There is no axiom defining reptiles at all.

Therefore, it is impossible to prove that platypuses are not reptiles based solely on the given premises. The negation of the statement (∃ platypus that is not a reptile) cannot be derived.

<lean>
axiom Animal : Type
axiom Mammal : Animal → Prop
axiom Reptile : Animal → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : Animal → Prop
axiom Platypus : Animal → Prop
axiom Human : Animal → Prop

axiom some_mammals_have_teeth : ∃ a : Animal, Mammal a ∧ HasTeeth a
axiom platypuses_no_teeth : ∀ a : Animal, Platypus a → ¬ HasTeeth a
axiom platypuses_are_mammals : ∀ a : Animal, Platypus a → Mammal a
axiom humans_have_teeth : ∀ a : Animal, Human a → HasTeeth a

-- Attempt to prove that "Platypuses are reptiles" is false, i.e.,
-- ¬(∀ a, Platypus a → Reptile a) which is equivalent to ∃ a, Platypus a ∧ ¬Reptile a.
-- However, there are no premises about Reptile, so we cannot prove this.
