The premises state that some mammals have teeth, platypuses (which are mammals) have no teeth, and humans have teeth. There is no premise connecting "having teeth" to being a mammal or not being a mammal. Specifically:  
- The existence of mammals without teeth (platypuses) doesn't preclude non-mammals from having teeth.  
- Humans having teeth doesn't conflict with them being mammals or not, since no premise says that teeth imply mammal status or vice versa.  
  
A proof that humans are **not** mammals (¬Mammal Human) is impossible from these premises. The conclusion remains consistent under both possibilities (humans being mammals or humans being non-mammals). Thus, the negation of the statement cannot be proven.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because I attempted to use the `simp` tactic in a proof that was inherently impossible to complete. The `simp` tactic made no progress because there is no contradiction in the premises when assuming `Mammal Human`. 

The premises are:
1. Some mammals have teeth (∃m, Mammal m ∧ HasTeeth m)
2. Platypuses (which are mammals) have no teeth
3. Humans have teeth

These premises are consistent with both possibilities:
- Humans being mammals (since some mammals have teeth)
- Humans not being mammals (since having teeth doesn't imply being a mammal)

There is no premise that links "having teeth" to "being a mammal" in a way that would force humans to be non-mammals. Therefore, we cannot prove ¬Mammal Human.

Corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop
axiom Platypus : obj
axiom Human : obj
axiom T1 : ∃ m : obj, Mammal m ∧ HasTeeth m
axiom T2 : ¬HasTeeth Platypus
axiom T3 : Mammal Platypus
axiom T4 : HasTeeth Human

-- No contradiction when assuming Mammal Human:
-- Premises allow both Mammal Human and ¬Mammal Human
-- Cannot prove ¬Mammal Human from given axioms
</lean>
