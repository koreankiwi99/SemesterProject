The context states that vacuums suck and space is a vacuum, which directly implies that space sucks. Therefore, the statement "Space sucks" is true, and its negation cannot be proven from the premises. The Lean code formalizes the reasoning but confirms that ¬Suck Space is unprovable.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Suck : obj → Prop
axiom IsVacuum : obj → Prop
axiom Space : obj
axiom T1 : ∀ x : obj, IsVacuum x → Suck x
axiom T2 : IsVacuum Space
theorem space_sucks : Suck Space := T1 Space T2
-- Cannot prove ¬Suck Space since T1 and T2 imply Suck Space
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure
