The context provides several premises about objects and their properties, but does not establish any connection that would allow proving that space cannot be a vampire. Specifically:
- Space is a vacuum, and vacuums suck.
- Vampires suck, but this does not imply that vacuums cannot be vampires.
- No premise states that vacuums and vampires are mutually exclusive categories.
- The duster property (not sucking) is irrelevant to space or vampires.

Thus, while space sucks (as a vacuum), this is consistent with space potentially being a vampire (since vampires also suck). There is no contradiction in assuming space is a vampire.

ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to using `constant` for declaring `space` and then `axiom` for its property. In Lean 4, `constant` and `axiom` are synonymous, but mixing declarations can cause parsing issues. The corrected code uses `axiom` consistently and fixes the syntax.

Logical analysis:
- Space is a vacuum (premise), and vacuums suck (premise), so space sucks.
- Vampires suck (premise), but this doesn't contradict space being a vampire.
- No premises state that vacuums cannot be vampires or that sucking implies being a vampire.
- The duster property (not sucking) doesn't apply to space, as space isn't stated to be a duster.

Thus, we cannot prove that space is not a vampire.

axiom IsDuster : obj → Prop

axiom plungers_suck : ∀ x : obj, IsPlunger x → Suck x

example : ¬IsVampire space := by
  -- We know space sucks (from vacuums_suck and space_vacuum)
  have space_sucks : Suck space := vacuums_suck space space_vacuum
  -- But vampires also suck, so this doesn't prevent space from being a vampire
  -- No axioms link vacuum/vampire exclusion or imply ¬IsVampire space
  -- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation
