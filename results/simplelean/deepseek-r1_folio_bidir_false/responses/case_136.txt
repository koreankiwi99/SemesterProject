The context provides a counterexample to the statement "If something is a household appliance, it sucks." Specifically, a duster is defined as a household appliance that does not suck. This directly contradicts the universal claim that all household appliances suck. Therefore, we can prove the negation of the statement.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Sucks : obj → Prop
axiom HouseholdAppliance : obj → Prop
axiom Duster : obj
axiom duster_appliance : HouseholdAppliance Duster
axiom duster_no_suck : ¬ Sucks Duster

theorem household_appliance_not_sucks : ¬ (∀ x, HouseholdAppliance x → Sucks x) :=
  fun H => duster_no_suck (H Duster duster_appliance)
</lean>

ANSWER: False
