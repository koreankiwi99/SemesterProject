The goal is to prove the negation of the statement "Some Heck cattle are artificially selected", which is ¬∃ x, HeckCattle x ∧ ArtificiallySelected x. However, the axioms establish that all Heck cattle are bred back (T1) and all bred back animals are artificially selected (T2). This implies ∀ x, HeckCattle x → ArtificiallySelected x. To prove the negation, one would need to show no Heck cattle exist or that no Heck cattle are artificially selected. The axioms do not provide existence or non-existence of Heck cattle. Without knowing if Heck cattle exist, the negation cannot be proven. The additional context about animals resembling extinct animals (T5) does not provide information about Heck cattle's existence or artificial selection status. Therefore, the proof fails.

-- From T1 and T2, we have: ∀ x, HeckCattle x → ArtificiallySelected x
-- However, we cannot prove the negation without knowing whether any Heck cattle exist.
-- Since the existence of Heck cattle is not asserted nor denied, the proof fails.

The compilation error occurred because `Aurochs` was not defined as a predicate. In the initial Lean code, `Aurochs` was used in `T4` as a predicate without a corresponding declaration. I corrected this by adding `axiom Aurochs : obj → Prop`. 

Regarding the proof attempt:
- The statement to disprove is "Some Heck cattle are artificially selected" (∃x, HeckCattle x ∧ ArtificiallySelected x).
- From `T1` and `T2`, we know ∀x, HeckCattle x → ArtificiallySelected x. 
- The negation of the statement is equivalent to ∀x, HeckCattle x → ¬ArtificiallySelected x, which would require showing that no Heck cattle exist or that they lack artificial selection.
- However:
  1. `T5` confirms existence of *some* bred-back animals resembling extinct species, but not specifically Heck cattle.
  2. No axiom confirms existence/non-existence of Heck cattle.
  3. We can derive ∀x, HeckCattle x → ArtificiallySelected x, but cannot prove absence of Heck cattle instances.
- Therefore, the negation cannot be proven from the given premises.

Corrected Lean code:

axiom T5 : ∃ x, Animal x ∧ BreedingBack x ∧ ResembleExtinct x

-- Cannot prove negativity: ¬∃ x, HeckCattle x ∧ ArtificiallySelected x
-- Implied universal: ∀ x, HeckCattle x → ArtificiallySelected x 
-- But no axiom confirms whether Heck cattle exist
