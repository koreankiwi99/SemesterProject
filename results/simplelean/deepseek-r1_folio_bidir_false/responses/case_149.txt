The context establishes that all books published by New Vessel Press are in English, and Neapolitan Chronicles is published by New Vessel Press. Therefore, Neapolitan Chronicles must be an English book. Attempting to prove the negation (that Neapolitan Chronicles is not an English book) leads to a contradiction with the axioms, but this contradiction requires assuming the opposite of what is directly derivable. Since the premises directly prove the statement and no contradiction arises without additional unsupported assumptions, the negation cannot be proven from the given premises alone.

<lean>
axiom Book : Type
axiom NewVesselPress : Book → Prop
axiom inEnglish : Book → Prop
axiom NeapolitanChronicles : Book
axiom PalaceOfFlies : Book

-- Premises
axiom all_books_english : ∀ (b : Book), NewVesselPress b → inEnglish b
axiom nc_published : NewVesselPress NeapolitanChronicles
-- Additional given facts (unused in proof)
axiom nc_translated_from_italian : True -- Placeholder (no impact on proof)
axiom pof_published : NewVesselPress PalaceOfFlies

-- Prove that Neapolitan Chronicles is in English (for context)
theorem nc_english : inEnglish NeapolitanChronicles := 
  all_books_english NeapolitanChronicles nc_published

-- Attempt to prove the negation: ¬inEnglish NeapolitanChronicles
theorem prove_negation : ¬inEnglish NeapolitanChronicles → False := 
  fun h : ¬inEnglish NeapolitanChronicles => 
    h nc_english

-- Since we cannot prove ¬inEnglish NeapolitanChronicles directly from premises without contradiction,
-- but the contradiction only arises when assuming the negation while having proof of the positive,
-- we cannot construct a standalone proof of the negation from the axioms. Thus, the attempt fails.
