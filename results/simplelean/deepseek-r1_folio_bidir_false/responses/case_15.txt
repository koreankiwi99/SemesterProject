The reasoning provided is logically valid. The premises state that all squares are four-sided and all four-sided things are shapes, which directly implies that all squares are shapes. Therefore, it is impossible to prove the negation of the conclusion.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Square : obj → Prop
axiom FourSided : obj → Prop
axiom Shape : obj → Prop
axiom T1 : ∀ x : obj, Square x → FourSided x
axiom T2 : ∀ x : obj, FourSided x → Shape x

-- Attempt to prove ¬(∀ x, Square x → Shape x)
theorem neg_conclusion : ¬(∀ x, Square x → Shape x) :=
  fun h : ∀ x, Square x → Shape x =>
  -- But note: we can actually prove the positive statement:
  have positive : ∀ x, Square x → Shape x :=
    fun x hSq => T2 x (T1 x hSq)
  -- This leads to a contradiction because h and positive are identical.
  -- However, this contradiction requires that the domain is non-empty and there exists a square.
  -- But without an existence assumption, we cannot derive False.
  -- Moreover, the premises are consistent with the conclusion.
  -- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation.
  False.elim (sorry) -- We cannot fill this proof.

-- Since we cannot provide a proof for neg_conclusion without additional assumptions, we conclude Failure.
