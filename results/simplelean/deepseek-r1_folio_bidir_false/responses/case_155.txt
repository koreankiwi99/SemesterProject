The premises state that all humans are mortal and all Greeks are humans. The conclusion claims that some Greeks are mortal. To prove the conclusion false, we would need to show that no Greeks are mortal. However, the premises do not provide information about the existence of Greeks. If there are Greeks, they must be mortal by the premises, making the conclusion true. If there are no Greeks, the conclusion would be false, but the premises do not assert this absence. Therefore, we cannot prove the negation of the conclusion from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Greek : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Mortal : obj → Prop
axiom A1 : ∀ x, Human x → Mortal x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Greek x → Human x

-- Attempt to prove ¬(∃ x, Greek x ∧ Mortal x)
-- However, without knowing whether any Greeks exist, we cannot prove this negation.
-- If there exists a Greek, then by A2 they are Human, and by A1 they are Mortal, contradicting the negation.
-- Since the premises do not specify existence or non-existence of Greeks, the negation is unprovable.
