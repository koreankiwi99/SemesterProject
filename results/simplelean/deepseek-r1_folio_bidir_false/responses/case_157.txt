The premises lead to a contradiction, specifically from the statements about James: James works in the lab (premise 6), but premise 7 states that James does not work in the lab or have a part-time job. Since James works in the lab, the disjunction in premise 7 must be true, contradicting premise 7 itself. This inconsistency allows proving any statement, including that James has a part-time job, which directly contradicts the conclusion that James does not have a part-time job. Thus, the conclusion is false.

-- The conclusion "James does not have a part-time job" is ¬has_part_time_job James.
-- We have proven its negation (¬¬has_part_time_job James), meaning the conclusion is false.
