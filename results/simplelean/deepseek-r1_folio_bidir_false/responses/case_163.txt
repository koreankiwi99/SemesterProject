The reasoning involves attempting to prove that Breaking Bad is not airing at 8 pm on Monday from the given premises. The premises establish that there exists a show airing at 8 pm Monday that gives roses, which must be The Bachelor and thus a reality TV show. Breaking Bad is explicitly stated not to be a reality TV show. However, there is no premise indicating that only one show airs at 8 pm Monday or that airing at that time requires giving roses. Therefore, Breaking Bad could air at 8 pm Monday without giving roses, avoiding any contradiction with the premises. Since the negation of the statement cannot be proven, the result is Failure.

axiom Show : Type
axiom BreakingBad : Show
axiom AiringMonday8pm : Show → Prop
axiom GivesRoses : Show → Prop
axiom IsBachelor : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
axiom RealityTV : Show → Prop

axiom T1 : ∃ x : Show, AiringMonday8pm x ∧ GivesRoses x
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Show, GivesRoses x → IsBachelor x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Show, IsBachelor x → PortraysRealPeople x
axiom R3 : ∀ x : Show, PortraysRealPeople x → RealityTV x
axiom T2 : ¬ RealityTV BreakingBad

-- Attempt to prove ¬AiringMonday8pm BreakingBad fails because:
-- 1. BreakingBad being airing at 8pm Monday doesn't force it to give roses.
-- 2. T1 guarantees a show (possibly different) airing then that gives roses.
-- 3. No premise forces multiple shows at 8pm Monday to share properties.
-- Thus, no contradiction arises from AiringMonday8pm BreakingBad.
