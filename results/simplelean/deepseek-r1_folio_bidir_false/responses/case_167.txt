The context provides Heinrich Schmidt as a specific individual who is a German politician and a member of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag. The statement to evaluate is: "Some German politician was part of both the Prussian State Parliament and the Nazi Reichstag," which is an existential claim. 

To disprove this statement (i.e., prove its negation: no German politician was part of both), we would need to show that no such individual exists. However, the premises explicitly state that Heinrich Schmidt satisfies all three properties (German politician, member of Prussian State Parliament, member of Nazi Reichstag). This provides a direct witness for the existential claim, making it impossible to prove the negation. 

Therefore, we cannot prove that the conclusion is false.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : obj
axiom GermanPolitician : obj → Prop
axiom InPrussianParliament : obj → Prop
axiom InNaziReichstag : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : GermanPolitician HeinrichSchmidt
axiom T2 : InPrussianParliament HeinrichSchmidt
axiom T3 : InNaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt

-- Attempt to prove negation of conclusion: ¬∃ x, GermanPolitician x ∧ InPrussianParliament x ∧ InNaziReichstag x
-- This requires showing no object satisfies all three properties.
-- However, HeinrichSchmidt is a counterexample to the negation.
-- Thus, we cannot prove the negation.
