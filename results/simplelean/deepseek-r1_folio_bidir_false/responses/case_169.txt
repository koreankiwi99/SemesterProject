The goal is to prove that "Colorectal cancer is a kind of severe cancer" is false from the given premises. After careful analysis using Lean, it turns out that the premises do not provide sufficient information to prove the negation. Specifically:

- Assuming `SevereCancer Colorectal` leads to `LowSurvivalRate Colorectal` via the chain `SevereCancer → DeadlyDisease → LowSurvivalRate`.
- Premise 6 states that colorectal cancer cannot be both bile duct cancer and have low survival rate. With `LowSurvivalRate Colorectal`, this implies `¬BileDuctCancer Colorectal`.
- However, there are no premises forcing bile duct cancer status on severe cancers, nor any contradictions with colorectal cancer being severe without being bile duct cancer.

Thus, the negation cannot be proven.

-- Attempt to prove ¬SevereCancer Colorectal
theorem disprove : ¬SevereCancer Colorectal := by
  intro h -- Assume SevereCancer Colorectal
  have deadly := T2 Colorectal h -- DeadlyDisease Colorectal
  have low_surv := T1 Colorectal deadly -- LowSurvivalRate Colorectal
  have not_bile : ¬BileDuctCancer Colorectal := by
    intro bile
    exact T6 ⟨bile, low_surv⟩ -- Contradiction with T6
  -- No further contradictions: ¬BileDuctCancer is consistent with SevereCancer
  -- Cannot derive False
  admit -- Proof fails here

-- Since we cannot complete the proof, we mark as failure
