To determine if the statement "If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu" is false, we model the premises in Lean and attempt to prove its negation. The negation of the implication (P ∨ R) → (P ∧ S) is (P ∨ R) ∧ ¬(P ∧ S), where:
- P: Colorectal cancer is bile duct cancer
- R: Colorectal cancer is Cholangiocarcinoma
- S: Colorectal cancer is mild flu (equated here).

Axioms:
- Any deadly disease has low survival rate.
- Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
- Bile duct cancer is a severe cancer.
- Cholangiocarcinoma is a type of bile duct cancer.
- Mild flu has low survival rate.
- Colorectal cancer is not both bile duct cancer and low survival rate.

From the axioms, we derive:
1. If colorectal cancer were bile duct cancer (P), it would have low survival rate (by the chain: bile duct → severe → deadly → low survival). This contradicts the axiom that colorectal cancer is not both bile duct cancer and low survival rate (A6). Thus, ¬P.
2. If colorectal cancer were Cholangiocarcinoma (R), it would be bile duct cancer (P) via A4, leading to the same contradiction. Thus, ¬R.

Therefore, ¬(P ∨ R). The premise of the original implication is false, making the implication true. The negation (the statement being false) cannot be proven since (P ∨ R) is false. Thus, we cannot prove the conclusion false.
