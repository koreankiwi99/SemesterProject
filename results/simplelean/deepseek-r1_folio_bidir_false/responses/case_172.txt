ANSWER: False

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The error occurred because I incorrectly applied `A2` in the second case. `A2` states that growing up in a health-conscious home implies eating salads regularly, but it does not establish the converse (that eating salads requires growing up in such a home). Therefore, in the second case, we cannot derive a contradiction from `¬GrewUpHealthConsciousHome Taylor` and `EatsSaladsRegularly Taylor`.

After re-examining the axioms:
- In Case 1 (Taylor grew up health-conscious and disregards well-being), we get a contradiction because `HealthConscious Taylor` (from `A1`) conflicts with `¬HealthConscious Taylor` (from `A4`).
- In Case 2 (Taylor neither grew up health-conscious nor disregards well-being), we have:
  - `EatsSaladsRegularly Taylor` (assumption)
  - `HealthConscious Taylor` (from `A1`)
  - `¬DisregardsWellBeing Taylor` (consistent with `HealthConscious Taylor`)
  - `¬GrewUpHealthConsciousHome Taylor` (no axiom links this to `¬EatsSaladsRegularly`)
Since Case 2 has no contradiction, we cannot prove `¬EatsSaladsRegularly Taylor`.
