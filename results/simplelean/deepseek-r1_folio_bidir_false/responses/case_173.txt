The reasoning involves proving that Taylor does not visit the gym daily based on the given premises. By assuming Taylor visits the gym daily, we derive a contradiction through logical deductions using the axioms. Specifically:
1. If Taylor visits the gym daily, she fulfills her nutritional intakes (A5).
2. This implies she grew up in a health-conscious home (A3).
3. Thus, she eats salads regularly (A2) and is very health-conscious (A1).
4. However, A6 states Taylor either has a health-conscious childhood and disregards well-being, or neither.
5. In the first case, disregarding well-being contradicts being very health-conscious (A4).
6. In the second case, not having a health-conscious childhood contradicts step 2.
Both cases lead to contradiction, proving the negation.
