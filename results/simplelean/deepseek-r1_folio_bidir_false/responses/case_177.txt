The premises state that the last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo and that the United States won the most medals in Tokyo. Since the last games were held in Tokyo, winning the most medals "in Tokyo" directly implies winning the most medals at the last summer Olympic games. Therefore, the statement is true, and its negation cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Tokyo : obj
axiom UnitedStates : obj
axiom last_event : obj
axiom location : obj → obj
axiom won_most_medals : obj → obj → Prop
axiom T1 : location last_event = Tokyo
axiom T2 : won_most_medals UnitedStates last_event

-- The statement "The United States won the most medals in the last summer Olympic games" 
-- is formalized as: won_most_medals UnitedStates last_event
-- We have T2 as an axiom proving this statement true.
-- Attempting to prove the negation (¬ won_most_medals UnitedStates last_event) leads to contradiction with T2.
-- However, since we cannot prove the negation from the premises (as T2 directly affirms the statement),
-- we conclude Failure.
