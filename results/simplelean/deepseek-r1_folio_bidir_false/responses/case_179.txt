The context states that Susan flies to LGA airport, meaning there exists a departure airport (not specified) for Susan such that she arrives at LGA. John flies from LGA airport, meaning there exists an arrival airport (not specified) for John such that he departs from LGA. The axiom states that for any flight, the departure and arrival airports must be different. However, there is no information indicating that a person cannot have multiple flights. Susan could have one flight arriving at LGA and another flight departing from LGA (to a different airport), which would satisfy the axiom. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that Susan does not fly from LGA airport based solely on the given premises.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Airport : Type
axiom Susan : Person
axiom John : Person
axiom LGA : Airport
axiom Fly : Person → Airport → Airport → Prop
axiom T1 : ∃ d, Fly Susan d LGA
axiom R1 : ∀ (p : Person) (a b : Airport), Fly p a b → a ≠ b
axiom T2 : ∃ a, Fly John LGA a

-- We cannot prove ¬(∃ a, Fly Susan LGA a) because:
-- 1. T1 provides a flight for Susan arriving at LGA (from some d).
-- 2. T2 provides a flight for John departing from LGA (to some a).
-- 3. R1 only requires that within a single flight, departure ≠ arrival.
-- 4. There is no axiom preventing Susan from having multiple flights.
-- 5. A flight by Susan departing from LGA (to any airport ≠ LGA) would not contradict R1 or T1.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation.
