axiom Flight : Type
axiom Person : Type
axiom Airport : Type
axiom Susan : Person
axiom John : Person
axiom LGA : Airport
axiom flies : Person → Flight → Prop
axiom departure : Flight → Airport
axiom arrival : Flight → Airport

-- Premises
axiom susan_to_lga : ∃ f : Flight, flies Susan f ∧ arrival f = LGA
axiom no_same_airport : ∀ f : Flight, departure f ≠ arrival f
axiom john_from_lga : ∃ f : Flight, flies John f ∧ departure f = LGA

-- Statement to evaluate: John flies to LGA airport (i.e., ∃ f, flies John f ∧ arrival f = LGA)
-- We attempt to prove ¬ (∃ f, flies John f ∧ arrival f = LGA)

-- However, note:
-- We know John has a flight (say j_flight) with departure LGA (from john_from_lga).
-- For j_flight, we know departure j_flight ≠ arrival j_flight (by no_same_airport).
-- Thus, arrival j_flight ≠ LGA.

-- But this only applies to the specific flight j_flight. John might have another flight (different from j_flight) that arrives at LGA.
-- The premises do not state that John has only one flight. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of a second flight by John arriving at LGA.

-- Since we cannot prove the negation, we return Failure.
