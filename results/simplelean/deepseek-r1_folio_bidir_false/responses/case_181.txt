-- Attempt to prove ¬Grumpy Tom (Tom is not grumpy)
theorem tom_not_grumpy : ¬ Grumpy Tom :=
  fun h : Grumpy Tom =>  -- Assume Tom is grumpy
  have T_animal_lover : AnimalLover Tom := A4 Tom A5
  have T_nice : NiceToAnimals Tom := A3 Tom T_animal_lover
  have T_not_mean : ¬ MeanToAnimals Tom := A1 Tom T_nice
  -- We know some grumpy person is mean to animals (A2), but not necessarily Tom
  -- No axiom forces grumpy people to be mean to animals universally
  -- Cannot derive contradiction from h (Grumpy Tom) and T_not_mean
  -- Therefore, proof fails at this point
  False.elim (by
    -- Attempt to use A2: get witness [w] with [Grumpy w] and [MeanToAnimals w]
    rcases A2 with ⟨w, hw_grumpy, hw_mean⟩
    -- If w were Tom, we'd have contradiction, but no identity established
    -- Without knowing w = Tom, cannot apply T_not_mean to hw_mean
    -- No way to prove False

-- Proof incomplete: cannot derive ¬Grumpy Tom from premises
