-- Premises
axiom T1 : ∃ x, BasketballPlayer x ∧ ¬American x
axiom T2 : ∀ x, BasketballPlayer x → JumpShots x
axiom T3 : ∀ x, JumpShots x → LeapAir x
axiom T4 : ∀ x, LeapAir x → ActivateLegMuscles x
axiom T5 : ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri

-- Attempt to prove ¬American Yuri
theorem disprove_american : ¬American Yuri := by
  -- We can derive that Yuri isn't a basketball player
  have not_basketball : ¬BasketballPlayer Yuri := by
    intro hBasket
    have jump : JumpShots Yuri := T2 Yuri hBasket
    have leap : LeapAir Yuri := T3 Yuri jump
    exact T5 (T4 Yuri leap)
  -- But T1 only shows existence of non-American basketball players,
  -- not that non-basketball players are non-American. We have no
  -- information linking nationality to non-players.
  -- Cannot derive ¬American Yuri from the axioms.
  sorry -- Proof fails here

-- Since the proof cannot be completed without `sorry`, we conclude Failure.
