The goal is to prove that the statement "If Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish" is false. However, after formalizing the premises in Lean and attempting to derive a contradiction, it becomes clear that the statement holds true under the given axioms.

From the premises:
- Rockie is spotted and calm.
- Spotted animals are either rabbits or squirrels.
- Calm animals cannot be skittish.
- If Rockie were a squirrel, it would be skittish (contradicting calmness), so Rockie must be a rabbit.
- As a spotted rabbit, Rockie is cute.
- Thus, the conclusion "Rockie is cute or skittish" holds.
- The premise "Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel" is true because Rockie is not a squirrel.

Therefore, the implication is true, and its negation cannot be proven. The Lean code below formalizes this reasoning but does not derive a contradiction (False), leading to the conclusion of Failure.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Rockie : obj

axiom Rabbit : obj → Prop
axiom Turtle : obj → Prop
axiom Squirrel : obj → Prop
axiom Spotted : obj → Prop
axiom Cute : obj → Prop
axiom Skittish : obj → Prop
axiom Calm : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, (Rabbit x ∧ Spotted x) → Cute x
axiom A2 : ∃ x, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, Spotted x → Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
axiom A5 : ∀ x, Squirrel x → Spotted x → Skittish x
axiom T1 : Spotted Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

-- Attempt to prove the negation of the statement: ¬(¬(Turtle Rockie ∧ Squirrel Rockie) → (Cute Rockie ∨ Skittish Rockie))
-- This is equivalent to: (¬(Turtle Rockie ∧ Squirrel Rockie)) ∧ ¬(Cute Rockie ∨ Skittish Rockie)

-- Derive necessary facts about Rockie:
theorem not_squirrel : ¬ Squirrel Rockie := by
  intro h
  have ⟨spotted, calm⟩ := T1
  have skittish : Skittish Rockie := A5 Rockie h spotted
  exact A4 Rockie skittish calm

theorem is_rabbit : Rabbit Rockie := by
  have ⟨spotted, _⟩ := T1
  cases A3 Rockie spotted with
  | inl rabbit => exact rabbit
  | inr squirrel => exact (not_squirrel squirrel).elim

theorem is_cute : Cute Rockie := by
  have ⟨spotted, _⟩ := T1
  exact A1 Rockie ⟨is_rabbit, spotted⟩

-- Now, ¬(Cute Rockie ∨ Skittish Rockie) requires ¬Cute Rockie and ¬Skittish Rockie
-- But we have is_cute, so ¬(Cute Rockie ∨ Skittish Rockie) is false
-- Therefore, the conjunction (¬(Turtle Rockie ∧ Squirrel Rockie)) ∧ ¬(Cute Rockie ∨ Skittish Rockie) cannot hold
-- Hence, we cannot prove the negation of the original statement
