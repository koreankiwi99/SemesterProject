The reasoning text is translated into Lean code to evaluate the statement: "If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player." The premises establish that Yuri does not activate his leg muscles, which implies he does not leap. Further, if he were a basketball player, he would perform jump shots and leap, leading to a contradiction. Thus, Yuri cannot be a basketball player, making the consequent false. The antecedent is true, so the implication is false.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom BasketballPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom American : obj → Prop
axiom JumpShots : obj → Prop
axiom LeapAir : obj → Prop
axiom ActivateMuscles : obj → Prop
axiom Yuri : obj

axiom A1 : ∃ x, BasketballPlayer x ∧ ¬American x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, BasketballPlayer x → JumpShots x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, JumpShots x → LeapAir x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, LeapAir x → ActivateMuscles x
axiom A5 : ¬ActivateMuscles Yuri

theorem not_statement : ¬(¬LeapAir Yuri → (BasketballPlayer Yuri ∧ American Yuri)) := by
  intro h_imp
  have h_no_leap : ¬LeapAir Yuri := by
    intro h_leap
    exact A5 (A4 Yuri h_leap)
  have h_conj := h_imp h_no_leap
  have h_bp := h_conj.1
  have h_js := A2 Yuri h_bp
  have h_leap := A3 Yuri h_js

ANSWER: False
