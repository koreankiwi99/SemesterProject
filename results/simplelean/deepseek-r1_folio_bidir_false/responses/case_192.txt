The premises state that every event is either happy or sad (inclusive) and that at least one event is happy. However, the conclusion "All events are sad" can still hold if the happy event is also sad. Since there is no premise stating that happy and sad are mutually exclusive, we cannot prove that the conclusion is false. Thus, we return "Failure."

<lean>
axiom Event : Type
axiom Happy : Event → Prop
axiom Sad : Event → Prop
axiom A1 : ∀ (e : Event), Happy e ∨ Sad e
axiom A2 : ∃ (e : Event), Happy e
-- Cannot prove ¬(∀ e, Sad e) because a happy event might also be sad

ANSWER: Failure
