The reasoning shows that assuming KiKi is a barking dog leads to a contradiction. Specifically:
1. If KiKi is a dog, it barks (premise 2).
2. Jane dislikes barking animals (premise 1), so Jane dislikes KiKi.
3. Premise 7 and other logical deductions force KiKi to either jump or have legs.
4. If KiKi jumps, Jane likes it (premise 3), contradicting step 2.
5. If KiKi has legs, it jumps (premise 4), again leading to Jane liking it, contradicting step 2.
Thus, KiKi cannot be a barking dog.

The compilation errors were due to the use of the `push_neg` tactic, which is not available in the core Lean 4. The proof has been revised using basic tactics without `push_neg`. The key fixes include:

1. Replaced `push_neg` with explicit decomposition of the negation using `fun` and `Or.inl`/`Or.inr`
2. Used explicit term application (`exact not_liked liked`) instead of `contradiction` for clarity
3. Maintained consistent variable naming in the proof

The corrected Lean 4 code proves that "KiKi is a barking dog" is false from the given premises.

The compilation errors occurred due to the use of the `by_contra` tactic, which is not available in core Lean 4. The proof has been revised using classical logic with the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM) to derive the required disjunction. Key fixes include:

1. Added `axiom lem : ∀ (P : Prop), P ∨ ¬P` to enable classical reasoning
2. Replaced `by_contra` with explicit case analysis using LEM
3. Simplified the proof by directly applying contradictions
4. Maintained consistent variable naming throughout

The corrected Lean 4 code proves that "KiKi is a barking dog" is false from the given premises.
