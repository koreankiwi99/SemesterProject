The premises establish that "Stranger Things" is popular, which implies Karen binge-watches it. The binge-watching directly leads to sharing with Lisa according to the given conditional. There is no information contradicting this chain for "Stranger Things," and the details about "Black Mirror" don't affect this conclusion. Therefore, the statement "Karen will share 'Stranger Things' with Lisa" follows from the premises, making its negation unprovable.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because `ST` is a reserved name in Lean (related to the State monad). To fix this, I renamed the constants for the shows to avoid name clashes. The corrected Lean code uses `strangerThings` and `blackMirror` as show constants.

After analyzing the premises:
1. "Stranger Things" is popular (`Popular strangerThings`)
2. Popular shows are binge-watched (`∀s, Popular s → BingeWatch s`)
3. Binge-watching iff downloading (`∀s, BingeWatch s ↔ Download s`)
4. "Black Mirror" is not downloaded (`¬Download blackMirror`)
5. Binge-watched shows are shared (`∀s, BingeWatch s → Share s`)

We can prove `Share strangerThings`:
- From 1 and 2: `BingeWatch strangerThings`
- From 5: `Share strangerThings`

The negation `¬Share strangerThings` cannot be proven because:
- The premises directly imply `Share strangerThings`
- The information about "Black Mirror" doesn't contradict anything about "Stranger Things"
- There are no inconsistent axioms that would allow proving a contradiction

Thus, we cannot prove the negation of the statement.
