The goal is to prove the negation of the statement "Karen will share 'Black Mirror' with Lisa" from the given premises. The premises establish:
- "Black Mirror" is a Netflix show.
- Karen does not download "Black Mirror."
- The biconditional: Karen binge-watches a Netflix show if and only if she downloads it.
- The implication: If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she shares it with Lisa.

From the biconditional and the fact that Karen does not download "Black Mirror," it follows that Karen does not binge-watch "Black Mirror." However, the sharing premise only states that binge-watching is sufficient for sharing, not necessary. Without additional premises indicating that binge-watching is the only way sharing occurs, we cannot conclude that Karen does not share "Black Mirror" with Lisa. Thus, the negation cannot be proven.

axiom obj : Type
axiom BlackMirror : obj
axiom NetflixShow : obj → Prop
axiom DownloadKaren : obj → Prop
axiom BingeKaren : obj → Prop
axiom ShareWithLisa : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : NetflixShow BlackMirror
axiom T2 : ¬ DownloadKaren BlackMirror
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, NetflixShow x → (BingeKaren x ↔ DownloadKaren x)
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, NetflixShow x → BingeKaren x → ShareWithLisa x

theorem no_binge : ¬ BingeKaren BlackMirror := by
  intro hBinge
  have h : BingeKaren BlackMirror ↔ DownloadKaren BlackMirror := R1 BlackMirror T1
  have hDownload : DownloadKaren BlackMirror := h.mp hBinge
  exact T2 hDownload

-- Cannot prove ¬ShareWithLisa BlackMirror because R2 does not provide the converse.
