The statement claims that Beijing hosted both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics. The context confirms that Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and has hosted the Winter Olympics (in 2022), but it does not specify that the Winter Olympics were hosted in 2008. Since the statement does not specify a year for the Winter Olympics, the general claim that Beijing hosted both events (in any years) is supported by the context. Therefore, the negation of the statement cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Beijing : obj
axiom HostedSummer2008 : obj → Prop
axiom HostedWinter : obj → Prop  -- Represents hosting any Winter Olympics
axiom T1 : HostedSummer2008 Beijing  -- From "hosted 2008 Summer Olympics"
axiom T2 : HostedWinter Beijing      -- From "hosted Winter Olympics"

-- The statement: HostedSummer2008 Beijing ∧ HostedWinter Beijing
-- We have T1 and T2, so the statement is true. 
-- Cannot prove ¬(HostedSummer2008 Beijing ∧ HostedWinter Beijing)
