ANSWER: Failure

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred due to the use of `∃!` for unique existence, which is not valid in Lean 4. Instead, unique existence must be explicitly defined using `∃` and `∀` with uniqueness constraints.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom City : Type
axiom Beijing : City
axiom ChineseCity : City → Prop
axiom Population : City → Nat

def Larger (x y : City) : Prop := Population x > Population y

def SecondLargest (x : City) : Prop := 
  ChineseCity x ∧ 
  ∃ L : City, 
    ChineseCity L ∧ 
    Larger L x ∧ 
    (∀ y : City, ChineseCity y → Larger y x → y = L)

axiom capital_PRC : ChineseCity Beijing
axiom capital_most_populous : ChineseCity Beijing
axiom in_Northern_China : ChineseCity Beijing
axiom hosted_2008_events : ChineseCity Beijing
axiom hosted_multiple_olympics : ChineseCity Beijing
axiom good_universities : ChineseCity Beijing

theorem not_second_largest : ¬ SecondLargest Beijing :=
by
  -- No information about:
  -- 1. Population of Beijing vs other cities
  -- 2. Existence/non-existence of larger cities
  -- 3. Uniqueness of larger cities
  -- Therefore impossible to prove negation
  sorry

ANSWER: Failure

Explanation:
1. Replaced `∃!` with explicit definition of unique existence using `∃ L` and `∀ y` with uniqueness constraint
2. Maintained all context axioms about Beijing being a Chinese city
3. The proof still fails because:
   - No population data exists for any city
   - No comparisons between Beijing and other cities are provided
   - "Most populous nation" doesn't imply anything about Beijing's rank among Chinese cities
   - Olympic hosting and university quality don't correlate with population rank

The context provides no information to refute Beijing being the second largest Chinese city.
