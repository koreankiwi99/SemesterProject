The goal is to prove that "James has lunch in the company" is false, i.e., ¬HasLunchInBuilding James. After analyzing the axioms:

1. If James has lunch in the building:
   - He schedules meetings (A2).
   - He goes to the building (A1).
   - He is a manager (A7).
   - Managers cannot work remotely (A6).
   - This is consistent since lunch in the building doesn't imply remote work.

2. If James has lunch at home:
   - He works remotely (A4).
   - He cannot be a manager (A6).
   - He does not go to the building (A7).
   - He may or may not schedule meetings (no axiom prevents scheduling while remote).
   - This is also consistent if he doesn't schedule meetings.

Since both scenarios are consistent with the axioms, we cannot prove ¬HasLunchInBuilding James.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person

axiom SchedulesMeeting : Person → Prop
axiom GoesToBuildingToday : Person → Prop
axiom HasLunchInBuilding : Person → Prop
axiom HasLunchAtHome : Person → Prop
axiom WorksRemotelyFromHome : Person → Prop
axiom IsManager : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, SchedulesMeeting x → GoesToBuildingToday x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, HasLunchInBuilding x → SchedulesMeeting x
axiom A3 : ∀ x, HasLunchInBuilding x ∨ HasLunchAtHome x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, HasLunchAtHome x → WorksRemotelyFromHome x
axiom A6 : ∀ x, IsManager x → ¬WorksRemotelyFromHome x
axiom A7 : GoesToBuildingToday James ↔ IsManager James

-- Attempt to prove ¬HasLunchInBuilding James fails due to consistency of both cases
