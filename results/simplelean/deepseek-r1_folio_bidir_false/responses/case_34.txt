The context states that Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine, which includes the Creed Brothers. However, "leads" is defined as a relation between a leader and a group (here, Diamond Mine). There is no explicit information indicating that Roderick Strong directly leads the Creed Brothers subgroup. While they are part of Diamond Mine, the axioms do not establish that leading a stable implies leading every subgroup or member within it. Consequently, proving the negation of the statement (¬(Roderick Strong leads the Creed Brothers)) is impossible with the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom RoderickStrong : obj
axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom CreedBrothers : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj
axiom Imperium : obj

axiom stable : obj → Prop
axiom leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom includes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom hasFeud : obj → obj → Prop

axiom T1 : stable DiamondMine
axiom T2 : leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
axiom T3 : includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
axiom T4 : includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom T5 : hasFeud Imperium DiamondMine

-- No axiom links "leads a stable" to "leads every subgroup/member"
-- Cannot prove ¬(leads RoderickStrong CreedBrothers) from given premises
