The context states that Diamond Mine is a stable that includes Ivy Nile, and Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine. Therefore, there exists a stable (Diamond Mine) that includes Ivy Nile and has a feud with Imperium. This directly contradicts the statement "Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile," proving it false.
