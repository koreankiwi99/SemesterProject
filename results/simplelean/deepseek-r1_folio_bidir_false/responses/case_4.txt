The goal is to prove that the statement "James does not have lunch in the company" is false, i.e., to prove `HasLunchInBuilding James` from the given premises. After formalizing the context in Lean, the analysis shows that it is impossible to prove `HasLunchInBuilding James` due to insufficient information about James's employment status and whether he is a manager. Specifically:

- Premise 7 states that James appears in the company if and only if he is a manager, but it does not specify whether James is actually a manager.
- If James is a manager, then by premise 6 he does not work remotely. If we assume managers are employees (which is not explicitly stated), premises 3 and 4 would imply he must have lunch in the building to avoid contradiction. However, without this assumption or knowledge of his employment, we cannot apply premises 3, 4, or 5.
- If James is not a manager, premise 7 implies he does not go to the building, but there is no constraint forcing his lunch location.
- Premise 2 applies to everyone, but it only ensures that if James has lunch in the building, he schedules meetings, which does not force him to have lunch there.

Since no contradiction arises from assuming `¬HasLunchInBuilding James`, and `HasLunchInBuilding James` cannot be proven, the negation of the statement cannot be established.
