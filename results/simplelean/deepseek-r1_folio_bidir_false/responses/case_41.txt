The goal is to prove the negation of the statement "A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy" (interpreted as ∀ s, Adores s → Evocative s ∨ Dreamy s) from the given premises. The Lean code attempts to prove the existence of a style s that Max adores which is neither evocative nor dreamy (∃ s, Adores s ∧ ¬Evocative s ∧ ¬Dreamy s). However, the premises lead to a contradiction for any Zaha Hadid style that Max adores (due to conflicting requirements about interesting geometries and brutalist buildings), and Kelly Wearstler styles are both evocative and dreamy. This contradiction implies that no such counterexample can exist. Moreover, the premises do not provide a specific witness for the existential claim. Thus, the negation cannot be proven.

axiom Style : Type
axiom Adores : Style → Prop
axiom ZahaStyle : Style → Prop
axiom KellyStyle : Style → Prop
axiom Brutalist : Style → Prop
axiom InterestingGeometry : Style → Prop
axiom Evocative : Style → Prop
axiom Dreamy : Style → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ s : Style, ZahaStyle s ∧ Adores s → InterestingGeometry s
axiom P2 : ∀ s : Style, Brutalist s ∧ Adores s → ¬ InterestingGeometry s
axiom P3 : ∀ s : Style, Adores s → ZahaStyle s ∨ KellyStyle s
axiom P4 : ∀ s : Style, KellyStyle s ∧ Adores s → Evocative s
axiom P5 : ∀ s : Style, KellyStyle s ∧ Adores s → Dreamy s
axiom P6 : ∀ s : Style, Adores s ∧ InterestingGeometry s → Brutalist s ∧ Evocative s

theorem neg_conclusion : ∃ s, Adores s ∧ ¬Evocative s ∧ ¬Dreamy s :=

  -- Attempt to find a witness style s that Max adores but is neither evocative nor dreamy.
  -- Consider cases based on premise 3: any adored style is either ZahaStyle or KellyStyle.
  -- Case 1: KellyStyle s → by P4 and P5, s is both evocative and dreamy → contradicts ¬Evocative s ∧ ¬Dreamy s.
  -- Case 2: ZahaStyle s → 
  --   By P1: s has interesting geometries.
  --   By P6: s is brutalist and evocative.
  --   By P2: brutalist and adored implies no interesting geometries → contradiction.
  -- Thus, no such s exists. Cannot prove the existential.
  sorry -- Proof fails
