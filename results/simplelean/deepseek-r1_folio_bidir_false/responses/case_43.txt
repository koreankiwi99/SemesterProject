The Lean code models the given context and attempts to prove the negation of the statement "Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal". The key steps are:

1. Define the domain and predicates:
   - `Player` type for tennis players
   - Predicates for properties (WTA highly ranked, lost to Świątek/Nadal, female/male, at Roland Garros 2022)
   - Constant `Coco_Gauff`

2. Formalize all axioms:
   - A1: WTA highly ranked → most active (unused in proof)
   - A2: Lost to Świątek → WTA highly ranked
   - A3: At RG2022 and female → lost to Świątek
   - A4: At RG2022 → female or male
   - A5: At RG2022 and male → lost to Nadal
   - A6: (WTA highly ranked or lost to Nadal) → not male
   - A7: Coco_Gauff at RG2022

3. Prove intermediate results:
   - `coco_not_male`: Coco_Gauff cannot be male (using A4, A5, A6, A7)
   - `coco_female`: Coco_Gauff is female (using A4, A7, coco_not_male)
   - `coco_lost_swiatek`: Coco_Gauff lost to Świątek (using A3, A7, coco_female)
   - `coco_wta_high`: Coco_Gauff is WTA highly ranked (using A2, coco_lost_swiatek)

4. Attempt to prove `¬ Lost_to_Nadal Coco_Gauff`:
   - Assume `Lost_to_Nadal Coco_Gauff`
   - This satisfies the disjunction in A6 (right branch)
   - A6 yields `¬ Male Coco_Gauff` (already proven)
   - No contradiction found
   - Cannot derive False from premises

The conclusion "Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal" cannot be proven false from the given axioms.

  -- We have no contradiction from assuming Lost_to_Nadal Coco_Gauff
  -- since axioms allow female players to lose to Nadal
