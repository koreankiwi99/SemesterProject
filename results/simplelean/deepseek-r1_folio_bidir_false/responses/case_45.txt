The context states that all cats are mammals and some pets are not mammals. The statement to evaluate is "No pets are cats," meaning there are no pets that are cats. To prove this false, we need to show that there exists at least one pet that is a cat (i.e., ∃x, Pet x ∧ Cat x). However, the premises do not force this existence. The existence of a non-mammalian pet does not imply the existence of a cat (which would be mammalian), and there might be no cats at all. Thus, the negation cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Cat : obj → Prop
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom Pet : obj → Prop

axiom all_cats_mammals : ∀ x, Cat x → Mammal x
axiom some_pets_not_mammals : ∃ x, Pet x ∧ ¬ Mammal x

-- Attempt to prove the negation of "No pets are cats" (i.e., ∃ x, Pet x ∧ Cat x)
-- We have an object that is a pet and not a mammal. If this object were a cat, 
-- it would be a mammal (by all_cats_mammals), contradicting ¬Mammal x. Thus, 
-- this object cannot be a cat. The premises do not provide evidence for any other 
-- pet that is a cat. Therefore, we cannot prove ∃ x, Pet x ∧ Cat x.
