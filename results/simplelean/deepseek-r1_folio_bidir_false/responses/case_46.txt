inductive Season where
  | spring
  | summer
  | fall
  | winter

inductive Student where
  | emma
  | mia
  | james

axiom WantsLongVacation : Student → Prop
axiom FavoriteSeason : Student → Season → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ (s : Student), WantsLongVacation s → FavoriteSeason s Season.summer
axiom T2 : FavoriteSeason Student.emma Season.summer
axiom T3 : ¬ FavoriteSeason Student.mia Season.summer
axiom T4 : WantsLongVacation Student.james

-- Attempt to prove that James's favorite season is NOT summer (¬FavoriteSeason Student.james Season.summer)
theorem prove_negation : ¬ FavoriteSeason Student.james Season.summer := by
  -- We have T1: ∀s, WantsLongVacation s → FavoriteSeason s summer
  -- and T4: WantsLongVacation james, so by T1 james T4 we get FavoriteSeason james summer
  -- This directly contradicts the goal. Therefore, we cannot prove the negation.
  -- Instead, we can prove the positive statement:
  have james_summer : FavoriteSeason Student.james Season.summer := T1 Student.james T4
  -- Since we have proof of FavoriteSeason james summer, we cannot prove its negation
  intro h
  -- At this point, we have both james_summer and h, but they are not contradictory
  -- because h is the same as james_summer. We have no axiom that makes summer unique per student?
  -- Actually, we don't have an axiom that forbids multiple students from having summer as favorite.
  -- Moreover, T3 only says Mia doesn't have summer, which doesn't affect James.
  -- Therefore, we cannot derive contradiction.
  -- We must admit failure to prove the negation.
  admit

-- Since the above theorem requires 'admit', it means we cannot prove the negation.
