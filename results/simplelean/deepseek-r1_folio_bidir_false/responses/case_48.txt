The Lean code attempts to prove that "1984 is printed text" is false from the given premises. The premises are translated into axioms, and the negation of the statement (¬ PrintedText n1984) is the goal.

- **Premise 1**: No digital media are analog → ∀ x, Digital x → ¬ Analog x  
- **Premise 2**: Every printed text is analog → ∀ x, PrintedText x → Analog x  
- **Premise 3**: All streaming services are digital → ∀ x, StreamingService x → Digital x  
- **Premise 4**: Hardcover books are printed text → ∀ x, HardcoverBook x → PrintedText x  
- **Premise 5**: If 1984 is a streaming service, it is a hardcover book → StreamingService n1984 → HardcoverBook n1984  

**Analysis**:  
- Assuming `PrintedText n1984` leads to `Analog n1984` (by Premise 2).  
- There is no premise forcing `n1984` to be digital. The only path to digital (via `StreamingService`) is unattainable because assuming `StreamingService n1984` leads to a contradiction (via Premises 5, 4, 2, 3, and 1). However, `¬ StreamingService n1984` does not contradict `PrintedText n1984`.  
- Without evidence that `n1984` is digital, `PrintedText n1984` does not violate "no digital media are analog".  

**Result**: The negation of "1984 is printed text" cannot be proven. The statement might be true in some models consistent with the premises (e.g., where `n1984` is analog printed text but not digital).

-- Proving ¬ PrintedText n1984 is impossible
-- Attempted approach: Assume PrintedText n1984 (hPT) and derive contradiction.
-- Only contradiction arises under StreamingService n1984, but we have no such evidence.
theorem impossible : ¬ PrintedText n1984 :=
  fun hPT : PrintedText n1984 => 
    have hAna : Analog n1984 := A2 n1984 hPT   -- From A2
    -- To use A1 (Digital n1984 → ¬Analog n1984), we need Digital n1984.
    -- Digital n1984 only derives from StreamingService n1984 (A3), but:
    --   If we assume StreamingService n1984 (hSS),
    have hSS_contradiction : StreamingService n1984 → False := 
      fun hSS : StreamingService n1984 =>
        have hDig : Digital n1984 := A3 n1984 hSS
        have hBook : HardcoverBook n1984 := A5 hSS
        have hPT' : PrintedText n1984 := A4 n1984 hBook
        have hAna' : Analog n1984 := A2 n1984 hPT'
        have hNotAna : ¬ Analog n1984 := A1 n1984 hDig
        hNotAna hAna'
    -- This proves ¬StreamingService n1984 (not_SS), but not PrintedText n1984.
    -- Without StreamingService n1984, no further contradiction is possible.
    -- Hence, we cannot derive False from hPT.
    -- Without additional constraints on n1984, PrintedText n1984 does not yield a contradiction.
