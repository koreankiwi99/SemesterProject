The goal is to prove that the statement "1984 is not a streaming service" is false, meaning we need to prove that 1984 is a streaming service (`StreamingService a1984`) from the given premises. However, the premises do not provide direct evidence that 1984 is a streaming service. Instead, they establish relationships between categories:

1. Digital media are not analog.
2. Printed texts are analog media.
3. Streaming services are digital media.
4. Hardcover books are printed texts.
5. If 1984 is a streaming service, then it is a hardcover book.

Assuming `StreamingService a1984` leads to a contradiction:
- It implies `HardcoverBook a1984` (from axiom 5).
- Then `PrintedText a1984` (from axiom 4).
- Then `Analog a1984` (from axiom 2).
- But `StreamingService a1984` also implies `Digital a1984` (from axiom 3).
- And `Digital a1984` implies `¬ Analog a1984` (from axiom 1), contradicting `Analog a1984`.

This contradiction proves that `¬ StreamingService a1984` must be true. Therefore, we **cannot** prove `StreamingService a1984` (the negation of the conclusion). Since we fail to prove the conclusion false, the answer is Failure.
