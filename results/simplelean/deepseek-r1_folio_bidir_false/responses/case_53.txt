ANSWER: False

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The error occurred because the proof for `¬IndoEuropean French` was incorrectly structured. The axioms actually prove that French *is* Indo-European, making it impossible to prove the negation. Here's the corrected analysis:

axiom French : Language
axiom Spanish : Language
axiom German : Language
axiom Basque : Language
axiom Romance : Language → Prop
axiom IndoEuropean : Language → Prop
axiom Related : Language → Language → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ l : Language, Romance l → IndoEuropean l

axiom A4 : Romance Spanish
axiom A5 : Related German Spanish
axiom A6 : ∀ x : Language, x ≠ Basque → ¬Related Basque x

-- Proof that French is Indo-European (contradicting the negation)
theorem french_indoeuropean : IndoEuropean French := A1 French A3

-- Attempt to prove ¬IndoEuropean French fails because:
-- 1. We have direct proof of IndoEuropean French (A1 + A3)
-- 2. No axioms contradict this fact
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure

Explanation:
- The premise "All Romance languages are Indo-European" (A1) combined with "French is a Romance language" (A3) proves `IndoEuropean French`.
- The other axioms about language relationships don't provide any contradiction to this fact.
- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation `¬IndoEuropean French`.
