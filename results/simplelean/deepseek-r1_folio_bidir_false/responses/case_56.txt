The context does not provide any information about Robert Lewandowski being a "star" or any properties related to stardom. The axioms establish that he is a striker (hence a soccer player), left Bayern Munchen, and no longer plays for them, but there are no premises connecting these facts to the concept of being a star. Therefore, it is impossible to prove the negation of the statement "Robert Lewandowski is a star" from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom RobertLewandowski : obj
axiom BayernMunchen : obj
axiom Striker : obj → Prop
axiom SoccerPlayer : obj → Prop
axiom Left : obj → obj → Prop
axiom PlaysFor : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Star : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : Striker RobertLewandowski
axiom T2 : ∀ x, Striker x → SoccerPlayer x
axiom T3 : Left RobertLewandowski BayernMunchen
axiom T4 : ∀ (player : obj) (team : obj), Left player team → ¬ PlaysFor player team

-- No axioms relate Striker/SoccerPlayer/Left to Star. Cannot prove ¬Star RobertLewandowski.
