The reasoning involves proving that Butte and St Pierre are not in the same state based on the given context. The key steps are:

1. Butte is in Montana (explicitly stated).
2. St Pierre is not in Montana (explicitly stated).
3. Non-exceptional cities (like Butte and St Pierre) can only be in one state (given the exception list excludes them).
4. Therefore, Butte is exclusively in Montana.
5. If St Pierre were in the same state as Butte, it would have to be Montana, contradicting premise 2.

The Lean formalization captures these points and proves the negation of the statement "Butte and St Pierre are in the same state".

<lean>
axiom City : Type
axiom State : Type
axiom Montana : State
axiom Butte : City
axiom StPierre : City

axiom IsInState : City → State → Prop

axiom butte_in_montana : IsInState Butte Montana
axiom stPierre_not_in_montana : ¬ IsInState StPierre Montana

-- Non-exceptional cities (Butte/StPierre not in exception list) have unique states
axiom unique_state : ∀ (c : City) (s1 s2 : State), IsInState c s1 → IsInState c s2 → s1 = s2

theorem not_same_state : ¬ ∃ s, IsInState Butte s ∧ IsInState StPierre s := by
