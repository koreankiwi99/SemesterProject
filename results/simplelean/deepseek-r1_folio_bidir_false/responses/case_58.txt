The goal is to prove that the statement "St Pierre and Bismarck are in the same state" is false. However, after formalizing the context in Lean, it becomes clear that there is insufficient information to prove this negation. The premises establish that St Pierre is not in Montana and that Butte, Billings, Helena, Missoula, and White Sulphur Springs are in Montana. The rule that non-exception cities (like St Pierre and Bismarck) can be in at most one state is also included. However, there is no information about Bismarck's state. Bismarck could be in the same state as St Pierre or a different state, and neither scenario contradicts the premises. Therefore, the negation cannot be proven.
