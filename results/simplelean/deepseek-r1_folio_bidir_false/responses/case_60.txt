theorem negate : ¬HasF1 Mike := by
  intro hF1 -- Assume Mike has F1 visa
  -- We have no information about Mike's work intentions (WantsToWork Mike) 
  -- and no axioms that force a contradiction from Mike having F1.
  have visa : HasF1 Mike ∨ HasJ1 Mike := A1 Mike A3
  cases visa
  case inl f1 => -- Mike has F1 - no contradiction
    -- To trigger A2, we'd need WantsToWork Mike, which isn't provided
    apply False.elim ?a -- Missing contradiction
    sorry  -- Unable to derive contradiction
  case inr j1 => -- Mike has J1 but could potentially have both since exclusivity isn't stated
    -- No axiom prevents Mike from having both visas simultaneously
    have simultaneously : HasF1 Mike ∧ HasJ1 Mike := ⟨hF1, j1⟩
    -- Still no contradiction as no axiom relates F1/J1 to incompatible properties
    apply False.elim ?b
    sorry  -- Unable to derive contradiction
