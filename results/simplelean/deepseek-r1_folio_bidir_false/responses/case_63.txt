The reasoning involves proving that the statement "Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle" is false based on the given premises. The key steps are:

1. **Ted is an alligator** (premise), and **alligators are not domesticated animals** (premise). Therefore, Ted is not domesticated.
2. **All Brown Swiss cattle are cows** (premise), and **all cows are domesticated animals** (premise). Therefore, all Brown Swiss cattle are domesticated.
3. If Ted were Brown Swiss cattle, he would be domesticated, but Ted is not domesticated (from step 1). Thus, Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle.
4. The statement claims Ted is both a pet and Brown Swiss cattle. Since Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle (step 3), the conjunction is false regardless of whether Ted is a pet.

The Lean formalization proves the negation of the statement using the axioms:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Ted : obj
axiom BrownSwiss : obj → Prop
axiom Cow : obj → Prop
axiom Pet : obj → Prop
axiom DomesticatedAnimal : obj → Prop
axiom Alligator : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BrownSwiss x → Cow x
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Pet x ∧ BrownSwiss x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Cow x → DomesticatedAnimal x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Alligator x → ¬DomesticatedAnimal x
axiom A5 : Alligator Ted

theorem not_ted_pet_and_brown : ¬ (Pet Ted ∧ BrownSwiss Ted) :=
  fun ⟨hPet, hBrown⟩ =>
    have hCow : Cow Ted := A1 Ted hBrown
    have hDom : DomesticatedAnimal Ted := A3 Ted hCow
    have hNotDom : ¬DomesticatedAnimal Ted := A4 Ted A5
    hNotDom hDom
</lean>

ANSWER: False
