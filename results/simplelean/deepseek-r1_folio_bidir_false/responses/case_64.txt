After analyzing the premises and the statement to evaluate, I attempted to prove that the conclusion "If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet" is false. This requires proving the negation of the conditional: that Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle and Ted is a pet. However, the premises lead to a contradiction if Ted is assumed to be a Brown Swiss cattle, because:

1. Ted is an alligator (premise).
2. Alligators are not domesticated (premise).
3. If Ted were a Brown Swiss cattle:
   - All Brown Swiss cattle are cows (premise), so Ted would be a cow.
   - All cows are domesticated (premise), so Ted would be domesticated.
4. This contradicts the fact that alligators are not domesticated.

Thus, Ted cannot be a Brown Swiss cattle. This means the antecedent of the conditional is false, making the entire conditional true. Consequently, the negation of the conditional (Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle and a pet) cannot be proven from the premises. Therefore, it is impossible to prove the conclusion false.

ITERATION 2

The compilation error occurred because the `⟨...⟩` notation was used incorrectly on a non-inductive type. The original approach attempted to destruct a negation of an implication (`¬(P → Q)`) as if it were a conjunction, which is not valid in Lean without classical reasoning. 

After analysis:
1. The conclusion to prove false is: "If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet"
2. This requires proving its negation: "Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle and Ted is a pet"
3. However, the premises lead to:
   - Ted is an alligator
   - Alligators are not domesticated
   - Brown Swiss cattle are cows, which are domesticated
4. If Ted were a Brown Swiss cattle, this would create a contradiction (domesticated vs. not domesticated)
5. Therefore, Ted cannot be a Brown Swiss cattle, making the antecedent false
6. This means we cannot prove the conjunction "Ted is Brown Swiss cattle and a pet"
7. Thus, we cannot prove the original conclusion false
