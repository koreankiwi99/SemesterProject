Based on the provided context, there is no information about the endowments of other educational institutions. While Yale's endowment is stated as $42.3 billion, there are no comparison points to determine if it is the largest. The residential colleges listed are part of Yale University, not separate educational institutions. Therefore, it is impossible to prove either the statement or its negation from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Yale : obj
axiom endowment : obj → ℝ
axiom IsEducationalInstitution : obj → Prop

-- Given endowment value for Yale
axiom yale_endowment : endowment Yale = 42300000000

-- No information about other institutions' endowments
-- Residential colleges are part of Yale, not separate institutions

-- Negation of the statement: ∃ x, IsEducationalInstitution x ∧ endowment x > endowment Yale
-- Cannot construct such an x from given axioms
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure
