The context states that there is a list of residential colleges at Yale, and Pierson College is included in that list. This directly supports the statement that Pierson College is a residential college at Yale. Attempting to prove the negation (that Pierson College is not a residential college) leads to a contradiction with the given information. However, the premises do not contain any contradiction or additional information that would allow proving the negation. Therefore, the negation cannot be proven.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
constant PiersonCollege : obj
axiom ResidentialCollege : obj → Prop
axiom in_residential_list : ResidentialCollege PiersonCollege
</lean>

The compilation error occurred due to using `constant` incorrectly. The fixed code uses `axiom` consistently for all declarations and ensures proper type handling.

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom College : Type
axiom PiersonCollege : College
axiom ResidentialCollege : College → Prop
axiom in_residential_list : ResidentialCollege PiersonCollege
</lean>

**Explanation:**  
- `College` is declared as a type
- `PiersonCollege` is a constant of type `College`
- `ResidentialCollege` is a predicate on colleges
- `in_residential_list` axiom states PiersonCollege has this property

The context explicitly lists Pierson College as a residential college, making the statement true. The premises contain no contradiction that would allow us to prove "Pierson College is NOT a residential college" (the negation of the statement). We cannot derive a contradiction from:  
1. The list of colleges (which includes Pierson College)  
2. The axiom that Pierson College is residential  

Therefore, we cannot prove the negation.
