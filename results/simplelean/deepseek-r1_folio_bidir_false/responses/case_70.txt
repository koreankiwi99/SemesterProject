The context does not explicitly state that mature stocks are stocks. While "KO is a mature stock" is given, there is no axiom linking "MatureStock" to "Stock". Therefore, we cannot prove that KO is not a stock (¬Stock KO) from the premises. Attempting to derive a contradiction fails because:
- KO being a mature stock implies it is suitable for retirement (via R3).
- If KO were a growth stock, it would lead to a contradiction (since growth stocks are bought for profit and thus not suitable for retirement). However, there is no evidence that KO is a growth stock.
- The existence of some growth stocks (T1) does not involve KO.

Thus, ¬Stock KO cannot be proven.

axiom obj : Type
axiom KO : obj
axiom Stock : obj → Prop
axiom GrowthStock : obj → Prop
axiom MatureStock : obj → Prop
axiom BoughtForProfit : obj → Prop
axiom SuitableForRetirement : obj → Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ x, GrowthStock x → BoughtForProfit x
axiom R2 : ∀ x, BoughtForProfit x → ¬ SuitableForRetirement x
axiom T1 : ∃ x, Stock x ∧ GrowthStock x
axiom R3 : ∀ x, MatureStock x → SuitableForRetirement x
axiom T2 : MatureStock KO

-- Attempt to prove ¬Stock KO leads to failure
-- No axioms connect MatureStock to Stock or prohibit KO from being a Stock
