The goal is to prove that the statement "If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile" is false. The Lean formalization includes the given context and attempts to derive a contradiction from the negation of the statement.

From the premises:
- KO is a mature stock (T5).
- All mature stocks are suitable for retirement (T4), so KO is suitable for retirement.
- If a stock is bought for profit, it is not suitable for retirement (T2). By contraposition, since KO is suitable for retirement, it is not bought for profit.
- All growth stocks are bought for profit (T1), so if KO were a growth stock, it would be bought for profit, leading to a contradiction. Thus, KO is not a growth stock.

Therefore, the antecedent (KO is a growth stock or bought for profit) is false, making the entire implication true. The negation of the statement cannot be proven, as it requires the antecedent to be true (which is false) or the consequent to be false (but there is no information about KO being a stock or volatility).
