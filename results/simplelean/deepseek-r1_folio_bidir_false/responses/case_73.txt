The context provides information about vehicle registration plates in Istanbul and specific plates for Joe and Tom. The key premises are:

1. All Istanbul plates begin with 34: `∀p, Istanbul p → BeginsWith34 p`
2. Plates not beginning with 34 are not from Istanbul: `∀p, ¬BeginsWith34 p → ¬Istanbul p` (redundant as it's the contrapositive of 1)
3. Joe's plate is from Istanbul: `Istanbul JoePlate`
4. Tom's plate begins with 35: `BeginsWith35 TomPlate`
5. Plates beginning with 35 do not begin with 34: `∀p, BeginsWith35 p → ¬BeginsWith34 p`

The statement to evaluate is: "Joe's license plate begins with the number 34." From premise 1 and 3, we derive `BeginsWith34 JoePlate`. Attempting to prove the negation (`¬BeginsWith34 JoePlate`):

- Assume `¬BeginsWith34 JoePlate`
- From premise 2, this implies `¬Istanbul JoePlate`
- But premise 3 states `Istanbul JoePlate`, leading to a contradiction
- However, this contradiction proves the *original* statement (`BeginsWith34 JoePlate`), not its negation

No premises connect Joe's plate to Tom's plate (e.g., no equality or shared properties), so Tom's plate (beginning with 35) doesn't affect Joe. Thus, the negation cannot be proven.

axiom obj : Type
axiom JoePlate : obj
axiom TomPlate : obj
axiom Istanbul : obj → Prop
axiom BeginsWith34 : obj → Prop
axiom BeginsWith35 : obj → Prop

axiom Premise1 : ∀ p : obj, Istanbul p → BeginsWith34 p
axiom Premise3 : Istanbul JoePlate
axiom Premise4 : BeginsWith35 TomPlate
axiom Premise5 : ∀ p : obj, BeginsWith35 p → ¬BeginsWith34 p

-- Proving the original statement is true:
theorem joe_has_34 : BeginsWith34 JoePlate := Premise1 JoePlate Premise3

-- Attempting to prove the negation (¬BeginsWith34 JoePlate) fails:
-- 1. Assume ¬BeginsWith34 JoePlate
-- 2. From contrapositive of Premise1: ¬BeginsWith34 JoePlate → ¬Istanbul JoePlate
-- 3. This yields ¬Istanbul JoePlate, contradicting Premise3
-- But this contradiction only proves BeginsWith34 JoePlate (via proof by contradiction),
-- not the negation of the statement. There is no derivation of ¬BeginsWith34 JoePlate.
