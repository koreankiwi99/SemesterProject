The premises lead to a contradiction, proving `False`. Specifically:
- `WorksOnCampus Hannah` (from axiom T7)
- `NeedsMoney Hannah` (from A1 and `WorksOnCampus Hannah`)
- However, T7 implies that if `NeedsMoney Hannah` holds, then `¬NeedsMoney Hannah` must also hold (via the implication `NeedsMoney Hannah → ¬PickyEater Hannah ∧ ¬NeedsMoney Hannah`), creating a contradiction.

Since `False` is derived, any conclusion (including the negation of the given statement) can be proven.
