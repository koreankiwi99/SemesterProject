The goal is to prove that the statement "Dried Thai chilies are not products of Baked by Melissa" is false, which means proving that Dried Thai chilies are products of Baked by Melissa. However, the premises lead to a contradiction when assuming Dried Thai chilies are products of Baked by Melissa, as shown in the Lean proof. Specifically, assuming `FromBakedByMelissa DriedThaiChilies` leads to a chain of deductions that contradict the disjunction in axiom T5. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that Dried Thai chilies are products of Baked by Melissa, and the original statement holds true under the given premises.

-- Since prove_negation shows that assuming FromBakedByMelissa DriedThaiChilies leads to contradiction,
-- it is impossible to prove FromBakedByMelissa DriedThaiChilies (the negation of the statement).
-- Therefore, we cannot prove the statement false.
