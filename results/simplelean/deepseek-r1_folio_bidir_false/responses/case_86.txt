The goal is to prove that the statement "Sir Digby’s nemesis does not win" is false, which means proving that Sir Digby’s nemesis wins. However, the axioms lead to the conclusion that Sir Digby wins (since he is a good guy in a superhero movie), and by the fight outcome axiom, if Sir Digby wins, his opponent (the nemesis) cannot win. This creates a contradiction when assuming the nemesis wins, but it does not provide a direct proof that the nemesis wins. Instead, it proves that the nemesis cannot win. Therefore, it is impossible to prove that the nemesis wins from the given premises.

axiom Movie : Type
axiom Character : Type
axiom digby_movie : Movie
axiom digby : Character
axiom nemesis : Character

axiom IsSuperheroMovie : Movie → Prop
axiom IsGoodGuy : Movie → Character → Prop
axiom IsBadGuy : Movie → Character → Prop
axiom NamedAfter : Movie → Character → Prop
axiom InMovie : Movie → Character → Prop
axiom Fights : Movie → Character → Character → Prop
axiom Wins : Movie → Character → Prop

axiom T1 : NamedAfter digby_movie digby
axiom T2 : IsSuperheroMovie digby_movie
axiom T3 : Fights digby_movie digby nemesis

axiom A1 : ∀ (m : Movie), IsSuperheroMovie m → ∀ (c : Character), IsGoodGuy m c → Wins m c
axiom A2 : ∀ (m : Movie) (c : Character), NamedAfter m c → IsGoodGuy m c
axiom A3 : ∀ (m : Movie) (c1 c2 : Character), Fights m c1 c2 → Wins m c1 → ¬ Wins m c2
axiom A4 : ∀ (m : Movie) (c : Character), NamedAfter m c → InMovie m c
axiom A5 : ∀ (m : Movie) (c1 c2 : Character), IsSuperheroMovie m → Fights m c1 c2 → 
           (IsGoodGuy m c1 → IsBadGuy m c2) ∧ (IsBadGuy m c1 → IsGoodGuy m c2)

theorem prove_nemesis_wins : Wins digby_movie nemesis := by
  have digby_good : IsGoodGuy digby_movie digby := A2 digby_movie digby T1
  have digby_wins : Wins digby_movie digby := A1 digby_movie T2 digby digby_good
  have nemesis_bad : IsBadGuy digby_movie nemesis := (A5 digby_movie digby nemesis T2 T3).left digby_good
  -- No axiom states that bad guys win; A1 only ensures good guys win.
  -- Attempting to use digby_wins with A3 proves nemesis cannot win, not that nemesis wins.
  -- Thus, cannot prove Wins digby_movie nemesis.
