The statement "A smarter person has gained knowledge" is interpreted as: There exists a person who is smarter and has gained knowledge. The premises provide Harry as an example: he read a book, gained knowledge, and became smarter. Thus, we can prove the statement true. However, the task requires attempting to prove the negation (that no smarter person has gained knowledge). Since Harry is a counterexample, the negation cannot be proven.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Book : Type
axiom Walden : Book
axiom Harry : Person
axiom reads : Person → Book → Prop
axiom gains_knowledge : Person → Prop
axiom smarter : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), reads p b → gains_knowledge p
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person), gains_knowledge p → smarter p
axiom A3 : reads Harry Walden

-- Attempt to prove the negation: No smarter person has gained knowledge (∀ p, smarter p → ¬ gains_knowledge p)
theorem prove_negation : ∀ p, smarter p → ¬ gains_knowledge p :=
  fun p smart_p =>   -- Assume p is smarter
  -- For Harry specifically: he is smarter and has gained knowledge
  have h_gain_Harry : gains_knowledge Harry := A1 Harry Walden A3
  have h_smart_Harry : smarter Harry := A2 Harry h_gain_Harry
  -- If p is Harry, we have a contradiction: smarter Harry but ¬ gains_knowledge Harry fails
  -- Without knowing p ≠ Harry or other smarter persons without knowledge, proof fails
  -- General case: No axioms allow deducing ¬gains_knowledge from smarter for arbitrary p
  -- Proof cannot be completed
  sorry  -- Proof attempt fails

-- Alternatively, note we can prove the original statement:
example : ∃ p, smarter p ∧ gains_knowledge p := 
  ⟨Harry, A2 Harry (A1 Harry Walden A3), A1 Harry Walden A3⟩
