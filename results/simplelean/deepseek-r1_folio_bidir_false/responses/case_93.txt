After analyzing the context and the statement, I attempted to prove that "Tom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy" is false. The key points are:

1. **Olive Garden is a managed building** with rent $2000.
2. **Security deposit ≥ rent** at managed buildings, so Olive Garden's deposit ≥ $2000.
3. **$2000 > $1500**, so Olive Garden's deposit > $1500.
4. Tom will rent **only if** allowed with Fluffy **and** deposit ≤ $1500 (but deposit > $1500 here).
5. **Rule 10**: If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with pets.

However:
- We know pets are allowed in **some** managed buildings, but **not necessarily** at Olive Garden.
- Rule 10 only states a **sufficient condition** (if pets allowed → then move-in allowed). It does **not** state a necessary condition or what happens if pets are **not** allowed.
- There is **no axiom** indicating Olive Garden forbids pets or that move-in is prohibited without pet allowance.
- Tom's renting condition (deposit ≤ $1500) fails at Olive Garden, but this **does not affect move-in allowance**—only his decision to rent.

Thus, we **cannot prove** that Tom is **not** allowed to move in, as we lack information about pet policy at Olive Garden. The negation of the statement cannot be proven.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

After analyzing the context, I attempted to prove that "Tom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy" is false. The key points are:

1. **Olive Garden is a managed building** with rent $2000
2. **Security deposit ≥ rent** at managed buildings, so Olive Garden's deposit ≥ $2000
3. **$2000 > $1500**, so Olive Garden's deposit > $1500
4. Tom will rent only if allowed with Fluffy AND deposit ≤ $1500 (which fails here)
5. **Rule 10**: If a building allows pets → then move-in is allowed

However:
- We know pets are allowed in SOME managed buildings, but NOT necessarily at Olive Garden
- Rule 10 only states a SUFFICIENT condition (if pets allowed → move-in allowed)
- There is NO axiom stating that move-in requires pet allowance or that high deposits block move-in
- Tom's renting condition fails due to high deposit, but this doesn't affect move-in allowance

Thus, we CANNOT prove that Tom is NOT allowed to move in with Fluffy, as we lack information about Olive Garden's pet policy.
