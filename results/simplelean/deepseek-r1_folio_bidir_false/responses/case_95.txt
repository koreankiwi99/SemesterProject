The goal is to prove the negation of the statement "The Harvard Weekly Book Club has legal obligations" from the given premises. After formalizing the context in Lean, we attempt to prove `¬HasLegalObligations HarvardWeeklyBookClub`. However, the axioms do not provide sufficient information to establish that Harvard Weekly Book Club is not a legal entity. Specifically:
- While legal entities must be created under law (Axiom T4), we lack information about whether Harvard Weekly Book Club was created under law.
- The conditional axiom (T6) about Harvard Weekly Book Club only relates its creation status to not being a private company, but does not preclude it from being a non-private company or other type of legal entity.
- Without evidence that Harvard Weekly Book Club fails to satisfy any necessary conditions for being a legal entity, we cannot prove it lacks legal obligations.

Thus, the negation cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom HarvardWeeklyBookClub : obj
axiom BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop
axiom Company : obj → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : obj → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : obj → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
axiom T2 : ∀ x, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
axiom T3 : ∀ x, PrivateCompany x → Company x
axiom T4 : ∀ x, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
axiom T5 : ∀ x, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
axiom T6 : CreatedUnderLaw HarvardWeeklyBookClub → ¬ PrivateCompany HarvardWeeklyBookClub

-- Attempt to prove ¬HasLegalObligations HarvardWeeklyBookClub fails
-- No axioms provide evidence that HarvardWeeklyBookClub is not a LegalEntity
