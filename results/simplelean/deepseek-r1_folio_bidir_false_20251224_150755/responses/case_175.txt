The context provides the following information:
- The summer Olympic games is a sporting event
- The last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo
- The United States won the most medals in Tokyo

The statement to evaluate is: "The world championships is a sporting event." 

Since the context does not mention the world championships at all, there's no direct link between the summer Olympic games and the world championships. The premises establish facts about the summer Olympic games but do not allow us to infer anything about the world championships. 

To prove the negation of the statement ("The world championships is not a sporting event"), we would need premises that either:
- Explicitly state that the world championships is not a sporting event
- Establish that only specific events are sporting events (and world championships isn't included)
- Provide some exclusivity rule

None of these exist in the context. Without any information about the world championships, it's impossible to prove it isn't a sporting event.
