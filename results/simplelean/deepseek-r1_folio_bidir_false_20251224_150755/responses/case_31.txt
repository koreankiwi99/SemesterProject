The premises establish that Djokovic must live in a tax haven. Djokovic is at the mixer, so by the first premise, he is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor. 

- **Grand Slam path**: If he is a Grand Slam champion (GS), then by the second premise, he is a tennis player. The fourth premise makes him an athlete, and the sixth makes him famous. As a famous athlete, R8 implies he is well-paid. The seventh premise then forces him to live in a tax haven.  
- **Oscar path**: If he is an Oscar-nominated actor, the third premise makes him a celebrity. The fifth premise makes him well-paid, and the seventh premise again requires him to live in a tax haven.  

In both cases, the conclusion "Djokovic lives in a tax haven" holds. Thus, the negation (¬TaxHaven djokovic) cannot be proven from the premises. The Lean code declares the axioms but cannot construct a proof of the negation.

axiom GS : obj → Prop
axiom Oscar : obj → Prop
axiom Tennis : obj → Prop
axiom Celebrity : obj → Prop
axiom Athlete : obj → Prop
axiom Famous : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x, AtMixer x → GS x ∨ Oscar x
axiom P2 : ∀ x, AtMixer x → GS x → Tennis x
axiom P3 : ∀ x, AtMixer x → Oscar x → Celebrity x
axiom P4 : ∀ x, AtMixer x → Tennis x → Athlete x
axiom P5 : ∀ x, AtMixer x → Celebrity x → WellPaid x
axiom P6 : ∀ x, AtMixer x → Athlete x → Famous x
axiom P7 : ∀ x, AtMixer x → WellPaid x → TaxHaven x
axiom P8 : AtMixer djokovic
axiom R8 : Famous djokovic ∧ Athlete djokovic → WellPaid djokovic

-- No proof exists for ¬TaxHaven djokovic given the premises
