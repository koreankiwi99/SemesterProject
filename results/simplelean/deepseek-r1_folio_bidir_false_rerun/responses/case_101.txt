ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The errors occurred because the `fail` tactic was used in the second disjunct, which is not a valid way to handle an unprovable case. The proof correctly handles the first disjunct but cannot derive a contradiction in the second disjunct because:
1. The premises do not require that spending time with siblings implies being born in a multiple birth
2. The second disjunct (¬BornMultiple Luke ∧ ¬LiveWithStrangers Luke) is consistent with SpendTimeWithSiblings Luke given the premises

Here is the corrected Lean code:

ANSWER: Failure

Explanation:
- The proof fails in the second disjunct because:
   • Premise1 only states that born multiple → spend time, not the converse
   • There are no premises connecting spending time to being born multiple
   • The context allows Luke to spend time with siblings without being born in a multiple birth
- Since we cannot derive a contradiction when assuming Luke spends time with siblings, the negation cannot be proven

======================================================================
ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The error occurred due to an attempt to use dummy proofs in lieu of a valid contradiction. After reevaluating the premises, the following analysis applies:

1. **Premise relationships form a partial chain**:
   - Spending time with siblings → Live at home (Premise5)
   - Live at home → Not living with strangers (Premise4)
   - Born multiple → Spend time with siblings (Premise1)

2. **Luke's disjunction creates two cases**:
   - Case 1 (Born multiple and lives with strangers): Immediately contradicts Premise4 + Premise5 chain
   - Case 2 (Not born multiple and not living with strangers): Accepts SpendTimeWithSiblings without contradiction since:
     * Premise1 is not bidirectional
     * No premises force being born multiple if spending time with siblings
     * No premise connects spending time to birth multiplicity

The corrected Lean code reflects this analysis:

axiom LukeDisjunction : 
    (BornMultiple Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) ∨ 
    (¬ BornMultiple Luke ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke)

-- Cannot prove ¬SpendTimeWithSiblings Luke due to consistent case:
-- When Luke is not born multiple but still spends time with siblings,
-- this doesn't violate any premise. Premise1 only gives BornMultiple → 
-- SpendTime, not the converse, leaving a valid scenario where the 
-- statement could hold in the second disjunct.
