The context does not provide sufficient information to prove that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often. The relevant axioms establish that Bonnie must be in one of two mutually exclusive states:

1. State A: Attends and engaged with school events and is a student at the school.
2. State B: Does not attend/engage with school events and is not a student at the school.

- **In State A**: Bonnie cannot be inactive/disinterested (as that would imply she is not a student, contradicting State A). Therefore, she must perform.
- **In State B**: Bonnie cannot perform (as that would require her to attend/engage, contradicting State B). Therefore, she must be inactive/disinterested.

Since the premises specify that Bonnie is in exactly one state but do not indicate which state applies, we cannot determine whether she performs. Premise 5 about young children/teenagers is not usable, as Bonnie's age and academic wishes are unspecified.

The Lean proof fails because Bonnie's state is indeterminate. In the second case, we derive `¬Performs Bonnie`, making `Performs Bonnie` unprovable.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to the use of `variable` declarations without properly scoping them, leading to parser issues. The corrected approach uses `axiom` for all declarations to ensure clarity and avoid scoping problems. Additionally, the theorem name `BonniePerforms?` contained an invalid character (`?`), which was removed.

The logical analysis shows:
- Bonnie must be in one of two mutually exclusive states based on the premises.
- In State 1 (attends/engaged and student), Bonnie must perform (proof by contradiction: inactivity would imply she's not a student).
- In State 2 (not attends/engaged and not student), Bonnie cannot perform (proof by contradiction: performing would require her to be attends/engaged).
- Since Bonnie's specific state is unknown, we cannot definitively prove she performs.

The proof fails in the second case because Bonnie's inactive state is consistent with the premises when she is neither attends/engaged nor a student. Since we cannot determine Bonnie's state, the statement "Bonnie performs in school talent shows often" is unprovable.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the proof contained unclosed goals in the second branch. After correcting the `BonnieState` axiom to accurately reflect the logical disjunction derived from the context ("Student Bonnie ∨ ¬AttendsEngaged Bonnie"), the proof attempt still fails in the case where Bonnie is not attending school events. In this case, Bonnie cannot perform (as performing would require attendance, leading to contradiction), and the inactive state is consistent with the premises. Since Bonnie's specific state is indeterminate, the statement "Bonnie performs in school talent shows often" cannot be proven.
