The reasoning problem involves determining if the statement "Luke complains often about annoying siblings" can be proven true based on the given premises. The premises establish relationships between several conditions: being born in a multiple birth, having siblings born together, complaining about siblings, spending time with siblings, living at home, and living with strangers. Luke's situation is specified as a disjunction: either (1) he was born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers, or (2) he was not born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.

Attempting to prove that Luke complains about annoying siblings:
1. Assume `ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke`.  
   - Premise 3: Complaining implies having siblings born together.  
   ∴ `HasSiblingBornTogether Luke`.  
2. Premise 2: Having siblings born together implies being born in a multiple birth.  
   ∴ `MultipleBirth Luke`.  
3. Premise 1: Being born in a multiple birth implies spending time with siblings.  
   ∴ `SpendTimeWithSiblings Luke`.  
4. Premise 5: Spending time with siblings implies living at home.  
   ∴ `LiveAtHome Luke`.  
5. Premise 4: Living at home implies not living with strangers.  
   ∴ `¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke`.  

Luke's disjunction now requires:  
- Since `MultipleBirth Luke` holds (step 2), the disjunction forces `LiveWithStrangers Luke` (case 1).  
- However, step 5 proves `¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke`, a **contradiction**.  

This contradiction shows the assumption `ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke` is inconsistent with the premises. Thus, the statement cannot be true, and it cannot be proven from the axioms.
