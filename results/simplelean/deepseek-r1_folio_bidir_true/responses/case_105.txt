The context explicitly states that the GRE test costs $205 and that this amount is cheaper than $300. Therefore, the statement "It costs below US $300 to take the GRE test" directly follows from this information. The other details about Tom and financial aid are irrelevant to this cost fact.

<lean>
constant gre_cost : Nat
axiom cost_gre : gre_cost = 205
theorem gre_below_300 : gre_cost < 300 := by
  rw [cost_gre]
  exact by decide
</lean>

ANSWER: True

The compilation errors occurred because `constant` was used instead of `axiom` for declaring `gre_cost`, and the `exact by decide` syntax was incorrect. The corrected code uses `axiom` for both declarations and simplifies the proof by using `decide` directly after rewriting.

<lean>
axiom gre_cost : Nat
axiom cost_gre : gre_cost = 205
theorem gre_below_300 : gre_cost < 300 := by
  rw [cost_gre]
  decide
</lean>

ANSWER: True
