The statement "No one taking the GRE test has financial aid provided to them by something" is a universal claim that requires proving for all individuals taking the GRE test, they do not receive financial aid. The context provides information about Tom, who is an applicant meeting the conditions for financial aid (living in a single-parent family and having few resources), but does not explicitly state that Tom takes the GRE test. While Tom has financial aid (as established by the axioms), the lack of a connection between being an applicant and taking the test means we cannot confirm Tom is a test-taker. Thus, we cannot prove the universal claim about all test-takers.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Tom : obj
axiom Takes_GRE : obj → Prop
axiom Applicant : obj → Prop
axiom EconomicHardship : obj → Prop
axiom FinancialAid : obj → Prop
axiom SingleParentFamily : obj → Prop
axiom FewResources : obj → Prop

axiom applicant_financial_aid : ∀ x : obj, Applicant x → EconomicHardship x → FinancialAid x
axiom hardship_conditions : ∀ x : obj, SingleParentFamily x ∨ FewResources x → EconomicHardship x
axiom tom_applicant : Applicant Tom
axiom tom_single_parent : SingleParentFamily Tom
axiom tom_few_resources : FewResources Tom

-- We can prove Tom has financial aid
theorem tom_has_aid : FinancialAid Tom := by
  apply applicant_financial_aid Tom tom_applicant
  apply hardship_conditions Tom
  left
  exact tom_single_parent

-- But we cannot prove Tom takes the GRE test (Takes_GRE Tom is missing)
-- The statement to prove: ∀ x, Takes_GRE x → ¬ FinancialAid x
-- This cannot be proven from the axioms
