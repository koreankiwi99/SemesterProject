The reasoning involves analyzing the given premises and Peter's disjunctive condition to determine if "Peter is notably tidy" can be proven. The key steps are:

1. **Premise Analysis**:
   - If someone spills a lot of food, they are not notably tidy (∀x, SpillsLot x → ¬NotablyTidy x).
   - If someone is cleanly, they are notably tidy (∀x, Cleanly x → NotablyTidy x).
   - Peter is either (spills a lot and cleanly) or (does not spill a lot and not cleanly).

2. **Case 1 (Spills a lot and cleanly)**:
   - Leads to contradiction: SpillsLot Peter implies ¬NotablyTidy Peter, but Cleanly Peter implies NotablyTidy Peter.

3. **Case 2 (Does not spill a lot and not cleanly)**:
   - No contradiction, but no premise directly proves NotablyTidy Peter from ¬SpillsLot Peter or ¬Cleanly Peter.
   - Other premises (about clumsy foodies, valuing order, family priorities) cannot connect to Peter without additional information about him.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Case 1 is impossible, so Case 2 must hold (¬SpillsLot Peter ∧ ¬Cleanly Peter).
   - However, NotablyTidy Peter cannot be proven from ¬Cleanly Peter or other axioms, as there is no rule that notably tidy must derive from these conditions.

Thus, "Peter is notably tidy" cannot be proven from the premises.
