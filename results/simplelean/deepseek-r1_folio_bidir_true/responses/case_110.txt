The premises state that all fir trees are evergreens and that there exists at least one object of worship that is a fir tree. This implies there is an object of worship that is an evergreen. However, the conclusion claims there exists an evergreen that is not an object of worship. The premises do not provide information about evergreens that are not fir trees or establish that there must be evergreens outside the set of objects of worship. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom FirTree : obj → Prop
axiom Evergreen : obj → Prop
axiom ObjectOfWorship : obj → Prop

axiom all_fir_are_evergreen : ∀ x, FirTree x → Evergreen x
axiom some_worship_are_fir : ∃ x, ObjectOfWorship x ∧ FirTree x

-- Attempt to prove: ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ ObjectOfWorship x
example : ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ ObjectOfWorship x := by
  -- We have some object `a` that is both ObjectOfWorship and FirTree
  cases some_worship_are_fir with | intro a h =>
    have h_worship : ObjectOfWorship a := h.left
    have h_fir : FirTree a := h.right
    have h_evergreen : Evergreen a := all_fir_are_evergreen a h_fir
    -- At this point, we know `a` is Evergreen and ObjectOfWorship
    -- But we need an evergreen that is NOT worshipped
    -- We have no information about other evergreens or non-fir evergreens
    -- Cannot produce such an object from the axioms
    admit  -- Proof fails
