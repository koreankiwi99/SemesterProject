The premises state that the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico or Texas, Juan de Onate visited them, and the Harding Pegmatite Mine (located there) was donated. However, there are no mountain ranges in Texas with donated mines. If the Picuris Mountains were in Texas, this would contradict the last premise because the mine is donated. Thus, the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico. While Juan visited this mountain range, there is no information about him visiting any mountain range in Texas. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven.

The error occurred because the `fail` tactic was used in the proof attempt when the Picuris Mountains were determined to be in New Mexico. This is not a valid way to handle unprovable cases in Lean. Instead, we must recognize that the premises do not provide sufficient information to prove that Juan de Onate visited a mountain range in Texas.

Revised Lean approach:
1. Prove that the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas (using the donated mine premise).
2. Establish that they must be in New Mexico.
3. Acknowledge that there is no information about Juan visiting any other mountain ranges, especially in Texas.

Since the goal (Juan visiting a Texas mountain range) remains unprovable, we conclude with Failure.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was used without having the necessary contradictory hypotheses in the local context. The helper theorem `in_new_mexico` attempted to derive a contradiction using the `contradiction` tactic, but this tactic only looks for contradictions within the local context, and the required negation (`¬ Texas PicurisMountains`) was not present locally.

After analysis, the reasoning is:
1. The premises imply the Picuris Mountains cannot be in Texas (due to the donated mine contradicting P6)
2. Therefore, the Picuris Mountains must be in New Mexico
3. Juan visited the Picuris Mountains, but they are not in Texas
4. There is no information about Juan visiting any other mountain ranges in Texas

The goal (Juan visited a mountain range in Texas) cannot be proven from the premises.

Here is the corrected Lean code:
