The statement "Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class" translates to the existence of a man in Michael's class who is taller than Peter. However, the premises lead to the opposite conclusion:

1. Peter is taller than Michael (given).
2. Michael is taller than every other man in his class (given).
3. By transitivity of "taller", Peter is taller than every man in Michael's class (since Peter > Michael > any other class member).
4. Michael himself is not taller than Peter (as Peter > Michael).

Thus, no man in Michael's class (including Michael) is taller than Peter. The blocking and shooter premises are irrelevant to height comparisons. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given premises.

-- Prove: ∃ y, InClass y ∧ Man y ∧ Taller y Peter
-- Attempt:
--   Let y be any candidate in Michael's class.
--   Case 1: y = Michael → Taller y Peter? But peter_taller_michael gives Taller Peter Michael, so Michael is not taller than Peter.
--   Case 2: y ≠ Michael → Taller Michael y (by michael_tallest). Then:
--        Taller Peter Michael (peter_taller_michael) and Taller Michael y → Taller Peter y (by taller_trans).
--        Thus, y is shorter than Peter, not taller.
--   No such y exists. The shooter axioms are irrelevant to height comparisons.
-- Therefore, the statement is unprovable.
