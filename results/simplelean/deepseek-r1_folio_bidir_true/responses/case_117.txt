The context provides information about locations and a transitivity rule for "located in," but does not establish any connection between Barutin Cove's naming and islands in Antarctica. Specifically:
- Barutin Cove is named after Barutin (a settlement), not islands.
- No axioms link the naming of Barutin Cove to islands in Antarctica.
- Antarctica's location in South Shetland Islands does not imply that islands within it share naming properties with Barutin Cove.
- The universal statement requires proof for every island in Antarctica, which cannot be derived from given premises.

axiom BarutinCove : Place
axiom BarutinSettlement : Place
axiom SnowIsland : Place
axiom SouthShetland : Place
axiom Antarctica : Place
axiom LocatedIn : Place → Place → Prop
axiom NamedAfter : Place → Place → Prop
axiom Island : Place → Prop

axiom named_after : NamedAfter BarutinCove BarutinSettlement
axiom on_coast : LocatedIn BarutinCove SnowIsland
axiom snow_in_shetland : LocatedIn SnowIsland SouthShetland
axiom antarctica_in_shetland : LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetland
axiom transitivity : ∀ (A B C : Place), LocatedIn A B → LocatedIn B C → LocatedIn A C

-- Statement: ∀ (I : Place), Island I → LocatedIn I Antarctica → NamedAfter BarutinCove I
-- Cannot prove from given axioms
