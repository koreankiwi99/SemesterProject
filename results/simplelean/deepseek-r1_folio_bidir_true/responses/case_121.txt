The context provides several premises about cars and their properties, but does not directly state any information about John's car that would force it to be a Tesla Model 3. The premises describe general rules about Tesla Model 3s, Solo EVs, and their relationships to passenger capacity and seating. However, the last premise ("If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car") is logically equivalent to "If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a single-seat electric car" (after resolving the ambiguous "or"). This still does not provide sufficient information to conclude that John's car must be a Tesla Model 3, as there could be other car types not mentioned in the premises.

Lean formalization:
<lean>
axiom Car : Type
axiom johns_car : Car
axiom TransportMultiple : Car → Prop
axiom OneSeater : Car → Prop
axiom TeslaModel3 : Car → Prop
axiom SingleSeatElectricCar : Car → Prop
axiom SoloEV : Car → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x : Car, TransportMultiple x → ¬ OneSeater x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : Car, TeslaModel3 x → TransportMultiple x
axiom P3 : ∀ x : Car, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x
axiom P4 : ∀ x : Car, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x
axiom P5 : ¬ TeslaModel3 johns_car → ¬ SingleSeatElectricCar johns_car

-- No proof found for "TeslaModel3 johns_car"
