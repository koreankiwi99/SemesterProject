The premises do not provide sufficient information to conclude that John's car is a Solo EV. While the axioms establish relationships between vehicle types (e.g., Solo EVs are single-seat electric cars, which are one-seaters, and Tesla Model 3s transport multiple passengers and are not one-seaters), there is no information about John's car beyond the tautological axiom 5. This axiom is logically true but does not constrain John's car to be a Solo EV. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given context.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom JohnsCar : obj
axiom TransportMultiple : obj → Prop
axiom OneSeater : obj → Prop
axiom TeslaModel3 : obj → Prop
axiom SingleSeatElectricCar : obj → Prop
axiom SoloEV : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, TransportMultiple x → ¬ OneSeater x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, TeslaModel3 x → TransportMultiple x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x
axiom A5 : ¬ TeslaModel3 JohnsCar → (¬ TeslaModel3 JohnsCar ∨ ¬ SingleSeatElectricCar JohnsCar)

-- No axioms force JohnsCar to be a SoloEV
theorem johns_car_solo_ev : SoloEV JohnsCar := by
  sorry -- No proof possible

ANSWER: Failure
