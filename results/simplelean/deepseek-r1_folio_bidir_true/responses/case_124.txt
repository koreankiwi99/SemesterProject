-- All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.
axiom A1 : ∀ x, PeterPet x ∧ Mammal x → Animal x
-- All monkeys are mammals.
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Monkey x → Mammal x
-- Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds.
axiom A3 : ∀ x, PeterPet x → Monkey x ∨ Bird x
-- Peter's birds can fly.
axiom A4 : ∀ x, PeterPet x ∧ Bird x → CanFly x
-- All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
axiom A5 : ∀ x, Animal x ∧ PeterPet x → CanBreathe x
-- If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
axiom A6 : ∀ x, PeterPet x ∧ CanFly x → HasWings x
-- Rock is Peter's pet.
axiom A7 : PeterPet Rock
-- Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.
axiom A8 : CanFly Rock ∨ Bird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock

-- We attempt to prove Rock is a monkey.
theorem rock_is_monkey : Monkey Rock := by
  -- From A3, Rock is either a monkey or a bird.
  have h_rock_type := A3 Rock A7
  cases h_rock_type with
  | inl monkey_rock => 
      -- Case 1: Rock is a monkey -> trivial.
      exact monkey_rock
  | inr bird_rock => 
      -- Case 2: Rock is a bird.
      -- Then by A4, Rock can fly.
      have rock_can_fly : CanFly Rock := A4 Rock ⟨A7, bird_rock⟩
      -- By A6, Rock has wings (not relevant to conclusion).
      have rock_has_wings : HasWings Rock := A6 Rock ⟨A7, rock_can_fly⟩
      -- Now, we need to see if we can force Rock to be a monkey.
      -- From A8: Rock can fly ∨ Bird Rock ∨ ¬CanBreathe Rock
      -- Since we have Bird Rock and CanFly Rock, A8 is satisfied but doesn't help.
      -- To use breathing: if we could show Rock must breathe, we might get contradiction? 
      -- But is Rock an animal? We only know mammals are animals (A1), and birds aren't mammals.
      -- We have no axiom stating birds are animals. Thus:
      --   - We cannot prove Animal Rock (since Rock is bird, not mammal).
      --   - Hence A5 (which requires Animal) doesn't apply to prove CanBreathe Rock.
      -- Without CanBreathe Rock, the disjunction A8 remains satisfied via Bird Rock.
      -- Thus, the bird case is consistent without forcing Rock to be a monkey.
      -- We cannot derive a contradiction here.
      sorry  -- Stuck: cannot prove Monkey Rock in this branch.

-- Since the bird case leads to an unprovable state, the overall proof fails.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove Monkey Rock from the axioms.
