The statement to evaluate is "John neither has a larger family nor does he invite others to his wedding." After analyzing the premises, we find that:

1. Premises establish chains of implication:
   - Inviting others → Making wedding plans → Being engaged
   - Having a well-attended wedding → Inviting others
   - For John: Being engaged → ¬(Inviting friends ∧ Making wedding plans)
   - For John: Having a larger family → (Well-attended wedding ∨ Inviting friends)

2. The conclusion requires proving both:
   - ¬LargerFamily John
   - ¬InviteOthers John

3. However:
   - No premise forces John to lack a larger family. Axiom 4 confirms existence of someone with both, but not John specifically.
   - If John invites others, he makes wedding plans (Axiom 2) and becomes engaged (Axiom 1). Then Axiom 5 implies he doesn't invite friends, but this doesn't prevent inviting others.
   - If John has a larger family (Axiom 6), he must have a well-attended wedding or invite friends. If he invites others (leading to well-attended wedding via Axiom 3), this scenario remains consistent with all axioms.

4. Since a scenario where John has a larger family and invites others satisfies all premises without contradiction, the conclusion cannot be proven.

axiom A4 : ∃ (x : Person), WellAttendedWedding x ∧ LargerFamily x
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InviteFriends John ∧ WeddingPlans John)
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → WellAttendedWedding John ∨ InviteFriends John

-- Cannot prove ¬LargerFamily John ∧ ¬InviteOthers John
