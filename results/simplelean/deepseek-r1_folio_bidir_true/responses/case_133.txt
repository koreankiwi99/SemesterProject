The context states that some mammals have teeth, platypuses have no teeth, platypuses are mammals, and humans have teeth. The statement to evaluate is that humans are mammals. However, there is no information linking humans to mammals directly. Humans having teeth does not imply they are mammals, as mammals without teeth exist (like platypuses), and non-mammals could also have teeth. Thus, the conclusion cannot be proven from the premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom HasTeeth : obj → Prop
axiom Platypus : obj
axiom Human : obj
axiom some_mammals_have_teeth : ∃ x, Mammal x ∧ HasTeeth x
axiom platypus_no_teeth : ¬ HasTeeth Platypus
axiom platypus_mammal : Mammal Platypus
axiom human_has_teeth : HasTeeth Human

-- No axiom links Human to Mammal; cannot prove Mammal Human
</lean>
