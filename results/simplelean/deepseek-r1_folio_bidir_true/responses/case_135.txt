The context states that plungers, vacuums, and vampires all suck, and space is a vacuum. The duster is mentioned as not sucking, but it does not relate to space or vampires. There is no information suggesting that vacuums are vampires or that sucking implies being a vampire. Therefore, "Space is a vampire" cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom space : obj
axiom Plunger : obj → Prop
axiom Vacuum : obj → Prop
axiom Vampire : obj → Prop
axiom Sucks : obj → Prop
axiom HouseholdAppliance : obj → Prop
axiom duster : obj

axiom plungers_suck : ∀ x, Plunger x → Sucks x
axiom vacuums_suck : ∀ x, Vacuum x → Sucks x
axiom vampires_suck : ∀ x, Vampire x → Sucks x
axiom space_vacuum : Vacuum space
axiom duster_appliance : HouseholdAppliance duster
axiom duster_no_suck : ¬ Sucks duster

-- No axiom links vacuums to vampires or sucking to vampire identity
-- Cannot prove Vampire space from given premises
