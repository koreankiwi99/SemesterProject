The context provides information about various entities and their properties, including that a duster is a household appliance that does not suck. The statement to evaluate claims that all household appliances suck. However, the existence of the duster serves as a counterexample: it is a household appliance that does not suck. Therefore, the universal statement cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Plunger : obj
axiom Vampire : obj
axiom Space : obj
axiom Duster : obj

axiom Vacuum : obj → Prop
axiom Sucks : obj → Prop
axiom HouseholdAppliance : obj → Prop

axiom plunger_sucks : Sucks Plunger
axiom vacuums_suck : ∀ x, Vacuum x → Sucks x
axiom vampires_suck : Sucks Vampire
axiom space_vacuum : Vacuum Space
axiom duster_appliance : HouseholdAppliance Duster ∧ ¬ Sucks Duster

theorem target : ∀ x, HouseholdAppliance x → Sucks x :=
  fun x h => 
  -- Proof attempt fails: Duster is a household appliance without sucking
  -- No axioms link household appliances to sucking; counterexample exists
  sorry
