The reasoning involves evaluating whether "Hachi: A Dog's Tale" contains excessive erotic and violent content or is in the "Frozen" series. The premises establish relationships between film properties, but do not provide sufficient information to prove the disjunction for "Hachi: A Dog's Tale".

- From the disjunction in premise 7 (family-friendly animated or appropriate for all ages), both cases lead to the film being appropriate for all ages (via premises 4 and 3 if family-friendly, or directly otherwise).  
- Appropriateness for all ages implies children can watch without guidance (premise 1).  
- If the film contained excessive content, children could not watch without guidance (premise 2), contradicting the above. Thus, "Hachi" cannot have excessive content.  
- However, no premises link "Hachi" to the Frozen series. Premise 5 only states that Frozen films are family-friendly, not the converse.  

Since excessive content is disproved and Frozen series membership cannot be established, the disjunction (excessive content ∨ in Frozen series) remains unproven.

axiom CanWatchWithoutGuidance : obj → Prop
axiom ContainsExcessiveContent : obj → Prop

axiom P4 : ∀ film, FamilyFriendlyAnimated film → RatedGA film

axiom P7 : FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi

      contradiction
  -- Now the goal reduces to InFrozenSeries Hachi (since ¬ContainsExcessiveContent Hachi)
  -- But no axiom forces Hachi to be in Frozen series
  -- Attempt to prove by cases on P7 yields no evidence for Frozen series
  cases P7 with
  | inl h_ff => 
    -- FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi, but P5 only works in reverse direction
    -- Cannot derive InFrozenSeries Hachi
    sorry
  | inr _ => 
    -- AppropriateForAllAges Hachi, no connection to Frozen series
    sorry
  -- Both cases fail to prove InFrozenSeries Hachi
