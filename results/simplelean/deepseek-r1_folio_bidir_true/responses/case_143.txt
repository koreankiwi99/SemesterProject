The context provides that Heck cattle were bred back to resemble aurochs and that some bred-back animals resemble extinct animals. However, it does not explicitly state that aurochs are extinct, nor does it imply that the resemblance between Heck cattle and aurochs is with the same extinct animal mentioned in the context. Without additional premises linking aurochs directly to extinction, the conclusion cannot be proven.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Heck_cattle : obj
axiom Aurochs : obj
axiom BredBack : obj → Prop
axiom Resemble : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Extinct : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : BredBack Heck_cattle
axiom A2 : Resemble Heck_cattle Aurochs
axiom A3 : ∃ x, BredBack x ∧ ∃ y, Resemble x y ∧ Extinct y

-- No axiom states that the animal resembled by a bred-back animal must be the extinct one.
-- A2 links Heck_cattle to Aurochs, but the extinct animal in A3 could be a different entity.
-- Therefore, Extinct Aurochs cannot be deduced from the premises.
