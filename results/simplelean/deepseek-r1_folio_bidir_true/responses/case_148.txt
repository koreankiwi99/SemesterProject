The reasoning involves evaluating the statement: "It is not true that Ekaterina can register to vote in the United States and Vladimir can participate in the 2024 United States presidential election." After formalizing the premises in Lean, the analysis shows:

- Vladimir lacks Taiwanese citizenship (A5), so by A3 (everyone has US or Taiwanese citizenship), he must have US citizenship. Then A2 (US citizenship enables voter registration) implies he can register, and A1 (voter registration enables election participation) implies he can participate.
- Ekaterina either can register (A6 left case) or is a Russian official (A6 right case). If she is a Russian official, A4 (no Russian officials have Taiwanese citizenship) forces her to have US citizenship (via A3), so A2 implies she can register. Thus, Ekaterina can always register.
- Therefore, both Ekaterina can register and Vladimir can participate are true, making their conjunction true. The negation of this true conjunction is false and cannot be proven from the premises.

ANSWER: Failure

======================================================================
ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the proof incorrectly attempted to apply `h.1` as a function to `reg_ek`, but `h` is actually a function expecting a conjunction proof. After re-evaluating the premises, it becomes clear that:

1. Vladimir must have US citizenship (since he lacks Taiwanese citizenship by A5, and A3 requires one or the other). Thus, he can register (A2) and participate (A1).
2. Ekaterina either registers directly (A6 left case) or is a Russian official (A6 right case). If she's an official, she lacks Taiwanese citizenship (A4), so she must have US citizenship (A3), allowing her to register (A2). Thus, she always registers.

Therefore, both Ekaterina can register and Vladimir can participate, making their conjunction true. The goal (the negation of this conjunction) is false and unprovable from the premises.
