The reasoning establishes that all squares are shapes through the transitive property: squares are four-sided, and four-sided things are shapes. Therefore, all squares must be shapes. This is provable in Lean using the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Square : obj → Prop
axiom FourSided : obj → Prop
axiom Shape : obj → Prop
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Square x → FourSided x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, FourSided x → Shape x
theorem squares_are_shapes : ∀ x : obj, Square x → Shape x :=
  fun x h =>
    have step1 : FourSided x := A1 x h
    show Shape x from A2 x step1
</lean>

ANSWER: True
