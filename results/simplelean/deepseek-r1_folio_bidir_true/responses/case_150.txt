The context provides information about New Vessel Press and specific books it published (Neapolitan Chronicles and Palace of Flies), but it does not mention Harry Potter at all. There is no premise stating that Harry Potter was published by New Vessel Press or any universal claim that would allow inferring this conclusion from the given facts. The conclusion requires direct evidence about Harry Potter, which is absent.
