-- Attempt to prove the statement: Alkane Mixture ∧ ContainsCarbon Mixture
-- We show that Alkane Mixture is impossible, so the conjunction cannot hold
theorem target : Alkane Mixture ∧ ContainsCarbon Mixture := by
  have := not_alkane
  -- Cannot prove Alkane Mixture, so conjunction fails
  sorry

-- Since the proof requires "sorry", we conclude Failure
