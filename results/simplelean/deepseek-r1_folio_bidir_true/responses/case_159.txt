The premises lead to a contradiction due to the statement about James: he works in the lab (premise 6) but is also claimed not to work in the lab or have a part-time job (premise 7). However, the conclusion that James takes the database course can be proven independently using premises 5, 6, and 4 without relying on the contradictory premise 7.

Proof chain:
1. James works in the lab (premise 6).
2. All students working in the lab take a class with Professor David (premise 5) → James takes a class with Professor David.
3. All students taking a class with Professor David take the database course (premise 4) → James takes the database course.

Thus, the conclusion follows.

  apply T4 James  -- Takes database course if takes class with David
