The context provides information about shows, their attributes, and specific properties. The goal is to evaluate whether "Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm" follows from the premises.

### Analysis:
1. **Premises**:
   - There exists a show airing at 8 pm on Monday that gives out roses.
   - If a show gives out roses, it is an episode of The Bachelor.
   - The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people (interpreted as: every episode of The Bachelor portrays real lives).
   - All shows portraying real lives are reality TV shows.
   - Breaking Bad is a show.
   - Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

2. **Logical Flow**:
   - Let \(s_0\) be a show airing Monday at 8 pm that gives out roses (from premise 1).
   - Since \(s_0\) gives out roses, it is an episode of The Bachelor (premise 2).
   - As an episode of The Bachelor, \(s_0\) portrays real lives (premise 3).
   - Thus, \(s_0\) is a reality TV show (premise 4).
   - Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show (premise 6), so it cannot be an episode of The Bachelor (otherwise it would be reality TV by premises 3 and 4).
   - However, **no premise links airing times to Breaking Bad**. The existence of \(s_0\) airing Monday at 8 pm does not restrict other shows (like Breaking Bad) from airing at the same time. Multiple shows can air simultaneously.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - There is insufficient evidence to prove that Breaking Bad airs on Monday at 8 pm. The premises establish properties of a specific show (\(s_0\)) but provide no information about Breaking Bad's schedule.

### Lean Code:
<lean>
axiom Show : Type
axiom AirsOnMondayAt8 : Show → Prop
axiom GivesOutRoses : Show → Prop
axiom IsBachelorEpisode : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
axiom IsRealityTV : Show → Prop
axiom breakingBad : Show

axiom P1 : ∃ s, AirsOnMondayAt8 s ∧ GivesOutRoses s
axiom P2 : ∀ s, GivesOutRoses s → IsBachelorEpisode s
axiom P3 : ∀ s, IsBachelorEpisode s → PortraysRealPeople s
axiom P4 : ∀ s, PortraysRealPeople s → IsRealityTV s
axiom P5 : ¬ IsRealityTV breakingBad

-- We cannot prove that Breaking Bad airs on Monday at 8 pm
