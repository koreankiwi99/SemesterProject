The reasoning involves deriving a contradiction from the assumption that roses are given out during Breaking Bad, which proves the implication by explosion.

<lean>
axiom Show : Type
axiom breakingBad : Show
axiom AiringMonday8pm : Show → Prop
axiom GivesRoses : Show → Prop
axiom IsBachelorEpisode : Show → Prop
axiom PortraysRealPeople : Show → Prop
axiom IsRealityTV : Show → Prop

-- Context: Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses (not used in proof)
axiom exists_show : ∃ s, AiringMonday8pm s ∧ GivesRoses s

-- If a show gives out roses, it is an episode of The Bachelor
axiom roses_imply_bachelor : ∀ s, GivesRoses s → IsBachelorEpisode s

-- The Bachelor portrays real people (applies to its episodes)
axiom bachelor_portrays_real : ∀ s, IsBachelorEpisode s → PortraysRealPeople s

-- Shows portraying real people are reality TV
axiom real_implies_reality : ∀ s, PortraysRealPeople s → IsRealityTV s

-- Breaking Bad is not reality TV
axiom breakingBad_not_reality : ¬ IsRealityTV breakingBad

-- Prove: If roses are given during Breaking Bad, then it airs Monday at 8 pm
theorem conclusion : GivesRoses breakingBad → AiringMonday8pm breakingBad :=
  fun h_roses : GivesRoses breakingBad =>
    have h_bachelor : IsBachelorEpisode breakingBad := roses_imply_bachelor breakingBad h_roses
    have h_real : PortraysRealPeople breakingBad := bachelor_portrays_real breakingBad h_bachelor
    have h_reality : IsRealityTV breakingBad := real_implies_reality breakingBad h_real
    False.elim (breakingBad_not_reality h_reality) -- Contradiction proves anything
