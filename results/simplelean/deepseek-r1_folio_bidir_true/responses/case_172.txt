Based on the premises, we cannot prove that Taylor eats salads regularly. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The premises establish a chain:  
   Gym visits → Nutritional fulfillment → Health-conscious upbringing → Salad eating → Health consciousness  
   Disregarding physical well-being implies not being health conscious.

2. Taylor's situation is given as:  
   (Health-conscious upbringing AND disregards well-being) OR  
   (NOT health-conscious upbringing AND NOT disregards well-being)

3. The first case leads to contradiction:  
   Health-conscious upbringing → Salad eating → Health consciousness, but  
   Disregarding well-being → NOT health conscious.

4. Thus Taylor must be in the second case:  
   NOT health-conscious upbringing and NOT disregarding well-being.

5. Without health-conscious upbringing, we cannot prove salad eating (from the chain). No alternative path exists.
