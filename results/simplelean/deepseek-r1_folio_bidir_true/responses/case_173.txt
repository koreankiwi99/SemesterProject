      -- Attempt to prove VisitsGymDaily Taylor leads to contradiction:
      -- Assume VisitsGymDaily Taylor, then by A5: FulfillsNutrition Taylor
      -- By A3: GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor, contradicting notGrew
      -- But we cannot positively prove VisitsGymDaily Taylor here
      -- No axioms provide direct support for VisitsGymDaily Taylor
      -- Classical reasoning doesn't help since we have ¬GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor
      -- and ¬DisregardsWellBeing Taylor doesn't yield positive health consciousness
      sorry  -- Proof incomplete
