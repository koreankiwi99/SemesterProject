The premises state that all horses have hooves and no humans have hooves. To prove that some humans are horses, we would need to find an object that is both human and horse. However, if such an object existed, it would have hooves (because it's a horse) and not have hooves (because it's human), leading to a contradiction. Additionally, the premises do not provide any existential assertions about the existence of horses or humans. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Horse : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Hooves : obj → Prop

axiom all_horses_have_hooves : ∀ x, Horse x → Hooves x
axiom no_humans_have_hooves : ∀ x, Human x → ¬ Hooves x

-- Attempt to prove: ∃ x, Human x ∧ Horse x
-- Proof strategy:
-- 1. Assume there exists an object x that is both Human and Horse.
-- 2. Then by all_horses_have_hooves, x has Hooves.
-- 3. By no_humans_have_hooves, x does not have Hooves.
-- 4. This contradiction shows the assumption is false.
-- However, this proves the negation of the statement (¬∃ x, Human x ∧ Horse x), 
-- not the original existential claim. Since we cannot construct a witness satisfying 
-- Human x ∧ Horse x from the premises, the existential statement remains unprovable.
