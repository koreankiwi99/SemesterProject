The context states that Susan flies to LGA airport, meaning LGA is her arrival airport. John flies from LGA airport, meaning LGA is his departure airport. The rule states that for any flight, the departure and arrival airports cannot be the same. However, there is no information linking Susan's departure airport to LGA. Specifically:
- We know Susan arrives at LGA, but not her departure airport.
- We know John departs from LGA, but not his arrival airport.
- The rule about different airports applies only when both departure and arrival are known for the same flight, which is not the case for Susan.
- There is no axiom or premise indicating that Susan's departure must be LGA.

Therefore, we cannot prove that Susan flies from LGA airport.

axiom Person : Type
axiom Susan : Person
axiom John : Person
axiom Airport : Type
axiom LGA : Airport
axiom flies_to : Person → Airport → Prop
axiom flies_from : Person → Airport → Prop
axiom susan_to_lga : flies_to Susan LGA
axiom john_from_lga : flies_from John LGA
axiom no_same_airport : ∀ (p : Person) (a b : Airport), flies_from p a → flies_to p b → a ≠ b

-- Cannot prove `flies_from Susan LGA` from the given axioms.
-- We know Susan flies to LGA, but not her departure airport.
-- The rule `no_same_airport` requires both departure and arrival for a person, which we don't have for Susan.
-- John's flight information is unrelated to Susan.
