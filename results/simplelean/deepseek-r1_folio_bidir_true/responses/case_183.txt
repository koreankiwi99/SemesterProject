The statement does not follow from the given premises. Here's the Lean analysis:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Tom : Person
axiom Grumpy : Person → Prop
axiom MeanToAnimals : Person → Prop
axiom NiceToAnimals : Person → Prop
axiom AnimalLover : Person → Prop
axiom PetOwner : Person → Prop

-- No one nice to animals is also mean to animals
axiom A1 : ∀ p, NiceToAnimals p → ¬ MeanToAnimals p

-- Some grumpy people are mean to animals (not needed for Tom's case)
axiom A2 : ∃ p, Grumpy p ∧ MeanToAnimals p

-- All animal lovers are nice to animals
axiom A3 : ∀ p, AnimalLover p → NiceToAnimals p

-- All pet owners love animals
axiom A4 : ∀ p, PetOwner p → AnimalLover p

-- Tom is a pet owner
axiom A5 : PetOwner Tom

-- Attempt to prove: ¬(Grumpy Tom ∧ MeanToAnimals Tom) → ¬Grumpy Tom ∧ ¬AnimalLover Tom
theorem target : ¬(Grumpy Tom ∧ MeanToAnimals Tom) → ¬Grumpy Tom ∧ ¬AnimalLover Tom :=
fun h => 
  have animalLoverTom : AnimalLover Tom := A4 Tom A5
  have niceTom : NiceToAnimals Tom := A3 Tom animalLoverTom
  have notMeanTom : ¬MeanToAnimals Tom := A1 Tom niceTom
  -- We know Tom isn't mean to animals, so ¬(Grumpy Tom ∧ MeanToAnimals Tom) holds trivially
  -- But we cannot prove ¬AnimalLover Tom since we've proved AnimalLover Tom
  ⟨?_, ?_⟩  -- Stuck: cannot prove ¬Grumpy Tom or ¬AnimalLover Tom
  -- Specifically: ¬AnimalLover Tom contradicts animalLoverTom
</lean>

The proof fails because:
1. From the axioms, Tom must be an animal lover (A5 + A4)
2. Thus ¬AnimalLover Tom in the conclusion is false
3. While the premise is true (Tom isn't mean to animals), the conclusion's second conjunct fails
4. Therefore the entire implication cannot be proven

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the proof attempted to construct a conjunction `⟨¬Grumpy Tom, ¬AnimalLover Tom⟩` but couldn't provide proofs for either component. Specifically:
1. `¬AnimalLover Tom` contradicts the derived fact `AnimalLover Tom` (from Tom being a pet owner)
2. `¬Grumpy Tom` has no supporting evidence in the axioms

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Tom : Person
axiom Grumpy : Person → Prop
axiom MeanToAnimals : Person → Prop
axiom NiceToAnimals : Person → Prop
axiom AnimalLover : Person → Prop
axiom PetOwner : Person → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ p : Person, NiceToAnimals p → ¬ MeanToAnimals p
axiom A2 : ∃ p : Person, Grumpy p ∧ MeanToAnimals p
axiom A3 : ∀ p : Person, AnimalLover p → NiceToAnimals p
axiom A4 : ∀ p : Person, PetOwner p → AnimalLover p
axiom A5 : PetOwner Tom

theorem target : ¬(Grumpy Tom ∧ MeanToAnimals Tom) → ¬Grumpy Tom ∧ ¬AnimalLover Tom :=
fun h => 
  have animalLoverTom : AnimalLover Tom := A4 Tom A5
  have niceTom : NiceToAnimals Tom := A3 Tom animalLoverTom
  have notMeanTom : ¬MeanToAnimals Tom := A1 Tom niceTom
  -- Cannot prove ¬Grumpy Tom (no information about Tom's grumpiness)
  -- Cannot prove ¬AnimalLover Tom (contradicts animalLoverTom)
  ⟨sorry, sorry⟩  -- Proof fails at both conjuncts
</lean>
