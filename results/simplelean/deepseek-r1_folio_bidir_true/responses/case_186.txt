The context provides information about Dani Shapiro being an American writer, Family History being a novel written by her, and Boston being an American city. However, there is no premise linking Dani Shapiro's birthplace to Boston or any other city. The statement "If a person is born in American City, the person is American" establishes a conditional relationship but does not provide the converse (being American does not imply being born in an American city). Since no information about Dani Shapiro's birthplace is given, the conclusion "Dani Shapiro was born in Boston" cannot be proven from the premises.

axiom P2 : ∀ (p : obj) (c : obj), IsBornIn p c → IsAmericanCity c → IsAmerican p
axiom P3 : ∀ (b : obj) (p : obj), IsBook b → IsNovel b → Wrote p b → IsNovelWriter p
axiom P4 : IsAmerican DaniShapiro ∧ IsWriter DaniShapiro
axiom P5 : Wrote DaniShapiro FamilyHistory
axiom P6 : IsNovel FamilyHistory
axiom P7 : Created DaniShapiro FamilySecrets
axiom P8 : IsAmericanCity Boston

-- Additional axiom: FamilyHistory is a book (implied by context but not explicitly stated)
axiom P6b : IsBook FamilyHistory

-- Prove Dani Shapiro is a novel writer (from P3, P5, P6, P6b)
theorem novel_writer : IsNovelWriter DaniShapiro :=
  P3 FamilyHistory DaniShapiro P6b P6 P5

-- However, no premise provides DaniShapiro's birthplace
-- Attempting to prove IsBornIn DaniShapiro Boston fails due to missing information
