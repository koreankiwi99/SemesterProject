The reasoning involves determining if Yuri must be an American national based on the given premises. The key deductions are:

1. From "Yuri does not activate his leg muscles" and the contrapositive of "If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles," we infer Yuri does not leap straight into the air.
2. Using the contrapositive of "If someone can do jump shots, they leap straight into the air," Yuri cannot do jump shots.
3. Applying the contrapositive of "All professional basketball players can do jump shots," Yuri is not a professional basketball player.
4. The premise "Some professional basketball players are not American nationals" is existential and does not provide information about non-players like Yuri.
5. No premises link non-basketball players to nationality, so Yuri's American nationality cannot be proven.
