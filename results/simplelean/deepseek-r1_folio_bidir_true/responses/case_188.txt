The reasoning involves proving that Yuri is not an American professional basketball player based on the given premises. The key steps are:

1. From the premises:
   - All professional basketball players can do jump shots (T2).
   - Doing jump shots implies leaping straight into the air (T3).
   - Leaping straight into the air implies activating leg muscles (T4).
   - Yuri does not activate his leg muscles (T5).

2. By contraposition:
   - ¬ActivateLegMuscles(Yuri) → ¬LeapStraightIntoAir(Yuri) (from T4)
   - ¬LeapStraightIntoAir(Yuri) → ¬CanDoJumpShots(Yuri) (from T3)
   - ¬CanDoJumpShots(Yuri) → ¬ProfessionalBasketballPlayer(Yuri) (from T2)

3. Thus, Yuri cannot be a professional basketball player. Therefore, he cannot be an American professional basketball player (as this would require being a professional basketball player).

The Lean proof formalizes this chain of implications to show that Yuri is not a professional basketball player, which directly implies he is not an American professional basketball player.
