The reasoning involves proving the implication that if Rockie is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rockie is either cute or skittish. Given the premises, Rockie must be a rabbit (since being a squirrel leads to a contradiction with calmness), making Rockie cute. Thus, the consequent holds regardless of the antecedent, proving the entire implication true.
