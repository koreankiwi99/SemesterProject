The conclusion does not follow from the premises. Here's the analysis:

1. From "Yuri does not activate his leg muscles" and "if someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles", we conclude Yuri does not leap straight into the air (contraposition).
2. From "all professional basketball players can do jump shots" and "if someone can do jump shots, they leap straight into the air", if Yuri were a professional basketball player, he would leap (contradicting #1). Thus Yuri cannot be a professional basketball player.
3. The conclusion requires Yuri to be both a professional basketball player and American national if he doesn't leap. But since he doesn't leap (#1) and isn't a professional player (#2), the consequent is false while the antecedent is true, making the implication false.

The Lean code has been corrected to address the compilation errors. The key issue was the incorrect use of term-mode proofs and missing definitions. The code now uses tactic-mode proofs for clarity and correctness. However, the target theorem remains unproven because the consequent (Yuri being an American professional basketball player) cannot be derived from the premises.
