The premises do not allow us to conclusively prove that KiKi is terricolous. While we can derive that KiKi must jump (due to a contradiction arising from assuming otherwise), there is no connection between jumping and being terricolous. The Jane-related premises (about barking and liking animals) are unused and irrelevant to KiKi's terricolous status. Thus, the conclusion does not follow.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred because the `by_contra` tactic requires classical logic, which wasn't explicitly enabled. Additionally, the proof for `KiKi_jumps` wasn't essential for evaluating the main statement about KiKi being terricolous. After analysis:

1. The premises allow us to prove that KiKi jumps (via contradiction using P4, P6, P5, and P7)
2. However, there's no premise linking jumping to being terricolous
3. P5 only gives a one-way implication (terricolous → has legs → jumps)
4. The Jane-related premises are disconnected from KiKi's terricolous status

Thus, while KiKi must jump, we cannot prove KiKi is terricolous.

ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `by_contra` tactic requires classical logic, but the proof wasn't properly structured to use it. The corrected proof uses the law of excluded middle explicitly via `Classical.em`. While we can prove that KiKi jumps (using P4, P5, P6, and P7), there's no premise linking jumping to being terricolous. P5 only gives terricolous → has legs → jumps, not the reverse. The Jane-related premises are irrelevant to KiKi's terricolous status.
