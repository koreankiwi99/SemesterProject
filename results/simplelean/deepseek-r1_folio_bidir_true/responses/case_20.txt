The given context and premises lead to the following deductions:
- Rockie is spotted near campus and calm (premise 6).
- Any animal spotted near campus is either a rabbit or a squirrel (premise 3).
- If Rockie were a squirrel, then Rockie would be skittish (premise 5), but skittish implies not calm (premise 4), contradicting Rockie's calmness. Thus, Rockie cannot be a squirrel.
- Therefore, Rockie must be a rabbit (from the disjunction).
- All spotted rabbits are cute (premise 1), so Rockie is cute.
- Thus, Rockie is cute and calm (antecedent true).
- The consequent requires Rockie to be both skittish and a turtle. However:
  - Rockie is calm, so cannot be skittish (premise 4).
  - Rockie is a rabbit, and while turtles exist (premise 2), there's no evidence Rockie is a turtle (categories aren't mutually exclusive but no overlap indicated for Rockie).
- Hence, the consequent (skittish turtle) is false.

The implication (true → false) is false. Therefore, the statement "If Rockie is cute and calm, then Rockie is a skittish turtle" does not follow from the premises and cannot be proven.

The corrected Lean code addresses the compilation error by properly handling the projection issue and attempting to prove the theorem. However, the proof remains incomplete for the rabbit branch, as the consequent (Skittish Rockie ∧ Turtle Rockie) cannot be proven from the premises.

**Analysis:**
- The squirrel branch leads to a contradiction (calm and not-calm), so it's closed.
- In the rabbit branch:
  - `Cute Rockie` is provable via `A1`.
  - `¬ Skittish Rockie` is provable (skittish would contradict calm via `A4`).
  - The consequent requires:
    1. `Skittish Rockie`: Contradicts `¬ Skittish Rockie` (no proof possible).
    2. `Turtle Rockie`: No premise links rabbits to turtles (unprovable).
- The antecedent `(Cute Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie)` is true for Rockie, but the consequent is false, making the overall implication unprovable.
