The context provides information about Ailton Silva's associations with Braga and Náutico, but there is no mention of any connection to Fluminense. The facts state:
- Ailton Silva plays for Náutico
- Ailton Silva was loaned to Braga
- Fluminense is a football club (but no relationship to Ailton Silva is indicated)

No premises establish that Ailton Silva played for Fluminense. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given context.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom AiltonSilva : obj
axiom Braga : obj
axiom Nautico : obj
axiom Fluminense : obj
axiom PlaysFor : obj → obj → Prop
axiom T1 : PlaysFor AiltonSilva Nautico
axiom T2 : PlaysFor AiltonSilva Braga  -- From "loaned out to Braga" implying he played there
-- No axiom links AiltonSilva to Fluminense
theorem statement : PlaysFor AiltonSilva Fluminense := by sorry  -- No way to prove this
