The reasoning involves proving that Ailton Silva was loaned out to a football club. The premises state:
- Ailton Silva was loaned out to Braga.
- Braga is a football club.

Therefore, since Braga is a football club, Ailton Silva was loaned out to at least one football club (namely Braga). This is represented in Lean using an existential quantifier to capture "a football club".
