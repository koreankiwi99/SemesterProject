The reasoning involves analyzing the given premises to determine if "Marvin is an alien" can be proven. The key steps are:

1. **Premises analysis**:
   - All aliens are extraterrestrials: `∀x, Alien x → Extraterrestrial x`
   - From Mars implies alien: `∀x, FromMars x → Alien x`
   - No extraterrestrials are human: `∀x, Extraterrestrial x → ¬Human x`
   - Highly intelligent Earth beings are human: `∀x, (HighlyIntelligent x ∧ FromEarth x) → Human x`
   - Marvin is highly intelligent: `HighlyIntelligent Marvin`
   - Marvin's origin: Either (from Earth and Mars) or (neither): `(FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin) ∨ (¬FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬FromMars Marvin)`
   - Not from Earth implies extraterrestrial: `¬FromEarth Marvin → Extraterrestrial Marvin`

2. **Proof attempt**:
   - **Case 1**: Marvin is from Earth and Mars.
     - From Mars → Alien (by axiom 2), so `Alien Marvin`.
     - But also: From Earth and highly intelligent → Human (by axiom 4).
     - Alien → Extraterrestrial (by axiom 1) → ¬Human (by axiom 3).
     - Contradiction: Human and ¬Human. Thus, this case is impossible.
   - **Case 2**: Marvin is not from Earth and not from Mars.
     - Not from Earth → Extraterrestrial (by axiom 7).
     - However, no axiom states that extraterrestrials must be aliens. Being extraterrestrial does not imply alien status.
     - Cannot derive `Alien Marvin` from available premises.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Case 1 leads to contradiction and is invalid.
   - Case 2 establishes `Extraterrestrial Marvin` but not `Alien Marvin`.
   - No premises connect extraterrestrial status directly to alien status without Mars origin.
   - Thus, "Marvin is an alien" cannot be proven from the given premises.
