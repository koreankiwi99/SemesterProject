The reasoning follows from the given premises. Djokovic is at the mixer, so by the first premise, he is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor (or both). 

- If Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion:
  - He becomes a professional tennis player (by premise 2).
  - Then an athlete (by premise 4).
  - Then famous (by premise 6).
  - Since he is a famous athlete, premise 8 implies he is well paid.
  
- If Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor:
  - He becomes a celebrity (by premise 3).
  - Then well paid (by premise 5).

In both cases, Djokovic is well paid. Premise 7 then ensures he lives in a tax haven. The Lean proof formalizes this case analysis.
