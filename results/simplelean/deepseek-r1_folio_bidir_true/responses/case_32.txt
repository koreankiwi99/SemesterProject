The goal is to prove that Djokovic does not live in a tax haven (¬ LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic) from the given premises. However, the premises imply that Djokovic lives in a tax haven. Here's the reasoning:

1. Djokovic is at the mixer (A8).
2. Everyone at the mixer is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor (A1).
3. If Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion:
   - He is a professional tennis player (A2).
   - Then an athlete (A4).
   - Then famous (A6).
   - Since he's a famous athlete, he is well-paid (A9).
   - Then he lives in a tax haven (A7).
4. If Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor:
   - He is a celebrity (A3).
   - Then well-paid (A5).
   - Then he lives in a tax haven (A7).

In both cases, Djokovic lives in a tax haven. Thus, the statement "Djokovic does not live in a tax haven" cannot be proven from the premises.
