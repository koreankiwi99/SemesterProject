The context states that Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine, and Diamond Mine includes the Creed Brothers. However, there is no explicit or implicit axiom stating that leading a stable implies leading every member or subgroup within that stable. Without an axiom connecting leadership of a stable to leadership of its included entities, the conclusion cannot be proven from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom RoderickStrong : obj
axiom CreedBrothers : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj
axiom Imperium : obj

axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Feud : obj → obj → Prop

axiom T1 : Leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine
axiom T2 : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
axiom T3 : Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom T4 : Feud Imperium DiamondMine

-- No axiom links stable leadership to member leadership
example : Leads RoderickStrong CreedBrothers := by sorry -- Unprovable
