The statement "Imperium doesn't have a feud with a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile" is evaluated in the context provided. The context establishes that Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile and that Imperium has a feud with Diamond Mine. This directly contradicts the statement, as there exists a stable (Diamond Mine) that includes Ivy Nile and has a feud with Imperium. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven true from the given premises.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom DiamondMine : obj
axiom Imperium : obj
axiom IvyNile : obj
axiom CreedBrothers : obj

axiom Stable : obj → Prop
axiom Includes : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Feud : obj → obj → Prop

axiom stable_DiamondMine : Stable DiamondMine
axiom includes_Creed : Includes DiamondMine CreedBrothers
axiom includes_Ivy : Includes DiamondMine IvyNile
axiom feud_Imperium_DiamondMine : Feud Imperium DiamondMine

-- The statement: ¬∃ X, Stable X ∧ Includes X IvyNile ∧ Feud Imperium X
-- We can prove the existence of such X (DiamondMine), making the statement false
example : ∃ X, Stable X ∧ Includes X IvyNile ∧ Feud Imperium X :=
  ⟨DiamondMine, stable_DiamondMine, includes_Ivy, feud_Imperium_DiamondMine⟩

-- Attempt to prove the statement fails due to counterexample
