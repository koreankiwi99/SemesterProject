The context provides premises about designs that Max adores and their properties. The statement to evaluate is "A design by Max is a brutalist building," which is ambiguous but can be interpreted as either:
- Universal: All designs by Max are brutalist buildings.
- Existential: There exists a design by Max that is a brutalist building.

However, the premises only constrain designs that Max adores. There is no information about designs by Max that he does not adore. For designs adored by Max and designed by Max:
- They must be Kelly Wearstler style (due to a contradiction if Zaha Hadid style).
- They are evocative and dreamy, but there is no premise forcing them to be brutalist.
- Premise 6 only implies brutality if they have interesting geometries, but Kelly Wearstler styles may not have interesting geometries.

No premise asserts the existence of any design by Max. Thus, neither interpretation can be proven from the given premises.
