The reasoning context provides several premises about employees, managers, and their behaviors, but does not specify whether James is a manager or not. The key points are:

1. If James is a manager:
   - He appears at the company (by axiom ax7).
   - As a manager, he cannot work remotely (ax6).
   - If he had lunch at home, he would work remotely (ax4), contradicting ax6.
   - Therefore, he must have lunch in the building (by ax3).

2. If James is not a manager:
   - He does not appear at the company (by ax7).
   - If he had lunch in the building, he would schedule meetings (ax2) and go to the building (ax1), contradicting ¬GoToBuilding James.
   - Therefore, he cannot have lunch in the building and must have lunch at home.

The statement "James does not have lunch in the company" holds only when James is not a manager. Since the premises do not specify whether James is a manager, this statement cannot be universally proven. Therefore, the proof fails.

axiom ax5 : ∀ x, Employee x → InOtherCountry x → RemoteWork x
axiom ax6 : ∀ x, Manager x → ¬ RemoteWork x
axiom ax7 : GoToBuilding James ↔ Manager James

-- Attempt to prove ¬LunchInBuilding James fails due to case dependency on manager status
