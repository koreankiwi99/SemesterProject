The reasoning involves analyzing the premises to determine if the conclusion follows. The premises describe properties of design styles that Max adores, and the conclusion claims that any design by Max (interpreted as designs Max adores) is either evocative or dreamy.

### Lean Formalization:

axiom Design : Type
axiom Adores : Design → Prop
axiom ZahaStyle : Design → Prop
axiom KellyStyle : Design → Prop
axiom BrutalistBuilding : Design → Prop
axiom InterestingGeometries : Design → Prop
axiom Evocative : Design → Prop
axiom Dreamy : Design → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ d, ZahaStyle d ∧ Adores d → InterestingGeometries d
axiom P2 : ∀ d, BrutalistBuilding d ∧ Adores d → ¬ InterestingGeometries d
axiom P3 : ∀ d, Adores d → ZahaStyle d ∨ KellyStyle d
axiom P4 : ∀ d, KellyStyle d ∧ Adores d → Evocative d
axiom P5 : ∀ d, KellyStyle d ∧ Adores d → Dreamy d
axiom P6 : ∀ d, Adores d ∧ InterestingGeometries d → BrutalistBuilding d ∧ Evocative d

theorem conclusion : ∀ d, Adores d → Evocative d ∨ Dreamy d := by
  intro d hAdore

      contradiction

### Explanation:
- **Premises Translation**:
  - `P1`: If a design is Zaha Hadid's style and adored by Max, it has interesting geometries.
  - `P2`: No brutalist building adored by Max has interesting geometries.
  - `P3`: Every design adored by Max is either Zaha Hadid's or Kelly Wearstler's style.
  - `P4`/`P5`: Kelly Wearstler's designs adored by Max are evocative and dreamy.
  - `P6`: If a design adored by Max has interesting geometries, it is brutalist and evocative.

- **Proof Strategy**:
  - For any design `d` adored by Max (`Adores d`), by `P3`, it is either Zaha-style or Kelly-style.
  - **Kelly-style case**: Directly from `P4`, it is evocative (so `Evocative d ∨ Dreamy d` holds).
  - **Zaha-style case**: 
    - By `P1`, it has interesting geometries (`ig`).
    - By `P6`, it is brutalist and evocative.
    - But `P2` states brutalist designs adored by Max cannot have interesting geometries, contradicting `ig`.
    - This contradiction implies the Zaha-style case is impossible, leaving only the Kelly-style case.

- **Conclusion**: The proof shows that for all designs adored by Max, the Kelly-style case holds (and is evocative/dreamy). Thus, the conclusion follows.
