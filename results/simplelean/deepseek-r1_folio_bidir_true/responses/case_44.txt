The context provides several premises about tennis players at Roland Garros 2022, specifically regarding Coco Gauff. The goal is to prove that Coco Gauff is not both a player who lost to Iga Świątek and one of the most active players. However, the premises lead to the conclusion that Coco Gauff must be female (since the male case results in a contradiction), and as a female player at Roland Garros 2022, she lost to Iga Świątek. This, combined with the ranking and activity implications, means she is both. Therefore, the negation (the statement to prove) cannot be derived from the premises.

axiom R1 : ∀ x, RankedHighWTA x → MostActive x
axiom R2 : ∀ x, LostToIga x → RankedHighWTA x
axiom R3 : ∀ x, (Female x ∧ AtRG2022 x) → LostToIga x
axiom R4 : ∀ x, AtRG2022 x → Female x ∨ Male x
axiom R5 : ∀ x, (Male x ∧ AtRG2022 x) → LostToRafa x
axiom R6 : (RankedHighWTA Coco ∨ LostToRafa Coco) → ¬ (Male Coco ∧ AtRG2022 Coco)
axiom T1 : AtRG2022 Coco

-- Attempt to prove: ¬ (LostToIga Coco ∧ MostActive Coco)
-- Proof strategy:
-- 1. Show Coco must be female (male case leads to contradiction).
-- 2. As female, Coco lost to Iga (by R3) and is most active (by R2 and R1).
-- 3. Thus, the conjunction holds, so its negation is unprovable.

theorem coco_ranked_high : RankedHighWTA Coco := R2 Coco coco_lost_to_iga
theorem coco_most_active : MostActive Coco := R1 Coco coco_ranked_high

-- Thus, we have (LostToIga Coco ∧ MostActive Coco), so ¬ (LostToIga Coco ∧ MostActive Coco) is false.
-- Therefore, the goal statement cannot be proven from the premises.
