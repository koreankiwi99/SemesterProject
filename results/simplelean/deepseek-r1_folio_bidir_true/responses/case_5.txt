The given statement consists of two implications. After formalizing the premises in Lean, the goal is to prove the entire statement. However, analysis shows that the first implication fails when James is in other countries, as this forces him to work remotely (by premise 5), making the consequent false. Similarly, the second implication fails when James works remotely due to being in other countries, as the consequent falsely requires him not to be in other countries. Thus, the statement does not follow from the premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj

-- Predicates
axiom Employee : obj → Prop
axiom Manager : obj → Prop
axiom InOtherCountries : obj → Prop
axiom SchedulesMeeting : obj → Prop
axiom GoesToBuilding : obj → Prop
axiom HasLunchInBuilding : obj → Prop
axiom HasLunchAtHome : obj → Prop

-- James is an employee (required to apply employee premises)
axiom James_employee : Employee James

-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ e : obj, Employee e ∧ SchedulesMeeting e → GoesToBuilding e
axiom P2 : ∀ e : obj, HasLunchInBuilding e → SchedulesMeeting e
axiom P3 : ∀ e : obj, Employee e → (HasLunchInBuilding e ∨ HasLunchAtHome e)
axiom P4 : ∀ e : obj, Employee e → (HasLunchAtHome e → WorksRemotelyFromHome e)
axiom P5 : ∀ e : obj, Employee e → (InOtherCountries e → WorksRemotelyFromHome e)
axiom P6 : ∀ e : obj, Manager e → ¬ WorksRemotelyFromHome e
axiom P7 : AppearsToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Attempt to prove the entire statement (both implications)
theorem statement :
