ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `contradiction` tactic was used incorrectly. The context contained `¬PlaysFor RobertLewandowski BayernMunchen` while the goal was to prove `PlaysFor RobertLewandowski BayernMunchen`. These form a logical contradiction, but Lean's `contradiction` tactic requires both contradictory hypotheses to be present in the context, not one as a hypothesis and one as the goal.

The axioms establish:
1. Robert Lewandowski left Bayern Munchen (`left_team`)
2. The leaving rule states that leaving implies not playing for the team (`leaving_rule`)
3. Therefore, we can prove `¬PlaysFor RobertLewandowski BayernMunchen`

However, the statement to evaluate is `PlaysFor RobertLewandowski BayernMunchen`, which directly contradicts the provable negation. Since we cannot prove a statement that contradicts our axioms, the evaluation fails.
