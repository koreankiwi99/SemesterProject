The context provides information about several cities and states, but lacks any details about Bismarck. Specifically, St Pierre is known not to be in Montana, but its actual state is unspecified. Bismarck's state is entirely unknown. The exception for multi-state cities does not apply here since Bismarck and St Pierre are not among the listed exceptions (Bristol, Texarkana, Texhoma, Union City). Therefore, there is insufficient information to prove that St Pierre and Bismarck are in the same state.
