The context states that international students have either an F1 or J1 visa, but it does not specify Mike's visa type. While Mike is an international student (premise 3) and must apply for CPT if he wants to work (premise 4), this does not provide information about his visa type. Premise 2 links F1 visa holders to CPT or OPT requirements, but without knowing if Mike wants to work or any rules for J1 visa holders, we cannot deduce that Mike has an F1 visa. Thus, the statement "Mike has an F1 visa" cannot be proven from the premises.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Mike : obj
axiom InternationalStudent : obj → Prop
axiom F1Visa : obj → Prop
axiom J1Visa : obj → Prop
axiom WantsToWork : obj → Prop
axiom NeedsCPT : obj → Prop
axiom NeedsOPT : obj → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, InternationalStudent x → F1Visa x ∨ J1Visa x
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, InternationalStudent x → F1Visa x → (WantsToWork x → (NeedsCPT x ∨ NeedsOPT x))
axiom P3 : InternationalStudent Mike
axiom P4 : WantsToWork Mike → NeedsCPT Mike

-- Cannot prove F1Visa Mike: Mike might have J1 visa, and no information about WantsToWork or J1 requirements
