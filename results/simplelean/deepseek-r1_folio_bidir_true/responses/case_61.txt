The statement "Mike has a J1 visa" cannot be proven from the given context. Here's the formal analysis:

<lean>
axiom Student : Type
axiom Mike : Student
axiom InternationalStudent : Student → Prop
axiom F1Visa : Student → Prop
axiom J1Visa : Student → Prop
axiom WantsWork : Student → Prop
axiom NeedsCPT : Student → Prop
axiom NeedsOPT : Student → Prop

-- Premise: International students have either F1 or J1 visa
axiom visa_type : ∀ x : Student, InternationalStudent x → F1Visa x ∨ J1Visa x

-- Premise: F1 visa holders need CPT or OPT to work
axiom F1_work_requirement : ∀ x : Student, InternationalStudent x → F1Visa x → WantsWork x → NeedsCPT x ∨ NeedsOPT x

-- Premise: Mike is an international student
axiom mike_international : InternationalStudent Mike

-- Premise: Mike needs CPT if he wants to work
axiom mike_cpt : WantsWork Mike → NeedsCPT Mike

-- Attempt to prove Mike has J1 visa
theorem mike_j1 : J1Visa Mike := by
  -- We know Mike has either F1 or J1 visa
  have mike_visa := visa_type Mike mike_international
  cases mike_visa with
  | inl f1 => 
    -- If Mike has F1 visa, we need to derive contradiction or show impossibility
    -- But no information about Mike's work desire or visa-specific contradictions
    -- Axioms remain consistent whether Mike wants to work or not
    sorry
  | inr j1 => 
    -- If Mike has J1 visa, we can use this branch
    exact j1
-- Proof fails in the F1 visa case
</lean>

**Explanation of why proof fails:**
1. We know Mike has either F1 or J1 visa (`visa_type`).
2. In the J1 visa case, the proof is trivial.
3. In the F1 visa case:
   - If Mike wants to work: 
     * He must apply for CPT or OPT (`F1_work_requirement`)
     * He specifically needs CPT (`mike_cpt`)
     * These are consistent (CPT satisfies the OR requirement)
   - If Mike doesn't want to work: 
     * No work-related requirements apply
     * No contradiction arises
4. There are no premises linking J1 visas to work requirements or any other properties that could force Mike's visa type.

Since the F1 visa case remains consistently possible under all premises, we cannot prove Mike must have a J1 visa.
