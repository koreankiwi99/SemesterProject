The context provides information about Brown Swiss cattle, cows, pets, domesticated animals, and alligators. Ted is specified as an alligator. The statement to evaluate is whether Ted is a pet.

From the premises:
- All Brown Swiss cattle are cows.
- Some pets are Brown Swiss cattle (so there exists at least one pet that is a Brown Swiss cattle).
- All cows are domesticated animals.
- Alligators are not domesticated animals.
- Ted is an alligator.

There is no direct link between being an alligator and being a pet. The existence of some pets that are Brown Swiss cattle (and therefore domesticated) does not imply that all pets are domesticated, nor does it provide any connection between alligators and pets. Ted being an alligator (and therefore not domesticated) doesn't contradict the pet definition since pets aren't required to be domesticated. Thus, there's insufficient evidence to conclude that Ted is a pet.

axiom U : Type
axiom BrownSwissCattle : U → Prop
axiom Cow : U → Prop
axiom Pet : U → Prop
axiom DomesticatedAnimal : U → Prop
axiom Alligator : U → Prop
axiom Ted : U

axiom A1 : ∀ x : U, BrownSwissCattle x → Cow x
axiom A2 : ∃ x : U, Pet x ∧ BrownSwissCattle x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : U, Cow x → DomesticatedAnimal x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : U, Alligator x → ¬ DomesticatedAnimal x
axiom A5 : Alligator Ted

-- We need to prove: Pet Ted
-- There is no information linking Alligator to Pet. 
-- A2 shows existence of a pet that is BrownSwissCattle (hence domesticated), 
-- but Ted is not domesticated (by A4 and A5). However, this doesn't prevent Ted 
-- from being a pet, as pets aren't required to be domesticated. 
-- No axioms force Ted to be a pet or provide evidence for it.
