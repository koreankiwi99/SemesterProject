The statement "Ted is a pet and Brown Swiss cattle" does not follow from the given premises. Here's the reasoning:

1. Ted is an alligator (given).
2. Alligators are not domesticated animals (given).
3. If Ted were Brown Swiss cattle, then:
   - All Brown Swiss cattle are cows (premise), so Ted would be a cow.
   - All cows are domesticated animals (premise), so Ted would be domesticated.
4. But Ted cannot be domesticated (from #2), leading to a contradiction.
5. Thus, Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle, making the conjunction false.

The Lean formalization confirms this:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Ted : obj

axiom BrownSwiss : obj → Prop
axiom Cow : obj → Prop
axiom Pet : obj → Prop
axiom DomesticatedAnimal : obj → Prop
axiom Alligator : obj → Prop

axiom T1 : ∀ x, BrownSwiss x → Cow x
axiom T2 : ∃ x, Pet x ∧ BrownSwiss x
axiom T3 : ∀ x, Cow x → DomesticatedAnimal x
axiom T4 : ∀ x, Alligator x → ¬ DomesticatedAnimal x
axiom T5 : Alligator Ted

-- Proof that Ted cannot be Brown Swiss cattle
theorem not_BrownSwiss_Ted : ¬ BrownSwiss Ted :=
  fun hBS : BrownSwiss Ted =>
    have hCow : Cow Ted := T1 Ted hBS
    have hDom : DomesticatedAnimal Ted := T3 Ted hCow
    have hNotDom : ¬ DomesticatedAnimal Ted := T4 Ted T5
    hNotDom hDom

-- Attempt to prove "Pet Ted ∧ BrownSwiss Ted" fails:
-- 1. BrownSwiss Ted is false (by not_BrownSwiss_Ted)
-- 2. Thus the conjunction is unprovable
</lean>

ANSWER: Failure
