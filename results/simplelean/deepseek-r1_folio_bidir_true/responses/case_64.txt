The reasoning involves proving the conditional statement: "If Ted is a Brown Swiss cattle, then Ted is not a pet." Given the premises, if Ted were a Brown Swiss cattle, this would lead to a contradiction because Ted is an alligator, and alligators are not domesticated animals, while Brown Swiss cattle are cows and thus domesticated animals. This contradiction allows us to conclude anything, including that Ted is not a pet. Therefore, the conditional holds vacuously.
