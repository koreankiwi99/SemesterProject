The context states that Yale University is a private Ivy League research university and that it moved to New Haven. The statement to evaluate claims that "a private Ivy League research university moved to New Haven," which requires proving the existence of at least one such university with these properties. Since Yale satisfies all conditions (private, Ivy League, research university) and moved to New Haven, the statement follows.

<lean>
axiom University : Type
axiom Yale : University
axiom isPrivate : University → Prop
axiom isIvyLeague : University → Prop
axiom isResearchUniversity : University → Prop
axiom movedToNewHaven : University → Prop

axiom Yale_private : isPrivate Yale
axiom Yale_ivy : isIvyLeague Yale
axiom Yale_research : isResearchUniversity Yale
axiom Yale_moved : movedToNewHaven Yale

theorem exists_private_ivy_moved : ∃ u : University, isPrivate u ∧ isIvyLeague u ∧ isResearchUniversity u ∧ movedToNewHaven u :=
