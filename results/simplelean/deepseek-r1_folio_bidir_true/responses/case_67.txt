The context explicitly lists "Pierson College" as one of the residential colleges at Yale University. Therefore, the statement "Pierson College is a residential college at Yale" directly follows from the given information. The Lean proof establishes this by defining the necessary types and axioms, then proving the theorem using the provided axiom.

<lean>
constant ResidentialCollege : Type
constant PiersonCollege : ResidentialCollege
constant IsResidentialCollegeAtYale : ResidentialCollege → Prop
axiom pierson_listed : IsResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege
theorem pierson_at_yale : IsResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege := by
  exact pierson_listed
</lean>

After analyzing the errors, I realize the issue was with the type system setup. The key problem was that `ResidentialCollege` was defined as a type, but then `IsResidentialCollegeAtYale` was incorrectly applied. Here's the corrected approach:

1. Define `College` as a base type
2. Declare `PiersonCollege` as a constant of type `College`
3. Define the predicate `IsResidentialCollegeAtYale` on `College`
4. Use an axiom stating Pierson College satisfies this predicate
5. Prove the theorem by applying the axiom

The corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
constant College : Type
constant PiersonCollege : College
constant IsResidentialCollegeAtYale : College → Prop
axiom pierson_listed : IsResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege
theorem pierson_at_yale : IsResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege := pierson_listed
</lean>

The context explicitly lists "Pierson College" as one of Yale's residential colleges, so the statement is provable from the given information. The proof is direct application of the axiom.

After analyzing the errors, I realize the issue was with how constants were declared. In Lean 4, we need to properly separate declarations and ensure predicate applications are correctly structured. Here's the corrected approach:

1. Declare `College` as a type
2. Declare `PiersonCollege` as a specific college
3. Declare the predicate as a function from colleges to propositions
4. State the axiom directly as a proposition about PiersonCollege
5. Prove the theorem by referencing the axiom

The corrected Lean 4 code:

<lean>
axiom College : Type
axiom PiersonCollege : College
axiom IsResidentialCollegeAtYale : College → Prop
axiom pierson_listed : IsResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege
theorem pierson_at_yale : IsResidentialCollegeAtYale PiersonCollege := pierson_listed
</lean>

The context explicitly lists "Pierson College" as one of Yale's residential colleges, so the statement is directly provable from the given information. The proof simply references the established axiom.
