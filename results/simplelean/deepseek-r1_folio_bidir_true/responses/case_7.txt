axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates
axiom MonkeypoxVirus : obj → Prop
axiom GetsMonkeypox : obj → Prop
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Flu : obj → Prop
axiom Tired : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from context
axiom virus_in_some_animals : ∃ x : obj, Animal x ∧ MonkeypoxVirus x
axiom human_mammal : ∀ x : obj, Human x → Mammal x
axiom mammal_animal : ∀ x : obj, Mammal x → Animal x
axiom monkeypox_symptoms : ∀ x : obj, GetsMonkeypox x → Tired x
axiom flu_causes_tiredness : ∀ x : obj, Human x → Flu x → Tired x

-- Statement: No one gets the flu (i.e., no human has flu)
theorem no_flu : ¬∃ x : obj, Human x ∧ Flu x :=
  by
  -- We have no premises that directly or indirectly prove absence of flu.
  -- Context provides existence of Monkeypox in animals but no link to flu.
  -- Flu causes tiredness, but tiredness can occur from other sources (like Monkeypox).
  -- No contradiction or negation about flu is provided.
  -- Thus, we cannot prove the statement.
  sorry -- Proof fails

-- Since 'sorry' is used, the proof is incomplete, confirming failure.
