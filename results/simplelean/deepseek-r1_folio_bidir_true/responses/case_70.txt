The context establishes that mature stocks are a subset of stocks, and KO is explicitly stated to be a mature stock. Therefore, KO must be a stock. This is formally proven in Lean using the subset axiom for mature stocks.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom KO : obj

axiom Stock : obj → Prop
axiom GrowthStock : obj → Prop
axiom MatureStock : obj → Prop
axiom BoughtForProfit : obj → Prop
axiom SuitableForRetirement : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x, GrowthStock x → BoughtForProfit x
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Stock x → (BoughtForProfit x → ¬ SuitableForRetirement x)
axiom A3 : ∃ x, Stock x ∧ GrowthStock x
axiom A4 : ∀ x, MatureStock x → SuitableForRetirement x
axiom A5 : MatureStock KO

-- Mature stocks are a subset of stocks (implicit in natural language)
axiom MatureStock_subset : ∀ x, MatureStock x → Stock x

theorem KO_is_stock : Stock KO := by
  exact MatureStock_subset KO A5
</lean>

ANSWER: True
