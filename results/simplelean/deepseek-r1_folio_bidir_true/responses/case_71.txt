The context establishes relationships between different types of stocks and their properties. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. KO is explicitly stated as a mature stock.
2. All mature stocks are suitable for retirement funds (from context).
3. Growth stocks are bought for rapid appreciation (from context).
4. Anything bought for rapid appreciation is not suitable for retirement funds (from context).
5. Therefore, growth stocks ≠ mature stocks (they have contradictory properties).
6. KO is a mature stock but cannot be a growth stock due to the contradiction.

While we can prove KO is a stock (because mature stocks are stocks), we cannot prove KO is a growth stock as it leads to contradiction:

- If KO were a growth stock, it would be bought for rapid appreciation (A1)
- This would make it unsuitable for retirement (A2)
- But as a mature stock, KO must be suitable for retirement (A4)
- This contradiction proves KO cannot be a growth stock

Therefore, the required conjunction (KO is stock AND growth stock) is unprovable.
