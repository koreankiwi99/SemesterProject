The premises lead to a contradiction when combined with the conclusion, but the conclusion can be directly proven from the axioms without invoking the contradiction. Specifically:

1. Premise 7 states Hannah works in student jobs (`Work Hannah`).
2. Premise 1 states that anyone working student jobs needs money (`∀x, Work x → NeedMoney x`).
3. Thus, `NeedMoney Hannah` follows directly from `Work Hannah` and the universal implication.

The second part of premise 7 (`NeedMoney Hannah → (¬Picky Hannah ∧ ¬NeedMoney Hannah)`) creates a contradiction when combined with `NeedMoney Hannah`, but this doesn't invalidate the direct proof of the conclusion. Since the conclusion is derivable from the axioms, it is provable.

axiom obj : Type
axiom Hannah : obj
axiom Work : obj → Prop
axiom NeedMoney : obj → Prop
axiom OrderTakeout : obj → Prop
axiom EnjoyDining : obj → Prop
axiom Picky : obj → Prop

axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Work x → NeedMoney x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, OrderTakeout x → Work x
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, OrderTakeout x ∨ EnjoyDining x
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, EnjoyDining x → ¬ Picky x
axiom T7 : Work Hannah ∧ (NeedMoney Hannah → (¬ Picky Hannah ∧ ¬ NeedMoney Hannah))

theorem hannah_needs_money : NeedMoney Hannah :=
