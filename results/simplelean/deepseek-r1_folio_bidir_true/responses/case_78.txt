The premises do not allow us to prove that Dried Thai chilies are products of Baked by Melissa. In fact, assuming they are leads to a contradiction:

1. If Dried Thai chilies were products of Baked by Melissa, they would be cupcakes (by axiom 4).
2. Then they would be baked sweets (by axiom 2).
3. This implies they are not spicy (by axiom 1).
4. However, axiom 5 states they are either spicy, mala hotpots, or not baked sweets.
5. Since they are baked sweets (step 2), they must be either spicy or mala hotpots.
6. If spicy, contradicts step 3. If mala hotpots, they must be spicy (axiom 3), again contradicting step 3.

Thus, the assumption must be false. Since we cannot prove the statement from the premises, we return Failure.
