The reasoning context provides several premises, but does not establish that Dried Thai chilies must be a mala hotpot. The disjunction "Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets" allows scenarios where Dried Thai chilies are spicy without being mala hotpots, or where they are not baked sweets without being mala hotpots. No premises force Dried Thai chilies to be a baked sweet (which would require mala hotpot status via the disjunction) or directly link spiciness exclusively to mala hotpots. Thus, the conclusion cannot be proven.

The compilation errors occurred due to improper handling of the disjunction in the `cases` tactic and the use of `admit` without closing all goals. After analysis, it's confirmed that the statement "Dried Thai chilies are a mala hotpot" cannot be proven from the given premises. Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom DriedThaiChilies : obj
axiom BakedSweet : obj → Prop
axiom Spicy : obj → Prop
axiom Cupcake : obj → Prop
axiom MalaHotpot : obj → Prop
axiom ProductFromBakedByMelissa : obj → Prop

-- No baked sweets are spicy
axiom A1 : ∀ x, BakedSweet x → ¬ Spicy x
-- All cupcakes are baked sweets
axiom A2 : ∀ x, Cupcake x → BakedSweet x
-- All mala hotpots are spicy
axiom A3 : ∀ x, MalaHotpot x → Spicy x
-- All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes
axiom A4 : ∀ x, ProductFromBakedByMelissa x → Cupcake x
-- Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets
axiom A5 : Spicy DriedThaiChilies ∨ MalaHotpot DriedThaiChilies ∨ ¬ BakedSweet DriedThaiChilies

-- Proof that MalaHotpot DriedThaiChilies is unprovable:
-- Case 1: If spicy, A1 implies it cannot be a baked sweet, but no axiom forces it to be a mala hotpot
-- Case 2: If mala hotpot, we have the result but this isn't the only possibility
-- Case 3: If not baked sweet, no axiom links this to mala hotpots
