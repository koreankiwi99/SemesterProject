The reasoning shows that the statement about the Hamden Plaza Subway store follows from the premises. The proof leverages the disjunctive premise (Premise 5) and shows that in both cases, the store does not receive many negative reviews, which directly implies the disjunctive conclusion.

axiom Restaurant : Type
axiom S : Restaurant
axiom ListedInYelpRecs : Restaurant → Prop
axiom ManyNegativeReviews : Restaurant → Prop
axiom RatingGreaterThanFour : Restaurant → Prop
axiom ProvidesTakeOut : Restaurant → Prop
axiom PopularAmongLocals : Restaurant → Prop

axiom P1 : ∀ r : Restaurant, ListedInYelpRecs r → ¬ ManyNegativeReviews r
axiom P2 : ∀ r : Restaurant, RatingGreaterThanFour r → ListedInYelpRecs r
axiom P3 : ∃ r : Restaurant, ¬ ProvidesTakeOut r ∧ ManyNegativeReviews r
axiom P4 : ∀ r : Restaurant, PopularAmongLocals r → RatingGreaterThanFour r
axiom P5 : RatingGreaterThanFour S ∨ PopularAmongLocals S

theorem target : ProvidesTakeOut S ∨ ¬ ManyNegativeReviews S := by
