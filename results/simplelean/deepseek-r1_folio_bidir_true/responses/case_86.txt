The reasoning involves translating the given context into Lean axioms and proving the statement "Sir Digby’s nemesis does not win." The key steps are:

1. **Sir Digby is a good guy**: Since the movie is a superhero movie named after Sir Digby, by the naming axiom, he must be a good guy.
2. **Sir Digby is in the movie**: The naming axiom also implies he is in the movie.
3. **Sir Digby wins against his nemesis**: As a good guy in a superhero movie, he wins all his fights (premise: "good guys always win").
4. **Nemesis cannot win**: If Sir Digby wins the fight, his opponent (nemesis) cannot win by the winning axiom.

The Lean code formalizes these steps:

<lean>
axiom Movie : Type
axiom Character : Type
axiom digby_movie : Movie
axiom SirDigby : Character
axiom Nemesis : Character

axiom SuperheroMovie : Movie → Prop
axiom GoodGuy : Character → Prop
axiom Fights : Character → Character → Prop
axiom WinsInFight : Character → Character → Prop
axiom NamedAfter : Movie → Character → Prop
axiom InMovie : Character → Movie → Prop

axiom T1 : SuperheroMovie digby_movie
axiom T2 : Fights SirDigby Nemesis
axiom T3 : NamedAfter digby_movie SirDigby

axiom R1 : ∀ (m : Movie) (c : Character), SuperheroMovie m → NamedAfter m c → GoodGuy c
axiom R3 : ∀ (m : Movie) (c : Character), NamedAfter m c → InMovie c m
axiom R4 : ∀ (m : Movie), SuperheroMovie m → ∀ (g : Character), GoodGuy g → InMovie g m → ∀ (b : Character), Fights g b → WinsInFight g b
axiom R5 : ∀ (x y : Character), WinsInFight x y → ¬ WinsInFight y x

theorem nemesis_not_win : ¬ WinsInFight Nemesis SirDigby :=
  R5 SirDigby Nemesis (R4 digby_movie T1 SirDigby
    (R1 digby_movie SirDigby T1 T3)
    (R3 digby_movie SirDigby T3)
    Nemesis T2)
</lean>

The proof is successful, concluding that Sir Digby’s nemesis does not win.
