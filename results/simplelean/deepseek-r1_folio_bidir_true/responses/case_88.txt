The reasoning involves proving that Harry is smarter than before based on the given premises. The key steps are:
1. Books contain knowledge, so reading a book provides knowledge.
2. Harry read "Walden", so he gained knowledge from it.
3. Gaining knowledge makes a person smarter than before.

In Lean, we model:
- `Person` and `Book` as types
- `Reads` relation between person and book
- `GainsKnowledge` and `BecomesSmarter` as properties of a person
- Axioms linking reading to knowledge gain and knowledge gain to becoming smarter

The proof shows:
- Harry read "Walden" (axiom `T1`)
- By `R1`, reading causes knowledge gain: `GainsKnowledge harry`
- By `R2`, knowledge gain causes becoming smarter: `BecomesSmarter harry`

Thus, the statement is proven.

<lean>
axiom Person : Type
axiom Book : Type
axiom harry : Person
axiom walden : Book
axiom Reads : Person → Book → Prop
axiom GainsKnowledge : Person → Prop
axiom BecomesSmarter : Person → Prop
axiom R1 : ∀ (p : Person) (b : Book), Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p
axiom R2 : ∀ p : Person, GainsKnowledge p → BecomesSmarter p
axiom T1 : Reads harry walden
theorem harry_smarter : BecomesSmarter harry := R2 harry (R1 harry walden T1)

ANSWER: True
