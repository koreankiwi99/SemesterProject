The context provides specific premises about books, reading, knowledge, and intelligence. The statement "A smarter person has gained knowledge" is interpreted existentially: there exists at least one person who is smarter and has gained knowledge. Given that Harry read "Walden," he gained knowledge and became smarter, satisfying the existential claim.
