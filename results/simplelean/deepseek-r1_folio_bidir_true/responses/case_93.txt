The context does not provide explicit information that The Olive Garden allows pets. Although pets are allowed in some managed buildings, this is an existential statement that does not specify which buildings. The condition for Tom being allowed to move in with Fluffy requires that the building allows pets (via axiom R3). Without confirmation that The Olive Garden allows pets, the conclusion cannot be proven.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `rw` tactic was applied to the goal instead of the hypothesis. The corrected approach uses `have` to introduce the inequality from `R2`, then rewrites `T3` in that hypothesis to match the goal.

However, the main issue remains: we cannot prove that Tom is allowed to move into The Olive Garden with Fluffy because:
1. The context states pets are allowed in *some* managed buildings (existential), but never specifies that The Olive Garden allows pets.
2. Axiom `R3` requires `AllowsPets OliveGarden` to derive `AllowedMoveInWith Tom Fluffy OliveGarden`, which is missing.
