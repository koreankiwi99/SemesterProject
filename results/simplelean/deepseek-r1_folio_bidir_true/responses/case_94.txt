The statement "The security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more" is directly supported by the context. Specifically, the context states that for any managed building, the security deposit is either equal to the monthly rent or more. Since the Olive Garden is a managed building with a monthly rent of $2000, the security deposit must be either $2000 or more than $2000.

Here is the Lean proof:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom OliveGarden : obj
axiom ManagedBuilding : obj → Prop
axiom monthly_rent : obj → Nat
axiom security_deposit : obj → Nat

axiom managed_OliveGarden : ManagedBuilding OliveGarden
axiom rent_OliveGarden : monthly_rent OliveGarden = 2000
axiom deposit_rule : ∀ b : obj, ManagedBuilding b → 
                      security_deposit b = monthly_rent b ∨ security_deposit b > monthly_rent b

theorem security_deposit_statement : 
        security_deposit OliveGarden = 2000 ∨ security_deposit OliveGarden > 2000 := by
  apply deposit_rule OliveGarden
  exact managed_OliveGarden
</lean>

ANSWER: True

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation error occurred because the `apply` tactic was used incorrectly. The `deposit_rule` produces a disjunction involving `monthly_rent OliveGarden`, while the goal requires the disjunction to be in terms of `2000`. Since we have `monthly_rent OliveGarden = 2000`, we can rewrite this equality in the disjunction obtained from `deposit_rule`.

Here is the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom OliveGarden : obj
axiom ManagedBuilding : obj → Prop
axiom monthly_rent : obj → Nat
axiom security_deposit : obj → Nat

axiom managed_OliveGarden : ManagedBuilding OliveGarden
axiom rent_OliveGarden : monthly_rent OliveGarden = 2000
axiom deposit_rule : ∀ b : obj, ManagedBuilding b → 
                      security_deposit b = monthly_rent b ∨ security_deposit b > monthly_rent b

theorem security_deposit_statement : 
        security_deposit OliveGarden = 2000 ∨ security_deposit OliveGarden > 2000 := by
  have H := deposit_rule OliveGarden managed_OliveGarden
  rw [rent_OliveGarden] at H
  exact H
</lean>

**Explanation of corrections:**
1. Instead of `apply`, we use `have` to obtain the disjunction from `deposit_rule`
2. We rewrite `monthly_rent OliveGarden` to `2000` in the disjunction using `rw [rent_OliveGarden] at H`
3. The resulting `H` exactly matches the goal, so we `exact H`

The statement "The security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more" is successfully proven from the context.
