The reasoning text is translated into Lean code to evaluate the statement about Luke. The axioms capture the given context, and the theorem is proven by case analysis of the disjunction about Luke's birth and living situation.

<lean>
axiom obj : Type
axiom Luke : obj

axiom BornMultiple : obj → Prop
axiom HasSiblingsBornTogether : obj → Prop
axiom ComplainAnnoyingSiblings : obj → Prop
axiom LiveAtHome : obj → Prop
axiom LiveWithStrangers : obj → Prop
axiom SpendTimeWithSiblings : obj → Prop

-- If born in multiple birth, spend time with siblings
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BornMultiple x → SpendTimeWithSiblings x
-- If have siblings born together, then born in multiple birth
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, HasSiblingsBornTogether x → BornMultiple x
-- If complain about annoying siblings, then have siblings born together
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, ComplainAnnoyingSiblings x → HasSiblingsBornTogether x
-- If live at home, do not live with strangers
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, LiveAtHome x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x
-- If spend time with siblings, then live at home
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, SpendTimeWithSiblings x → LiveAtHome x
-- Luke's disjunction: (multiple birth ∧ live with strangers) ∨ (¬multiple birth ∧ ¬live with strangers)
axiom Luke_disj : (BornMultiple Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) ∨ (¬ BornMultiple Luke ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke)

theorem luke_statement : ¬ BornMultiple Luke ∧ ¬ ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke := by
  cases Luke_disj with
  | inl h1 =>
      -- Case 1: Luke is born in multiple birth and lives with strangers
      have hB := h1.1
      have hLs := h1.2
      have hS := A1 Luke hB
      have hLh := A5 Luke hS
      have h_notLs := A4 Luke hLh
      contradiction
  | inr h2 =>
      -- Case 2: Luke is not born in multiple birth and does not live with strangers
      have h_notB := h2.1
      constructor
      · exact h_notB
      · intro hC
        have hH := A3 Luke hC
        have hB' := A2 Luke hH
