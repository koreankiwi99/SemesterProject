All aliens are extraterrestrials.\n   \u2200x, Alien x \u2192 Extraterrestrial x\n\n2. If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.\n   \u2200x, FromMars x \u2192 Alien x\n\n3. No extraterrestrials are human.\n   \u2200x, Extraterrestrial x \u2192 \u00acHuman x   (or equivalently, no overlap)\n\n4. All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.\n   \u2200x, (HighlyIntelligent x \u2227 FromEarth x) \u2192 Human x\n\n5. Marvin is a highly intelligent being.\n   HighlyIntelligent Marvin\n\n6. Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.\n   (FromEarth Marvin \u2227 FromMars Marvin) \u2228 (\u00acFromEarth Marvin \u2227 \u00acFromMars Marvin)\n\n7. If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.\n   \u00acFromEarth Marvin \u2192 Extraterrestrial Marvin\n\nWe need to prove:\n   If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human.\n   \u00acFromMars Marvin \u2192 Human Marvin\n\nLet me outline the reasoning:\n\nWe have a disjunction in premise 6. We can consider two cases.\n\nCase 1: (FromEarth Marvin \u2227 FromMars Marvin)\n   If Marvin is from Earth and from Mars, then we are in the first disjunct.\n   Now, the implication we need to prove is: \u00acFromMars Marvin \u2192 Human Marvin.\n   But in this case, FromMars Marvin is true, so \u00acFromMars Marvin is false. Thus the implication is true (by false antecedent).\n\nCase 2: (\u00acFromEarth Marvin \u2227 \u00acFromMars Marvin)\n   In this case, we know \u00acFromEarth Marvin is true. By premise 7, we have Extraterrestrial Marvin.\n   Now, we need to prove that if \u00acFromMars Marvin (which is true in this case) then Human Marvin.\n   But note that by premise 3, no extraterrestrial is human: so Extraterrestrial Marvin implies \u00acHuman Marvin.\n   Thus we have \u00acHuman Marvin. So the consequence Human Marvin is false, but the antecedent \u00acFromMars Marvin is true -> we are trying to prove True \u2192 False, which is false.\n\nWait, that would suggest that in the second case the implication fails? But note: we are asked to prove the implication as a whole. However, in the second case, we have both \u00acFromMars Marvin and \u00acHuman Marvin. So the implication \u00acFromMars Marvin \u2192 Human Marvin would be False (because true implies false is false). Therefore, if we are in the second case, the statement we are trying to prove is false.\n\nBut wait: the problem asks to prove that the statement holds. So do we have a contradiction?\n\nLet me reexamine:\n\nWe have two cases from premise 6. In the first case, the implication holds because the antecedent is false. In the second case, the implication fails because we have the antecedent true but the consequent false.\n\nHowever, I must check if the second case is even consistent with the premises.\n\nIn the second case: \n   \u00acFromEarth Marvin and \u00acFromMars Marvin.\n\nFrom premise 7: \u00acFromEarth Marvin \u2192 Extraterrestrial Marvin, so we have Extraterrestrial Marvin.\n\nFrom premise 3: Extraterrestrial Marvin \u2192 \u00acHuman Marvin, so Marvin is not human.\n\nBut what about premise 4? Premise 4: All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans. Since Marvin is not from Earth, this premise does not apply to Marvin.\n\nNow, we have Marvin as highly intelligent (premise 5) and not from Earth. We don't have any rule that says a highly intelligent being not from Earth must be human. In fact, we have that he is an extraterrestrial and therefore not human.\n\nSo in the second case, we have:\n   \u00acFromMars Marvin (true) and Human Marvin (false). Therefore the implication \u00acFromMars Marvin \u2192 Human Marvin is false.\n\nBut the problem states that we are to prove the implication. However, we are only proving it in the context of the premises. The implication might not hold in all models of the axioms? We must check if the second case is actually consistent.\n\nBut note: premise 6 says Marvin is either (from Earth and Mars) OR (from neither). So both cases are possible.\n\nIn the second case, we have:\n   \u00acFromEarth Marvin and \u00acFromMars Marvin. \n   Then by premise 7, Extraterrestrial Marvin.\n\nHow about the alien part? \nPremise 2: If someone is from Mars then they are alien. Since Marvin is not from Mars, premise 2 is not applicable.\n\nPremise 1: All aliens are extraterrestrials. But we don't have that Marvin is an alien. So we cannot directly get that he is an alien? Then how do we get extraterrestrial? Premise 7 directly gives it from \u00acFromEarth.\n\nThus the second case is consistent: Marvin is an extraterrestrial (by premise 7) because he is not from Earth, and then not human (by premise 3). And he is not from Mars.\n\nTherefore, the implication \"If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is human\" is not always true. In case 1 it is true (vacuously) because Marvin is from Mars. But in case 2, when Marvin is not from Mars, he is not human.\n\nThus, the statement to evaluate does not follow from the premises.\n\nHowever, let's double-check: the statement to evaluate is an implication. We are to prove that the implication holds. But from the above, we see that there is a scenario (case 2) in which the antecedent is true (Marvin is not from Mars) but the consequent is false (Marvin is not human). Hence, the implication is false in that model.\n\nBut wait: the problem asks \"If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human.\" and we found that in one of the cases when Marvin is not from Mars, he is NOT human. Hence the implication is not derivable.\n\nTherefore, we cannot prove it.\n\nFormally, we need to see if the premises entail the conclusion: Premises \u2192 (\u00acFromMars Marvin \u2192 Human Marvin)\n\nBut in the second case we have a model where the premises are true but the conclusion is false.\n\nThus, we cannot prove the conclusion.\n\nSo the answer should be Failure.\n\nBut let me try to write the Lean code to see if we can formalize and then attempt to prove.\n\nWe'll define:\n  obj: Type\n  Marvin: obj\n  Alien, Extraterrestrial, Human, FromMars, FromEarth, HighlyIntelligent: predicates on obj\n\nAxioms:\n\naxiom A1: \u2200 x, Alien x \u2192 Extraterrestrial x\naxiom A2: \u2200 x, FromMars x \u2192 Alien x\naxiom A3: \u2200 x, Extraterrestrial x \u2192 \u00ac Human x   -- or equivalently, \u2200 x, Extraterrestrial x \u2192 Human x \u2192 False\naxiom A4: \u2200 x, HighlyIntelligent x \u2192 FromEarth x \u2192 Human x\naxiom A5: HighlyIntelligent Marvin\naxiom A6: (FromEarth Marvin \u2227 FromMars Marvin) \u2228 (\u00acFromEarth Marvin \u2227 \u00acFromMars Marvin)\naxiom A7: \u00acFromEarth Marvin \u2192 Extraterrestrial Marvin\n\nWe want to prove:\n  \u00acFromMars Marvin \u2192 Human Marvin\n\nBut we suspect it is not provable because of the second disjunct in A6.\n\nIn Lean, we might try a case analysis on A6.\n\nHowever, in the second case we get:\n  h: \u00acFromEarth Marvin \u2227 \u00acFromMars Marvin\n  Then from A7: Extraterrestrial Marvin (because h.left gives \u00acFromEarth)\n  Then from A3: \u00acHuman Marvin\n  Then we have \u00acFromMars Marvin (by h.right) and not Human Marvin, so the implication \u00acFromMars Marvin \u2192 Human Marvin would require us to prove Human Marvin from \u00acFromMars Marvin, but we actually have \u00acHuman Marvin.\n\nThis is a contradiction? No, we don't have a contradiction. We have \u00acHuman Marvin and we have \u00acFromMars Marvin. That is consistent.\n\nThus, in that branch we are stuck trying to prove Human Marvin, but we have \u00acHuman Marvin. So the implication fails.\n\nHence, the overall proof attempt would fail.\n\nLet's try to write the proof in Lean and see.\n\n<lean>\naxiom obj : Type\naxiom Marvin : obj\naxiom Extraterrestrial : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Alien : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom Human : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom FromMars : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom FromEarth : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom HighlyIntelligent : obj \u2192 Prop\n\n-- All aliens are extraterrestrials.\naxiom A1 : \u2200 x, Alien x \u2192 Extraterrestrial x\n\n-- If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.\naxiom A2 : \u2200 x, FromMars x \u2192 Alien x\n\n-- No extraterrestrials are human.\naxiom A3 : \u2200 x, Extraterrestrial x \u2192 \u00ac Human x\n\n-- All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.\naxiom A4 : \u2200 x, HighlyIntelligent x \u2192 FromEarth x \u2192 Human x\n\n-- Marvin is highly intelligent.\naxiom A5 : HighlyIntelligent Marvin\n\n-- Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.\naxiom A6 : (FromEarth Marvin \u2227 FromMars Marvin) \u2228 (\u00ac FromEarth Marvin \u2227 \u00ac FromMars Marvin)\n\n-- If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.\naxiom A7 : \u00ac FromEarth Marvin \u2192 Extraterrestrial Marvin\n\ntheorem target : \u00ac FromMars Marvin \u2192 Human Marvin := by\n  -- We'll do case analysis on A6\n  cases A6 with\n  | inl h =>\n      -- Case 1: FromEarth Marvin and FromMars Marvin\n      intro hnm  -- assume \u00ac FromMars Marvin\n      -- But we have FromMars Marvin from h.right, contradiction.\n      contradiction\n  | inr h =>\n      -- Case 2: \u00acFromEarth Marvin and \u00acFromMars Marvin\n      intro hnm  -- \u00acFromMars Marvin (which we have, but actually we are given it again, but it's the same)\n      -- We need to show Human Marvin.\n      -- We know \u00acFromEarth Marvin (by h.left)\n      have extraterrestrial_Marvin : Extraterrestrial Marvin := A7 h.left\n      have not_human : \u00ac Human Marvin := A3 Marvin extraterrestrial_Marvin\n      -- We are trying to prove Human Marvin, but we have \u00acHuman Marvin.\n      -- This is a contradiction?

Actually, it says \"or she did neither\", so it's a disjunction of two cases]\n\nWe have two cases for Taylor:\n\nCase 1: A \u2227 B\n   Then Taylor grew up health-conscious (A) and disregards well-being (B).\n   From A and the transitivity above, we have HealthConscious Taylor.\n   From B and premise (4), we have \u00ac HealthConscious Taylor.\n   This is a contradiction. So this case is impossible.\n\nThus, we must be in Case 2: \u00acA \u2227 \u00acB.\n\nSo we have:\n   \u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor   (this is part of the statement we want)\n   and \u00ac DisregardsWellBeing Taylor.\n\nBut we also have to show \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n\nRecall: if Taylor visits the gym daily (VisitsGymDaily Taylor), then by (5) and (3) we get GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor.\nBut we just have \u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor. Therefore, we cannot have VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n\nSo by contrapositive: since if she visited the gym daily then she would have grown up in a health-conscious home, but we know she did not, so she does not visit the gym daily.\n\nThus, we have both \u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor and \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day\" is true.\n\nWe can now write the Lean code.\n\nNote: We'll define the type of people and the predicates. The object is Taylor.\n\nWe'll use:\n- `Person` as the type\n- `EatsSaladsRegularly (p : Person) : Prop`\n- `HealthConscious (p : Person) : Prop`\n- `GrewUpHealthConscious (p : Person) : Prop`\n- `FulfillsNutrition (p : Person) : Prop`\n- `DisregardsWellBeing (p : Person) : Prop`\n- `VisitsGymDaily (p : Person) : Prop`\n\nAnd the axioms as given.\n\nWe'll then prove the theorem for Taylor.\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n1. We have that Taylor is in one of two cases: (A \u2227 B) or (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB) where A = GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor and B = DisregardsWellBeing Taylor.\n\n2. Case 1: A \u2227 B.\n   - From A: GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor, then by (axiom2) she eats salads, then by (axiom1) she is health conscious.\n   - From B: DisregardsWellBeing Taylor, then by (axiom4) she is not health conscious.\n   - Contradiction. Therefore, case 1 is false.\n\n3. So we have case 2: \u00acA \u2227 \u00acB, meaning \u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor and \u00ac DisregardsWellBeing Taylor.\n\n4. We also want \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n   - Suppose VisitsGymDaily Taylor (for contradiction).\n   - Then by (axiom5), she fulfills her nutrition, so by (axiom3), she grew up health conscious -> A.\n   - But we have \u00acA. Contradiction.\n   - Therefore, \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n\nTherefore, we can prove the statement.\n\nNow, in Lean, we can do a proof by cases on the disjunction (axiom6) and then in the first case derive a contradiction.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly.\n", "prediction": "True", "parse_status": "SUCCESS", "lean_code": "axiom Person : Type\naxiom Taylor : Person\n\n-- Predicates\naxiom EatsSaladsRegularly : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom HealthConscious : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom GrewUpHealthConscious : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FulfillsNutrition : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom DisregardsWellBeing : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VisitsGymDaily : Person \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Axioms\naxiom axiom1 : \u2200 p : Person, EatsSaladsRegularly p \u2192 HealthConscious p\naxiom axiom2 : \u2200 p : Person, GrewUpHealthConscious p \u2192 EatsSaladsRegularly p\naxiom axiom3 : \u2200 p : Person, FulfillsNutrition p \u2192 GrewUpHealthConscious p\naxiom axiom4 : \u2200 p : Person, DisregardsWellBeing p \u2192 \u00ac HealthConscious p\naxiom axiom5 : \u2200 p : Person, VisitsGymDaily p \u2192 FulfillsNutrition p\naxiom axiom6 : (GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 DisregardsWellBeing Taylor) \u2228 (\u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardsWellBeing Taylor)\n\n-- Statement to prove: Taylor neither grew up health-conscious nor visits gym daily.\ntheorem taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by\n  -- Case analysis on Taylor's situation (axiom6)\n  cases axiom6 with\n  | inl (case1) => \n      -- Case 1: Taylor grew up health-conscious AND disregards well-being\n      have h_grew := case1.left\n      have h_disregard := case1.right\n      -- Since Taylor grew up health-conscious, she eats salads (axiom2)\n      have h_eats := axiom2 Taylor h_grew\n      -- Then she is health-conscious (axiom1)\n      have h_health_conscious := axiom1 Taylor h_eats\n      -- But from disregarding well-being, she is NOT health-conscious (axiom4)\n      have h_not_health := axiom4 Taylor h_disregard\n      -- Contradiction\n      contradiction\n  | inr (case2) =>\n      -- Case 2: Taylor did NOT grow up health-conscious and does NOT disregard well-being\n      have not_grew := case2.left\n      -- We need to also show \u00acVisitsGymDaily\n      apply And.intro not_grew\n      intro h_gym\n      -- If Taylor visits gym daily, she fulfills nutrition (axiom5)\n      have h_nutrition := axiom5 Taylor h_gym\n      -- Then she grew up health-conscious (axiom3)\n      have h_grew' := axiom3 Taylor h_nutrition\n      -- Contradiction with not_grew\n      contradiction", "lean_verification": {"success": false, "env": 1, "errors": ["Alternative `inr` has not been provided", "unsolved goals\ncase inl\nh\u271d : GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 DisregardsWellBeing Taylor\n\u22a2 \u00acGrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 \u00acVisitsGymDaily Taylor", "unexpected token '('; expected command"], "warnings": [], "all_messages": [{"severity": "error", "data": "Alternative `inr` has not been provided"}, {"severity": "error", "data": "unsolved goals\ncase inl\nh\u271d : GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 DisregardsWellBeing Taylor\n\u22a2 \u00acGrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 \u00acVisitsGymDaily Taylor"}, {"severity": "error", "data": "unexpected token '('; expected command"}]}, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 546, "completion_tokens": 1932, "total_tokens": 2478}}, {"iteration": 2, "llm_response": "The compilation errors were due to the way the `cases` tactic was used and the handling of the contradiction in the `inl` branch.

Let me analyze the errors:\n\n1. \"Alternative `inr` has not been provided\": This might be because the `cases` tactic expects both alternatives to be handled, but the error message says that the `inl` case is not closed? Actually, the error message says \"Alternative `inr` has not been provided\" but we have both `inl` and `inr` branches.\n\n2. The error message also says: \"unsolved goals\" in the `inl` case and then shows a goal for the `inl` case.\n\nLooking at the code, in the `inl` branch we have:\n  case1: GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 DisregardsWellBeing Taylor\nWe then derive:\n  h_health_conscious: HealthConscious Taylor\n  h_not_health: \u00ac HealthConscious Taylor\nand then use `contradiction` to close the goal. This should work.\n\nBut note: the error says \"unexpected token '('; expected command\" at the end. This might be due to the way the branches are written.\n\nIn Lean 4, the `cases` tactic can be used with the `with` clause and then pattern matching. However, the syntax for the pattern matching might be off.\n\nAlternatively, the error might be because the `inl` branch does not actually produce a proof of the goal? The goal is `\u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor`. In the `inl` branch we have a contradiction, so we can close the entire goal by contradiction. But note: in the `inl` branch we have a contradiction, so we can use `False.elim` on the contradiction? Actually, the `contradiction` tactic should work.\n\nBut the error message says that the `inl` case is not closed. Let me check: after `contradiction` we should be done with that branch.\n\nAnother possibility: the `cases` tactic does not automatically close the goal? We might need to use `case` or other methods.\n\nAlternatively, we can restructure the proof.\n\nAlso, note that the error says \"unexpected token '('; expected command\" at the end. This might be a parsing error. Let me check the syntax of the `cases` with branches.\n\nI think the syntax is correct. However, sometimes Lean is sensitive to indentation.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to write the proof without the named branches.\n\nBut let me try to fix the `inl` branch: we have a contradiction, so we can use `exfalso` and then apply the contradiction? Actually, `contradiction` should work.\n\nAlternatively, we can close the entire branch by noting that we have a contradiction and then we can prove anything. So we can do `exfalso; exact ...` but `contradiction` should do that.\n\nAnother idea: the `contradiction` tactic might not be finding the contradiction because the hypotheses are not in the context? Let me write the `inl` branch more explicitly.\n\nWe can try:\n\n  | inl case1 =>\n      let \u27e8h_grew, h_disregard\u27e9 := case1\n      have h_eats := axiom2 Taylor h_grew\n      have h_health_conscious := axiom1 Taylor h_eats\n      have h_not_health := axiom4 Taylor h_disregard\n      exact absurd h_health_conscious h_not_health\n\nBut then we have to prove the goal? Actually, in the `inl` branch we have a contradiction, which should allow us to prove anything, including the goal. But note: the goal is a conjunction. We can use `False.elim` on the contradiction? Alternatively, we can use the contradiction to immediately close the entire theorem? But we are in the middle of a case.\n\nActually, we can do:\n\n  | inl case1 => \n      let \u27e8h_grew, h_disregard\u27e9 := case1\n      have h_health_conscious : HealthConscious Taylor := axiom1 Taylor (axiom2 Taylor h_grew)\n      have h_not_health : \u00ac HealthConscious Taylor := axiom4 Taylor h_disregard\n      exact False.elim (h_not_health h_health_conscious)\n\nBut then we have not built the conjunction? Wait, no: because the entire goal is `\u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor`. But we are proving `False`? Actually, we are proving `False` and then we can eliminate it to prove anything. But note: the `exact False.elim ...` would prove the entire goal? Because the goal is arbitrary once we have `False`.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  | inl case1 => \n      let \u27e8h_grew, h_disregard\u27e9 := case1\n      have h_health_conscious : HealthConscious Taylor := axiom1 Taylor (axiom2 Taylor h_grew)\n      have h_not_health : \u00ac HealthConscious Taylor := axiom4 Taylor h_disregard\n      exact False.elim (h_not_health h_health_conscious)\n\nBut wait, this would close the entire theorem? Yes, because we have a contradiction.\n\nBut the goal is a conjunction. However, if we have `False`, we can derive anything, including the conjunction.\n\nAlternatively, we can use `by_contradiction`? But that might be overkill.\n\nActually, the above `exact False.elim ...` should work.\n\nNow for the `inr` branch:\n\n  | inr case2 =>\n      let \u27e8not_grew, not_disregard\u27e9 := case2\n      -- We need to show \u00acGrewUpHealthConscious Taylor (which we have) and \u00acVisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n      constructor\n      \u00b7 exact not_grew\n      \u00b7 intro h_gym\n        have h_nutrition := axiom5 Taylor h_gym\n        have h_grew' := axiom3 Taylor h_nutrition\n        exact not_grew h_grew'\n\nThis should work.\n\nSo let me rewrite the entire proof accordingly.\n\nAlso, note: the original axiom6 is about Taylor only, so we don't need to generalize.\n\nLet me write the corrected code:\n\n<lean>\naxiom Person : Type\naxiom Taylor : Person\n\n-- Predicates\naxiom EatsSaladsRegularly : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom HealthConscious : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom GrewUpHealthConscious : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FulfillsNutrition : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom DisregardsWellBeing : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VisitsGymDaily : Person \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Axioms\naxiom axiom1 : \u2200 p : Person, EatsSaladsRegularly p \u2192 HealthConscious p\naxiom axiom2 : \u2200 p : Person, GrewUpHealthConscious p \u2192 EatsSaladsRegularly p\naxiom axiom3 : \u2200 p : Person, FulfillsNutrition p \u2192 GrewUpHealthConscious p\naxiom axiom4 : \u2200 p : Person, DisregardsWellBeing p \u2192 \u00ac HealthConscious p\naxiom axiom5 : \u2200 p : Person, VisitsGymDaily p \u2192 FulfillsNutrition p\naxiom axiom6 : (GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 DisregardsWellBeing Taylor) \u2228 (\u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardsWellBeing Taylor)\n\n-- Statement to prove: Taylor neither grew up health-conscious nor visits gym daily.\ntheorem taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by\n  cases axiom6 with\n  | inl case1 =>\n      let \u27e8h_grew, h_disregard\u27e9 := case1\n      have h_health_conscious : HealthConscious Taylor := axiom1 Taylor (axiom2 Taylor h_grew)\n      have h_not_health : \u00ac HealthConscious Taylor := axiom4 Taylor h_disregard\n      exact False.elim (h_not_health h_health_conscious)\n  | inr case2 =>\n      let \u27e8not_grew, not_disregard\u27e9 := case2\n      constructor\n      \u00b7 exact not_grew\n      \u00b7 intro h_gym\n        have h_nutrition := axiom5 Taylor h_gym\n        have h_grew' := axiom3 Taylor h_nutrition\n        exact not_grew h_grew'\n</lean>\n\nNow, let me explain the changes:\n\n1. In the `inl` branch, we use `let` to destructure the conjunction.\n2. We then derive `HealthConscious Taylor` and `\u00ac HealthConscious Taylor`.\n3. We use `False.elim` to derive the entire goal from the contradiction.\n4. In the `inr` branch, we also destructure the conjunction.\n5. We use `constructor` to break the goal into two subgoals: `\u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor` and `\u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor`.\n   - The first is exactly `not_grew`.\n   - The second: assume `VisitsGymDaily Taylor`, then derive `GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor` (via `axiom5` and `axiom3`), which contradicts `not_grew`.\n\nThis should compile.\n\nNow, we must note: the statement we are proving is exactly the conclusion we want. So if this theorem is proven, then the answer is True.\n\nLet me run through the cases:\n\nCase 1: Taylor grew up health-conscious and disregards well-being.\n  From the axioms, she would be health-conscious (from eating salads) and not health-conscious (from disregarding well-being). Contradiction. So this case is impossible? Actually, the context says \"Taylor either ... or ...\", so both cases are possible? But in this case we get a contradiction, meaning that this case cannot occur. Therefore, only the second case occurs.\n\nBut note: the disjunction in axiom6 is exclusive? Not necessarily, but in this case the first branch leads to contradiction, so we are left with the second branch.\n\nIn the second branch, we have: \u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor and \u00ac DisregardsWellBeing Taylor. Then we prove \u00acVisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n\nSo overall, we have \u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor and \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion holds.\n\nSo the code should now compile and prove the theorem.\n\nThus, the answer is True.", "prediction": "True", "parse_status": "SUCCESS", "lean_code": "axiom Person : Type\naxiom Taylor : Person\n\n-- Predicates\naxiom EatsSaladsRegularly : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom HealthConscious : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom GrewUpHealthConscious : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FulfillsNutrition : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom DisregardsWellBeing : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VisitsGymDaily : Person \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Axioms\naxiom axiom1 : \u2200 p : Person, EatsSaladsRegularly p \u2192 HealthConscious p\naxiom axiom2 : \u2200 p : Person, GrewUpHealthConscious p \u2192 EatsSaladsRegularly p\naxiom axiom3 : \u2200 p : Person, FulfillsNutrition p \u2192 GrewUpHealthConscious p\naxiom axiom4 : \u2200 p : Person, DisregardsWellBeing p \u2192 \u00ac HealthConscious p\naxiom axiom5 : \u2200 p : Person, VisitsGymDaily p \u2192 FulfillsNutrition p\naxiom axiom6 : (GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 DisregardsWellBeing Taylor) \u2228 (\u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardsWellBeing Taylor)\n\n-- Statement to prove: Taylor neither grew up health-conscious nor visits gym daily.\ntheorem taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by\n  cases axiom6 with\n  | inl case1 =>\n      let \u27e8h_grew, h_disregard\u27e9 := case1\n      have h_health_conscious : HealthConscious Taylor := axiom1 Taylor (axiom2 Taylor h_grew)\n      have h_not_health : \u00ac HealthConscious Taylor := axiom4 Taylor h_disregard\n      exact False.elim (h_not_health h_health_conscious)\n  | inr case2 =>\n      let \u27e8not_grew, not_disregard\u27e9 := case2\n      constructor\n      \u00b7 exact not_grew\n      \u00b7 intro h_gym\n        have h_nutrition := axiom5 Taylor h_gym\n        have h_grew' := axiom3 Taylor h_nutrition\n        exact not_grew h_grew'", "lean_verification": {"success": true, "env": 2, "errors": [], "warnings": [], "all_messages": []}, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1886, "completion_tokens": 2751, "total_tokens": 4637}}], "num_iterations": 2, "lean_code": "axiom Person : Type\naxiom Taylor : Person\n\n-- Predicates\naxiom EatsSaladsRegularly : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom HealthConscious : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom GrewUpHealthConscious : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FulfillsNutrition : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom DisregardsWellBeing : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom VisitsGymDaily : Person \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Axioms\naxiom axiom1 : \u2200 p : Person, EatsSaladsRegularly p \u2192 HealthConscious p\naxiom axiom2 : \u2200 p : Person, GrewUpHealthConscious p \u2192 EatsSaladsRegularly p\naxiom axiom3 : \u2200 p : Person, FulfillsNutrition p \u2192 GrewUpHealthConscious p\naxiom axiom4 : \u2200 p : Person, DisregardsWellBeing p \u2192 \u00ac HealthConscious p\naxiom axiom5 : \u2200 p : Person, VisitsGymDaily p \u2192 FulfillsNutrition p\naxiom axiom6 : (GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 DisregardsWellBeing Taylor) \u2228 (\u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 \u00ac DisregardsWellBeing Taylor)\n\n-- Statement to prove: Taylor neither grew up health-conscious nor visits gym daily.\ntheorem taylor_case : \u00ac GrewUpHealthConscious Taylor \u2227 \u00ac VisitsGymDaily Taylor := by\n  cases axiom6 with\n  | inl case1 =>\n      let \u27e8h_grew, h_disregard\u27e9 := case1\n      have h_health_conscious : HealthConscious Taylor := axiom1 Taylor (axiom2 Taylor h_grew)\n      have h_not_health : \u00ac HealthConscious Taylor := axiom4 Taylor h_disregard\n      exact False.elim (h_not_health h_health_conscious)\n  | inr case2 =>\n      let \u27e8not_grew, not_disregard\u27e9 := case2\n      constructor\n      \u00b7 exact not_grew\n      \u00b7 intro h_gym\n        have h_nutrition := axiom5 Taylor h_gym\n        have h_grew' := axiom3 Taylor h_nutrition\n        exact not_grew h_grew'", "lean_verification": {"success": true, "env": 2, "errors": [], "warnings": [], "all_messages": []}, "total_tokens": {"prompt_tokens": 2432, "completion_tokens": 4683, "total_tokens": 7115}, "story_id": 355, "example_id": 943, "case_idx": 174}

Assume `ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke`.  \n   - Premise 3: Complaining implies having siblings born together.  \n   \u2234 `HasSiblingBornTogether Luke`.  \n2. Premise 2: Having siblings born together implies being born in a multiple birth.  \n   \u2234 `MultipleBirth Luke`.  \n3. Premise 1: Being born in a multiple birth implies spending time with siblings.  \n   \u2234 `SpendTimeWithSiblings Luke`.  \n4. Premise 5: Spending time with siblings implies living at home.  \n   \u2234 `LiveAtHome Luke`.  \n5. Premise 4: Living at home implies not living with strangers.  \n   \u2234 `\u00ac LiveWithStrangers Luke`.  \n\nLuke's disjunction now requires:  \n- Since `MultipleBirth Luke` holds (step 2), the disjunction forces `LiveWithStrangers Luke` (case 1).  \n- However, step 5 proves `\u00ac LiveWithStrangers Luke`, a **contradiction**.  \n\nThis contradiction shows the assumption `ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke` is inconsistent with the premises. Thus, the statement cannot be true, and it cannot be proven from the axioms.\n\n<lean>\naxiom obj : Type\n\naxiom ComplainAnnoyingSiblings : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom HasSiblingBornTogether : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom MultipleBirth : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom SpendTimeWithSiblings : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom LiveAtHome : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom LiveWithStrangers : obj \u2192 Prop\n\naxiom Luke : obj\n\naxiom A : \u2200 x : obj, MultipleBirth x \u2192 SpendTimeWithSiblings x\naxiom B : \u2200 x : obj, HasSiblingBornTogether x \u2192 MultipleBirth x\naxiom C : \u2200 x : obj, ComplainAnnoyingSiblings x \u2192 HasSiblingBornTogether x\naxiom D : \u2200 x : obj, LiveAtHome x \u2192 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers x\naxiom E : \u2200 x : obj, SpendTimeWithSiblings x \u2192 LiveAtHome x\naxiom F : (MultipleBirth Luke \u2227 LiveWithStrangers Luke) \u2228 (\u00ac MultipleBirth Luke \u2227 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers Luke)\n\n-- Attempt to prove ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke leads to contradiction\ntheorem cannot_prove : \u00acComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke := by\n  intro hComplain\n  have hSiblings : HasSiblingBornTogether Luke := C Luke hComplain\n  have hMulti : MultipleBirth Luke := B Luke hSiblings\n  have hTime : SpendTimeWithSiblings Luke := A Luke hMulti\n  have hHome : LiveAtHome Luke := E Luke hTime\n  have hNoStrangers : \u00acLiveWithStrangers Luke := D Luke hHome\n  cases F with\n  | inl h =>\n    have hStrangers := h.right\n    contradiction\n  | inr h =>\n    have hNotMulti := h.left\n    contradiction\n\n-- Since the positive statement leads to a contradiction, it cannot be proven.\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: Failure", "reasoning_content": "We are given several premises and a statement to evaluate about Luke.\n The goal is to determine whether the statement \"Luke complains often about annoying siblings\" leads to a conclusion that is necessarily true given the context? \n But note: the problem is to see if we can prove the conclusion that Luke complains often about annoying siblings is true? \n Actually, the statement to evaluate is given as a fact? Or is it the conclusion we are to test? \n\n Rereading: \"Statement to evaluate: Luke complains often about annoying siblings\"\n\n However, note the problem setting: we are to try to prove the conclusion (which is given as \"Luke complains often about annoying siblings\") from the premises? \n But wait, in the context, we have a description of Luke: \n   \"Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers\"\n\n But note: the problem does not state that Luke is a person? We will assume that we are talking about people.\n\n Let us define the predicates:\n\n Let U be a type for people.\n\n Predicates:\n   MultipleBirth(x) : x was born in a multiple birth (twins, triplets, etc.)\n   HasSiblingBornTogether(x) : x has siblings who were born together (which we can equate to being born in the same multiple birth event) \n   ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(x) : x complains often about annoying siblings.\n   LiveAtHome(x) : x lives at home.\n   LiveWithStrangers(x) : x lives with strangers.\n\n Premises:\n   1. \u2200 x, (Born in multiple birth with siblings \u2192 spend a lot of time with siblings) \n        We don't have a predicate for \"spend a lot of time ...\", but we have:\n        \"If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home.\"\n\n        Let me reify:\n        Let SpendTimeWithSiblings(x) : x spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with siblings.\n\n        So:\n          A: \u2200x, MultipleBirth(x) \u2192 SpendTimeWithSiblings(x)   [Premise1]\n\n   2. \u2200x, (HasSiblingBornTogether(x) \u2192 MultipleBirth(x))\n        Actually: \"If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.\"\n        But note: if a person has a sibling born together (i.e. in the same birth event), then that person must have been born in that multiple birth too? \n        However, note: if a person has a sibling from the same multiple birth, then they were one of the multiple births. So:\n\n          B: \u2200x, HasSiblingBornTogether(x) \u2192 MultipleBirth(x)\n\n   3. \u2200x, (ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(x) \u2192 HasSiblingBornTogether(x))\n        Premise: \"If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.\"\n\n          C: \u2200x, ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(x) \u2192 HasSiblingBornTogether(x)\n\n   4. \u2200x, (LiveAtHome(x) \u2192 \u00acLiveWithStrangers(x))\n\n          D: \u2200x, LiveAtHome(x) \u2192 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers(x)\n\n   5. \u2200x, (SpendTimeWithSiblings(x) \u2192 LiveAtHome(x))\n\n          E: \u2200x, SpendTimeWithSiblings(x) \u2192 LiveAtHome(x)\n\n   6. Disjunction about Luke:\n        Luke either:\n          (is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers) \n          OR \n          (is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers)\n\n        Note: We are told that Luke is a baby? But we don't have a predicate for baby, so we can ignore that and focus on the events.\n\n        But note: we have two predicates: MultipleBirth and LiveWithStrangers.\n\n        Let L: Luke\n\n        So: \n          (MultipleBirth(L) \u2227 LiveWithStrangers(L)) \u2228 (\u00ac MultipleBirth(L) \u2227 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers(L))\n\n        That is: MultipleBirth(L) \u2194 LiveWithStrangers(L)   ??? No, actually:\n\n          It's an exclusive or? Actually, the two cases are mutually exclusive? But the statement says \"either ... or ...\", which in logic usually means exclusive or? \n          However, we can represent it as:\n\n          F: (MultipleBirth(L) \u2227 LiveWithStrangers(L)) \u2228 (\u00ac MultipleBirth(L) \u2227 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers(L))\n\n          This is equivalent to: LiveWithStrangers(L) \u2194 MultipleBirth(L)\n\n Now, we want to know: can we prove that Luke complains often about annoying siblings? \n\n But note: the statement to evaluate is \"Luke complains often about annoying siblings\". However, we are not given that. We are to check if it is true?\n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Textual context: ...\" and then the statement to evaluate. \n\n How is this set up? In the previous examples, we were to prove the statement when we have the context (premises) and the context includes the \"context\" plus the \"statement to evaluate\" as a premise? \n\n Not exactly: looking back at examples, the first example had:\n    Context: The cat is blue. If someone is blue then they are nice.\n    Question: The cat is nice.\n\n Then we proved that.\n\n But in this case, the statement to evaluate is given at the end. However, note the context does not say that Luke complains... So we are to see if it follows from the premises? \n\n But wait: the premises alone do not force Luke to complain. We have a disjunctive fact about Luke, but we don't have that he must complain.\n\n However, let me see: we are asked to evaluate the statement. How?\n\n Actually, the problem statement is: \"Statement to evaluate: Luke complains often about annoying siblings\"\n\n I think we are to determine if it is necessarily true? Or perhaps we are supposed to assume it and see if we can prove it? \n\n But the problem says: \"During the translation, please pay close attention to the predicates and entities. [...] try to PROVE that the conclusion is TRUE (follows from the premises).\"\n\n The conclusion here is the \"statement to evaluate\"? \n\n In the example, the question was the conclusion.\n\n So in this problem, we are to see if the statement \"Luke complains often about annoying siblings\" follows from the context? \n\n However, note that we have a piece of information about Luke (the disjunction). So we are to prove:\n\n   Premises and the disjunction about Luke \u22a2 ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L)\n\n Let's try:\n\n   Assume we want to prove ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L).\n\n   From C: we have that ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L) \u2192 HasSiblingBornTogether(L)\n\n   Then from B: HasSiblingBornTogether(L) \u2192 MultipleBirth(L)\n\n   So if Luke complains, then we get MultipleBirth(L).\n\n   Then from F: if MultipleBirth(L) is true, then the disjunction tells us that LiveWithStrangers(L) is true.\n\n   Now, what about the other premises? \n\n   From A: MultipleBirth(L) \u2192 SpendTimeWithSiblings(L)\n\n   From E: SpendTimeWithSiblings(L) \u2192 LiveAtHome(L)\n\n   Then from D: LiveAtHome(L) \u2192 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers(L)\n\n   So we have:\n\n        LiveAtHome(L)\n\n        and also: \u00ac LiveWithStrangers(L)\n\n   But from the disjunction, if Luke is multiple birth, then LiveWithStrangers(L) is true.\n\n   Contradiction: because we get both LiveWithStrangers(L) and \u00acLiveWithStrangers(L).\n\n   Therefore, if Luke complains about annoying siblings, we get a contradiction.\n\n   What does this mean? It means that the premises and the disjunction about Luke imply that Luke cannot complain about annoying siblings? \n\n   Therefore, the statement \"Luke complains often about annoying siblings\" is actually false? \n\n   But wait, we are asked to prove that the conclusion (which is that statement) is true? We see that we get a contradiction if we assume it. So we cannot prove it, and in fact it leads to an inconsistency. \n\n   Therefore, we can't prove it? Actually, we've proven that it is false (within the premises). \n\n   However, note: the problem is to try to prove the statement \"Luke complains often about annoying siblings\" is true. We have shown that under the assumption of the statement we get a contradiction. So the statement is false? \n\n   But the problem does not require us to prove its negation. It just asks: can we prove the statement? \n\n   We cannot. And we get that the statement is inconsistent with the premises? So it cannot be true. \n\n   Therefore, the conclusion (that Luke complains often) does not follow from the premises. \n\n   Important: the problem says \"try to PROVE that the conclusion is TRUE (follows from the premises)\".\n\n   We could not prove it. In fact, we found a contradiction if we assume it. So we must return \"Failure\".\n\n   However, note: we are not given the statement as a premise. We are only to see if it is entailed.\n\n   Since it is not entailed (and in fact is refuted by the premises), we cannot prove it.\n\n Let me check the disjunction:\n\n        F: (MultipleBirth(L) \u2227 LiveWithStrangers(L)) \u2228 (\u00ac MultipleBirth(L) \u2227 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers(L))\n\n   And we have:\n\n        If Luke were to have ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L), then:\n\n          \u2192 HasSiblingBornTogether(L)   [by C]\n          \u2192 MultipleBirth(L)   [by B]\n\n        Then from A: SpendTimeWithSiblings(L)\n        Then from E: LiveAtHome(L)\n        Then from D: \u00ac LiveWithStrangers(L)\n\n        But by F: if MultipleBirth(L), then LiveWithStrangers(L) must hold.\n\n        Contradiction because we have both LiveWithStrangers(L) and \u00acLiveWithStrangers(L).\n\n   Therefore, the assumption that ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L) leads to a contradiction.\n\n   Hence, by the law of non-contradiction, it cannot be that ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L) is true.\n\n   So the negation is true: \u00acComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L)\n\n   But we are not asked to prove that. We are asked to prove ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L).\n\n   We cannot prove ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L). So the answer is Failure.\n\n   However, note that the problem does not say we must assume the statement. We are only given the context (premises) and the disjunction about Luke, and then we are to check if the statement follows.\n\n   It does not. So we cannot prove it.\n\n   But wait, what if we consider the second branch of the disjunction? \n\n        Case 1: Luke is in a multiple birth and lives with strangers: \n          From A: Luke spends time with siblings -> LiveAtHome (by E) -> not living with strangers (D). \n          But we have living with strangers -> contradiction.\n\n        So actually, the first branch already leads to a contradiction? How?\n\n          Premises:\n            A: MultipleBirth(L) \u2192 SpendTimeWithSiblings(L)\n            E: SpendTimeWithSiblings(L) \u2192 LiveAtHome(L)\n            D: LiveAtHome(L) \u2192 \u00acLiveWithStrangers(L)\n\n          And the branch: MultipleBirth(L) and LiveWithStrangers(L)\n\n          Then from A: SpendTimeWithSiblings(L)\n          Then E -> LiveAtHome(L)\n          Then D -> \u00acLiveWithStrangers(L)\n\n          But we have LiveWithStrangers(L) -> contradiction.\n\n          Therefore, the first branch must be false? So then the second branch must be taken:\n\n             \u00ac MultipleBirth(L) and \u00ac LiveWithStrangers(L)\n\n          Then, we don't have to worry about spending time, etc.\n\n        Does this affect our conclusion? \n\n        But note: we are not using the statement in the disjunction. The disjunction is about Luke and it doesn't involve the complaint.\n\n        So given the premises, we can deduce that Luke must be in the second branch: \n            \u00acMultipleBirth(L) and \u00acLiveWithStrangers(L)\n\n        Now, can we prove ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L) from this? \n\n          If Luke complains, then by C: HasSiblingBornTogether(L), then by B: MultipleBirth(L). \n          But we have \u00acMultipleBirth(L). So a contradiction. \n\n        Therefore, we have proven that ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L) is false? But again, we are asking for a proof of it.\n\n        Since we can derive \u00acComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L) from the premises and the disjunction, we certainly cannot derive ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L).\n\n        Hence, Failure.\n\n   But note: in the first branch we also get a contradiction? So the entire disjunction must choose the second branch. \n\n   We can actually prove in the context (without the statement) that:\n\n        \u00ac (MultipleBirth(L) \u2227 LiveWithStrangers(L))\n\n   Because:\n\n        assume MultipleBirth(L) and LiveWithStrangers(L)\n        then by A: SpendTimeWithSiblings(L)\n        then by E: LiveAtHome(L)\n        then by D: \u00acLiveWithStrangers(L)\n        contradiction.\n\n   So the disjunction F becomes:\n\n        (MultipleBirth(L) \u2227 LiveWithStrangers(L)) is false, so we must have \u00acMultipleBirth(L) \u2227 \u00acLiveWithStrangers(L)\n\n   Then, without the statement, we have: \u00acMultipleBirth(L) and \u00acLiveWithStrangers(L)\n\n   Now, if we try to prove ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L), we can do:\n\n        assume H: ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L)\n        from C, H: HasSiblingBornTogether(L)\n        from B: MultipleBirth(L)\n        but we have \u00acMultipleBirth(L) -> contradiction.\n\n        Therefore, we can actually prove \u00acComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L) from the context.\n\n        So the conclusion \"Luke complains often about annoying siblings\" is false? \n\n        We are only being asked to prove the positive statement. Since we can prove the negation, we cannot prove the positive. \n\n   Therefore: Failure.\n\n Let me formalize:\n\n   We are to prove: ComplainAnnoyingSiblings(L) \u2192 contradiction, but that only shows that we can prove the negation. \n\n   The problem asks for: can we prove the statement? -> no.\n\n   Therefore, we return Failure.\n\n Code:\n\n   We define:\n     obj : Type (for people)\n     Luke : obj\n\n   Predicates:\n     MultipleBirth : obj \u2192 Prop\n     SpendTimeWithSiblings : obj \u2192 Prop\n     HasSiblingBornTogether : obj \u2192 Prop\n     ComplainAnnoyingSiblings : obj \u2192 Prop\n     LiveAtHome : obj \u2192 Prop\n     LiveWithStrangers : obj \u2192 Prop\n\n   Axioms:\n     A : \u2200x, MultipleBirth x \u2192 SpendTimeWithSiblings x\n     B : \u2200x, HasSiblingBornTogether x \u2192 MultipleBirth x\n     C : \u2200x, ComplainAnnoyingSiblings x \u2192 HasSiblingBornTogether x\n     D : \u2200x, LiveAtHome x \u2192 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers x\n     E : \u2200x, SpendTimeWithSiblings x \u2192 LiveAtHome x\n     F : (MultipleBirth Luke \u2227 LiveWithStrangers Luke) \u2228 (\u00ac MultipleBirth Luke \u2227 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers Luke)\n\n   We then try to prove: ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke\n\n   But then:\n\n        have H : ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke\n        then have H1 : HasSiblingBornTogether Luke := C Luke H\n        then have H2 : MultipleBirth Luke := B Luke H1\n        then have H3 : SpendTimeWithSiblings Luke := A Luke H2\n        then have H4 : LiveAtHome Luke := E Luke H3\n        then have H5 : \u00ac LiveWithStrangers Luke := D Luke H4\n\n        now, from F, we must have one of the two cases. But if first case:\n             H6 : MultipleBirth Luke and LiveWithStrangers Luke\n             so we have both LiveWithStrangers Luke and \u00ac LiveWithStrangers Luke -> contradiction.\n        if second case: \n             H6 : \u00ac MultipleBirth Luke and \u00ac LiveWithStrangers Luke\n             then H2: MultipleBirth Luke and from H6 (left) we get \u00acMultipleBirth Luke -> contradiction.\n\n        Therefore, contradiction in both cases? \n\n        So we have a proof of False from the assumption H? \n\n        Then we can do:\n\n          theorem not_Complain: \u00ac ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke := \n            fun H : ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke => \n              let H1 := C Luke H\n              let H2 := B Luke H1\n              (match F with\n                | Or.inl (h_multi, h_live) => \n                  let H3 := A Luke h_multi\n                  let H4 := E Luke H3\n                  let H5 := D Luke H4\n                  h_live (H5)   -- H5: \u00ac LiveWithStrangers, h_live: LiveWithStrangers Luke\n                | Or.inr (h_not_multi, h_not_live) => \n                  h_not_multi H2   -- H2: MultipleBirth Luke, h_not_multi: \u00ac MultipleBirth Luke\n              )\n\n        So we can prove \u00acComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot prove ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke -> Failure.\n\n   However, note: we are not required to prove the negation. We are only required to see if the statement can be proven. Since it leads to contradiction, it is unprovable (in fact refutable).\n\n Therefore, we return Failure.\n\n Code Implementation:\n\n   Note: We have to express the disjunction F as an axiom about Luke.\n\n   Let's write:\n\n     axiom Luke : obj\n     axiom A : \u2200 x, MultipleBirth x \u2192 SpendTimeWithSiblings x\n     axiom B : \u2200 x, HasSiblingBornTogether x \u2192 MultipleBirth x\n     axiom C : \u2200 x, ComplainAnnoyingSiblings x \u2192 HasSiblingBornTogether x\n     axiom D : \u2200 x, LiveAtHome x \u2192 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers x\n     axiom E : \u2200 x, SpendTimeWithSiblings x \u2192 LiveAtHome x\n     axiom F : (MultipleBirth Luke \u2227 LiveWithStrangers Luke) \u2228 (\u00acMultipleBirth Luke \u2227 \u00acLiveWithStrangers Luke)\n\n   Now, if we try to write:\n\n        theorem luke_complains : ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke := ...   -- we can't\n\n   We instead have a proof of the negation. But the problem does not ask for that.\n\n   So we cannot prove it? We can only prove the negation? That's fine, but that means we cannot prove the positive statement.\n\n   Therefore, we return Failure.\n\n   However, note: the disjunction F is not the only thing about Luke. We must also note the premise A, B, C, D, E are universally quantified. \n\n   But we see that the disjunction F leads to a contradiction with the universal premises if Luke were multiple birth? Actually, we found that the first branch leads to contradiction (without even considering the complaint) because:\n\n        If Luke is multiple birth, then we have:\n            by A: SpendTime -> by E: LiveAtHome -> by D: \u00acLiveWithStrangers\n        but the first branch says LiveWithStrangers -> contradiction.\n\n        So indeed, we can prove that the first branch is false? Then F forces the second branch: \u00acMultipleBirth and \u00acLiveWithStrangers.\n\n        Then with the complaint, we get: \n            complaint -> ... -> MultipleBirth -> which contradicts \u00acMultipleBirth.\n\n        So we can prove \u00acComplaint.\n\n        But again, we are asked for the complaint.\n\n   We cannot provide a proof of the complaint. So the code should just have the axioms and then state that we cannot prove ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke.\n\n   Therefore:\n\n        We'll write the axioms and then:\n\n          -- Cannot prove ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke\n\n   And then return Failure.\n\n   But note: we are allowed to use tactics? The problem says: \"by\" followed by tactics. However, in the failure example, they just have a comment.\n\n   We'll follow the failure example.\n\n   Let me write the Lean code:\n\n<lean>\naxiom obj : Type\n\n-- Predicates\naxiom ComplainAnnoyingSiblings : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom HasSiblingBornTogether : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom MultipleBirth : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom SpendTimeWithSiblings : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom LiveAtHome : obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom LiveWithStrangers : obj \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Constants\naxiom Luke : obj\n\n-- Axioms\naxiom A : \u2200 x : obj, MultipleBirth x \u2192 SpendTimeWithSiblings x\naxiom B : \u2200 x : obj, HasSiblingBornTogether x \u2192 MultipleBirth x\naxiom C : \u2200 x : obj, ComplainAnnoyingSiblings x \u2192 HasSiblingBornTogether x\naxiom D : \u2200 x : obj, LiveAtHome x \u2192 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers x\naxiom E : \u2200 x : obj, SpendTimeWithSiblings x \u2192 LiveAtHome x\naxiom F : (MultipleBirth Luke \u2227 LiveWithStrangers Luke) \u2228 (\u00ac MultipleBirth Luke \u2227 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers Luke)\n\n-- Let's try to prove that ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke is false to see that we can't prove it true.\n-- We do not need to write the proof of the negation because we are only required to see if the positive statement is provable.\n-- We find it is not, so:\n-- Cannot prove ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: Failure\n\nBut note: wait, the disjunction F is about Luke. And we have to use that information. Also, we can see that the first branch of F leads to a contradiction even without the complaint. So we can actually prove the second branch holds. Then we can also prove that MultipleBirth Luke is false, and then from the complaint we would get MultipleBirth Luke (by C and B), which would be a contradiction. Therefore, we can also prove the negation of the complaint. But again, we are only required to answer for the complaint (the positive statement). \n\nOur reasoning: the premises without the disjunction do not mention Luke. The disjunction is the only information about Luke. We cannot derive the complaint. So the conclusion (the complaint) does not follow. Therefore, we return Failure.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me see if we can write a proof of the complaint? We can't.

Or we can have a single type for everything? Since we are dealing with events and places, it might be simpler to have two types.\n\n But note: The statement is about the world championships being a sporting event. The context only says that the summer Olympic games is a sporting event.\n\n We have no axiom that says anything about the world championships.\n\n Therefore, we cannot prove that the world championships is a sporting event.\n\n Let's formalize:\n\n We introduce:\n  - `Event` : a type for events.\n  - `Place` : a type for places? But note that Tokyo is a place, but the events are also entities.\n\n Alternatively, we can have a single type `entity` for everything?

Actually, it was at the summer Olympic games held in Tokyo. So we might need to relate the event and the place.\n\n Alternatively, we can interpret \"in Tokyo\" as at the event that was held in Tokyo? But we have only one event mentioned: the summer Olympic games.\n\n So we can have:\n  `axiom T2 : LastHeldIn SummerOlympicGames Tokyo`\n  `axiom T3 : WonMostMedals UnitedStates SummerOlympicGames`   -- because the winning was at the summer Olympic games (which was in Tokyo, but the winning is attached to the event).\n\n But note: the context says \"in Tokyo\", but we don't have an explicit connection between the event and the place for the winning. However, it is clear from the context that the winning occurred at the event held in Tokyo.

All well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens.\n   \u2200x (at mixer \u2227 WellPaid x) \u2192 LivesInTaxHaven x\n\n8. Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.\n   This is a bit tricky. It says:\n      Djokovic is at the mixer.\n      And then a conditional: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.\n   But note: the conditional is only about Djokovic. Also, note that the conditional is given as a fact because it is stated after the colon.\n\n   So we have:\n      T8: Djokovic is at the mixer.\n      R8: (Famous Djokovic \u2227 Athlete Djokovic) \u2192 WellPaid Djokovic\n\nHowever, note that from the context, we have two paths for Djokovic:\n\nPath 1: Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion -> then he is a professional tennis player -> then an athlete -> then famous.\nPath 2: Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor -> then a celebrity -> then well paid.\n\nBut we also have an additional condition (R8) specific to Djokovic: if he is a famous athlete then he is well paid.\n\nOur goal: to prove that Djokovic lives in a tax haven.\n\nTo live in a tax haven, we need Djokovic to be well paid and at the mixer (from axiom 7).\n\nSo we need to show WellPaid Djokovic.\n\nHow can we get WellPaid Djokovic?\n\nOption 1: If Djokovic is a celebrity (from being an Oscar-nominated actor) then by axiom 5, he is well paid.\n\nOption 2: If Djokovic is an athlete and famous (by axiom 6) and then by the specific rule R8, he becomes well paid? But note: R8 says if he is a famous athlete then he is well paid. However, if he is an athlete, then by axiom 6 he is famous. So if Djokovic is an athlete, then he is both famous and an athlete, hence by R8 he is well paid.\n\nBut note: we have two disjoint paths? Actually, Djokovic could be both? The context says \"or\", but it doesn't say exclusive or. So Djokovic could be both a Grand Slam champion and an Oscar-nominated actor? However, the axioms don't preclude that.\n\nBut let's see: if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, then he becomes an athlete (via professional tennis player) and then famous. Then by R8 (since he is a famous athlete) he becomes well paid.\n\nIf he is an Oscar-nominated actor, then he becomes a celebrity and then well paid.\n\nBut what if he is both? Then we have two ways to get well paid.\n\nSo in any case, we can get WellPaid Djokovic.\n\nBut wait: what if he is only a Grand Slam champion? Then we have:\n  GrandSlamChampion Djokovic -> ProfessionalTennisPlayer Djokovic -> Athlete Djokovic -> Famous Djokovic.\nThen by R8: since he is a famous athlete, he is well paid.\n\nWhat if he is only an Oscar-nominated actor?\n  OscarNominatedActor Djokovic -> Celebrity Djokovic -> WellPaid Djokovic.\n\nWhat if he is both? Then we have both paths.\n\nTherefore, in every case, Djokovic is well paid.\n\nThen by axiom 7: WellPaid Djokovic and at the mixer -> LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic.\n\nSo the statement is true.\n\nNow, let's formalize in Lean.\n\nWe'll define:\n  obj : Type\n  Djokovic : obj\n  IsAtMixer : obj \u2192 Prop\n  GrandSlamChampion : obj \u2192 Prop\n  OscarNominatedActor : obj \u2192 Prop\n  ProfessionalTennisPlayer : obj \u2192 Prop\n  Celebrity : obj \u2192 Prop\n  Athlete : obj \u2192 Prop\n  WellPaid : obj \u2192 Prop\n  Famous : obj \u2192 Prop\n  LivesInTaxHaven : obj \u2192 Prop\n\nAxioms:\n\nA1: \u2200x, IsAtMixer x \u2192 (GrandSlamChampion x \u2228 OscarNominatedActor x)\nA2: \u2200x, IsAtMixer x \u2227 GrandSlamChampion x \u2192 ProfessionalTennisPlayer x\nA3: \u2200x, IsAtMixer x \u2227 OscarNominatedActor x \u2192 Celebrity x\nA4: \u2200x, IsAtMixer x \u2227 ProfessionalTennisPlayer x \u2192 Athlete x\nA5: \u2200x, IsAtMixer x \u2227 Celebrity x \u2192 WellPaid x\nA6: \u2200x, IsAtMixer x \u2227 Athlete x \u2192 Famous x\nA7: \u2200x, IsAtMixer x \u2227 WellPaid x \u2192 LivesInTaxHaven x\nA8: IsAtMixer Djokovic\nA9: (Famous Djokovic \u2227 Athlete Djokovic) \u2192 WellPaid Djokovic   [This is the specific rule for Djokovic]\n\nWe want to prove: LivesInTaxHaven Djokovic.\n\nWe'll break it down:\n\nWe know Djokovic is at the mixer (A8).

Let me read: \n   \"Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.\"\n This seems to be two statements:\n   1. Djokovic is at the mixer.\n   2. If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.\n\n However, note that the second part is conditional on being a famous athlete. Since we have Djokovic at the mixer, and we know that if he is an athlete then he is famous (from the premise: \"If a person at the mixer is an athlete, then they are famous\") \u2014 but that applies to anyone at the mixer. Similarly, we have that he might be either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.\n\n The statement we are to evaluate: \"Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.\"\n\n We are to prove that this follows from the premises? Or rather, we are to check if it must be true?\n\n Let me think: We don't necessarily have enough to force Djokovic to be a Grand Slam champion. He could be an Oscar-nominated actor.\n\n However, note that the last premise says: \"if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid\". But that conditional might be redundant because from the general rules we have:\n   - If he is an athlete (and hence famous by the other rule) then he is well-paid? But note: the rule for athletes is they are famous, and for celebrities they are well-paid. But Djokovic might be an athlete but not a celebrity? Actually, he can't be both? We have two disjoint paths?\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Suppose Djokovic is at the mixer. Then he is either:\n   (A) a Grand Slam champion or \n   (B) an Oscar-nominated actor.\n\n Case A: If he is a Grand Slam champion, then:\n   - He is a professional tennis player (by the second premise), \n   - then an athlete (by the fourth premise), \n   - then famous (from the rule for athletes).\n\n   But note: do we have that athletes are well paid? The premises say:\n     - For an athlete: they are famous.\n     - For a celebrity: they are well paid.\n\n   There's no direct link from athlete to well paid? However, note the conditional about Djokovic: \n        \"if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid\"\n\n   In this case, Djokovic is a famous athlete (because he is an athlete and hence famous). So then by the conditional, he is well paid.\n\n   But also note: we have a general rule that all well-paid people at the mixer live in tax havens. But that doesn't affect this.\n\n   However, we are to check the statement \"Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion\" \u2014 in case A, yes, by assumption.\n\n Case B: If he is an Oscar-nominated actor, then:\n   - He is a celebrity (by the third premise),\n   - then well paid (by the fifth premise),\n   - and then lives in a tax haven.\n\n   But note, being a celebrity does not make him an athlete? So we don't have the condition for being a famous athlete? The conditional about Djokovic says: \n        if he is a famous athlete, then he is well paid. \n\n   In this case, he is not an athlete (we have no information that an Oscar-nominated actor is an athlete) so the antecedent is false? Then the conditional is true regardless.\n\n   But the problem is: we cannot conclude that in case B, Djokovic is NOT a Grand Slam champion? Actually, we don't have any contradiction. So Djokovic could be an Oscar-nominated actor? Then he is a celebrity, well paid, but not an athlete? Then he is not a Grand Slam champion.\n\n Therefore, the statement \"Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion\" is not necessarily true? He could be the Oscar-nominated actor.\n\n However, let us check the premise again: the conditional about Djokovic is specific. But note that in case B, we do not trigger that conditional because he is not an athlete? So that premise is satisfied (trivially true) in case B.\n\n Therefore, from the premises, we cannot conclude that Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.\n\n But wait: let me read the last premise again: \n    \"Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.\"\n\n Is this an additional fact? Or is it a conditional that we must take as an axiom? And is it redundant?\n\n The conclusion: The statement to evaluate is \"Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion\" \u2014 we cannot prove it from the premises.\n\n However, note that in case A (Grand Slam champion) we get that Djokovic is a famous athlete and then by the conditional he is well paid. But in case B (Oscar-nominated actor) we don't have him being an athlete so the conditional doesn't apply. And we also don't have that he is not a Grand Slam champion. So the two cases are possible.\n\n Therefore, the answer should be Failure.\n\n But let me think: is there any contradiction that forces Djokovic to be a Grand Slam champion?\n\n Let's try to see if the premises force that if Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor then he is also an athlete? No.\n\n Also, note that the premises do not say that someone cannot be both? But in the first premise, it says \"or\". That could be inclusive? However, we are not told that the categories are exclusive.\n\n However, even if it is inclusive, it doesn't force the exclusive case. For example, if Djokovic is both, then he would be both an athlete (from the Grand Slam champion path) and a celebrity (from the Oscar path). But then we don't get a contradiction? And we cannot conclude that he must be exclusively a Grand Slam champion? Actually, the statement we are evaluating is \"Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion\" \u2014 and if he is both, then he is one. So then it would be true? But we are not forced into that scenario.\n\n However, the point is: we don't know Djokovic is both. We have no evidence that he is both. He could be only an Oscar-nominated actor, and not a Grand Slam champion? So then the statement would be false.\n\n Therefore, we cannot prove that Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.\n\n So the answer is Failure.\n\n But note: the problem says \"if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid\". Is it possible that in the Oscar-nominated actor case, Djokovic could also be an athlete by some other means? The rules only define that Grand Slam champions become athletes? So if he is not a Grand Slam champion (but an Oscar-nominated actor) then we don't have any rule that makes him an athlete? Therefore, he would not be an athlete? So the conditional about Djokovic is never used in case B? And we have no contradiction.\n\n Hence, we cannot prove Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.\n\n However, let me formalize to see if there might be a hidden implication.\n\n In Lean, we will define the types and axioms.\n\n Steps:\n   - Define a type `Person`.\n   - Since we are talking about people at the mixer, we have Djokovic as a constant.\n   - We are mainly concerned with properties of people at the mixer? But note, the premises are about people at the mixer.\n\n However, we can define:\n\n   axiom mixer : Person \u2192 Prop   (to say who is at the mixer)\n\n But note the context: \"Everyone at the mixer ...\" so all our premises are restricted to the mixer.\n\n Let me define:\n\n   variable Person : Type\n\n We have:\n   axiom Premise1 : \u2200 p, mixer p \u2192 (GrandSlamChampion p \u2228 OscarNominatedActor p)\n   axiom Premise2 : \u2200 p, mixer p \u2192 GrandSlamChampion p \u2192 ProfessionalTennisPlayer p\n   axiom Premise3 : \u2200 p, mixer p \u2192 OscarNominatedActor p \u2192 Celebrity p\n   axiom Premise4 : \u2200 p, mixer p \u2192 ProfessionalTennisPlayer p \u2192 Athlete p\n   axiom Premise5 : \u2200 p, mixer p \u2192 Celebrity p \u2192 WellPaid p\n   axiom Premise6 : \u2200 p, mixer p \u2192 Athlete p \u2192 Famous p\n   axiom Premise7 : \u2200 p, mixer p \u2192 WellPaid p \u2192 LivesInTaxHaven p\n\n   We also have:\n     Djokovic is at the mixer: mixer Djokovic\n     and the conditional: Athlete Djokovic \u2227 Famous Djokovic \u2192 WellPaid Djokovic\n\n But note: from Premise6, if Djokovic is an athlete, then he is famous. So the condition for the conditional (famous athlete) is equivalent to just being an athlete? Because if he is an athlete then he is famous. So the conditional becomes: \n        if (Athlete Djokovic) then WellPaid Djokovic.\n\n However, in the case of an athlete (through being a Grand Slam champion) we might already have the well-paid by the general rule? Not necessarily: because the general rule says that if you are a celebrity then you are well paid, but an athlete is not necessarily a celebrity? \n\n But in our setup:\n     If Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, then along the chain: \n         GrandSlamChampion Djokovic \u2192 ProfessionalTennisPlayer Djokovic \u2192 Athlete Djokovic \u2192 Famous Djokovic.\n     And then the conditional says: if he is a famous athlete (which he is) then well paid. So we have WellPaid Djokovic.\n\n     However, if Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor, then:\n         OscarNominatedActor Djokovic \u2192 Celebrity Djokovic \u2192 WellPaid Djokovic.\n\n     So in both cases, he ends up well paid? But note: the conditional about Djokovic is redundant in case A? But in case B, we get well paid without the conditional? \n\n     Therefore, the conditional doesn't add any new information? It might be redundant? Because both paths lead to well paid. \n\n     But does that force Djokovic to be a Grand Slam champion? No, because he could be an Oscar-nominated actor.\n\n     So what is the purpose of the conditional? Actually, it might be redundant because in both cases we have that Djokovic is well paid? But we don't need it? \n\n     Therefore, we still have two possibilities: Grand Slam champion vs Oscar-nominated actor.\n\n Thus, we cannot prove Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.\n\n So we will write the Lean code and then say Failure.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid\". But in the Oscar-nominated actor case, he isn't an athlete? So the conditional is not used? And we don't have a contradiction? \n\n Lean code:\n\n Let's define the types and axioms accordingly.\n\n We are not going to use the", "prediction": null, "parse_status": "EMPTY", "lean_code": null, "lean_verification": null, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 542, "completion_tokens": 2551, "total_tokens": 3093}}, {"iteration": 2, "llm_response": "<lean>\naxiom Person : Type\naxiom Djokovic : Person\naxiom AtMixer : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom GrandSlamChampion : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom OscarNominatedActor : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom ProfessionalTennisPlayer : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom Celebrity : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom Athlete : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom Famous : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom WellPaid : Person \u2192 Prop\n\n-- Context axioms\naxiom A1 : \u2200 x, AtMixer x \u2192 GrandSlamChampion x \u2228 OscarNominatedActor x\naxiom A2 : \u2200 x, AtMixer x \u2192 GrandSlamChampion x \u2192 ProfessionalTennisPlayer x\naxiom A3 : \u2200 x, AtMixer x \u2192 OscarNominatedActor x \u2192 Celebrity x\naxiom A4 : \u2200 x, AtMixer x \u2192 ProfessionalTennisPlayer x \u2192 Athlete x\naxiom A5 : \u2200 x, AtMixer x \u2192 Celebrity x \u2192 WellPaid x\naxiom A6 : \u2200 x, AtMixer x \u2192 Athlete x \u2192 Famous x\naxiom A7 : \u2200 x, AtMixer x \u2192 WellPaid x \u2192 True  -- Placeholder for tax haven (not used)\naxiom A8 : AtMixer Djokovic\naxiom A9 : (Famous Djokovic \u2227 Athlete Djokovic) \u2192 WellPaid Djokovic\n\n-- Attempt to prove Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion\ntheorem goal : GrandSlamChampion Djokovic := by\n  have h_cases := A1 Djokovic A8  -- Djokovic is GSC or ONA\n  cases h_cases with\n  | inl h_gsc => exact h_gsc  -- Case 1: He is GSC (immediate)\n  | inr h_ona => \n      -- Case 2: He is ONA \u2192 Celebrity \u2192 WellPaid\n      have h_celeb := A3 Djokovic A8 h_ona\n      have h_wellpaid := A5 Djokovic A8 h_celeb\n      -- No path to derive GSC from ONA/WellPaid\n      sorry  -- Stuck: Cannot prove GSC from Oscar-nominated actor branch\n</lean>\n\nANSWER: Failure", "reasoning_content": "We are given a context and a statement to evaluate: \"Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.\"\n We need to represent the context in Lean and then try to prove the statement.\n\n Steps:\n 1.

[This might not be needed for the current conclusion?]\n   - Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid. [Note: This is a bit confusing. Let me parse it.]\n\n Actually, the last premise says: \"Djokovic is at the mixer: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.\"\n But note: the context says \"Djokovic is at the mixer\", and then separately we have a conditional: \"if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid.\"\n\n However, we are trying to prove: \"Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.\"\n\n Let me break down the premises:\n\n   A1: \u2200x at mixer, (GrandSlamChampion x \u2228 OscarNominatedActor x)\n   A2: \u2200x at mixer, GrandSlamChampion x \u2192 ProfessionalTennisPlayer x\n   A3: \u2200x at mixer, OscarNominatedActor x \u2192 Celebrity x\n   A4: \u2200x at mixer, ProfessionalTennisPlayer x \u2192 Athlete x\n   A5: \u2200x at mixer, Celebrity x \u2192 WellPaid x\n   A6: \u2200x at mixer, Athlete x \u2192 Famous x\n   A7: \u2200x at mixer, WellPaid x \u2192 LivesInTaxHaven x   [This may not be needed for our current goal]\n   A8: Djokovic is at the mixer.\n   A9: If Djokovic is a famous athlete, then Djokovic is well-paid. [Note: This is a specific statement about Djokovic]\n\n However, note that A9 is redundant? Because from A6 and A4 and A2 we might derive that if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion then he is an athlete and then famous? But wait, we don't know if he is a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.\n\n Approach:\n\n   We know Djokovic is at the mixer (A8). So by A1, he is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.\n\n   Case 1: If he is a Grand Slam champion, then we are done.\n\n   Case 2: If he is an Oscar-nominated actor, then by A3 he is a celebrity, then by A5 he is well paid. Also, from being an Oscar-nominated actor, we don't have a direct path to athlete? So he might not be an athlete? \n\n   But note: we have A9: if Djokovic is a famous athlete, then he is well paid. However, in the OscarNominatedActor case, we don't have any information that he is an athlete. So we cannot conclude that he is an athlete.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot force the case that he must be a Grand Slam champion? \n\n   However, note that the goal is to prove that he is a Grand Slam champion. We don't have any contradiction if he is an Oscar-nominated actor? So we cannot prove that he is a Grand Slam champion.\n\n   But wait: is there any connection that might force Djokovic to be an athlete even if he is an Oscar-nominated actor? The context does not say that Oscar-nominated actors are also athletes. So no.\n\n   Also, note that A9 is a conditional: if Djokovic is a famous athlete then he is well paid. But if he is an Oscar-nominated actor, he is well paid (via celebrity) regardless of being an athlete? So A9 might be redundant? \n\n   However, the problem is: we have two cases. In the Grand Slam case, we are done. In the Oscar case, we don't get a contradiction, but we also don't get that he is a Grand Slam champion.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot prove that Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.\n\n   But let me double-check: is there any other premise that might link Oscar-nominated actors to being athletes? No.\n\n   Also, note that the conclusion we are asked to evaluate is \"Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion\", which we cannot prove because he might be an Oscar-nominated actor.\n\n   However, wait: what if we try to use A9? Suppose we assume Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor. Then he is a celebrity (A3) and then well paid (A5). But A9 says: if he is a famous athlete, then he is well paid. That doesn't contradict because he is well paid already? \n\n   But note: A9 doesn't say anything about when he is not a famous athlete. So it doesn't force anything.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot prove that Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.\n\n   So the answer should be Failure.\n\n   However, let me consider if there is a way to derive a contradiction in the Oscar-nominated actor case? We don't have any premise that says that a person cannot be both? But the context doesn't say that the categories are exclusive? Actually, the first premise says \"or\", which is inclusive. So Djokovic could be both? But that doesn't help because we still don't know which one he is.\n\n   Alternatively, if we assume he is an Oscar-nominated actor, then we can derive that he is well paid (via celebrity). But we don't have any requirement that he must be an athlete? And A9 doesn't require him to be an athlete? So no contradiction.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot prove that Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.\n\n   Now, let me write the Lean code accordingly.\n\n   We'll define:\n     - `Person` as a type (we don't need a separate type for mixer attendees because we can use a predicate `AtMixer`)\n     - Predicates:\n        AtMixer : Person \u2192 Prop\n        GrandSlamChampion : Person \u2192 Prop\n        OscarNominatedActor : Person \u2192 Prop\n        ProfessionalTennisPlayer : Person \u2192 Prop\n        Celebrity : Person \u2192 Prop\n        Athlete : Person \u2192 Prop\n        Famous : Person \u2192 Prop\n        WellPaid : Person \u2192 Prop\n        LivesInTaxHaven : Person \u2192 Prop   [though not needed]\n\n   Constants:\n        Djokovic : Person\n\n   Axioms:\n        A1: \u2200x, AtMixer x \u2192 GrandSlamChampion x \u2228 OscarNominatedActor x\n        A2: \u2200x, AtMixer x \u2192 GrandSlamChampion x \u2192 ProfessionalTennisPlayer x\n        A3: \u2200x, AtMixer x \u2192 OscarNominatedActor x \u2192 Celebrity x\n        A4: \u2200x, AtMixer x \u2192 ProfessionalTennisPlayer x \u2192 Athlete x\n        A5: \u2200x, AtMixer x \u2192 Celebrity x \u2192 WellPaid x\n        A6: \u2200x, AtMixer x \u2192 Athlete x \u2192 Famous x\n        A7: \u2200x, AtMixer x \u2192 WellPaid x \u2192 LivesInTaxHaven x   [we won't use it]\n        A8: AtMixer Djokovic\n        A9: (Famous Djokovic \u2227 Athlete Djokovic) \u2192 WellPaid Djokovic   [Note: the premise says \"if Djokovic is a famous athlete\", meaning both famous and athlete?]\n\n   However, note: the premise says \"if Djokovic is a famous athlete\", which I interpret as \"if Djokovic is famous and an athlete\". \n\n   Now, we try to prove `GrandSlamChampion Djokovic`.\n\n   We know from A1 and A8 that:\n        GrandSlamChampion Djokovic \u2228 OscarNominatedActor Djokovic\n\n   We can do case analysis.\n\n   Case 1: GrandSlamChampion Djokovic -> done.\n\n   Case 2: OscarNominatedActor Djokovic.\n        Then by A3 (with A8) we have Celebrity Djokovic.\n        Then by A5 (with A8) we have WellPaid Djokovic.\n\n        But we don't have any information that would force Djokovic to be an athlete? \n        In fact, from OscarNominatedActor, we don't get ProfessionalTennisPlayer?

Actually, being born in a multiple birth means they have siblings (by definition, multiples are siblings). \n        But note: the context does not explicitly define that being born in a multiple birth implies having siblings born together? Actually, if you are born in a multiple birth, then your siblings (the other multiples) were born together with you.\n\n        Let me re-read:\n        - \"People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings\" -> redundant? Actually, being born in a multiple birth implies having siblings (the other children in the same birth). So we can assume:\n          BornMultiple x \u2192 HasSiblingsBornTogether x   [because the siblings were born together in that birth]\n\n        But the second sentence: \"If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.\" \n          HasSiblingsBornTogether x \u2192 BornMultiple x\n\n        So actually, these two are equivalent? \n\n        However, note: the first sentence does not explicitly say that being born in a multiple birth implies having siblings born together? It says they spend time with siblings, implying they have siblings. But the second sentence gives the converse.\n\n        Let me formalize:\n\n        A1: \u2200 x, BornMultiple x \u2192 HasSiblingsBornTogether x   [because if you are born in a multiple birth, then you have siblings born together (the multiples)]\n        A2: \u2200 x, HasSiblingsBornTogether x \u2192 BornMultiple x   [given]\n\n        Therefore, we can actually prove that `BornMultiple x \u2194 HasSiblingsBornTogether x`.\n\n        But wait: the first sentence does not explicitly state that being born in a multiple birth implies having siblings born together? It says they spend time with siblings. However, the context of multiple birth inherently means siblings born together.\n\n        Given the second sentence, we have A2. And the first sentence doesn't directly give A1? Actually, the first sentence says \"born in a multiple birth with siblings\" which implies that being born in a multiple birth means having siblings (and they were born together). So we can take:\n\n        A1: \u2200 x, BornMultiple x \u2192 HasSiblingsBornTogether x   [implicit from the first sentence?]\n\n        However, the problem says: \"If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.\" (A2)\n\n        And then: \"If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.\" \n          A3: \u2200 x, ComplainAnnoyingSiblings x \u2192 HasSiblingsBornTogether x\n\n        Also: \"If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.\"\n          A4: \u2200 x, LiveAtHome x \u2192 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers x\n\n        And: \"If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often live at home.\"\n          Let `SpendTimeWithSiblings (x : obj) : Prop` for spending a lot of time hanging out with and playing with siblings.\n          Then: A5: \u2200 x, SpendTimeWithSiblings x \u2192 LiveAtHome x\n\n        But note: the first sentence says: \"People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\"\n          This is: \u2200 x, BornMultiple x \u2192 SpendTimeWithSiblings x\n\n        Now, about Luke:\n          \"Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and live with strangers, or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.\"\n\n          We don't have a predicate for \"baby\", but note: the context doesn't use \"baby\" elsewhere. Probably we can ignore \"baby\" and focus on the birth and living.\n\n          So: \n            (BornMultiple Luke \u2227 LiveWithStrangers Luke) \u2228 (\u00ac BornMultiple Luke \u2227 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers Luke)\n\n        Statement to evaluate: \n          Luke is neither born in a multiple birth nor complains often about annoying siblings.\n          This is: \u00ac BornMultiple Luke \u2227 \u00ac ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke\n\n        We want to know if this statement follows from the premises.\n\n        Let's denote:\n          B : BornMultiple\n          H : HasSiblingsBornTogether\n          C : ComplainAnnoyingSiblings\n          Lh : LiveAtHome\n          Ls : LiveWithStrangers\n          S : SpendTimeWithSiblings\n\n        Axioms:\n          A1: \u2200 x, B x \u2192 S x   [from first sentence]\n          A2: \u2200 x, H x \u2192 B x   [second sentence]  -> note: actually the second sentence says: if they have siblings born together then they were born in multiple birth -> H x \u2192 B x\n          A3: \u2200 x, C x \u2192 H x   [third sentence]\n          A4: \u2200 x, Lh x \u2192 \u00ac Ls x\n          A5: \u2200 x, S x \u2192 Lh x\n\n          And for Luke: \n            (B Luke \u2227 Ls Luke) \u2228 (\u00ac B Luke \u2227 \u00ac Ls Luke)\n\n        We wish to prove: \u00ac B Luke \u2227 \u00ac C Luke\n\n        How to proceed?\n\n        Note: from A1 and A5, we have that if B x then S x and then Lh x, and then by A4, \u00ac Ls x.\n\n        So: B x \u2192 \u00ac Ls x.\n\n        Now, look at the disjunction for Luke:\n\n          Case 1: (B Luke \u2227 Ls Luke)\n            Then we have B Luke \u2192 \u00ac Ls Luke, so we get \u00ac Ls Luke. But we also have Ls Luke. Contradiction.\n\n          Case 2: (\u00ac B Luke \u2227 \u00ac Ls Luke)\n            Then we have \u00ac B Luke, which is part of the desired conclusion.\n\n        So in Case 1 we get a contradiction, meaning that Case 1 is impossible. Therefore, only Case 2 holds: \u00ac B Luke and \u00ac Ls Luke.\n\n        Now we need to show \u00ac C Luke.\n\n        From \u00ac B Luke and A2 (which says H x \u2192 B x), we have by contrapositive: \u00ac B Luke \u2192 \u00ac H Luke, so \u00ac H Luke.\n\n        From A3: C Luke \u2192 H Luke. So by contrapositive: \u00ac H Luke \u2192 \u00ac C Luke.\n\n        Therefore, \u00ac C Luke.\n\n        Hence, we have \u00ac B Luke and \u00ac C Luke.\n\n        Therefore, the statement is true.\n\n        Let's formalize in Lean.\n\n        We'll define:\n          SpendTimeWithSiblings : obj \u2192 Prop   (for spending a lot of time with siblings)\n\n        And the axioms accordingly.\n\n        Note: We don't need the equivalence of B and H? We have:\n          A2: \u2200 x, H x \u2192 B x\n          And we also have from the first sentence: \u2200 x, B x \u2192 H x? Actually, the first sentence doesn't explicitly say that. It says that if born in multiple birth then they spend time with siblings (S x). But note: the first sentence says \"born in a multiple birth with siblings\" - but that doesn't explicitly state that they have siblings born together? \n\n        However, the context of multiple birth inherently means that there are siblings born together. Moreover, the second sentence says that having siblings born together implies being born in a multiple birth. So we might assume that B x \u2194 H x? \n\n        But wait: the problem does not explicitly say that being born in a multiple birth implies having siblings born together? It only says the converse.\n\n        However, the first sentence: \"People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings ...\" - the phrase \"with siblings\" might be redundant? Actually, if you are born in a multiple birth, you have siblings (the other multiples). And they were born together. So we can safely assume:\n\n          A1_bis: \u2200 x, B x \u2192 H x\n\n        But note: the problem does not state that explicitly. Let me reread:\n\n          \"People who are born in a multiple birth with siblings spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\"\n\n          This does not say that being born in a multiple birth implies having siblings born together? It says that if you are born in a multiple birth and have siblings (which is always true in a multiple birth) then you spend time with them.\n\n          Actually, the phrase \"born in a multiple birth\" already implies having siblings? So we can interpret:\n\n          A1: \u2200 x, B x \u2192 S x\n\n          But we also need to connect B and H? We have:\n\n          A2: \u2200 x, H x \u2192 B x   [explicit]\n\n          And from the third sentence: A3: \u2200 x, C x \u2192 H x\n\n          Now, is there a way to get H x from B x? \n\n          Consider: if x is born in a multiple birth (B x), then by the nature of multiple birth, x has siblings who were born together (H x). So we can add:\n\n          A6: \u2200 x, B x \u2192 H x\n\n          However, the problem does not explicitly state this. But note: the second sentence says the converse. And without A6, we cannot complete the proof.\n\n          Let me check: without A6, can we prove the conclusion?\n\n          We have for Luke: \u00ac B Luke (from the disjunction). Then we want to show \u00ac C Luke.\n\n          We have A3: C Luke \u2192 H Luke. And A2: H Luke \u2192 B Luke. So C Luke \u2192 B Luke. Therefore, \u00ac B Luke \u2192 \u00ac C Luke. So we don't need A6 for the conclusion about Luke.\n\n          Therefore, we can avoid assuming A6.\n\n        So we don't need A6 for the proof.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          We have:\n            (B Luke \u2227 Ls Luke) \u2228 (\u00ac B Luke \u2227 \u00ac Ls Luke)\n\n          We also have:\n            A1: \u2200 x, B x \u2192 S x\n            A5: \u2200 x, S x \u2192 Lh x\n            A4: \u2200 x, Lh x \u2192 \u00ac Ls x\n\n          Therefore, for any x, B x \u2192 \u00ac Ls x.\n\n          Now, for Luke:\n            Case 1: B Luke \u2227 Ls Luke\n              Then we have B Luke \u2192 \u00ac Ls Luke, so \u00ac Ls Luke. But we have Ls Luke -> contradiction.\n            Case 2: \u00ac B Luke \u2227 \u00ac Ls Luke\n              Then we have \u00ac B Luke.\n\n          Since Case 1 leads to contradiction, we must be in Case 2: \u00ac B Luke and \u00ac Ls Luke.\n\n          Now, we wish to show \u00ac C Luke.\n\n          We have:\n            A3: \u2200 x, C x \u2192 H x\n            A2: \u2200 x, H x \u2192 B x\n\n          So: C Luke \u2192 H Luke \u2192 B Luke.\n\n          Therefore, \u00ac B Luke \u2192 \u00ac C Luke.\n\n          Hence, \u00ac C Luke.\n\n          Therefore, \u00ac B Luke \u2227 \u00ac C Luke.\n\n        So the statement is true.\n\n        Let's write the Lean code accordingly.\n\n        We define:\n          obj : Type\n          Luke : obj\n\n          BornMultiple : obj \u2192 Prop\n          HasSiblingsBornTogether : obj \u2192 Prop\n          ComplainAnnoyingSiblings : obj \u2192 Prop\n          LiveAtHome : obj \u2192 Prop\n          LiveWithStrangers : obj \u2192 Prop\n          SpendTimeWithSiblings : obj \u2192 Prop   [for the first axiom]\n\n        Axioms:\n          A1: \u2200 x, BornMultiple x \u2192 SpendTimeWithSiblings x\n          A2: \u2200 x, HasSiblingsBornTogether x \u2192 BornMultiple x\n          A3: \u2200 x, ComplainAnnoyingSiblings x \u2192 HasSiblingsBornTogether x\n          A4: \u2200 x, LiveAtHome x \u2192 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers x\n          A5: \u2200 x, SpendTimeWithSiblings x \u2192 LiveAtHome x\n          Luke_disj : (BornMultiple Luke \u2227 LiveWithStrangers Luke) \u2228 (\u00ac BornMultiple Luke \u2227 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers Luke)\n\n        Theorem: \u00ac BornMultiple Luke \u2227 \u00ac ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke\n\n        Proof:\n\n          We'll split the disjunction and handle each case.\n\n        In Lean:\n\n          We'll use cases on Luke_disj.\n\n          Case 1: h1 : BornMultiple Luke \u2227 LiveWithStrangers Luke\n            Then we have hB := h1.1 and hLs := h1.2.\n            From A1: SpendTimeWithSiblings Luke (by A1 Luke hB)\n            Then LiveAtHome Luke (by A5 Luke ...)\n            Then \u00ac LiveWithStrangers Luke (by A4 Luke ...)\n            This contradicts hLs.\n\n          Case 2: h2 : \u00ac BornMultiple Luke \u2227 \u00ac LiveWithStrangers Luke\n            Then we have h_notB := h2.1.\n            We need to show \u00ac ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke.\n            Suppose (by contradiction) hC: ComplainAnnoyingSiblings Luke.\n            Then by A3: HasSiblingsBornTogether Luke (A3 Luke hC)\n            Then by A2: BornMultiple Luke (A2 Luke ...) which contradicts h_notB.\n\n          Therefore, both cases lead to the desired conclusion?

But note: we are proving a conjunction. However, in Case 1 we have a contradiction so we can prove the entire goal by exfalso? But the goal is a conjunction. Alternatively, we can split the goal into two and handle each case.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          have no_case1 : \u00ac (BornMultiple Luke \u2227 LiveWithStrangers Luke) := by\n

In fact, the premises imply the opposite.\n\n Therefore, we cannot prove the statement to evaluate (that the last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo) from the given premises.\n\n However, let me clarify: the problem says \"Statement to evaluate\". We are to determine if this statement is true (i.e., follows from the premises). But the premises directly contradict it.\n\n So we should try to model the situation and see if we can prove the negation.\n\n Approach:\n\n We'll define:\n   - A type for entities: `obj`\n   - We have a specific object for the summer Olympic games? Actually, note: the context says \"The summer Olympic games is a sporting event.\" and then talks about the last one.\n\n But note: the context refers to \"the last summer Olympic games\". So we might need:\n   - A predicate for being a sporting event: `SportingEvent : obj \u2192 Prop`\n   - We also have a specific object for Tokyo: `Tokyo : obj`\n   - And we have the last summer Olympic games as an object? Let's call it `lastSummerOlympics : obj`\n\n Alternatively, we can model \"the last summer Olympic games\" as a specific object, and then we have:\n\n   axiom lastSummerOlympics : obj\n   axiom SportingEvent : obj \u2192 Prop\n   axiom T1 : SportingEvent lastSummerOlympics   -- from \"The summer Olympic games is a sporting event\" (but note: it says \"the summer Olympic games\" in general, but then we have the last one. We might need to interpret)\n\n However, note the context says \"The summer Olympic games is a sporting event.\" This seems to be a general statement. But then it says \"The last summer Olympic games ...\". So we have a specific instance.\n\n Actually, let me break down:\n\n   Premise 1: The summer Olympic games is a sporting event. \n        This might be interpreted as: every summer Olympic games is a sporting event? Or that the concept is? But note, the context then refers to a particular one: the last one.\n\n   We can model:\n        We have a type `Game` for Olympic games? Or we can have a predicate `IsSummerOlympics : obj \u2192 Prop` and then `SportingEvent` applies to objects that are summer olympics.\n\n   Alternatively, we can have:\n        `obj` as the type of things.\n        `Tokyo : obj`\n        `lastSummerOlympics : obj`   -- representing the last summer Olympic games\n        `Location : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop`  -- meaning the first argument is an event held in the second (a location)\n\n   Then:\n        Premise 1: We don't actually need it for the statement about location? The statement to evaluate is only about the location of the last summer olympics.\n\n        Premise 2: The last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo. -> `Location lastSummerOlympics Tokyo`\n\n        Premise 3: The United States won the most medals in Tokyo. -> This seems irrelevant to the location of the last summer olympics.\n\n   The statement to evaluate: The last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo -> `\u00ac Location lastSummerOlympics Tokyo`\n\n   But from premise 2 we have `Location lastSummerOlympics Tokyo`, so we cannot prove `\u00ac Location lastSummerOlympics Tokyo`. In fact, we can prove the opposite.\n\n   Therefore, the statement to evaluate does not follow from the premises. It is false given the premises.\n\n   So we should output Failure because we cannot prove the statement (we can prove its negation).\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Statement to evaluate: The last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo.\" and we are to prove that this statement follows from the premises? It does not.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot prove it. So we output Failure.\n\n   But wait: the example outputs \"True\" only when we can prove the statement. Here we cannot prove the statement (because it is false) so we output Failure.\n\n   However, let me read the instructions again: \"I want you to try to PROVE that the conclusion is TRUE (follows from the premises).\"\n\n   The conclusion is the statement to evaluate: \"The last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo\". We cannot prove it because the premises say it was in Tokyo.\n\n   Therefore, we output Failure.\n\n   But note: there is a nuance. The premises include that the last summer olympics was in Tokyo, so we can prove that the statement to evaluate is false. However, the task is to prove the statement to evaluate (which is the negation) is true. Since we cannot prove the statement to evaluate, we output Failure.\n\n   Alternatively, if we were asked to prove that the last summer olympics was in Tokyo, then we could prove that. But we are asked about the negation.\n\n   So:\n\n        Premises: \n          P2: Location lastSummerOlympics Tokyo\n          ... (others irrelevant)\n\n        Conclusion: \u00ac Location lastSummerOlympics Tokyo\n\n        This is a contradiction. We cannot prove a contradiction from consistent premises? Actually, we can prove anything from a contradiction, but here we don't have a contradiction in the premises. We have consistent premises.\n\n        We have P2 and we are trying to prove \u00acP2. That is impossible.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot prove the conclusion.\n\n   We'll model:\n\n        axiom obj : Type\n        axiom lastSummerOlympics : obj\n        axiom Tokyo : obj\n        axiom Location : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\n        axiom P2 : Location lastSummerOlympics Tokyo\n\n        Now, we want to prove: \u00ac Location lastSummerOlympics Tokyo\n\n        This is impossible because we have P2.\n\n        So we output Failure.\n\n   However, note: we also have premise 1 and 3. But they don't help for the location.\n\n   Let's write the Lean code accordingly.\n\n   Important: We must include all premises? Even if they are not used? Yes, because the context says so.\n\n   We'll have:\n\n        axiom obj : Type\n        axiom SportingEvent : obj \u2192 Prop\n        axiom lastSummerOlympics : obj\n        axiom Tokyo : obj\n        axiom UnitedStates : obj\n        axiom WonMostMedals : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop   -- first arg is the winner, second is the location? or event? \n        -- But note: \"The United States won the most medals in Tokyo\" -> it's about the event in Tokyo? \n        -- Actually, it says \"in Tokyo\", so we can interpret as: at the event held in Tokyo, the United States won the most medals.\n\n        However, we don't have a direct link between the event and the medals? We don't need it for the current statement.\n\n        We'll model:\n\n          axiom P1 : SportingEvent lastSummerOlympics   -- because the last summer olympics is a specific summer olympics, so it is a sporting event? \n          -- But note: the first premise says \"The summer Olympic games\" (general) is a sporting event. We don't have a general predicate. \n          -- Alternatively, we can have:\n          --   axiom IsSummerOlympics : obj \u2192 Prop\n          --   axiom P1_general : \u2200 g, IsSummerOlympics g \u2192 SportingEvent g\n          --   and then we need to know that lastSummerOlympics is a summer olympics? But the context doesn't explicitly say that the last summer olympics is a summer olympics? It says \"the last summer Olympic games\", so we can assume that.\n\n        Actually, let's simplify: the context says \"The summer Olympic games is a sporting event.\" and then \"The last summer Olympic games ...\". So we can assume that the last summer olympics is a summer olympics and hence a sporting event. But again, we don't need that for the location.\n\n        We'll skip the irrelevant axioms for the proof we are trying.\n\n        We focus on:\n\n          axiom P2 : Location lastSummerOlympics Tokyo\n\n        and we are trying to prove: \u00ac Location lastSummerOlympics Tokyo.\n\n        We cannot.\n\n   Therefore, we output Failure.\n\n   Code:\n\n<lean>\naxiom obj : Type\naxiom lastSummerOlympics : obj\naxiom Tokyo : obj\naxiom Location : obj \u2192 obj \u2192 Prop\naxiom P2 : Location lastSummerOlympics Tokyo\n-- We are trying to prove: \u00ac Location lastSummerOlympics Tokyo\n-- But we have P2, so we cannot prove the negation.\n-- Therefore, we do not write a theorem proving the negation.\n</lean>\n\n   ANSWER: Failure\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"The summer Olympic games is a sporting event.\" and we haven't modeled that.

Identify the entities and predicates.\n   - Entities: GRE test, ETS, Tom, Tom's dad, etc.\n   - We note that we are talking about GRE applicants and financial aid.\n\n2. Define the types and predicates in Lean:\n   - We'll have a type for people (or applicants). Let's call it `Person`.\n   - We'll have a type for the GRE test? Actually, we don't need to model the test as an object for this reasoning.\n   - Instead, we focus on:\n        `Person`: the type of individuals (Tom, etc.)\n        `GREApplicant (p: Person)`: a proposition that person `p` is applying to take the GRE test.\n        `FinancialAid (p: Person)`: a proposition that ETS provides financial aid to person `p`.\n        `EconomicHardship (p: Person)`: a proposition that person `p` proves economic hardship.\n\n   Additionally, we have conditions for proving economic hardship:\n        `SingleParentFamily (p: Person)`: person `p` lives in a single-parent family.\n        `FewResources (p: Person)`: person `p` has few resources available to them.\n\n   Axioms:\n   - A1: ETS provides financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.\n        `\u2200 p : Person, GREApplicant p \u2192 EconomicHardship p \u2192 FinancialAid p`\n\n   - A2: Those living in single-parent families OR having few resources can prove economic hardship.\n        We can break this into two implications? Actually, the text says \"or\", so it's a disjunction. But note: the text says \"Those living in single-parent families or having few resources ... can prove economic hardship.\" This means that if either condition holds, then they can prove economic hardship.\n\n        We can write: `\u2200 p : Person, SingleParentFamily p \u2228 FewResources p \u2192 EconomicHardship p`\n\n        However, note that the text says \"or\", meaning at least one of the conditions. So the above is correct.\n\n   - Facts about Tom:\n        T1: Tom lives in a single-parent family: `SingleParentFamily Tom`\n        T2: Tom has few resources available to them: `FewResources Tom`\n        T3: Tom is applying to take the GRE test: `GREApplicant Tom`\n\n3. Now, we want to prove: `FinancialAid Tom`\n\nProof:\n   From T1 and T2, we know that Tom satisfies at least one of the conditions for economic hardship (in fact, both). Specifically, we can form the disjunction: `SingleParentFamily Tom \u2228 FewResources Tom` is true because `SingleParentFamily Tom` is true (so left disjunct is true).\n\n   Therefore, by A2, we get `EconomicHardship Tom`.\n\n   Then, using A1: since Tom is a GRE applicant (T3) and has economic hardship, we get `FinancialAid Tom`.\n\n4. Therefore, we can prove the statement.\n\nLet's write the Lean code accordingly.\n\nNote: We don't need the fact about the cost of the GRE test ($205 cheaper than $300) because it doesn't contribute to the logical reasoning about Tom's financial aid.\n\nWe define:\n   - `Person` as a type.\n   - Predicates: `GREApplicant`, `FinancialAid`, `EconomicHardship`, `SingleParentFamily`, `FewResources`.\n\nAxioms:\n   - `A1`: \u2200 p, GREApplicant p \u2192 EconomicHardship p \u2192 FinancialAid p\n   - `A2`: \u2200 p, SingleParentFamily p \u2228 FewResources p \u2192 EconomicHardship p\n\nFacts about Tom:\n   - `T1`: SingleParentFamily Tom\n   - `T2`: FewResources Tom\n   - `T3`: GREApplicant Tom\n\nWe then prove `FinancialAid Tom` by applying `A1` to Tom, which requires showing `GREApplicant Tom` (which is T3) and `EconomicHardship Tom`. The latter is shown by `A2` Tom, which requires showing `SingleParentFamily Tom \u2228 FewResources Tom`. We can prove the disjunction by `Or.inl T1` (since T1 is the left disjunct).\n\nAlternatively, we could also use `Or.inr T2` but we only need one. Since `T1` is present, we use left.\n\nLean code:\n", "prediction": "True", "parse_status": "SUCCESS", "lean_code": "axiom Person : Type\naxiom Tom : Person\naxiom GREApplicant : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FinancialAid : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom EconomicHardship : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom SingleParentFamily : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FewResources : Person \u2192 Prop\n\naxiom ets_rule : \u2200 (p : Person), GREApplicant p \u2192 EconomicHardship p \u2192 FinancialAid p\naxiom hardship_rule : \u2200 (p : Person), SingleParentFamily p \u2228 FewResources p \u2192 EconomicHardship p\naxiom tom_applicant : GREApplicant Tom\naxiom tom_family : SingleParentFamily Tom\naxiom tom_resources : FewResources Tom\n\ntheorem tom_aid : FinancialAid Tom := by\n  apply ets_rule Tom\n  \u00b7 exact tom_applicant\n  \u00b7 apply hardship_rule Tom\n    exact Or.inl tom_family  -- Tom satisfies single-parent condition", "lean_verification": {"success": true, "env": 9, "errors": [], "warnings": [], "all_messages": []}, "token_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 506, "completion_tokens": 1301, "total_tokens": 1807}}], "num_iterations": 1, "lean_code": "axiom Person : Type\naxiom Tom : Person\naxiom GREApplicant : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FinancialAid : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom EconomicHardship : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom SingleParentFamily : Person \u2192 Prop\naxiom FewResources : Person \u2192 Prop\n\naxiom ets_rule : \u2200 (p : Person), GREApplicant p \u2192 EconomicHardship p \u2192 FinancialAid p\naxiom hardship_rule : \u2200 (p : Person), SingleParentFamily p \u2228 FewResources p \u2192 EconomicHardship p\naxiom tom_applicant : GREApplicant Tom\naxiom tom_family : SingleParentFamily Tom\naxiom tom_resources : FewResources Tom\n\ntheorem tom_aid : FinancialAid Tom := by\n  apply ets_rule Tom\n  \u00b7 exact tom_applicant\n  \u00b7 apply hardship_rule Tom\n    exact Or.inl tom_family  -- Tom satisfies single-parent condition", "lean_verification": {"success": true, "env": 9, "errors": [], "warnings": [], "all_messages": []}, "total_tokens": {"prompt_tokens": 506, "completion_tokens": 1301, "total_tokens": 1807}, "story_id": 197, "example_id": 560, "case_idx": 104}
