The context explicitly states that the GRE test costs $205, which is cheaper than $300. This establishes that the base cost is below $300. The subsequent information about financial aid and Tom's situation pertains to eligibility for reduced costs but does not invalidate the base cost statement. The question asks whether the test costs below $300 in general, which is directly confirmed.
