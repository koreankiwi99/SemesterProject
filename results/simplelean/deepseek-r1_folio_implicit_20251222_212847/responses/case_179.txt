The given information states that Susan arrives at LGA airport in one of her flights and that no flight has the same departure and arrival airport. However, there is no information indicating Susan has no other flights. It is possible that Susan has another flight departing from LGA, as no restrictions forbid multiple flights per person.

**Lean Model:**
<lean>
-- Define basic types and variables for airports, people, and flights
variable (Person : Type)
variable (Airport : Type)
variable (LGA : Airport)  -- LGA is a specific airport
variable (Susan John : Person)  -- Susan and John are specific people
variable (Flight : Person → Airport → Airport → Prop)  -- Flight relation: who, from, to

-- Axioms from the text
axiom susan_arrives_LGA : ∃ d, Flight Susan d LGA  -- Susan flies to LGA from some departure d
axiom no_self_flight : ∀ p d a, Flight p d a → d ≠ a  -- No flight departs and arrives at same airport
axiom john_departs_LGA : ∃ a, Flight John LGA a  -- John flies from LGA to some arrival a

-- The target statement: Susan flies from LGA (i.e., ∃ an arrival a such that she flies from LGA to a)
theorem statement : ∃ a, Flight Susan LGA a := 
  -- Proof attempt fails: no axiom forces Susan to have such a flight
  sorry  -- Cannot prove

-- Negation of the statement: Susan never flies from LGA
theorem neg_statement : ¬ ∃ a, Flight Susan LGA a :=
  -- Proof attempt fails: no axiom forbids Susan from having such a flight
  sorry  -- Cannot disprove
</lean>

**Conclusion:**  
Neither the statement (Susan has a flight from LGA) nor its negation can be proven from the given information. It is consistent with the axioms that Susan might have another flight departing from LGA or not. Thus, the answer is **Unknown**.

**Final Answer:**  
ANSWER: Unknown
