The reasoning is based on the given information and constraints. Susan flies to LGA, so her arrival is LGA. John flies from LGA, so his departure is LGA. The constraint states that for any flight, departure and arrival cannot be the same airport. Therefore, for John's flight, since his departure is LGA, his arrival cannot be LGA. Thus, the statement "John flies to LGA airport" is false.

<lean>
variable (Airport : Type)
variable (LGA : Airport)

variable (Susan_dep : Airport)
variable (Susan_arr : Airport)
variable (John_dep : Airport)
variable (John_arr : Airport)

axiom susan_arrives_LGA : Susan_arr = LGA
axiom john_departs_LGA : John_dep = LGA
axiom constraint_John : John_dep ≠ John_arr

theorem john_not_to_LGA : John_arr ≠ LGA := by
  rw [john_departs_LGA] at constraint_John
  exact constraint_John
</lean>

The error occurred because the `rw` tactic was used incorrectly. The tactic `rw [john_departs_LGA] at constraint_John` attempts to rewrite `constraint_John` using `john_departs_LGA`, but `constraint_John` is a hypothesis of inequality, not equality. Instead, we use a direct proof by contradiction: assume John arrives at LGA, then derive that John's departure equals arrival (contradicting the constraint).

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<lean>
variable (Airport : Type)
variable (LGA : Airport)

variable (Susan_dep : Airport)
variable (Susan_arr : Airport)
variable (John_dep : Airport)
variable (John_arr : Airport)

axiom susan_arrives_LGA : Susan_arr = LGA
axiom john_departs_LGA : John_dep = LGA
axiom constraint_John : John_dep ≠ John_arr

theorem john_not_to_LGA : John_arr ≠ LGA := by
  intro h  -- Assume John_arr = LGA
  have : John_dep = John_arr := Eq.trans john_departs_LGA h.symm
  exact constraint_John this
</lean>

**Explanation:**
- `intro h` assumes `John_arr = LGA`.
- `have : John_dep = John_arr` combines `john_departs_LGA` (John_dep = LGA) and `h` (John_arr = LGA) to show John_dep = John_arr.
- `exact constraint_John this` uses the constraint `John_dep ≠ John_arr` to derive a contradiction.

The theorem proves that John does not fly to LGA, making the statement "John flies to LGA airport" **false**.

ITERATION 3

The compilation error occurred because there was an issue with variable scoping. The solution is to model the problem with constants for the airport type and specific airports/flights, and to properly include all necessary constraints. I've refactored the Lean code accordingly:

<lean>
constant Airport : Type
constant LGA : Airport

-- For John's flight
constant John_dep : Airport   -- departure airport for John
constant John_arr : Airport   -- arrival airport for John

axiom john_departs_LGA : John_dep = LGA
axiom flight_constraint : John_dep ≠ John_arr  -- Generic constraint applied to John's flight

theorem john_not_to_LGA : John_arr ≠ LGA := by
  intro h  -- Assume John_arr = LGA
  have : John_dep = John_arr := by
    rw [john_departs_LGA, h]
  exact flight_constraint this
</lean>

The proof shows that if John's arrival were at LGA, it would contradict the flight constraint that forbids both departure and arrival at the same airport. Therefore, the statement "John flies to LGA airport" is false.

ANSWER: False
