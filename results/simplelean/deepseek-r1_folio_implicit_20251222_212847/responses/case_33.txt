Based on the textual context, we can model the situation in Lean. The key facts are:
- Diamond Mine is a professional wrestling stable
- Roderick Strong leads Diamond Mine

This directly implies that Roderick Strong leads at least one professional wrestling stable (namely, Diamond Mine). The other information about members and feuds is irrelevant to this specific claim.

Here is the Lean formalization and proof:

<lean>
def RoderickStrong : String := "Roderick Strong"
def DiamondMine : String := "Diamond Mine"

axiom is_stable : String → Prop
axiom leads : String → String → Prop

axiom diamond_mine_is_stable : is_stable DiamondMine
axiom strong_leads_diamond_mine : leads RoderickStrong DiamondMine

theorem strong_leads_some_stable : ∃ (s : String), is_stable s ∧ leads RoderickStrong s :=
  ⟨DiamondMine, diamond_mine_is_stable, strong_leads_diamond_mine⟩
</lean>

The proof constructs the witness `DiamondMine` and uses the given axioms to satisfy the existential quantifier. Therefore, the statement "Roderick Strong leads a professional wrestling stable" is **true**.

ANSWER: True
