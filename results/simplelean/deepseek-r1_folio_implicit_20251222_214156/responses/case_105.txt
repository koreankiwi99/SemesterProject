ANSWER: True

Final Answer Explanation:  
The text explicitly states that the GRE test costs $205, which is cheaper than $300. The context about Tom's eligibility for financial aid does not alter this base cost. The Lean proof directly establishes that 205 < 300 using the `cost_lt_300` axiom. Therefore, the statement is proven true.

ITERATION 2
======================================================================

The compilation errors occurred due to improper handling of constant definitions and axioms. The key issue was attempting to define `GRE_COST` as a constant with a value while simultaneously declaring axioms about it, which Lean 4's typechecker rejected. Additionally, the proof of `GRE_COST < 300` doesn't require axioms since it's computationally verifiable.

Corrected approach:
1. Define `GRE_COST` as a fixed value using `def`
2. Prove `GRE_COST < 300` computationally using `decide`
3. Keep context about Tom/financial aid as axioms since they're irrelevant to the cost question

<lean>
-- Fixed cost definition (computationally verifiable)
def GRE_COST : ℕ := 205

-- Context about financial aid (unused but included for completeness)
constant Person : Type
constant tom : Person
constant greApplicant : Person → Prop
constant financialAidEligible : Person → Prop
constant singleParentFamily : Person → Prop
constant fewResources : Person → Prop

axiom financial_aid_rule : ∀ p, 
  greApplicant p → (singleParentFamily p ∨ fewResources p) → financialAidEligible p
  
axiom tom_single_parent : singleParentFamily tom
axiom tom_few_resources : fewResources tom
axiom tom_applicant : greApplicant tom

-- Theorem: GRE cost is below $300 (computational proof)
theorem cost_below_300 : GRE_COST < 300 := by
  simp [GRE_COST]  -- Unfold definition to 205
  decide          -- Verify 205 < 300
</lean>

ANSWER: True

Final Answer Explanation:  
The text explicitly states the GRE test costs $205, which is computationally less than $300. Financial aid rules and Tom's situation don't affect this base cost. The Lean proof uses computational reduction (`decide`) to verify 205 < 300, confirming the statement is true regardless of financial aid considerations.

======================================================================
ITERATION 3
======================================================================

The compilation errors arose from mixing `constant`, `axiom`, and `def` declarations in a way incompatible with Lean 4's structural requirements. The key insight is that the financial aid context about Tom is irrelevant to the cost question, as the text explicitly states the base GRE cost ($205) and its comparison with $300.

Corrected solution:
<lean>
-- Minimal verifiable fact fulfilling the requirement
def GRE_COST : ℕ := 205
theorem cost_below_300 : GRE_COST < 300 := by 
  simp [GRE_COST]  -- Reduces to 205 < 300
  decide          -- Decision procedure confirms truth
</lean>

ANSWER: True

Final Answer Explanation:  
1. The proof relies ONLY on the explicit statement: "It costs $205 [...] which is cheaper than $300"
2. Financial aid rules and Tom's circumstances do NOT affect the base cost
3. `def` ensures $205 is computationally verified
4. `decide` automatically proves that 205 < 300 in Lean
5. All compilation error sources (unnecessary constants/axioms) were removed
The statement is definitively true based on the textual evidence.
