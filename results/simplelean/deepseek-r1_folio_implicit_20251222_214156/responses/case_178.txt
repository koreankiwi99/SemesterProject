The premises state that all horses have hooves and no humans have hooves. The question asks whether it follows that some humans are horses. 

In Lean, we define a universe type `U` with predicates for `horse`, `human`, and `has_hooves`. The premises are formalized as:
1. `∀ x, horse x → has_hooves x` (all horses have hooves)
2. `∀ x, human x → ¬ has_hooves x` (no humans have hooves)

The statement "some humans are horses" is formalized as `∃ x, human x ∧ horse x`. We prove that this is false by deriving a contradiction. For any entity that is both human and horse, it must have hooves (from premise 1) but cannot have hooves (from premise 2), leading to an impossibility.

<lean>
variable (U : Type)
variable (horse human : U → Prop)
variable (has_hooves : U → Prop)

-- Premises
premise A1 : ∀ x, horse x → has_hooves x
premise A2 : ∀ x, human x → ¬ has_hooves x

-- Prove it is false that some humans are horses
theorem no_human_horse : ¬ ∃ x, human x ∧ horse x := by
  intro h  -- Assume there exists some human horse
  obtain ⟨w, hw⟩ := h  -- Unpack the witness `w` that is human and horse
  have h_hooves : has_hooves w := A1 w hw.right  -- `w` has hooves because it is a horse
  have no_hooves : ¬ has_hooves w := A2 w hw.left  -- `w` cannot have hooves because it is human
  contradiction  -- Contradiction: h_hooves and no_hooves
</lean>

The Lean proof confirms that the existence of a human horse leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the statement is false.

ANSWER: False

The compilation errors occurred due to incorrect declaration of premises and the use of `obtain` without proper context. In Lean 4, premises must be passed as parameters to the theorem, and `rcases` is used for existential elimination instead of `obtain`. The corrected code formalizes the logic properly:

<lean>
theorem no_human_horse (U : Type) (horse human has_hooves : U → Prop)
  (A1 : ∀ x, horse x → has_hooves x)
  (A2 : ∀ x, human x → ¬ has_hooves x) :
  ¬ ∃ x, human x ∧ horse x := by
  intro h
  rcases h with ⟨w, hw⟩
  have h_hooves : has_hooves w := A1 w hw.right
  have no_hooves : ¬ has_hooves w := A2 w hw.left
  exact no_hooves h_hooves
</lean>

The proof shows that assuming "some humans are horses" leads to a contradiction: 
1. Any horse must have hooves (premise 1)
2. No human can have hooves (premise 2)
3. Therefore, no entity can be both human and horse

The Lean proof verifies that "some humans are horses" is false under the given premises.

ANSWER: False
