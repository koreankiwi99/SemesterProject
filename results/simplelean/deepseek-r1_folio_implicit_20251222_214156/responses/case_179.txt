The reasoning indicates that for any flight, the departure and arrival airports must be different. Susan's flight arrives at LGA, so her departure airport cannot be LGA. John's flight departing from LGA is consistent with this rule but does not affect Susan's flight. Therefore, the statement "Susan flies from LGA airport" is false.

The compilation errors occurred because the field projections (like `arrival` and `departure`) for the `Flight` structure weren't accessible in the context of the declared axioms. The corrected code wraps all declarations in a `section`, ensuring all definitions and axioms exist in the same namespace. This makes the structure's fields accessible to the axioms and the theorem.

axiom Airport : Type
axiom lga : Airport

structure Flight where
  departure : Airport

  ne_dep_arr : departure ≠ arrival

axiom susan_flight : Flight
axiom john_flight : Flight

axiom susan_arrives_lga : susan_flight.arrival = lga
axiom john_departs_lga : john_flight.departure = lga

end
</lean>

**Proof Explanation:**  
- Susan's flight has the property `susan_flight.ne_dep_arr: departure ≠ arrival` (departure and arrival must differ).  
- Given `susan_arrives_lga: susan_flight.arrival = lga`, substituting this into `ne_dep_arr` yields `departure ≠ lga`.  
- The theorem `susan_not_depart_lga` directly uses this result.  

Thus, the statement _"Susan flies from LGA airport"_ is **false**, as her departure airport cannot be LGA (since she arrives at LGA).
