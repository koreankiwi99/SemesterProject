Therefore, no entity can be both human and horse\n\nThe Lean proof verifies that \"some humans are horses\" is false under the given premises.\n\nANSWER: False", "reasoning_content": "We are getting compilation errors because in Lean 4, we cannot use `variable` and `premise` in the same way as in Lean 3. Instead, we should use `axiom` or define the premises within a section or as hypotheses. Also, the `obtain` tactic might not be available in the same form. We can use `match` or `rcases` or simply use `let` and `have`.\n\nLet me correct the code:\n\n1. We declare a universe `U` and predicates as axioms (or use `variable` but then we must be in a context that allows it). Alternatively, we can put everything in a section and use `variable` and then `axiom` for the premises, but in Lean 4, `axiom` is replaced by `axiom` or `constant` but for this purpose, we can use `variable` for the type and predicates and then use `hypothesis` or `axiom` for the premises? Actually, in a theorem we can assume the premises as hypotheses.\n\nAlternatively, we can structure the theorem by taking the premises as hypotheses.\n\nBut note: the error says \"unexpected identifier; expected command\". This is because we are using `variable` without a surrounding `section` or `namespace`. However, we can avoid `variable` by using a fixed universe and defining the theorem with all parameters.\n\nAnother approach: We can define the entire theorem as a constant with the required parameters.\n\nLet me try to fix:\n\nWe can write:\n\n```lean\ntheorem no_human_horse (U : Type) (horse human has_hooves : U \u2192 Prop)\n  (A1 : \u2200 x, horse x \u2192 has_hooves x)\n  (A2 : \u2200 x, human x \u2192 \u00ac has_hooves x) :\n  \u00ac \u2203 x, human x \u2227 horse x :=\nby\n  intro h\n  match h with\n  | \u27e8w, hw\u27e9 =>\n    have h_hooves : has_hooves w := A1 w hw.right\n    have no_hooves : \u00ac has_hooves w := A2 w hw.left\n    contradiction\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can use `rintro` or `rcases`.\n\nBut note: the error also says `Unknown identifier` for `has_hooves`, `A1`, etc. This is because in the original code, the premises were declared as `premise` which is not a Lean 4 keyword.\n\nSo, we replace `premise` with `axiom`? But in Lean 4, we can use `axiom` but it's better to pass them as parameters to the theorem.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a section to declare variables and axioms:\n\nBut the requirement is to have standalone code.\n\nI think the best way is to have the theorem take the type and predicates as parameters and the premises as arguments.\n\nLet me write the corrected code accordingly.\n\nWe'll define a theorem that takes:\n- A type `U`\n- Predicates `horse`, `human`, `has_hooves` on `U`\n- Two premises: `A1` and `A2`\n\nThen we prove the negation of the existence.\n\nWe'll use `match` or `rcases` to destruct the existential.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n```lean\n  intro \u27e8w, hw_human, hw_horse\u27e9\n```\n\nBut note: the existential is `\u2203 x, human x \u2227 horse x`, so it's one witness with two proofs.\n\nWe can also do:\n\n```lean\n  intro h\n  let \u27e8w, hw\u27e9 := h\n```\n\nBut `let` is for definitions, and in tactics we can use `obtain`? Actually, in Lean 4 `obtain` is not a built-in tactic, but we can use `rcases` or `cases`.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n```lean\n  intro h\n  cases h with | intro w hw => ... \n```\n\nBut I think the most straightforward is to use `match` in the tactic mode.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n```lean\n  rintro \u27e8w, hw_human, hw_horse\u27e9\n```\n\nBut note: the existential is bundled as a single conjunction, so we can do:\n\n```lean\n  intro h\n  rcases h with \u27e8w, hw\u27e9\n```\n\nBut then `hw` is a pair `\u27e8human w, horse w\u27e9`. Then we can access `hw.left` and `hw.right`.\n\nSo the corrected code:\n\n<lean>\ntheorem no_human_horse (U : Type) (horse human has_hooves : U \u2192 Prop)\n  (A1 : \u2200 x, horse x \u2192 has_hooves x)\n  (A2 : \u2200 x, human x \u2192 \u00ac has_hooves x) :\n  \u00ac \u2203 x, human x \u2227 horse x := by\n  intro h  -- Assume there exists an x that is both human and horse\n  rcases h with \u27e8w, hw\u27e9  -- Let w be such an x, and hw : human w \u2227 horse w\n  have h_hooves : has_hooves w := A1 w hw.right\n  have no_hooves : \u00ac has_hooves w := A2 w hw.left\n  exact no_hooves h_hooves  -- This is the contradiction, or we can use `contradiction`\n</lean>\n\nAlternatively, we can use `contradiction` because `no_hooves h_hooves` is exactly the contradiction.\n\nBut note: `contradiction` tactic might work too, but here we can also just apply `no_hooves` to `h_hooves`.\n\nLet me test with `exact no_hooves h_hooves`.\n\nThis should work.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n```lean\n  contradiction\n```\n\nbecause the context has `h_hooves : has_hooves w` and `no_hooves : \u00ac has_hooves w` which are contradictory.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll use `exact no_hooves h_hooves`.\n\nNow, the answer is still False because we proved the negation of \"some humans are horses\".\n\nSo, the statement \"some humans are horses\" is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is False.\n\nBut note: the question asks for the statement \"Some humans are horses\", and we proved it is false.\n\nSo, the final answer is False.\n\nLet me write the corrected code.\n", "prediction": "False", "parse_status": "SUCCESS", "lean_code": "theorem no_human_horse (U : Type) (horse human has_hooves : U \u2192 Prop)\n  (A1 : \u2200 x, horse x \u2192 has_hooves x)\n  (A2 : \u2200 x, human x \u2192 \u00ac has_hooves x) :\n  \u00ac \u2203 x, human x \u2227 horse x := by\n  intro h\n  rcases h with \u27e8w, hw\u27e9\n  have h_hooves : has_hooves w := A1 w hw.right\n  have no_hooves : \u00ac has_hooves w := A2 w hw.left\n  exact no_hooves h_hooves", "lean_verification": {"success": true, "env": 4, "errors": [], "warnings": [], "all_messages": []}}], "num_iterations": 2, "lean_code": "theorem no_human_horse (U : Type) (horse human has_hooves : U \u2192 Prop)\n  (A1 : \u2200 x, horse x \u2192 has_hooves x)\n  (A2 : \u2200 x, human x \u2192 \u00ac has_hooves x) :\n  \u00ac \u2203 x, human x \u2227 horse x := by\n  intro h\n  rcases h with \u27e8w, hw\u27e9\n  have h_hooves : has_hooves w := A1 w hw.right\n  have no_hooves : \u00ac has_hooves w := A2 w hw.left\n  exact no_hooves h_hooves", "lean_verification": {"success": true, "env": 4, "errors": [], "warnings": [], "all_messages": []}, "story_id": 259, "example_id": 703, "case_idx": 178}
