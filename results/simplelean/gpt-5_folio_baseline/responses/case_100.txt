axiom Harry : obj

-- Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → (Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x)
-- All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Backbone x) → ReproMF x
-- All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Vertebrate x → Backbone x
-- All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Bee x → ¬ ReproMF x
-- All queen bees are bees.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, QueenBee x → Bee x
-- Harry is a bee.
axiom A6 : Bee Harry

-- From being both a vertebrate and an animal with a backbone (the latter explicitly),
-- we can derive a contradiction with Harry being a bee.

  exact nrepro repro

-- We cannot derive the target implication nor its negation from the given axioms.
-- In particular, the second disjunct of the antecedent
-- (¬Vertebrate Harry ∧ ¬(Animal Harry ∧ Backbone Harry))
-- does not allow us to conclude ¬Invertebrate Harry or ¬QueenBee Harry.
-- Likewise, we cannot establish the negation (that the antecedent holds and
-- Harry is an invertebrate or a queen bee) from the axioms.
