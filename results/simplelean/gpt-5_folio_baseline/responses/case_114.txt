axiom obj : Type

-- Individuals
axiom Michael : obj
axiom Peter   : obj
axiom Windy   : obj

-- Predicates and relations
axiom Man : obj → Prop
axiom InClass : obj → Prop        -- Michael's class membership
axiom Taller : obj → obj → Prop   -- Taller x y means x is taller than y
axiom CanBlock : obj → obj → Prop -- CanBlock x y means x can block y's shooting
axiom Jump : obj → Prop
axiom Shooter : obj → Prop
axiom GreatShooter : obj → Prop

-- 1) If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
axiom R_block_by_height : ∀ x y : obj, Man x → Man y → Taller x y → CanBlock x y

-- 2) Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
axiom Michael_man : Man Michael
axiom Michael_tallest_in_class : ∀ y : obj, InClass y → y ≠ Michael → Taller Michael y

-- 3) Transitivity of taller
axiom taller_trans : ∀ x y z : obj, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z

-- 4) Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
axiom Peter_man : Man Peter
axiom Peter_taller_Michael : Taller Peter Michael

-- 5) Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
axiom Michael_blocks_if_no_jump : ∀ p : obj, ¬ Jump p → CanBlock Michael p

-- 6) Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
axiom not_block_Windy : ¬ CanBlock Michael Windy

-- 7) Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.
axiom jumpers_are_great : ∀ s : obj, Shooter s → Jump s → GreatShooter s

-- Optional: Windy is a shooter (implicit in "Windy's shooting"), not needed for the height question.
axiom Windy_shooter : Shooter Windy

-- Target statement (for reference):
-- "Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class."
-- Formalization: ∃ m : obj, Man m ∧ InClass m ∧ Taller m Peter
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive this statement nor its negation,
-- since no antisymmetry/irreflexivity constraints on Taller are provided.
-- Hence, we leave it unproven here.
