axiom SoloEV : obj → Prop

-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then it is not a one-seater.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, TransportMultiplePassengers x → ¬ OneSeater x
-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, TeslaModel3 x → TransportMultiplePassengers x
-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x
-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x
-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is either not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
axiom R5 : ¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar → (¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar ∨ SingleSeatElectricCar JohnCar)

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive SoloEV JohnCar or its negation.
-- Therefore, the statement "John's car is a Solo EV" is not provable nor disprovable here.
