-- Predicates
axiom MakePlans : Person → Prop
axiom Engaged : Person → Prop
axiom InviteOthers : Person → Prop
axiom WellAttended : Person → Prop
axiom LargerFamily : Person → Prop
axiom InviteFriends : Person → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
-- 1. All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, MakePlans x → Engaged x
-- 2. All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
-- 3. Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
-- 4. Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : Person, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- 5. If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and does not make wedding plans.
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬ InviteFriends John ∧ ¬ MakePlans John)
-- 6. If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- From the axioms we can derive that John does not invite others to his wedding.
theorem not_invite_others_John : ¬ InviteOthers John := by
  intro hIO
  have hMP : MakePlans John := A2 John hIO
  have hEng : Engaged John := A1 John hMP
  have hNotMP : ¬ MakePlans John := (A5 hEng).right
  exact hNotMP hMP

-- The target statement would be: ¬LargerFamily John ∧ ¬InviteOthers John.
-- We proved ¬InviteOthers John above, but we cannot derive ¬LargerFamily John
-- nor its negation from the given axioms.
-- Hence we cannot prove the statement nor its negation.
