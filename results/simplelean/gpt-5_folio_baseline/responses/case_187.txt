-- Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
axiom H1 : ∃ x : obj, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x ∧ ¬ AmericanNational x
-- All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
axiom H2 : ∀ x : obj, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x → CanDoJumpShots x
-- If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
axiom H3 : ∀ x : obj, CanDoJumpShots x → LeapsStraightIntoTheAir x
-- If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles.
axiom H4 : ∀ x : obj, LeapsStraightIntoTheAir x → ActivatesLegMuscles x
-- Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.
axiom H5 : ¬ ActivatesLegMuscles Yuri

-- From H5 and the implications, we can show Yuri is not a professional basketball player.
theorem yuri_not_professional : ¬ ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri :=
by
  have h_not_leap : ¬ LeapsStraightIntoTheAir Yuri :=
    fun hleap => H5 (H4 Yuri hleap)
  have h_not_jump : ¬ CanDoJumpShots Yuri :=
    fun hjump => h_not_leap (H3 Yuri hjump)
  exact fun hpro => h_not_jump (H2 Yuri hpro)

-- From the given information, we cannot derive whether Yuri is an American national or not.
-- No proof of AmericanNational Yuri or ¬ AmericanNational Yuri can be constructed from the axioms above.
