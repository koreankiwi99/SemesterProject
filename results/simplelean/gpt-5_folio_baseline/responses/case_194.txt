-- The winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic was Steinhauer.
axiom W1 : Winner1992 Steinhauer

-- Steinhauer participated in the 1992 du Maurier Classic.
axiom P1 : Participated1992 Steinhauer

-- One six-way tie was on the leaderboard (modeled as: anyone in the tie is on the leaderboard),
-- and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium.

-- Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic.
axiom D_belgium : FromBelgium Descampe
axiom D_leaderboard : OnLeaderboard1992 Descampe

-- All people on the leaderboard participated.
axiom L_participated : ∀ x : obj, OnLeaderboard1992 x → Participated1992 x

-- Goal in question: InSixWayTie1992 Descampe ?
-- From the axioms we only know that there exists some Belgian in the tie,
-- and that Descampe is Belgian and on the leaderboard. We cannot conclude
-- that the Belgian in the tie is Descampe, nor can we conclude that he is not.
-- Hence we cannot prove InSixWayTie1992 Descampe or its negation from the given information.
-- No theorem or its negation is derivable with the current axioms.
