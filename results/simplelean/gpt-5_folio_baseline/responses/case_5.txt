axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj

-- Predicates
axiom Employee : obj → Prop
axiom SchedulesWithCustomers : obj → Prop
axiom GoToCompanyBuildingToday : obj → Prop
axiom LunchInCompanyBuilding : obj → Prop
axiom LunchAtHome : obj → Prop
axiom WorksRemoteFromHome : obj → Prop
axiom InOtherCountries : obj → Prop
axiom Manager : obj → Prop
axiom AppearsInCompanyToday : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
-- 1. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ SchedulesWithCustomers x → GoToCompanyBuildingToday x

-- 2. Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, LunchInCompanyBuilding x → SchedulesWithCustomers x

-- 3. Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → (LunchInCompanyBuilding x ∨ LunchAtHome x)

-- 4. If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → WorksRemoteFromHome x

-- 5. All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → WorksRemoteFromHome x

-- 6. No managers work remotely from home.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬ WorksRemoteFromHome x

-- 7. James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom A7 : AppearsInCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- The queried statement (as a single conjunction of two implications):
def Claim : Prop :=
  ((Manager James ∨ InOtherCountries James) → ¬ (LunchAtHome James ∨ WorksRemoteFromHome James)) ∧
  ((LunchAtHome James ∨ WorksRemoteFromHome James) → (¬ Manager James ∧ ¬ InOtherCountries James))

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive Claim nor its negation.
-- Reasons:
-- - From Manager James we can get ¬WorksRemoteFromHome James (A6), but this does not imply ¬LunchAtHome James.
--   Hence we cannot prove the first implication.
-- - From WorksRemoteFromHome James we can derive ¬Manager James (using A6 contrapositively by case analysis),
--   but we cannot derive ¬InOtherCountries James without additional assumptions (e.g., that James is an employee).
--   Hence we cannot prove the second implication.
-- - Conversely, we also cannot derive the negation of Claim from the axioms, since we lack positive facts about
--   James being a manager, being in other countries, or having lunch at home.
-- Therefore, Claim and ¬Claim are both unprovable from these axioms.
