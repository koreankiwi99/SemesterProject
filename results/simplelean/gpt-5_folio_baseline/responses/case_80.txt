-- No baked sweets are spicy.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BakedSweet x → ¬ Spicy x
-- All cupcakes are baked sweets.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Cupcake x → BakedSweet x
-- All mala hotpots are spicy.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, MalaHotpot x → Spicy x
-- All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, FromBBM x → Cupcake x
-- Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets.
axiom A5 : Spicy DTC ∨ MalaHotpot DTC ∨ ¬ BakedSweet DTC

-- From the disjunction and "no baked sweets are spicy", we can show:
-- If DTC were a baked sweet, then DTC must be a mala hotpot.

-- However, from the given axioms we cannot derive MalaHotpot DTC or its negation.
-- No further theorem about DTC being a mala hotpot is derivable from the provided information.
