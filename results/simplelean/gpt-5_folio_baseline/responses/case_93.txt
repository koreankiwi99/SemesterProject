-- Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
axiom some_managed_allows_pets : ∃ b : Building, Managed b ∧ AllowsPets b

-- A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
axiom deposit_required_in_managed : ∀ b : Building, Managed b → DepositRequired b

-- The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
axiom deposit_at_least_rent : ∀ b : Building, Managed b → SecurityDeposit b ≥ MonthlyRent b

-- Fluffy is Tom's cat.
axiom fluffy_is_toms_cat : OwnedBy Tom Fluffy
axiom fluffy_is_cat : Cat Fluffy

-- Cats are pets.

-- The Olive Garden is a managed building.
axiom olive_is_managed : Managed OliveGarden

-- The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
axiom rent_olive : MonthlyRent OliveGarden = 2000

-- $2000 is more than $1500.
axiom two_thousand_gt_one_thousand_five_hundred : 2000 > 1500

-- Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
axiom tom_will_rent_if_allowed_and_deposit_small :
  ∀ b : Building, Managed b →
    (AllowedMoveInWith Tom Fluffy b ∧ SecurityDeposit b ≤ 1500) →

-- If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet.
axiom allows_pets_implies_people_can_move_in_with_pet :
  ∀ b : Building, Managed b → AllowsPets b →
    ∀ p : Person, ∀ a : Animal, Pet a → AllowedMoveInWith p a b

-- Goal: Tom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy.
-- We would need AllowsPets OliveGarden to use the rule, but we only know that
-- some managed building allows pets, not necessarily The Olive Garden.
-- Hence we cannot derive AllowedMoveInWith Tom Fluffy OliveGarden, nor its negation, from the given axioms.
-- theorem target : AllowedMoveInWith Tom Fluffy OliveGarden := by
--   admit
