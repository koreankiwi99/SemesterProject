-- Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → (Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x)
-- All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → Backbone x → ReproMF x
-- All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Vertebrate x → Backbone x
-- All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Bee x → ¬ ReproMF x
-- All queen bees are bees.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, QueenBee x → Bee x
-- Harry is a bee.
axiom A6 : Bee Harry

-- From these axioms, we cannot prove QueenBee Harry or its negation.
-- There is no link given from Bee to Animal (or other facts) that would yield a contradiction.
-- Hence the statement is undetermined from the given information.
