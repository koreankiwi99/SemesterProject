-- Predicates
axiom InClub : obj → Prop
axiom PerformOften : obj → Prop                      -- performs in school talent shows often
axiom AttendsEvents : obj → Prop                     -- attends school events
axiom EngagedEvents : obj → Prop                     -- is very engaged with school events

axiom ChaperoneDances : obj → Prop                   -- chaperones high school dances
axiom StudentAtSchool : obj → Prop                   -- student who attends the school
axiom YoungChild : obj → Prop

axiom WishesFurtherAcademic : obj → Prop             -- wishes to further academic careers and educational opportunities

-- Individual
axiom Bonnie : obj

-- Context axioms
-- People in this club who perform often attend and are very engaged with school events.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ PerformOften x → AttendsEvents x ∧ EngagedEvents x

-- People in this club either perform often or are inactive and disinterested.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x → PerformOften x ∨ InactiveDisinterested x

-- People in this club who chaperone dances are not students who attend the school.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ ChaperoneDances x → ¬ StudentAtSchool x

-- All in-club inactive and disinterested people chaperone dances.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ InactiveDisinterested x → ChaperoneDances x

-- All young children or teenagers in the club who wish to further academics are students at the school.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, (YoungChild x ∨ Teen x) ∧ InClub x ∧ WishesFurtherAcademic x → StudentAtSchool x

-- Bonnie is in the club.
axiom A6 : InClub Bonnie

-- Bonnie either (attends ∧ is engaged ∧ is a student) or (does not (attend ∧ is engaged) ∧ is not a student).
axiom A7 :
  ((AttendsEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedEvents Bonnie) ∧ StudentAtSchool Bonnie) ∨
  ((¬ (AttendsEvents Bonnie ∧ EngagedEvents Bonnie)) ∧ ¬ StudentAtSchool Bonnie)

-- Goal: Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.
-- From A2 and A6 we have PerformOften Bonnie ∨ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie.
-- Both disjuncts are consistent with the remaining information, so we cannot decide PerformOften Bonnie.
-- Likewise, we cannot derive ¬ PerformOften Bonnie.
-- Hence the truth of PerformOften Bonnie is undecidable from the given axioms.
-- theorems not provable with given information:
-- theorem bonnie_performs : PerformOften Bonnie := by
--   -- Cannot be derived
--   admit
-- theorem not_bonnie_performs : ¬ PerformOften Bonnie := by
--   -- Cannot be derived
--   admit
