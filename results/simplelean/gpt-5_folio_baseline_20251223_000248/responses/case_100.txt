axiom obj : Type

-- Entities and predicates
axiom Harry : obj
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom Invertebrate : obj → Prop
axiom Vertebrate : obj → Prop
axiom Backbone : obj → Prop
axiom ReproMF : obj → Prop
axiom Bee : obj → Prop
axiom QBee : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
-- Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → (Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x)

-- All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Backbone x) → ReproMF x

-- All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Vertebrate x) → Backbone x

-- All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Bee x → ¬ ReproMF x

-- All queen bees are bees.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, QBee x → Bee x

-- Harry is a bee.
axiom A6 : Bee Harry

-- The claim to analyze:
def Claim : Prop :=
  ((Vertebrate Harry ∧ Backbone Harry) ∨ (¬ Vertebrate Harry ∧ ¬ Backbone Harry))
  → (¬ Invertebrate Harry ∧ ¬ QBee Harry)

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive Claim, nor its negation.
-- Reasons (informal):
-- - We have no axiom that bees are animals, so A1 and A2/A3 may not apply to Harry.
-- - Nothing prevents Harry from being a queen bee, so we cannot prove ¬ QBee Harry.
-- - Likewise, we cannot prove ¬ Invertebrate Harry.
-- - We also cannot derive a counterexample from the axioms (i.e., the negation of Claim),
--   since the axioms do not assert that the antecedent holds or that Harry is a queen bee/invertebrate.
