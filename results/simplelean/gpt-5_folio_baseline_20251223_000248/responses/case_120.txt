axiom obj : Type
axiom Affection : obj → Prop
axiom Love : obj → Prop
axiom Positive : obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom some_aff_is_love : ∃ x : obj, Affection x ∧ Love x
axiom some_love_is_positive : ∃ x : obj, Love x ∧ Positive x

-- Goal: ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x
-- This does not follow from the premises, since the witnesses for the two existentials
-- might be different elements. We also cannot prove its negation from the given information.
