-- Premises
-- All of Peter's pets that are mammals are also animals.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Pet x ∧ Mammal x → Animal x
-- All monkeys are mammals.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Monkey x → Mammal x
-- Peter's pets are all either monkeys or birds.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Pet x → (Monkey x ∨ Bird x)
-- Peter's birds can fly.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Pet x ∧ Bird x → CanFly x
-- All animals that are Peter's pets can breathe.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Pet x ∧ Animal x → CanBreathe x
-- If Peter's pet can fly, then it has wings.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Pet x ∧ CanFly x → HasWings x
-- Rock is Peter's pet.
axiom A7 : Pet Rock
-- Rock can fly, or Rock is a bird, or Rock cannot breathe.
axiom A8 : CanFly Rock ∨ Bird Rock ∨ ¬ CanBreathe Rock

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive Monkey Rock or its negation.
-- Sketch:
--   From A3 and A7: Monkey Rock ∨ Bird Rock.
--   If Bird Rock, then by A4 with A7, CanFly Rock, consistent with all premises.
--   If Monkey Rock, then by A2, A1, and A5 (using A7), CanBreathe Rock, still consistent with A8.
-- No contradiction rules out either disjunct, and no rule forces Monkey Rock.
-- Hence neither Monkey Rock nor ¬ Monkey Rock is provable from these axioms.
