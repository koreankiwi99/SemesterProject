-- All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, MakePlans x → Engaged x
-- All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
-- Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
-- Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : Person, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and makes wedding plans.
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬ InviteFriends John ∧ MakePlans John)
-- If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive LargerFamily John or its negation.
-- No theorem is provable about LargerFamily John with the current information.
