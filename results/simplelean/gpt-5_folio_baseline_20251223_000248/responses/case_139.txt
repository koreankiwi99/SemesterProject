axiom Film : obj → Prop
axiom AppropriateAllAges : obj → Prop
axiom CanWatchWithoutGuidance : obj → Prop
axiom ExcessiveEroticViolent : obj → Prop
axiom RatedG : obj → Prop
axiom FamilyFriendlyAnimated : obj → Prop
axiom FrozenSeries : obj → Prop

-- Rules
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, AppropriateAllAges x → CanWatchWithoutGuidance x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, ExcessiveEroticViolent x → ¬ CanWatchWithoutGuidance x
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, RatedG x → AppropriateAllAges x
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, FamilyFriendlyAnimated x → RatedG x
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, FrozenSeries x → FamilyFriendlyAnimated x

-- Facts
axiom T1 : Film Hachi
axiom T2 : FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateAllAges Hachi

-- From family-friendly animated we can derive Rated G:
theorem rated_from_ffa : FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi → RatedG Hachi := fun h => R4 Hachi h

-- Cannot derive RatedG Hachi from AppropriateAllAges Hachi alone, and the disjunction T2
-- does not let us conclude which disjunct holds. Hence we cannot prove RatedG Hachi or its negation.
