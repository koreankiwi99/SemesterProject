axiom LikesMusic : Prop
axiom WantsCompose : Prop
axiom CanCompose : Prop
axiom HasProgram : Prop
axiom WillCompose : Prop

axiom R1 : LikesMusic → WantsCompose
axiom R2 : HasProgram → CanCompose
axiom R3 : (CanCompose ∧ WantsCompose) → WillCompose

theorem george_will_compose : (LikesMusic ∧ HasProgram) → WillCompose := by
  intro h
  have hL : LikesMusic := And.left h
  have hP : HasProgram := And.right h
  have hW : WantsCompose := R1 hL
  have hC : CanCompose := R2 hP
  exact R3 ⟨hC, hW⟩
