-- There exists a show airing at 8 pm on Monday that gives out roses on TV
axiom ex1 : ∃ x : obj, Show x ∧ AirsMon8 x ∧ GivesRosesOnTV x

-- If a show gives out roses on TV, then it is an episode of The Bachelor
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, GivesRosesOnTV x → Bachelor x

-- The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people (episodes included)
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Bachelor x → PortraysRealPeople x

-- All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, PortraysRealPeople x → RealityTV x

-- Breaking Bad facts

-- The claim in question: Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm
