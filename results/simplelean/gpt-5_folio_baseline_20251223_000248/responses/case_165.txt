-- Some show airing at 8 pm on Monday gives out roses on TV.
axiom E1 : ∃ s : obj, Show s ∧ AirsMon8 s ∧ GivesRoses s
-- If a show gives out roses on TV, then the show is an episode of The Bachelor.
axiom R1 : ∀ s : obj, GivesRoses s → EpisodeOfBachelor s
-- The Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.
axiom T1 : PortraysReal TheBachelor
-- All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.
axiom R2 : ∀ s : obj, PortraysReal s → RealityTV s
-- Breaking Bad is a show.
axiom T2 : Show BreakingBad
-- Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.
axiom T3 : ¬ RealityTV BreakingBad

-- Goal: GivesRoses BreakingBad → AirsMon8 BreakingBad
-- From the given axioms, there is no link from EpisodeOfBachelor to PortraysReal (or RealityTV) for that episode,
-- so we cannot derive ¬ GivesRoses BreakingBad to make the implication vacuously true.
-- We also cannot derive AirsMon8 BreakingBad directly.
-- Hence, neither the statement nor its negation is provable from the given information.
