axiom obj : Type
axiom HeinrichSchmidt : obj
axiom Politician : obj → Prop
axiom NaziReichstag : obj → Prop

-- Facts from the context
axiom H1 : Politician HeinrichSchmidt
axiom H2 : NaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt

-- The statement in question would be: ∀ x, Politician x → ¬ NaziReichstag x
-- This is false because HeinrichSchmidt is both a politician and in the Nazi Reichstag.

-- Provide a direct counterexample as existence
theorem counterexample_exists : ∃ x : obj, Politician x ∧ NaziReichstag x :=
Exists.intro HeinrichSchmidt (And.intro H1 H2)

-- Prove the negation of the universal claim
theorem negate_claim : ¬ (∀ x : obj, Politician x → ¬ NaziReichstag x) :=
by
  intro h
  have hH : Politician HeinrichSchmidt → ¬ NaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt := h HeinrichSchmidt
  have notNR : ¬ NaziReichstag HeinrichSchmidt := hH H1
  exact notNR H2
