-- If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Deadly x → LowSurvival x
-- Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, SevereCancer x → Deadly x
-- Bile duct cancer is a severe cancer.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x
-- All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x
-- Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
axiom T1 : LowSurvival MildFlu
-- Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.
axiom T2 : ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvival ColorectalCancer)

-- A derived lemma (does not answer the main question):
-- If colorectal cancer were severe, it would not be bile duct cancer.
theorem severe_implies_not_bile :
  SevereCancer ColorectalCancer → ¬ BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer := by
  intro hsev
  have hdead : Deadly ColorectalCancer := R2 ColorectalCancer hsev
  have hlow : LowSurvival ColorectalCancer := R1 ColorectalCancer hdead
  intro hbile
  exact T2 (And.intro hbile hlow)

-- Cannot prove SevereCancer ColorectalCancer or its negation from the given axioms.
