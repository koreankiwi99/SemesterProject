-- All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Rabbit x ∧ Spotted x → Cute x
-- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x
-- The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Spotted x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x)
-- If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
-- All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Squirrel x ∧ Spotted x → Skittish x
-- Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
axiom A6 : Spotted Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

theorem spotted_Rockie : Spotted Rockie := And.left A6
theorem calm_Rockie : Calm Rockie := And.right A6

theorem not_squirrel_Rockie : ¬ Squirrel Rockie := by
  intro hS
  have sp : Spotted Rockie := spotted_Rockie
  have sk : Skittish Rockie := A5 Rockie (And.intro hS sp)
  have ncalm : ¬ Calm Rockie := A4 Rockie sk
  exact ncalm calm_Rockie

theorem rabbit_Rockie : Rabbit Rockie := by
  have sp : Spotted Rockie := spotted_Rockie
  have disj : Rabbit Rockie ∨ Squirrel Rockie := A3 Rockie sp
  cases disj with
  | inl hr => exact hr
  | inr hs => exact False.elim (not_squirrel_Rockie hs)

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive either ¬ Turtle Rockie or Turtle Rockie.
-- Hence the statement "Rockie is not a turtle" cannot be proven or refuted here.
