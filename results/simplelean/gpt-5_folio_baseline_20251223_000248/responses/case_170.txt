axiom ColorectalCancer : obj

-- If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Deadly x → LowSurvival x
-- Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, SevereCancer x → Deadly x
-- Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x
-- All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x
-- Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, MildFlu x → LowSurvival x
-- Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.
axiom A6 : ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvival ColorectalCancer)

-- If colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer or a form of Cholangiocarcinoma,
-- then colorectal cancer is a kind of bile duct cancer and a kind of mild flu.
