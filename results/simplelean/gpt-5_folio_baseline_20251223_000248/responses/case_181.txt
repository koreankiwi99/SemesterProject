-- No one nice to animals is also mean to animals.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, NiceToAnimals x → ¬ MeanToAnimals x
-- Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : Person, Grumpy x ∧ MeanToAnimals x
-- All animal lovers are nice to animals.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, AnimalLover x → NiceToAnimals x
-- All pet owners love animals.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, PetOwner x → AnimalLover x
-- Tom is a pet owner.
axiom A5 : PetOwner Tom

-- We can derive that Tom is not mean to animals.
theorem not_mean_Tom : ¬ MeanToAnimals Tom :=
  A1 Tom ((A3 Tom) ((A4 Tom) A5))

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive Grumpy Tom or ¬ Grumpy Tom.
-- Therefore, the statement "Tom is a grumpy person" is not provable nor refutable here.
