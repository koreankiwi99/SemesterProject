axiom ActivateLegMuscles : obj → Prop

-- Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
axiom H1 : ∃ x : obj, ProBBall x ∧ ¬ American x
-- All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
axiom H2 : ∀ x : obj, ProBBall x → CanJumpShot x
-- If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
axiom H3 : ∀ x : obj, CanJumpShot x → LeapStraight x
-- If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles.
axiom H4 : ∀ x : obj, LeapStraight x → ActivateLegMuscles x
-- Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.
axiom H5 : ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri

-- From the rules, if Yuri were a professional basketball player, he'd activate his leg muscles,
-- which contradicts H5. Hence, Yuri is not a professional basketball player.

-- Cannot derive American Yuri or ¬ American Yuri from the given information.
