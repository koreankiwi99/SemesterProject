axiom obj : Type
axiom Happy : obj → Prop
axiom Sad : obj → Prop

-- Premises:
-- 1) Every event is happy or sad (not necessarily exclusively).
axiom either_happy_or_sad : ∀ x : obj, Happy x ∨ Sad x
-- 2) At least one event is happy.
axiom exists_happy : ∃ x : obj, Happy x

-- Question: Are all events sad?
-- From the given premises, we cannot derive ∀ x, Sad x.
-- Also, without exclusivity, we cannot derive its negation ∃ x, ¬ Sad x.
-- Hence the truth of "All events are sad" is not determined by the premises.
