-- Facts from the context
axiom W1 : Winner Steinhauer
axiom P_Steinhauer : Participated Steinhauer

-- The six-way tie was on the leaderboard: anyone in the tie is on the leaderboard
axiom TieOnLeaderboard : ∀ x : obj, InSixWayTie1992 x → OnLeaderboard1992 x

-- There exists a person in the six-way tie who is from Belgium
axiom ExistsBelgianInTie : ∃ x : obj, InSixWayTie1992 x ∧ FromBelgium x

-- Descampe is from Belgium and on the leaderboard
axiom D_belg : FromBelgium Descampe
axiom D_lead : OnLeaderboard1992 Descampe

-- All people on the leaderboard participated
axiom LeadParticipated : ∀ x : obj, OnLeaderboard1992 x → Participated x

-- Goal: InSixWayTie1992 Descampe
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive InSixWayTie1992 Descampe,
-- nor can we derive its negation.
