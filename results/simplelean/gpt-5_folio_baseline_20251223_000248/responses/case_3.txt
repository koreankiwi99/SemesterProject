-- 1. Employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will appear in the company today.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ SchedulesWithCustomers x → AppearCompanyToday x
-- 2. Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, LunchCompany x → SchedulesWithCustomers x
-- 3. Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → LunchCompany x ∨ LunchHome x
-- 4. If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ LunchHome x → WorkRemoteHome x
-- 5. All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → WorkRemoteHome x
-- 6. No managers work remotely from home.
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬ WorkRemoteHome x
-- 7. James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom R7 : AppearCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- From these axioms, we cannot derive LunchCompany James or its negation.
-- Note: We lack assumptions that James is an employee, so rules (3) and (4) may not apply to him.
-- Also, while LunchCompany James → SchedulesWithCustomers James (R2) and then (if Employee James) → AppearCompanyToday James (R1),
-- we do not know Employee James, and R7 does not yield LunchCompany James from Manager James.
-- Hence the statement is not derivable, nor is its negation.
