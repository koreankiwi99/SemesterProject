-- We can derive that Djokovic is well-paid, regardless of the disjunction.
theorem well_paid_dj : WellPaid Djokovic :=
by
  have disj : GrandSlamChampion Djokovic ∨ OscarNominatedActor Djokovic := Mix1 Djokovic DjAt
  cases disj with
  | inl gsc =>
      have pro : ProfessionalTennisPlayer Djokovic := Mix2 Djokovic DjAt gsc

-- Target in question: GrandSlamChampion Djokovic
-- From Mix1 and DjAt, we only get GrandSlamChampion Djokovic ∨ OscarNominatedActor Djokovic.
-- There is no way to eliminate the Oscar alternative or derive a contradiction from it,
-- so we cannot prove GrandSlamChampion Djokovic or its negation from the given axioms.
