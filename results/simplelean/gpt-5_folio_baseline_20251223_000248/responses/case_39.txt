axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates
axiom ZahaStyle : obj → Prop
axiom KellyStyle : obj → Prop
axiom Adores : obj → Prop           -- Max adores this item
axiom Interesting : obj → Prop      -- has interesting geometries
axiom Brutalist : obj → Prop        -- is a brutalist building
axiom Evocative : obj → Prop
axiom Dreamy : obj → Prop
axiom DesignByMax : obj → Prop      -- is a design by Max

-- Axioms from the context
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, ZahaStyle x ∧ Adores x → Interesting x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Brutalist x ∧ Adores x → ¬ Interesting x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Adores x → (ZahaStyle x ∨ KellyStyle x)
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, KellyStyle x ∧ Adores x → Evocative x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, KellyStyle x ∧ Adores x → Dreamy x
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x ∧ Adores x ∧ Interesting x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- The claim in question (interpreted as existential): 
-- "A design by Max is a brutalist building."
def Claim : Prop := ∃ x : obj, DesignByMax x ∧ Brutalist x

-- This claim (existence of a design-by-Max that is brutalist) cannot be proven from the given axioms.
-- Its negation (that no design-by-Max is brutalist) also cannot be proven from the given axioms.

-- However, we can derive a related consequence:
-- There is no design by Max that he adores which has interesting geometries.
