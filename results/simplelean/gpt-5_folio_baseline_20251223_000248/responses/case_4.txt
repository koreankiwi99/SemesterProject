-- 1. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ Schedules x → InCompanyToday x
-- 2. Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, LunchInCompany x → Schedules x
-- 3. Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → LunchInCompany x ∨ LunchAtHome x
-- 4. If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → WFH x
-- 5. All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → WFH x
-- 6. No managers work remotely from home.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬ WFH x
-- 7. James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom A7 : InCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Some derived consequences (do not settle the main question):

theorem schedules_of_lunch_company (x : obj) : LunchInCompany x → Schedules x :=
  A2 x

theorem manager_of_employee_lunch_company :
  Employee James ∧ LunchInCompany James → Manager James := by
  intro h
  have h_emp : Employee James := And.left h
  have h_lunch : LunchInCompany James := And.right h
  have h_sched : Schedules James := A2 James h_lunch
  have h_in : InCompanyToday James := A1 James (And.intro h_emp h_sched)
  exact (Iff.mp A7) h_in

theorem not_manager_of_employee_lunch_home :
  Employee James ∧ LunchAtHome James → ¬ Manager James := by
  intro h
  have h_wfh : WFH James := A4 James (And.intro h.left h.right)
  intro h_mgr
  have h_notwfh : ¬ WFH James := A6 James h_mgr
  exact h_notwfh h_wfh

-- We cannot derive ¬ LunchInCompany James nor LunchInCompany James from the given axioms,
-- since we have no assumption that James is an Employee (needed to connect lunch to appearance).
-- Thus the truth of "James does not have lunch in the company" is not provable here.
