-- All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Zaha x ∧ Adores x → Interesting x
-- No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Brutalist x ∧ Adores x → ¬ Interesting x
-- Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Adores x → (Zaha x ∨ Kelly x)
-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Kelly x ∧ Adores x → Evocative x
-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Kelly x ∧ Adores x → Dreamy x
-- If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then it is a brutalist building and evocative.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x ∧ Adores x ∧ Interesting x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- We can show: every design by Max that he adores is evocative or dreamy.
