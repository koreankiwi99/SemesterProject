axiom obj : Type
axiom Cat : obj → Prop
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom Pet : obj → Prop

-- All cats are mammals
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Cat x → Mammal x
-- Some pets are not mammals
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Pet x ∧ ¬ Mammal x

-- From the given axioms, we can derive that there exists a pet that is not a cat.
theorem exists_pet_not_cat : ∃ x : obj, Pet x ∧ ¬ Cat x := by
  rcases A2 with ⟨x, hx⟩
  rcases hx with ⟨hxPet, hxNotMam⟩
  refine ⟨x, ?_⟩
  apply And.intro hxPet
  intro hxCat
  have hMam : Mammal x := A1 x hxCat
  exact hxNotMam hMam

-- Target statement: "No pets are cats" ≡ ∀ x, Pet x → ¬ Cat x
-- From A1 and A2, we cannot prove this universal statement,
-- nor can we prove its negation (∃ x, Pet x ∧ Cat x).
-- The existence of a pet that is not a mammal only shows some pet is not a cat,
-- but does not rule out the possibility that some other pet is a cat.
