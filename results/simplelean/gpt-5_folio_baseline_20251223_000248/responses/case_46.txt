axiom person : Type
axiom season : Type
axiom Spring : season
axiom Summer : season
axiom Fall : season
axiom Winter : season

axiom Emma : person
axiom Mia : person
axiom James : person

axiom Favorite : person → season
axiom Student : person → Prop
axiom WantLongVacation : person → Prop

-- All students who want a long vacation have summer as their favorite season
axiom R1 : ∀ x : person, Student x ∧ WantLongVacation x → Favorite x = Summer

-- Emma's favorite season is summer
axiom T1 : Favorite Emma = Summer

-- Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's
axiom T2 : Favorite Mia ≠ Favorite Emma

-- James wants to have a long vacation
axiom T3 : WantLongVacation James

-- From T1 and T2, we can deduce that Mia's favorite season is not summer
theorem Mia_not_summer : Favorite Mia ≠ Summer := by
  intro h
  have : Favorite Mia = Favorite Emma := by
    calc
      Favorite Mia = Summer := h
      _ = Favorite Emma := by simpa using Eq.symm T1
  exact T2 this

-- We cannot prove Favorite James = Summer from the given axioms since we do not know James is a student.
-- Likewise, we cannot prove its negation.
-- theorem james_fav_summer : Favorite James = Summer := by
--   sorry
