axiom Person : Type
axiom Season : Type

axiom Emma : Person
axiom Mia : Person
axiom James : Person

axiom Spring : Season
axiom Summer : Season
axiom Fall : Season
axiom Winter : Season

axiom Fav : Person → Season

axiom Student : Person → Prop
axiom WantsLongVacation : Person → Prop

-- All students who want a long vacation have summer as their favorite season
axiom R1 : ∀ p : Person, Student p ∧ WantsLongVacation p → Fav p = Summer

-- Emma's favorite season is summer
axiom E1 : Fav Emma = Summer

-- Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's
axiom M1 : Fav Mia ≠ Fav Emma

-- James wants to have a long vacation
axiom J1 : WantsLongVacation James

-- From M1 and E1, we can conclude Mia does not favor summer
theorem mia_not_summer : Fav Mia ≠ Summer := by
  simpa [E1] using M1

-- Cannot prove Fav Mia = Spring or its negation from the given axioms
