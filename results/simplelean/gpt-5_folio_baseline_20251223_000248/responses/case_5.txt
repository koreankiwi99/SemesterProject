axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj

-- Predicates
axiom Employee : obj → Prop
axiom Manager : obj → Prop
axiom InOtherCountries : obj → Prop
axiom LunchAtHome : obj → Prop
axiom LunchInCompanyBuilding : obj → Prop
axiom RemoteFromHome : obj → Prop
axiom SchedulesMeetingWithCustomers : obj → Prop
axiom InCompanyToday : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
-- 1. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ SchedulesMeetingWithCustomers x → InCompanyToday x

-- 2. Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, LunchInCompanyBuilding x → SchedulesMeetingWithCustomers x

-- 3. Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → (LunchInCompanyBuilding x ∨ LunchAtHome x)

-- 4. If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → RemoteFromHome x

-- 5. All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → RemoteFromHome x

-- 6. No managers work remotely from home.
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬ RemoteFromHome x

-- 7. James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom R7 : InCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Target statement (as a single proposition combining the two implications):
def Target : Prop :=
  ((Manager James ∨ InOtherCountries James) → ¬ (LunchAtHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James)) ∧
  ((LunchAtHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James) → (¬ Manager James ∧ ¬ InOtherCountries James))

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive Target or its negation.
-- Reasons (informal):
-- - We do not know James is an Employee, so LunchAtHome James does not imply RemoteFromHome James.
-- - InOtherCountries James does not imply RemoteFromHome James unless James is an Employee.
-- - We can show RemoteFromHome James → ¬ Manager James (using R6), but this is insufficient to get the full second implication,
--   especially the ¬ InOtherCountries James part.
-- Hence neither Target nor ¬ Target is derivable.
