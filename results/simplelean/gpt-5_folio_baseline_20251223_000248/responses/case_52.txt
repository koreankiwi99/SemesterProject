-- All Romance languages are Indo-European languages.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Lang, Romance x → IndoEuropean x
-- Romance languages are a language family, and all languages within a language family are related to each other.
-- Hence, any two Romance languages are related.

-- French and Spanish are Romance languages.
axiom A3 : Romance French
axiom A4 : Romance Spanish
-- German is related to Spanish.
axiom A5 : Related German Spanish
-- Basque is not related to any other language (other than itself).
axiom A6 : ∀ y : Lang, y ≠ Basque → ¬ Related Basque y ∧ ¬ Related y Basque
