axiom InternationalUS : obj → Prop
axiom International : obj → Prop

axiom J1 : obj → Prop
axiom WantsWorkUS : obj → Prop
axiom NeedsCPT : obj → Prop
axiom NeedsOPT : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
-- International students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, InternationalUS x → (F1 x ∨ J1 x)

-- An international student in the US with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT if the student wants to work in the US.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InternationalUS x → F1 x → WantsWorkUS x → (NeedsCPT x ∨ NeedsOPT x)

-- Mike is an international student. (Not necessarily specified to be in the US.)
axiom A3 : International Mike

-- Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.
axiom A4 : WantsWorkUS Mike → NeedsCPT Mike

-- From these, we cannot derive J1 Mike or ¬ J1 Mike, since we lack information that Mike is an international student in the US or about his visa status.
-- Hence, the truth of "Mike has a J1 visa" is undecidable from the given information.
