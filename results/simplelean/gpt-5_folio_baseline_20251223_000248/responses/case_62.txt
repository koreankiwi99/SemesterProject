axiom Ted : obj

-- All Brown Swiss cattle are cows.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, BrownSwiss x → Cow x
-- Some pets are Brown Swiss cattle.
axiom E1 : ∃ x : obj, Pet x ∧ BrownSwiss x
-- All cows are domesticated animals.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Cow x → Domesticated x
-- Alligators are not domesticated animals.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Alligator x → ¬ Domesticated x
-- Ted is an alligator.
axiom T1 : Alligator Ted

-- Derivable facts (do not determine whether Ted is a pet):
theorem not_dom_Ted : ¬ Domesticated Ted := by
  apply R3 Ted
  exact T1

theorem not_cow_Ted : ¬ Cow Ted := by
  intro hCow
  apply not_dom_Ted
  exact R2 Ted hCow

theorem not_brownswiss_Ted : ¬ BrownSwiss Ted := by
  intro hBS
  have hCow : Cow Ted := R1 Ted hBS
  exact not_cow_Ted hCow

-- Cannot prove Pet Ted or ¬ Pet Ted from the given axioms.
