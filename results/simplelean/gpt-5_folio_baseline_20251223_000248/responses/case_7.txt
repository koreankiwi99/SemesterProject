axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom MonkeypoxVirusOccurs : obj → Prop
axiom Monkeypox : obj → Prop
axiom Fever : obj → Prop
axiom Headache : obj → Prop
axiom MusclePains : obj → Prop
axiom Tired : obj → Prop
axiom Flu : obj → Prop
axiom Person : obj → Prop
axiom CanOccurMonkeypoxVirus : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
-- When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox (modeled as implication)
axiom R_occurs_mpxv : ∀ x : obj, MonkeypoxVirusOccurs x → Monkeypox x
-- Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals (modeled as existence of animals where it can occur)
axiom E_can_occur_some_animals : ∃ x : obj, Animal x ∧ CanOccurMonkeypoxVirus x
-- Humans are mammals; Mammals are animals
axiom R_human_mammal : ∀ x : obj, Human x → Mammal x
axiom R_mammal_animal : ∀ x : obj, Mammal x → Animal x
-- Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness
axiom R_mpx_fever : ∀ x : obj, Monkeypox x → Fever x
axiom R_mpx_headache : ∀ x : obj, Monkeypox x → Headache x
axiom R_mpx_muscle : ∀ x : obj, Monkeypox x → MusclePains x
axiom R_mpx_tired : ∀ x : obj, Monkeypox x → Tired x
-- People feel tired when they get the flu
axiom R_flu_tired_people : ∀ x : obj, Person x → Flu x → Tired x

-- The statement to assess: "No one gets the flu." i.e., ∀ x, ¬ Flu x
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive ∀ x, ¬ Flu x, nor can we derive ∃ x, Flu x.
-- Hence the truth value is uncertain in this theory.
