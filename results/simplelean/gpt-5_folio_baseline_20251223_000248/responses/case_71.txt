-- All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Growth x → BoughtRapid x
-- If a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, BoughtRapid x → ¬ SuitableForRetirement x
-- Some stocks are growth stocks.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, Stock x ∧ Growth x
-- All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Mature x → SuitableForRetirement x
-- KO is a mature stock (we capture the 'mature' part explicitly).
axiom A5 : Mature KO

-- From maturity, KO is suitable; from growth, KO would be not suitable. Hence KO is not a growth stock.
lemma not_growth_KO : ¬ Growth KO := by
  intro hG
  have hB : BoughtRapid KO := A1 KO hG
  have hNotS : ¬ SuitableForRetirement KO := A2 KO hB
  have hS : SuitableForRetirement KO := A4 KO A5
  exact hNotS hS

-- Therefore, KO cannot be both a stock and a growth stock.
theorem ko_not_stock_and_growth : ¬ (Stock KO ∧ Growth KO) := by
