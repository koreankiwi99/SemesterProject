-- All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Growth x → Rapid x

-- If a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Rapid x → ¬ Suitable x

-- Some stocks are growth stocks.
axiom R3 : ∃ x : obj, Stock x ∧ Growth x

-- All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Mature x → Suitable x

-- KO is a mature stock.
axiom T1 : Mature KO

-- Question statement:
-- If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation,
-- then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.
