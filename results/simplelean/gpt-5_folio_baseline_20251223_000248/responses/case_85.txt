-- If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then it has not received many negative reviews.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, YelpRec x → ¬ ManyNeg x
-- All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, RatingGT4 x → YelpRec x
-- Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, ¬ Takeout x ∧ ManyNeg x
-- All restaurants popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Popular x → RatingGT4 x
-- The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.
axiom A5 : RatingGT4 HamdenPlaza ∨ Popular HamdenPlaza

-- Derivable facts:
theorem rating_hamden : RatingGT4 HamdenPlaza := by
  cases A5 with
  | inl h => exact h
  | inr pop => exact A4 HamdenPlaza pop

theorem not_manyneg_hamden : ¬ ManyNeg HamdenPlaza := by
  have r : RatingGT4 HamdenPlaza := by
    cases A5 with
    | inl h => exact h
    | inr pop => exact A4 HamdenPlaza pop
  have y : YelpRec HamdenPlaza := A2 HamdenPlaza r
  exact A1 HamdenPlaza y

-- Target statement: ¬ Takeout HamdenPlaza
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive ¬ Takeout HamdenPlaza or its negation.
-- The existential A3 does not identify HamdenPlaza, and there is no link from (not) takeout to rating/popularity/YelpRec sufficient to decide Takeout HamdenPlaza.
