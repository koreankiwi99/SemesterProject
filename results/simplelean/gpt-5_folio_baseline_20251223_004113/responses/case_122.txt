-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Multi x → ¬ OneSeater x
-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Tesla3 x → Multi x
-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatElectric x → OneSeater x
-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectric x
-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
axiom A5 : ¬ Tesla3 JohnCar → (¬ Tesla3 JohnCar ∨ SingleSeatElectric JohnCar)

-- Some derived consequences:
theorem Tesla3_implies_not_OneSeater : ∀ x : obj, Tesla3 x → ¬ OneSeater x := by
  intro x hT
  exact (A1 x) ((A2 x) hT)

theorem SoloEV_implies_OneSeater : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → OneSeater x := by
  intro x hS
  exact (A3 x) ((A4 x) hS)

theorem Tesla3_implies_not_SoloEV : ∀ x : obj, Tesla3 x → ¬ SoloEV x := by
  intro x hT hS
  have hOne : OneSeater x := (A3 x) ((A4 x) hS)
  have hNotOne : ¬ OneSeater x := (A1 x) ((A2 x) hT)
  exact hNotOne hOne

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive SoloEV JohnCar or its negation.
-- No theorem for SoloEV JohnCar can be proved or refuted with the current information.
