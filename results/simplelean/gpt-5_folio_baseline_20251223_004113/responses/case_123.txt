axiom SoloEV : obj → Prop

-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then it is not a one-seater.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, TransportMultiplePassengers x → ¬ OneSeater x
-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, TeslaModel3 x → TransportMultiplePassengers x
-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x
-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x
-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
axiom A5 : ¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar → (¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar ∨ SingleSeatElectricCar JohnCar)

-- Some derived consequences:
theorem tesla_not_oneseater : ∀ x : obj, TeslaModel3 x → ¬ OneSeater x := by
  intro x hx
  exact A1 x (A2 x hx)

theorem soloev_oneseater : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → OneSeater x := by
  intro x hx
  exact A3 x (A4 x hx)

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive ¬ SoloEV JohnCar nor SoloEV JohnCar.
-- Hence the truth value of "John's car is not a Solo EV" is not determined.
