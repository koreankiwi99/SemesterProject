-- All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, MakesPlans x → Engaged x
-- All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Person, InvitesOthers x → MakesPlans x
-- Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : Person, WellAttended x → InvitesOthers x
-- Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom Ex : ∃ x : Person, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and makes wedding plans.
axiom J1 : Engaged John → (¬ InvitesFriends John ∧ MakesPlans John)
-- If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom J2 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InvitesFriends John)

-- Useful derived fact: If John has a well-attended wedding, then John is engaged.
theorem wa_john_implies_engaged : WellAttended John → Engaged John :=
  fun h => R1 John (R2 John (R3 John h))

-- From the given information, we cannot derive ¬ LargerFamily John or LargerFamily John.
-- Hence, the statement "John does not have a larger family" is not provable nor is its negation.
