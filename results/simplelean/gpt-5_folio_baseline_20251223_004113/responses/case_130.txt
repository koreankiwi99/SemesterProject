axiom obj : Type
axiom John : obj

-- Predicates
axiom MakePlans : obj → Prop
axiom Engaged : obj → Prop
axiom InviteOthers : obj → Prop      -- invites others to come to their ceremony (their wedding)
axiom InviteFriends : obj → Prop     -- invites friends to their ceremony
axiom WellAttended : obj → Prop      -- has a well-attended wedding
axiom LargeFamily : obj → Prop       -- has a larger family

-- Axioms from the context
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MakePlans x → Engaged x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
axiom A4 : ∃ x : obj, WellAttended x ∧ LargeFamily x
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬InviteFriends John ∧ MakePlans John)
axiom A6 : LargeFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- Goal statement: ¬LargeFamily John ∧ ¬InviteOthers John
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive either this conjunction
-- nor its negation (which would assert LargeFamily John ∨ InviteOthers John).
-- Hence we leave the statement undecided.
-- No theorem can be proved or refuted with the provided information.
