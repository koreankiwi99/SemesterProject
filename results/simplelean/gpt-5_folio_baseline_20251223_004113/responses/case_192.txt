axiom Event : Type
axiom Happy : Event → Prop
axiom Sad : Event → Prop
-- Events are either happy or sad (inclusive or)
axiom A1 : ∀ e : Event, Happy e ∨ Sad e
-- At least one event is happy
axiom A2 : ∃ e : Event, Happy e
-- From these, we cannot derive that all events are sad, nor can we refute it
-- because a happy event might also be sad (inclusive or).
-- Hence we cannot prove ∀ e, Sad e or its negation.
