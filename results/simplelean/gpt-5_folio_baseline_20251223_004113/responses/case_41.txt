axiom DesignByMax : obj → Prop
axiom Adored : obj → Prop
axiom ZahaStyle : obj → Prop
axiom KellyStyle : obj → Prop
axiom Style : obj → Prop
axiom InterestingGeom : obj → Prop
axiom BrutalistBldg : obj → Prop
axiom Evocative : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
-- 1. All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, ZahaStyle x ∧ Adored x → InterestingGeom x

-- 2. No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, BrutalistBldg x ∧ Adored x → ¬ InterestingGeom x

-- 3. Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Style x ∧ Adored x → ZahaStyle x ∨ KellyStyle x

-- 4. All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, KellyStyle x ∧ Adored x → Evocative x

-- 5. All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, KellyStyle x ∧ Adored x → Dreamy x

-- 6. If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then it is a brutalist building and evocative.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x ∧ Adored x ∧ InterestingGeom x → BrutalistBldg x ∧ Evocative x

-- Goal statement in question:
-- "A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy."
-- Formalization: ∀ x, DesignByMax x → Evocative x ∨ Dreamy x
-- From the given axioms, there is no way to derive this universal claim,
-- nor its negation (which would require existence of a counterexample).
-- Hence, it is not provable or refutable here.

-- theorems not provable from the given axioms:
-- theorem claim : ∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x → Evocative x ∨ Dreamy x := by
--   sorry

-- theorem not_claim : ¬ (∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x → Evocative x ∨ Dreamy x) := by
--   sorry
