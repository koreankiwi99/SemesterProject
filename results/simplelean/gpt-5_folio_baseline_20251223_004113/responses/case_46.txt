axiom favorite : Person → Season
axiom Student : Person → Prop
axiom WantsLongVacation : Person → Prop

-- All students who want a long vacation have summer as their favorite season
axiom Rule : ∀ x : Person, Student x ∧ WantsLongVacation x → favorite x = Summer

-- Emma's favorite season is summer
axiom EmmaFav : favorite Emma = Summer

-- Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's
axiom MiaNotEmma : favorite Mia ≠ favorite Emma

-- James wants to have a long vacation
axiom JamesWants : WantsLongVacation James

-- A derivable fact: Mia's favorite season is not Summer
theorem mia_not_summer : favorite Mia ≠ Summer := by
  intro h
  have h' : favorite Mia = favorite Emma := Eq.trans h (Eq.symm EmmaFav)
  exact MiaNotEmma h'

-- Cannot prove favorite James = Summer without knowing that James is a Student.
-- Also cannot prove its negation from the given axioms.
