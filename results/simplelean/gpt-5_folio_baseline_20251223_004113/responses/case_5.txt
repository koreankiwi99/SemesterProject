-- 1. Employees who schedule a meeting go to the company building today.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ SchedulesMeeting x → InCompanyToday x
-- 2. Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, LunchInBuilding x → SchedulesMeeting x
-- 3. Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → (LunchInBuilding x ∨ LunchAtHome x)
-- 4. If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → RemoteFromHome x
-- 5. All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → RemoteFromHome x
-- 6. No managers work remotely from home.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬ RemoteFromHome x
-- 7. James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom A7 : InCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Target statement to assess:
def Claim : Prop :=
  ((Manager James ∨ InOtherCountries James) → ¬ (LunchAtHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James))
  ∧
  ((LunchAtHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James) → (¬ Manager James ∧ ¬ InOtherCountries James))

-- From RemoteFromHome, we can derive James is not a manager (but this is not enough to prove the full Claim).
theorem remote_implies_not_manager : RemoteFromHome James → ¬ Manager James :=
  fun hR hM => (A6 James hM) hR

-- Cannot prove Claim or its negation from given axioms.
