axiom KO : obj

-- All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Growth x → BoughtRapid x
-- If a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, BoughtRapid x → ¬ Suitable x
-- Some stocks are growth stocks.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, Stock x ∧ Growth x
-- All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Mature x → Suitable x
-- KO is a mature stock.
axiom A5 : Mature KO

-- Derived: Mature things are not bought for rapid profit (from A2 and A4).
theorem mature_not_bought : ∀ x : obj, Mature x → ¬ BoughtRapid x := by
  intro x hx hb
  have hs : Suitable x := A4 x hx
  have hns : ¬ Suitable x := A2 x hb
  exact hns hs

-- Goal: KO is a stock.
-- From the given information, we cannot derive Stock KO nor ¬ Stock KO.
-- theorem ko_is_stock : Stock KO := ?
-- theorem ko_not_stock : ¬ Stock KO := ?
