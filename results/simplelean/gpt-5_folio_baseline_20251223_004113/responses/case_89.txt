-- When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.
axiom R1 : ∀ p b, Person p → Book b → Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p
-- If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.
axiom R2 : ∀ p, GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p

-- Harry read the book “Walden”
axiom H_person : Person Harry
axiom W_book : Book Walden
axiom H_read_W : Reads Harry Walden

-- A smarter person has gained knowledge (there exists someone who is both smarter and has gained knowledge).
