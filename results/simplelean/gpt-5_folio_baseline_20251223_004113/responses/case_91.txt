axiom OutputTextSeq : obj → Prop

-- A natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.
axiom R1 : ∀ t : obj, NLP t → (Generation t ∨ Understanding t)
-- If the output of a natural language processing task is a text sequence, then it is a language generation task.
axiom R2 : ∀ t : obj, OutputTextSeq t → Generation t
-- Machine translation is a natural language processing task.
axiom T1 : NLP MT
-- The output of machine translation is a text sequence.
axiom T2 : OutputTextSeq MT

-- We can prove machine translation is a language generation task.
theorem mt_generation : Generation MT := R2 MT T2

-- From the given axioms, we cannot prove Understanding MT or ¬Understanding MT.
-- No contradiction arises from MT being both Generation and Understanding,
-- since exclusivity was not stated.
