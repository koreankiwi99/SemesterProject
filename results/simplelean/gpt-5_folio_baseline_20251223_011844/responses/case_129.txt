-- 1. All who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MakePlans x → Engaged x
-- 2. All who invite others to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
-- 3. Anyone with a well-attended wedding invites others to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
-- 4. Some people with well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : obj, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- 5. If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends and makes wedding plans.
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬ InviteFriends John ∧ MakePlans John)
-- 6. If John has a larger family, then either his wedding is well-attended or he invites friends.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)
