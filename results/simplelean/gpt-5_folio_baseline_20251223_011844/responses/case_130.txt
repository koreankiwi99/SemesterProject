axiom Person : Type

axiom WellAttended : Person → Prop
axiom LargerFamily : Person → Prop
axiom InviteFriends : Person → Prop

-- 1. All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, MakePlans x → Engaged x
-- 2. All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
-- 3. Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
-- 4. Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : Person, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- 5. If John is engaged, then John does not (invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans).
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InviteFriends John ∧ MakePlans John)
-- 6. If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- Goal: John neither has a larger family nor invites others to his wedding:
--       ¬ LargerFamily John ∧ ¬ InviteOthers John
-- From the given axioms, this cannot be derived, nor can its negation (LargerFamily John ∨ InviteOthers John) be derived.
-- Hence, the truth value is undetermined from the premises.
