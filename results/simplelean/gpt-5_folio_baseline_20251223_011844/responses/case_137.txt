-- The specific algorithm used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model
axiom A : Alg

-- Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement
axiom categorize : ∀ a : Alg, Learning a → (Supervised a ∨ Unsupervised a ∨ Reinforcement a)

-- Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data
axiom unsup_no_labels : ∀ a : Alg, Unsupervised a → ¬ RequiresLabels a

-- The ML algorithm used for training the text summarization model requires labeled data
axiom requires_A : RequiresLabels A

-- The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms (so A is ML)
axiom learning_A : Learning A

-- Reinforcement learning is not used to train the model (so A is not reinforcement)
axiom not_rl_A : ¬ Reinforcement A
