-- If George likes music, he wants to compose.
axiom A1 : LikesMusic George → WantsCompose George
-- If George has access to a program, he can compose.
axiom A2 : HasAccessProgram George → CanCompose George
-- If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.
axiom A3 : CanCompose George ∧ WantsCompose George → WillCompose George

-- From A3 we can derive: if George will not compose, then it is not the case that he both can compose and wants to compose.
theorem not_will_implies_not_can_and_want :
  ¬ WillCompose George → ¬ (CanCompose George ∧ WantsCompose George) := by
  intro hNotWill hCanAndWant
  apply hNotWill
  exact A3 hCanAndWant

-- Target statement to assess:
-- S: If George will not compose, George cannot compose.
--    ¬ WillCompose George → ¬ CanCompose George
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive S, nor its negation.
-- Reason: A3 only yields ¬Will → ¬(Can ∧ Want); without an assumption that George wants to compose,
-- we cannot conclude ¬Can. Likewise, we have no derivation of ¬S.
-- Hence the truth value is not determined by the given information.
