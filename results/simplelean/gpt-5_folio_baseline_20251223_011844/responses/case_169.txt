-- If something is a deadly disease, then it comes with a low survival rate.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, DeadlyDisease x → LowSurvival x
-- Severe cancers are deadly diseases.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, SevereCancer x → DeadlyDisease x
-- Bile duct cancer is a severe form cancer.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x
-- All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x
-- Mild flu comes with a low survival rate.
axiom F1 : LowSurvival MildFlu
-- Colorectal cancer is not both a bile duct cancer and with a low survival rate.
axiom F2 : ¬ (BileDuctCancer ColorectalCancer ∧ LowSurvival ColorectalCancer)

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive SevereCancer ColorectalCancer or its negation.
