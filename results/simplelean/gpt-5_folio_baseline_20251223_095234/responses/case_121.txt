-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, CanTransportMultiplePassengers x → ¬ OneSeater x
-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, TeslaModel3 x → CanTransportMultiplePassengers x
-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x
-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x
-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
axiom R5 : ¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar → (¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar ∨ SingleSeatElectricCar JohnCar)

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive TeslaModel3 JohnCar or its negation.
-- For example, we can derive a consequence if it were a Tesla Model 3:
theorem tesla_not_one_seater (h : TeslaModel3 JohnCar) : ¬ OneSeater JohnCar :=
by
  have hm : CanTransportMultiplePassengers JohnCar := R2 JohnCar h
  exact R1 JohnCar hm

-- However, there is no information to prove TeslaModel3 JohnCar,
-- nor to prove ¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar.
