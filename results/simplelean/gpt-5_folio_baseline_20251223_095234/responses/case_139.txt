axiom Hachi : obj

-- If a film is appropriate for all ages, then children can watch it without guidance.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, AppropriateForAllAges x → ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance x
-- If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, then children cannot watch it without guidance.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, ContainsExcessiveEroticAndViolentContent x → ¬ ChildrenCanWatchWithoutGuidance x
-- If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for all ages.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, RatedGeneralAudience x → AppropriateForAllAges x
-- All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, FamilyFriendlyAnimated x → RatedGeneralAudience x
-- All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, FrozenSeries x → FamilyFriendlyAnimated x

-- Hachi is a film.
axiom T1 : Film Hachi
-- Hachi is either family-friendly animated or appropriate for all ages.
axiom T2 : FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateForAllAges Hachi

-- We would like to prove RatedGeneralAudience Hachi.
-- From the left disjunct of T2 we can derive GA via R4, but from the right disjunct (AFAA) alone we cannot derive GA,
-- since we only have GA → AFAA (R3), not its converse.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove RatedGeneralAudience Hachi nor its negation from the given information.
-- Example derivation from the left disjunct (not generally available without deciding T2):
theorem from_left_disjunct : FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi → RatedGeneralAudience Hachi :=
  fun h => R4 Hachi h
-- Cannot prove RatedGeneralAudience Hachi or ¬RatedGeneralAudience Hachi from the given axioms.
