axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Film : obj → Prop
axiom AppropriateAllAges : obj → Prop
axiom CanWatchWithoutGuidance : obj → Prop
axiom ExcessiveEroticViolent : obj → Prop
axiom RatedGA : obj → Prop
axiom FamilyFriendlyAnimated : obj → Prop
axiom InFrozenSeries : obj → Prop

-- Specific film
axiom Hachi : obj

-- Rules from the context
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Film x ∧ AppropriateAllAges x → CanWatchWithoutGuidance x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Film x ∧ ExcessiveEroticViolent x → ¬ CanWatchWithoutGuidance x
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, RatedGA x → AppropriateAllAges x
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, FamilyFriendlyAnimated x → RatedGA x
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, InFrozenSeries x → FamilyFriendlyAnimated x

-- Facts about Hachi
axiom H_film : Film Hachi
axiom H_disj : FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateAllAges Hachi

-- Derived facts
theorem H_can_watch : CanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi := by
  have hF : Film Hachi := H_film
  cases H_disj with
  | inl hffa =>
      have hga : RatedGA Hachi := R4 Hachi hffa
      have happ : AppropriateAllAges Hachi := R3 Hachi hga
      exact R1 Hachi (And.intro hF happ)
  | inr happ =>
      exact R1 Hachi (And.intro hF happ)

theorem H_not_excessive : ¬ ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi := by
  have hcw : CanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi := H_can_watch
  intro hex
  have hnot : ¬ CanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi := R2 Hachi (And.intro H_film hex)
  exact hnot hcw

-- Goal in question: ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi ∨ InFrozenSeries Hachi
-- From the above, we have ¬ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi, but no information to prove or refute InFrozenSeries Hachi.
-- Hence, we cannot prove the disjunction, nor its negation.
