axiom obj : Type
axiom Square : obj → Prop
axiom FourSided : obj → Prop
axiom Shape : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Square x → FourSided x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, FourSided x → Shape x

theorem all_squares_shapes : ∀ x : obj, Square x → Shape x := by
  intro x
  intro hx
  have h4 : FourSided x := A1 x hx
  have hs : Shape x := A2 x h4
  exact hs
