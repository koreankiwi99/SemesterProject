-- All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ SchedulesMeetingWithCustomers x → GoToCompanyBuildingToday x
-- Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, LunchInCompanyBuilding x → SchedulesMeetingWithCustomers x
-- Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x → (LunchInCompanyBuilding x ∨ LunchAtHome x)
-- If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → WorksRemotelyFromHome x
-- All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → WorksRemotelyFromHome x
-- No managers work remotely from home.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : Person, Manager x → ¬ WorksRemotelyFromHome x
-- James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom A7 : AppearsInCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Goal: LunchInCompanyBuilding James
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive LunchInCompanyBuilding James or its negation.
-- We lack facts that James is an Employee, a Manager, or appears today, and there is no link
-- between AppearsInCompanyToday and GoToCompanyBuildingToday given in the axioms.
-- Hence the statement is not provable or refutable.
