axiom obj : Type
axiom H : obj  -- Harvard Weekly Book Club

axiom BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : obj → Prop
axiom Company : obj → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : obj → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop
axiom HasLegalObligations : obj → Prop

-- All business organizations are legal entities.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
-- All companies are business organizations.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
-- All private companies are companies.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, PrivateCompany x → Company x
-- All legal entities are created under law.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
-- All legal entities have legal obligations.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → HasLegalObligations x
-- If H is created under law, then it is not a private company.
axiom A6 : CreatedUnderLaw H → ¬ PrivateCompany H

-- From the axioms, H cannot be a private company.
theorem not_private_H : ¬ PrivateCompany H :=
by
  intro hpc
  have hc : Company H := A3 H hpc
  have hbo : BusinessOrganization H := A2 H hc
  have hle : LegalEntity H := A1 H hbo
  have hcul : CreatedUnderLaw H := A4 H hle
  have hnotpc : ¬ PrivateCompany H := A6 hcul
  exact hnotpc hpc

-- Therefore, the conjunction "H has legal obligations and is a private company" is false.
theorem not_hasObligations_and_private :
  ¬ (HasLegalObligations H ∧ PrivateCompany H) :=
by
  intro h
  exact not_private_H (And.right h)
