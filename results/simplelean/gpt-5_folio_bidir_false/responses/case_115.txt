-- If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
axiom R1 : ∀ x y : Person, Man x → Man y → Taller x y → CanBlock x y

-- Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
axiom T1 : Man Michael
axiom T2 : ∀ y : Person, InMichaelsClass y → y ≠ Michael → Taller Michael y

-- If x taller than y and y taller than z then x taller than z.
axiom R2 : ∀ x y z : Person, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z

-- Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
axiom T3 : Man Peter
axiom T4 : Taller Peter Michael

-- Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
axiom R3 : ∀ p : Person, ¬JumpsWhenShooting p → CanBlock Michael p

-- Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
axiom T5 : ¬CanBlock Michael Windy

-- Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.
axiom R4 : ∀ p : Person, JumpsWhenShooting p → GreatShooter p

-- From R3 and T5 we can derive that Windy jumps when shooting (classically), hence is a great shooter.
-- Therefore we cannot prove ¬GreatShooter Windy from the given axioms.
-- Below is a derivation (using classical logic) that Windy is a great shooter.
