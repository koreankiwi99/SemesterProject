-- All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, MakePlans x → Engaged x
-- All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
-- Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
-- Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom E1 : ∃ x : obj, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- If John is engaged, then John does not (invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans).
axiom J1 : Engaged John → ¬(InviteFriends John ∧ MakePlans John)
-- If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom J2 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- Cannot prove LargerFamily John from given axioms
