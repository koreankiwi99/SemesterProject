axiom obj : Type
axiom John : obj

axiom Engaged : obj → Prop
axiom MakePlans : obj → Prop
axiom Invite : obj → Prop               -- invites others to come to their ceremony
axiom InviteFriends : obj → Prop        -- invites friends to their ceremony
axiom WellAttended : obj → Prop
axiom LargerFamily : obj → Prop

-- All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MakePlans x → Engaged x

-- All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Invite x → MakePlans x

-- Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → Invite x

-- Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : obj, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x

-- If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and makes wedding plans.
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬InviteFriends John) ∧ MakePlans John

-- If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- From the given axioms, there is no derivation of ¬Engaged John.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation of the statement "John is engaged."
