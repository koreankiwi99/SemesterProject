-- All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Rabbit x ∧ Spotted x → Cute x
-- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x
-- The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Spotted x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x)
-- If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Skittish x → ¬Calm x
-- All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Squirrel x ∧ Spotted x → Skittish x
-- Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
axiom A6 : Spotted Rockie ∧ Calm Rockie

theorem spotted_R : Spotted Rockie := And.left A6
theorem calm_R : Calm Rockie := And.right A6

theorem not_squirrel_R : ¬ Squirrel Rockie :=

  intro hs
  have hsk : Skittish Rockie := A5 Rockie (And.intro hs spotted_R)
  have hnc : ¬ Calm Rockie := A4 Rockie hsk
  exact hnc calm_R

theorem rabbit_R : Rabbit Rockie :=

  have disj : Rabbit Rockie ∨ Squirrel Rockie := A3 Rockie spotted_R
  exact Or.elim disj (fun hr => hr) (fun hs => False.elim (not_squirrel_R hs))

-- Cannot prove ¬ Turtle Rockie from the given axioms.
