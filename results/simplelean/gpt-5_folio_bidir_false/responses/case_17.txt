-- All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Rabbit x ∧ Spotted x → Cute x
-- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x
-- The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Spotted x → Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x
-- If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Skittish x → ¬Calm x
-- All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Squirrel x ∧ Spotted x → Skittish x
-- Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.

-- We are asked to show the negation of "Rockie is not a turtle", i.e., to prove Turtle Rockie.
-- However, there is no connection in the premises that would imply Turtle Rockie.
-- Therefore, we cannot derive Turtle Rockie from the given axioms.
-- Cannot prove Turtle Rockie from given axioms.
