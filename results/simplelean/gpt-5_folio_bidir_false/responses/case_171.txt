-- Premises
axiom P1 : ∀ x : obj, Deadly x → LowSurvival x               -- Deadly → Low survival
axiom P2 : ∀ x : obj, SevereCancer x → Deadly x              -- Severe cancer → Deadly
axiom P3 : ∀ x : obj, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x      -- Bile duct cancer → Severe cancer
axiom P4 : ∀ x : obj, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x -- Cholangiocarcinoma → Bile duct cancer
axiom P5 : ∀ x : obj, MildFlu x → LowSurvival x              -- Mild flu → Low survival
axiom P6 : ¬ (BileDuctCancer Colorectal ∧ LowSurvival Colorectal) -- Colorectal is not both bile duct cancer and low survival

-- Claim to negate:
-- "Colorectal cancer is a form of Cholangiocarcinoma and it is a kind of mild flu or a kind of bile duct cancer, or all of the above."
-- We formalize "or all of the above" as including the conjunction of the first two.
