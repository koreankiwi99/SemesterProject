-- If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then it has not received many negative reviews.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, YelpRec x → ¬ManyNeg x
-- All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, RatingGT4 x → YelpRec x
-- Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
axiom R3 : ∃ x : obj, ¬TakeOut x ∧ ManyNeg x
-- All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Popular x → RatingGT4 x
-- The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.
axiom T5 : RatingGT4 Hamden ∨ Popular Hamden

-- The statement to evaluate:
-- (TakeOut Hamden ∧ ManyNeg Hamden) → (RatingGT4 Hamden ∧ ¬TakeOut Hamden)
-- To prove its negation, we would need TakeOut Hamden ∧ ManyNeg Hamden and ¬(RatingGT4 Hamden ∧ ¬TakeOut Hamden).
-- But from the premises we derived ¬ManyNeg Hamden, so the antecedent cannot hold.
-- Therefore, we cannot derive the negation of the implication from the given axioms.
