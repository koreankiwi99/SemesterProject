axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates and relations
axiom Book : obj → Prop
axiom ContainsKnowledge : obj → Prop
axiom Reads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom GainsKnowledge : obj → Prop
axiom Smarter : obj → Prop
axiom AuthorOf : obj → obj → Prop

-- Entities
axiom Harry : obj
axiom Walden : obj
axiom HenryThoreau : obj

-- Context axioms
axiom K1 : ∀ b : obj, Book b → ContainsKnowledge b
axiom R1 : ∀ p b : obj, Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p
axiom R2 : ∀ p : obj, GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p
axiom T1 : Reads Harry Walden
axiom T2 : Book Walden
axiom T3 : AuthorOf Walden HenryThoreau

-- From the context we can derive that Harry gained knowledge and is smarter,
-- but we cannot derive the negation of the statement
-- "A smarter person has gained knowledge" i.e.,
-- we cannot prove ¬(∀ p, Smarter p → GainsKnowledge p).
-- There is no axiom providing a smarter person who has not gained knowledge.
-- Hence, we cannot prove the negation from the given premises.
