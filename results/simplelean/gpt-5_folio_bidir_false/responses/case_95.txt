axiom BusinessOrganization : obj → Prop
axiom LegalEntity : obj → Prop
axiom Company : obj → Prop
axiom PrivateCompany : obj → Prop
axiom CreatedUnderLaw : obj → Prop
axiom LegalObligations : obj → Prop

-- All business organizations are legal entities.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, BusinessOrganization x → LegalEntity x
-- All companies are business organizations.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Company x → BusinessOrganization x
-- All private companies are companies.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, PrivateCompany x → Company x
-- All legal entities are created under law.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → CreatedUnderLaw x
-- All legal entities have legal obligations.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, LegalEntity x → LegalObligations x
-- If the Harvard Weekly Book Club is created under law, then it is not a private company.
axiom R6 : CreatedUnderLaw H → ¬ PrivateCompany H

-- We can derive that H is not a private company.

  have hnpc : ¬ PrivateCompany H := R6 hcul
  exact hnpc hpc

-- Cannot prove ¬LegalObligations H from the given axioms.
