-- People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ PerformsTalentOften x → AttendsEngagedEvents x
-- People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x → (PerformsTalentOften x ∨ InactiveDisinterested x)
-- People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ ChaperonesDances x → ¬StudentAttendsSchool x
-- All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ InactiveDisinterested x → ChaperonesDances x
-- All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
