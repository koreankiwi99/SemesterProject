axiom obj : Type
axiom Fir : obj → Prop
axiom Evergreen : obj → Prop
axiom Worship : obj → Prop

-- Premises:
-- All fir trees are evergreens.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Fir x → Evergreen x
-- Some objects of worship are fir trees.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Worship x ∧ Fir x

-- We would need to prove the negation of:
-- ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬Worship x
-- i.e., prove: ∀ x, Evergreen x → Worship x
-- This does not follow from the given premises.
-- Cannot prove ¬(∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬Worship x) from given axioms.
