axiom Place : Type
axiom BarutinCove : Place
axiom SnowIsland : Place
axiom GreenwichIsland : Place
axiom DeceptionIsland : Place
axiom SouthShetlandIslands : Place
axiom Antarctica : Place

axiom LocatedIn : Place → Place → Prop

-- Facts from the context
axiom T1 : LocatedIn BarutinCove SnowIsland
axiom T2 : LocatedIn SnowIsland SouthShetlandIslands
axiom T3 : LocatedIn GreenwichIsland SouthShetlandIslands
axiom T4 : LocatedIn DeceptionIsland SouthShetlandIslands
axiom T5 : LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetlandIslands

-- Transitivity of location
axiom Trans : ∀ A B C : Place, LocatedIn A B → LocatedIn B C → LocatedIn A C

-- Derivable fact: Barutin Cove is located in the South Shetland Islands
theorem Barutin_in_SSI : LocatedIn BarutinCove SouthShetlandIslands := by
  exact Trans BarutinCove SnowIsland SouthShetlandIslands T1 T2

-- To prove the negation of the statement "Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica",
-- we would need to show LocatedIn BarutinCove Antarctica.
-- From the given axioms, we only have LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetlandIslands,
-- not the reverse, so we cannot derive LocatedIn BarutinCove Antarctica.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation from the premises.
