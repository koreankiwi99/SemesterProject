axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates
axiom Film : obj → Prop
axiom AppropriateAllAges : obj → Prop
axiom CanWatchWithoutGuidance : obj → Prop
axiom ExcessiveEroticViolent : obj → Prop
axiom RatedGA : obj → Prop
axiom FamilyFriendlyAnimated : obj → Prop
axiom FrozenSeries : obj → Prop

-- Constant for the movie
axiom Hachi : obj

-- Rules from the context
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Film x → AppropriateAllAges x → CanWatchWithoutGuidance x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Film x → ExcessiveEroticViolent x → ¬CanWatchWithoutGuidance x
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Film x → RatedGA x → AppropriateAllAges x
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, FamilyFriendlyAnimated x → RatedGA x
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, FrozenSeries x → FamilyFriendlyAnimated x

-- Facts about Hachi
axiom F1 : Film Hachi
axiom F2 : FamilyFriendlyAnimated Hachi ∨ AppropriateAllAges Hachi

-- Derived: Hachi is appropriate for all ages
theorem hachi_appropriate : AppropriateAllAges Hachi := by
  cases F2 with
  | inl hfam =>
      have hrg : RatedGA Hachi := R4 Hachi hfam
      exact R3 Hachi F1 hrg
  | inr happ =>
      exact happ

-- Derived: Children can watch Hachi without guidance
theorem hachi_can_watch : CanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi :=
  R1 Hachi F1 hachi_appropriate

-- Derived: Hachi does not contain excessive erotic and violent content
theorem hachi_not_excessive : ¬ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi := by
  intro hex
  have hnotW : ¬CanWatchWithoutGuidance Hachi := R2 Hachi F1 hex
  exact hnotW hachi_can_watch

-- The statement to evaluate:
-- (ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi ∧ FrozenSeries Hachi) ∨ (¬ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi ∧ ¬FrozenSeries Hachi)
-- We can derive ¬ExcessiveEroticViolent Hachi, but we have no information to conclude either FrozenSeries Hachi
-- or ¬FrozenSeries Hachi. Hence we cannot prove the negation of the statement from the given premises.
-- In fact, from the statement together with hachi_not_excessive, we can derive ¬FrozenSeries Hachi,
-- but that still does not yield a contradiction without additional premises.

-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation of the statement from the given axioms.
