axiom obj : Type
axiom Square : obj → Prop
axiom FourSided : obj → Prop
axiom Shape : obj → Prop

axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Square x → FourSided x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, FourSided x → Shape x

-- From the premises we can derive the statement directly:
theorem all_squares_are_shapes : ∀ x : obj, Square x → Shape x :=
  fun x hx => A2 x (A1 x hx)

-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation (that not all squares are shapes).
