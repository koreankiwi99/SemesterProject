-- None of the students who currently work in the library are from the CS department.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, (Student x ∧ WorkLibrary x) → ¬ FromCS x
-- All students with university part-time jobs currently work in the library.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, (Student x ∧ PartTimeUni x) → WorkLibrary x
-- All students taking the database course are from the CS department.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, (Student x ∧ TakingDB x) → FromCS x
-- All students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, (Student x ∧ TakingWithDavid x) → TakingDB x
-- All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, (Student x ∧ WorkLab x) → TakingWithDavid x

-- James is a student working in the lab.
axiom J1 : Student James
axiom J2 : WorkLab James

-- James doesn't (work in the lab or have a university part-time job).
axiom J3 : ¬ (WorkLab James ∨ PartTimeUni James)

-- We prove the negation of the statement: "James has a part-time job offered by the university."
