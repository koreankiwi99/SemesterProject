axiom PortraysReal : obj → Prop
axiom RealityTV : obj → Prop

axiom BreakingBad : obj

-- Premises
axiom E1 : ∃ s : obj, Show s ∧ Monday8pm s ∧ GivesRosesTV s
axiom R1 : ∀ s : obj, GivesRosesTV s → BachelorEp s
axiom R2 : ∀ s : obj, BachelorEp s → PortraysReal s
axiom R3 : ∀ s : obj, PortraysReal s → RealityTV s
axiom BB_show : Show BreakingBad
axiom BB_not_reality : ¬RealityTV BreakingBad

-- From the premises, roses being given during Breaking Bad leads to a contradiction
theorem roses_BB_impossible : ¬GivesRosesTV BreakingBad :=
by
  intro h
  have hb : BachelorEp BreakingBad := R1 BreakingBad h
  have hrp : PortraysReal BreakingBad := R2 BreakingBad hb
  have hrtv : RealityTV BreakingBad := R3 BreakingBad hrp
  exact BB_not_reality hrtv

-- Therefore, the implication (GivesRosesTV BreakingBad → Monday8pm BreakingBad) actually holds
theorem implication_true : GivesRosesTV BreakingBad → Monday8pm BreakingBad :=
by
  intro h
  have : False := roses_BB_impossible h
  exact False.elim this

-- Hence we cannot derive the negation of the statement from the premises.
