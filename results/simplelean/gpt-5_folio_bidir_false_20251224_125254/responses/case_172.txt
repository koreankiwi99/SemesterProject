-- All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, EatsSalad x → VeryConscious x
-- All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, GrewUpHC x → EatsSalad x
-- All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, FulfillIntake x → GrewUpHC x
-- All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Disregard x → ¬VeryConscious x
-- If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, VisitGymDaily x → FulfillIntake x
-- Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregards her physical well-being, or she did neither.
axiom A6 : (GrewUpHC Taylor ∧ Disregard Taylor) ∨ (¬GrewUpHC Taylor ∧ ¬Disregard Taylor)

-- From Disregard, we can derive ¬EatsSalad (using A1 and A4)
theorem disregard_implies_not_eats : ∀ x : obj, Disregard x → ¬EatsSalad x :=
by
  intro x hD
  intro hE
  have hVC : VeryConscious x := A1 x hE
  have hNotVC : ¬VeryConscious x := A4 x hD
  exact hNotVC hVC

-- In the first disjunct of A6, we can derive ¬EatsSalad Taylor
theorem not_eats_from_first_disjunct : (GrewUpHC Taylor ∧ Disregard Taylor) → ¬EatsSalad Taylor :=
by
  intro h
  exact disregard_implies_not_eats Taylor h.right

-- However, from the second disjunct (¬GrewUpHC Taylor ∧ ¬Disregard Taylor), 
-- there is no way to derive ¬EatsSalad Taylor from the given axioms.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove ¬EatsSalad Taylor unconditionally from the premises.
-- Cannot prove ¬EatsSalad Taylor from given axioms
