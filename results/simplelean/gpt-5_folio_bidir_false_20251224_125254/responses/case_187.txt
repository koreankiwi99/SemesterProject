-- Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
axiom E1 : ∃ x : obj, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x ∧ ¬American x

-- All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, ProfessionalBasketballPlayer x → CanJumpShots x

-- If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, CanJumpShots x → LeapsStraightIntoAir x

-- If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, LeapsStraightIntoAir x → ActivatesLegMuscles x

-- Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.
axiom T1 : ¬ActivatesLegMuscles Yuri

-- From the chain of implications and T1, we can show Yuri is not a professional basketball player.
theorem Yuri_not_PBP : ¬ProfessionalBasketballPlayer Yuri := by
  intro hP
  have hJ : CanJumpShots Yuri := A1 Yuri hP
  have hL : LeapsStraightIntoAir Yuri := A2 Yuri hJ
  have hA : ActivatesLegMuscles Yuri := A3 Yuri hL
  exact T1 hA

-- Cannot prove ¬American Yuri from the given premises.
