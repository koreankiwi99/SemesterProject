-- Axioms from the context
-- 1. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ SchedulesMeeting x → GoBuildingToday x

-- 2. Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, LunchInCompany x → SchedulesMeeting x

-- 3. Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → LunchInCompany x ∨ LunchAtHome x

-- 4. If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → RemoteFromHome x

-- 5. All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → RemoteFromHome x

-- 6. No managers work remotely from home.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬ RemoteFromHome x

-- 7. James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom A7 : AppearInCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- A useful derived lemma: any employee who is a manager must have lunch in the company (cannot lunch at home).

-- We cannot derive Manager James (or AppearInCompanyToday James) from the given axioms,
-- nor can we derive Employee James. Therefore we cannot conclude LunchInCompany James,
-- i.e., we cannot prove the negation of the statement "James does not have lunch in the company."
