axiom Fav : Person → Season → Prop
axiom Student : Person → Prop
axiom WantLong : Person → Prop

-- All students who want a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, Student x ∧ WantLong x → Fav x Summer

-- Emma's favorite season is summer.
axiom T1 : Fav Emma Summer

-- Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's (so not summer).
axiom T2 : ¬Fav Mia Summer

-- James wants to have a long vacation.
axiom T3 : WantLong James

-- Statement to evaluate: Fav Mia Spring
-- We cannot derive ¬Fav Mia Spring from the given axioms.
-- No contradiction arises from assuming Fav Mia Spring.
-- Hence, we cannot prove the negation of the statement.
