-- All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → (ScheduleMeeting x → GoBuildingToday x)
-- Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, LunchInBuilding x → ScheduleMeeting x
-- Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → (LunchInBuilding x ∨ LunchAtHome x)
-- If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → (LunchAtHome x → WorkRemoteFromHome x)
-- All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → (InOtherCountries x → WorkRemoteFromHome x)
-- No managers work remotely from home.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬WorkRemoteFromHome x
-- James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom A7 : AppearCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Statement to evaluate:
-- (Manager James ∨ InOtherCountries James) → ¬(LunchAtHome James ∨ WorkRemoteFromHome James)
-- ∧
-- (LunchAtHome James ∨ WorkRemoteFromHome James) → (¬Manager James ∧ ¬InOtherCountries James)

  ((LunchAtHome James ∨ WorkRemoteFromHome James) → (¬Manager James ∧ ¬InOtherCountries James))

-- Cannot prove ¬Statement from given axioms
