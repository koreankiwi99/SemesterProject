axiom obj : Type

axiom Growth : obj → Prop
axiom Mature : obj → Prop
axiom BoughtRapid : obj → Prop
axiom SuitableRF : obj → Prop

-- All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Growth x → BoughtRapid x
-- If a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, BoughtRapid x → ¬SuitableRF x
-- Some stocks are growth stocks.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, Stock x ∧ Growth x
-- All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Mature x → SuitableRF x
-- KO is a mature stock.
axiom A5 : Mature KO

theorem KO_suitable : SuitableRF KO := A4 KO A5
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive ¬(Stock KO).
