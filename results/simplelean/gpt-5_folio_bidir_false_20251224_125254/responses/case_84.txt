-- If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then it has not received many negative reviews.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Listed x → ¬ManyNegRev x
-- All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, RatingGT4 x → Listed x
-- Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, ¬TakeOut x ∧ ManyNegRev x
-- All restaurants popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, PopularLocal x → RatingGT4 x
-- The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.
axiom A5 : RatingGT4 Hamden ∨ PopularLocal Hamden

-- From the premises, we can derive that Hamden does not receive many negative reviews.
theorem hamden_not_manyneg : ¬ManyNegRev Hamden :=
by
  have hrg4 : RatingGT4 Hamden :=
    Or.elim A5
      (fun h => h)
      (fun hp => A4 Hamden hp)
  have hlisted : Listed Hamden := A2 Hamden hrg4
  exact A1 Hamden hlisted

-- Therefore, the statement "TakeOut Hamden ∨ ¬ManyNegRev Hamden" is true.
theorem statement_true : TakeOut Hamden ∨ ¬ManyNegRev Hamden :=
by
  exact Or.inr hamden_not_manyneg

-- Hence we cannot prove the negation of the statement from the given premises.
