-- Rent and security deposit
axiom MonthlyRent : Building → Nat
axiom SecurityDeposit : Building → Nat

-- A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building. (Not formalized further)
-- The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
axiom deposit_at_least_rent : ∀ b : Building, Managed b → SecurityDeposit b ≥ MonthlyRent b

-- The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
axiom rent_og_2000 : MonthlyRent OliveGarden = 2000

-- $2000 is more than $1500.
axiom two_thousand_gt_1500 : 2000 > 1500

-- Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy,
-- and the security deposit is no more than $1500.

-- Target: ¬AllowedMoveInWithPet Tom Fluffy OliveGarden
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive ¬(AllowedMoveInWithPet Tom Fluffy OliveGarden).
-- There is no information that The Olive Garden allows or disallows pets; only that some managed building does.
-- Cannot prove ¬AllowedMoveInWithPet Tom Fluffy OliveGarden from given axioms.
