-- Context axioms
-- Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
axiom C1 : ∃ b : Building, Managed b ∧ AllowsPets b
-- A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
axiom C2 : ∀ b : Building, Managed b → DepositRequired b
-- The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
-- (We formalize this as: any security deposit amount at a managed building is equal to the monthly rent or more than it.)
axiom C3 : ∀ b r d : Building × Money × Money, True → True → True → True
-- Oops: Fix C3 signature properly
-- Re-declare with correct type (Lean doesn't allow reassign, but this is illustrative)
-- Corrected version:
axiom C3_correct : ∀ (b : Building) (r d : Money), Managed b → MonthlyRent b r → SecurityDepositAt b d → (d = r ∨ More d r)

-- Fluffy is Tom's cat.
axiom C4a : Cat Fluffy
axiom C4b : OwnedBy Fluffy Tom
-- Cats are pets.
axiom C5 : ∀ a : Animal, Cat a → Pet a
-- The Olive Garden is a managed building.
axiom C6 : Managed OliveGarden
-- The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
axiom C7 : MonthlyRent OliveGarden M2000
-- $2000 is more than $1500.
axiom C8 : More M2000 M1500
-- Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
axiom C9 : ∀ b : Building, Managed b → AllowedWithPet b Tom Fluffy → (∃ d : Money, SecurityDepositAt b d ∧ ¬More d M1500) → WillRentManaged Tom
-- If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. 
axiom C10 : ∀ b : Building, Managed b → AllowsPets b → ∀ p : Person, ∀ a : Animal, Pet a → AllowedWithPet b p a

-- Statement to evaluate: The security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more.
def OG_deposit_is_2000_or_more : Prop :=
  ∀ d : Money, SecurityDepositAt OliveGarden d → (d = M2000 ∨ More d M2000)

-- Attempt to prove the negation of the statement (i.e., show it is false) is not derivable from given axioms.
-- Cannot prove ¬OG_deposit_is_2000_or_more from the given axioms.
