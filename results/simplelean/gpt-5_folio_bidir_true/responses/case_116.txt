-- If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
axiom R1 : ∀ x y : obj, Man x → Man y → Taller x y → Block x y

-- Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
axiom T1 : Man Michael
axiom T2 : ∀ x : obj, InClassMichael x → Taller Michael x

-- If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z.
axiom R2 : ∀ x y z : obj, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z

-- Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
axiom T3 : Man Peter
axiom T4 : Taller Peter Michael

-- Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, ¬ Jump x → Block Michael x

-- Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
axiom T5 : ¬ Block Michael Windy

-- Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Jump x → Great x

-- Goal: Peter can block Windy's shooting.
-- From the given axioms, we have no information relating Windy to being a man
-- or to any height relation with Peter. Thus we cannot derive Block Peter Windy.
-- In particular, R1 requires both individuals be men and a Taller relation between them,
-- which we do not have for Windy.
-- Therefore, Block Peter Windy is not provable from the premises.
