axiom Hydrocarbon : obj → Prop
axiom Alkane : obj → Prop
axiom OrganicCompound : obj → Prop
axiom ChemicalCompound : obj → Prop
axiom ContainsCarbon : obj → Prop
axiom OnlyOneElement : obj → Prop

-- Object
axiom mixture : obj

-- Premises
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Hydrocarbon x → OrganicCompound x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Alkane x → Hydrocarbon x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, OrganicCompound x → ChemicalCompound x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, OrganicCompound x → ContainsCarbon x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, ChemicalCompound x → ¬ OnlyOneElement x
axiom A6 : (ChemicalCompound mixture ∧ OnlyOneElement mixture) ∨ (¬ ChemicalCompound mixture ∧ ¬ OnlyOneElement mixture)

-- We can derive that the mixture is not a chemical compound
theorem not_chemical_mixture : ¬ ChemicalCompound mixture := by
  intro hCC
  have hdisj := A6
  cases hdisj with
  | inl h =>
      have hnotOne : ¬ OnlyOneElement mixture := A5 mixture h.left
      exact hnotOne h.right
  | inr h =>
      exact h.left hCC

-- We cannot derive that the mixture contains carbon from the given axioms.
-- In particular, A4 gives carbon only for organic compounds, but we have no premise that the mixture is organic.
-- Moreover, from A5 and A6 we actually obtain ¬ ChemicalCompound mixture, which gives no route to ContainsCarbon mixture.

-- Hence, the statement "The mixture contains carbon" is not provable from the premises.
