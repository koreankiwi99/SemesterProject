-- None of the students who currently work in the library are from the CS department.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, WorkInLibrary x → ¬ FromCS x
-- All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, PTJobUniv x → WorkInLibrary x
-- All of the students who are taking the database course are from the CS department.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, TakingDatabase x → FromCS x
-- All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, TakingWithDavid x → TakingDatabase x
-- All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.

-- James is a student working in the lab.
axiom T1 : WorkInLab James
-- James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.
-- Interpreted as ¬(WorkInLab James ∨ PTJobUniv James)
axiom T2 : ¬ (WorkInLab James ∨ PTJobUniv James)

theorem james_has_pt_job : PTJobUniv James := by
  -- From T1 we have WorkInLab James, so (WorkInLab James ∨ PTJobUniv James) holds.
  -- This contradicts T2, yielding False, from which anything follows.
  have hFalse : False := T2 (Or.inl T1)
  exact False.elim hFalse
