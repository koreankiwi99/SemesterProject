axiom Person : Type
axiom Airport : Type

axiom Susan : Person
axiom John : Person
axiom LGA : Airport

axiom From : Person → Airport → Prop
axiom To : Person → Airport → Prop

-- Premises
axiom T1 : To Susan LGA
axiom R1 : ∀ p : Person, ∀ a : Airport, ¬ (From p a ∧ To p a)
axiom T2 : From John LGA

-- From the constraints, we can derive that Susan does not fly from LGA
theorem not_susan_from : ¬ From Susan LGA := by
  intro hFrom
  have hno := R1 Susan LGA
  exact hno ⟨hFrom, T1⟩

-- Cannot prove From Susan LGA from the given axioms; in fact, we proved its negation.
