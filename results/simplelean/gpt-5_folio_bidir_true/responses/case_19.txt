-- All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, (Rabbit x ∧ Spotted x) → Cute x
-- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x
-- The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Spotted x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x)
-- If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
-- All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, (Squirrel x ∧ Spotted x) → Skittish x
-- Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
