-- Axioms from the context
-- People in this club who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ PerformOften x → AttendEngaged x

-- People in this club either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested community members.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x → PerformOften x ∨ InactiveDisinterested x

-- People in this club who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ Chaperone x → ¬ StudentAttend x

-- All people in this club who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ InactiveDisinterested x → Chaperone x

-- All young children and teenagers in this club who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, InClub x ∧ YoungOrTeen x ∧ WishesAcademic x → StudentAttend x

-- Bonnie's status in the club and her attendance/engagement and student status constraint.
-- Interpreting: either (attend+engaged ∧ student) or not (attend+engaged ∧ ¬student).
axiom A6 : InClub Bonnie ∧ ((AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ StudentAttend Bonnie) ∨ ¬(AttendEngaged Bonnie ∧ ¬ StudentAttend Bonnie))

-- Statement to evaluate (target):
-- If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often,
-- then Bonnie is both (a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities)
-- and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
-- Formally:
-- (Chaperone Bonnie ∨ (¬ Chaperone Bonnie → PerformOften Bonnie)) → ((YoungOrTeen Bonnie ∧ WishesAcademic Bonnie) ∧ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie)

-- There is insufficient information to derive that Bonnie is YoungOrTeen and WishesAcademic, nor that she is InactiveDisinterested,
-- from the given premises and the antecedent. In particular:
-- - We only have (InClub ∧ YoungOrTeen ∧ WishesAcademic) → StudentAttend, not the converse.
-- - From Chaperone we cannot derive InactiveDisinterested (only the reverse is given).
-- Hence the conclusion cannot be proved from the premises.

-- theorem target :
--   (Chaperone Bonnie ∨ (¬ Chaperone Bonnie → PerformOften Bonnie)) →
--   ((YoungOrTeen Bonnie ∧ WishesAcademic Bonnie) ∧ InactiveDisinterested Bonnie) := by
--   -- Cannot be derived from the provided axioms.
