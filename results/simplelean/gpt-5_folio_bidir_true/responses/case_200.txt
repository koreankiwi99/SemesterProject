-- Given facts from the context
axiom H1 : FootballPlayer Ailton
axiom H2 : LoanedOutTo Ailton Braga
axiom H3 : PlaysFor Ailton Nautico
axiom H4 : FootballClub Nautico
axiom H5 : FootballClub Braga
axiom H6 : FootballClub Fluminense

-- In fact, we can prove the opposite: Ailton was loaned out to a football club (Braga).
theorem exists_loaned_out_to_club : ∃ c : obj, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedOutTo Ailton c := by

-- Therefore, we cannot prove: ¬ ∃ c, FootballClub c ∧ LoanedOutTo Ailton c
-- since we have a direct witness (Braga).
