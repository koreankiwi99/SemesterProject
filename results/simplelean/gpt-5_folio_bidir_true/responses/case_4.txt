-- All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will appear in the company today.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ SchedulesWithCustomers x → AppearInCompanyToday x
-- Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, LunchInCompany x → SchedulesWithCustomers x
-- Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → (LunchInCompany x ∨ LunchAtHome x)
-- If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → RemoteFromHome x
-- All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → RemoteFromHome x
-- No managers work remotely from home.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬ RemoteFromHome x
-- James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom A7 : AppearInCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Goal to prove: ¬ LunchInCompany James
-- From the given axioms, this does not follow.
-- For example, assuming LunchInCompany James yields SchedulesWithCustomers James (A2),
-- and if additionally Employee James holds, then AppearInCompanyToday James (A1),
-- hence Manager James (A7), which is consistent with LunchInCompany James.
-- There is no contradiction derivable to refute LunchInCompany James.
-- Therefore we cannot prove ¬ LunchInCompany James from the premises.
