-- All students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, WantsLongVacation x → Favorite x = Summer

-- Emma's favorite season is summer.
axiom T_EmmaFav : Favorite Emma = Summer

-- Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.
axiom T_MiaDiff : Favorite Mia ≠ Favorite Emma

-- James wants to have a long vacation.
axiom T_JamesWants : WantsLongVacation James

-- Goal to evaluate: Favorite Mia = Spring
-- From T_MiaDiff and T_EmmaFav we get Favorite Mia ≠ Summer.
-- This does not imply Favorite Mia = Spring (could be Fall or Winter).
-- Hence, the statement cannot be derived from the given axioms.
-- theorem target : Favorite Mia = Spring := by
--   sorry  -- Not provable from the provided premises
