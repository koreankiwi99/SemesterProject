axiom obj : Type

-- All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ SchedulesMeetingWithCustomers x → GoesToCompanyBuildingToday x
-- Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, HasLunchInCompanyBuilding x → SchedulesMeetingWithCustomers x
-- Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → (HasLunchInCompanyBuilding x ∨ HasLunchAtHome x)
-- If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ HasLunchAtHome x → WorksRemotelyFromHome x
-- All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → WorksRemotelyFromHome x
-- No managers work remotely from home.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬ WorksRemotelyFromHome x
-- James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom A7 : AppearsInCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Target (not derivable from given axioms alone):
-- 1) (Manager James ∨ InOtherCountries James) → ¬ (HasLunchAtHome James ∨ WorksRemotelyFromHome James)
-- 2) (HasLunchAtHome James ∨ WorksRemotelyFromHome James) → (¬ Manager James ∧ ¬ InOtherCountries James)
-- Obstacles:
-- - To rule out HasLunchAtHome from ¬ WorksRemotelyFromHome, we need Employee James to use A4.
-- - From WorksRemotelyFromHome we can get ¬ Manager (via A6), but cannot obtain ¬ InOtherCountries,
--   since A5 is one-way (requires Employee and does not give a converse).
-- Therefore the stated implications cannot be proven.
