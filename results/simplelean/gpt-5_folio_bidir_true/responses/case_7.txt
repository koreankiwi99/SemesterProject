axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates
axiom OccursMonkeypoxVirusIn : obj → Prop
axiom GetsMonkeypox : obj → Prop
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop
axiom Fever : obj → Prop
axiom Headache : obj → Prop
axiom MusclePains : obj → Prop
axiom Tired : obj → Prop
axiom Flu : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
-- When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, OccursMonkeypoxVirusIn x → GetsMonkeypox x

-- Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals. (modeled as existence)
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Animal x ∧ OccursMonkeypoxVirusIn x

-- Humans are mammals. Mammals are animals.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Human x → Mammal x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Mammal x → Animal x

-- Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, GetsMonkeypox x → Fever x
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, GetsMonkeypox x → Headache x
axiom A7 : ∀ x : obj, GetsMonkeypox x → MusclePains x
axiom A8 : ∀ x : obj, GetsMonkeypox x → Tired x

-- People feel tired when they get the flu.
axiom A9 : ∀ x : obj, Flu x → Tired x

-- Goal to evaluate: ∀ x, ¬ Flu x
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive that no one gets the flu.
-- We only know that flu implies tiredness, not that flu does not occur.
-- Hence, we cannot prove the statement.
