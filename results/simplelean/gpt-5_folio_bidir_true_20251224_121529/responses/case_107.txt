-- If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they are not notably tidy.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Spill x → ¬ Tidy x

-- All clumsy foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try spill a lot of food on their clothing.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, ClumsyFoodieGoesOut x → Spill x

-- If people are cleanly, then they are notably tidy.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Cleanly x → Tidy x

-- If people value order and spotlessness, then they are cleanly.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, ValueOrder x → Cleanly x

-- All people whose families prioritize order and spotlessness themselves value order and spotlessness.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, FamilyPrioritizesOrder x → ValueOrder x

-- Peter is either (spills and cleanly) or (doesn't spill and not cleanly).
axiom A6 : (Spill Peter ∧ Cleanly Peter) ∨ (¬ Spill Peter ∧ ¬ Cleanly Peter)

-- We cannot derive Tidy Peter from the given axioms.
-- From the left disjunct of A6 we can derive Tidy Peter (via A3), but the right disjunct provides no way to conclude Tidy Peter.
-- Hence, Tidy Peter is not provable from these premises.
