axiom obj : Type
axiom Fir : obj → Prop
axiom Evergreen : obj → Prop
axiom Worship : obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Fir x → Evergreen x
axiom E1 : ∃ x : obj, Worship x ∧ Fir x

-- Target statement would be: ∃ x, Evergreen x ∧ ¬ Worship x
-- This does not follow from the premises: from E1 and R1 we only get that
-- there exists an evergreen that is an object of worship, not that some
-- evergreen is not an object of worship.
-- Hence we cannot prove the target statement from the given axioms.
