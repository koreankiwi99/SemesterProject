-- From the donated mine located in Picuris, deduce Picuris is not in Texas

  cases PM_in_NM_or_TX with
  | inl hnm => exact hnm
  | inr htx => exact False.elim (PM_not_in_TX htx)

-- Goal in question would be: ∃ x, MountainRange x ∧ InTexas x ∧ Visited Juan x
-- This does not follow: we only know Juan visited Picuris, and Picuris is not in Texas.
-- No information about Juan visiting any other Texas mountain range is provided.
-- Hence we cannot prove the existential claim.
