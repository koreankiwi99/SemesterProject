-- If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
axiom R_block : ∀ x y : obj, Man x → Man y → Taller x y → CanBlock x y

-- Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
axiom Michael_man : Man Michael
axiom Michael_taller_than_class : ∀ y : obj, InClass y → Taller Michael y

-- Transitivity of taller-than
axiom taller_trans : ∀ x y z : obj, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z

-- Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
axiom Peter_man : Man Peter
axiom Peter_taller_Michael : Taller Peter Michael

-- Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
axiom Michael_blocks_nonjumpers : ∀ y : obj, ¬ JumpsWhenShooting y → CanBlock Michael y

-- Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
axiom not_Michael_blocks_Windy : ¬ CanBlock Michael Windy

-- Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.
axiom jumpers_are_great : ∀ x : obj, JumpsWhenShooting x → GreatShooter x

-- Claim to prove (from the question): Peter is shorter than a man in Michael's class.
-- Formalized as: there exists a man in Michael's class who is taller than Peter.
def Claim : Prop := ∃ z : obj, Man z ∧ InClass z ∧ Taller z Peter

-- From the given axioms, Claim does not follow.
-- In particular, we can derive that Peter is taller than every member of Michael's class
-- (by transitivity from Peter > Michael and Michael > classmate),
-- but we are not given asymmetry/irreflexivity of Taller, so we cannot rule out that a classmate
-- is also taller than Peter. Thus we cannot prove Claim from the premises.
-- No theorem provided.
