-- Barutin Cove is a cove named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin. (Not used in reasoning)
-- Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island.
axiom T1 : OnSWCoastOf BarutinCove SnowIsland

-- Snow, Greenwich, and Deception Islands are located in the South Shetland Islands.
axiom T2 : LocatedIn SnowIsland SouthShetlandIslands
axiom T3 : LocatedIn GreenwichIsland SouthShetlandIslands
axiom T4 : LocatedIn DeceptionIsland SouthShetlandIslands

-- Antarctica is located on the South Shetland Islands.
axiom T5 : LocatedIn Antarctica SouthShetlandIslands

-- Transitivity of location
axiom R1 : ∀ A B C : obj, LocatedIn A B → LocatedIn B C → LocatedIn A C

-- From the given information, we cannot derive ¬ LocatedIn BarutinCove Antarctica.
-- We also cannot derive LocatedIn BarutinCove Antarctica.
-- Hence the truth of "Barutin Cove is not located in Antarctica" is not provable from these axioms.
