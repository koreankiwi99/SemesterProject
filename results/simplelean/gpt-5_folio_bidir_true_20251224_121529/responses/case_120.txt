axiom obj : Type
axiom Affection : obj → Prop
axiom Love : obj → Prop
axiom Positive : obj → Prop

-- Premises:
axiom A1 : ∃ x : obj, Affection x ∧ Love x       -- Some affection is love.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Love x ∧ Positive x        -- Some love is positive.

-- Goal: ∃ x, Affection x ∧ Positive x
-- This does not follow from A1 and A2 in general, since the witnesses for A1 and A2 may differ.
-- Therefore, we cannot derive the conclusion from the given premises.
