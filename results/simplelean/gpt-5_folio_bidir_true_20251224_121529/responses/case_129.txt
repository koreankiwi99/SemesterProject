-- 1. All who make wedding plans are engaged.

-- 2. All who invite others to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
-- 3. Anyone with a well-attended wedding invites others to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
-- 4. Some people with well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : Person, WellAttended x ∧ LargeFamily x
-- 5. If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends and does not make wedding plans.
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬ InviteFriends John ∧ ¬ MakePlans John)
-- 6. If John has a larger family, then John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends.
axiom A6 : LargeFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- From the axioms we can show John does not have a well-attended wedding,
-- but this does not suffice to prove John is engaged.
