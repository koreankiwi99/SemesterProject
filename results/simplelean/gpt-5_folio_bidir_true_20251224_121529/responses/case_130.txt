-- 1. All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, MakePlans x → Engaged x
-- 2. All people who invite others to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
-- 3. Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
-- 4. Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : Person, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- 5. If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and does not make wedding plans.
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬ InviteFriends John ∧ ¬ MakePlans John)
-- 6. If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- From 2,1,5 we can derive that John does not invite others.
theorem not_invite_others_John : ¬ InviteOthers John := by
  intro hIO
  have hMP : MakePlans John := A2 John hIO
  have hEng : Engaged John := A1 John hMP
  have hNotMP : ¬ MakePlans John := (A5 hEng).right
  exact hNotMP hMP

-- Consequently, John does not have a well-attended wedding.
theorem not_well_attended_John : ¬ WellAttended John := by
  intro hW
  have hIO : InviteOthers John := A3 John hW
  exact not_invite_others_John hIO

-- We cannot derive ¬ LargerFamily John from the given axioms.
-- In particular, A6 allows the case that if John has a larger family, he might invite friends,
-- and we have no premise that forbids John from inviting friends unconditionally.
-- Hence the conjunction (¬ LargerFamily John ∧ ¬ InviteOthers John) is not provable.
-- theorem target : (¬ LargerFamily John) ∧ (¬ InviteOthers John) := ?
