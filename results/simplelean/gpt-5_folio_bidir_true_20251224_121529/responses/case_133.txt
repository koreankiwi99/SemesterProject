axiom obj : Type
axiom Platypus : obj
axiom Human : obj
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom Teeth : obj → Prop

-- Some mammals have teeth.
axiom some_mammal_teeth : ∃ x : obj, Mammal x ∧ Teeth x
-- Platypuses have no teeth.
axiom platypus_no_teeth : ¬ Teeth Platypus
-- Platypuses are mammals.
axiom platypus_mammal : Mammal Platypus
-- Humans have teeth.
axiom human_teeth : Teeth Human

-- Goal: prove Mammal Human
-- This does not follow from the given premises.
-- There is no rule that "having teeth" implies "being a mammal",
-- and the existence of some mammals with teeth does not imply that
-- every entity with teeth is a mammal.
-- Hence, we cannot derive Mammal Human from the axioms above.
