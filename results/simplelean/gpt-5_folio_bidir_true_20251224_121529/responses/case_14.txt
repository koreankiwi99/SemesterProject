axiom obj : Type
axiom Zelda : obj
axiom Top10 : obj → Prop
axiom Sold1M : obj → Prop
axiom MadeByJapanese : obj → Prop

-- All games on the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies.
axiom R2 : ∀ g : obj, Top10 g → MadeByJapanese g
-- If a game sells more than one million copies, then it is included in the Top 10 list.
axiom R1 : ∀ g : obj, Sold1M g → Top10 g
-- The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies.
axiom T1 : Sold1M Zelda

-- From the premises, we can derive that The Legend of Zelda is on the Top 10 list.
theorem zelda_top10 : Top10 Zelda := R1 Zelda T1

-- Therefore, we cannot prove that The Legend of Zelda is not on the Top 10 list.
-- ¬ Top10 Zelda is not derivable; in fact, Top10 Zelda holds.
