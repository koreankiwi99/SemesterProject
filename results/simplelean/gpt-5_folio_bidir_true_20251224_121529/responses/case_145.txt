-- Everyone who can register to vote in the US can participate in the 2024 election.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, CanRegisterUS x → Participate2024 x

-- If someone has US citizenship, then they can register to vote in the US.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, USCitizen x → CanRegisterUS x

-- A person either has US citizenship or Taiwanese citizenship.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, USCitizen x ∨ TaiwaneseCitizen x

-- No Russian Federation officials hold Taiwanese citizenship.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, RFO x → ¬ TaiwaneseCitizen x

-- Vladimir neither holds Taiwanese citizenship nor is he a manager at Gazprom.
axiom A5 : ¬ TaiwaneseCitizen Vladimir
axiom A6 : ¬ ManagerGazprom Vladimir

-- Ekaterina can register to vote in the US, or she is a Russian Federation official.
axiom A7 : CanRegisterUS Ekaterina ∨ RFO Ekaterina

-- From the given information, we cannot derive ¬ RFO Vladimir.
-- The axioms allow RFO Vladimir (which would imply ¬ TaiwaneseCitizen Vladimir), and we already have ¬ TaiwaneseCitizen Vladimir.
-- Hence there is no contradiction, and we cannot prove Vladimir is not an RFO.
-- Therefore, the statement "Vladimir is not a Russian federation official" is not derivable.
