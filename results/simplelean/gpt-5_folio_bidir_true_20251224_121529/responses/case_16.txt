-- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Turtle x ∧ Spotted x

-- The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.

-- If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x

-- All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Squirrel x → Spotted x → Skittish x

axiom Rockie : obj

-- Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.

-- Derivable: Rockie is not a squirrel.

-- Cannot prove Turtle Rockie from the given axioms.
