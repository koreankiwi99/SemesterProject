axiom LikeMusic : Prop
axiom WantsCompose : Prop
axiom HasAccessProgram : Prop
axiom CanCompose : Prop
axiom WillCompose : Prop

axiom R1 : LikeMusic → WantsCompose
axiom R2 : HasAccessProgram → CanCompose
axiom R3 : (CanCompose ∧ WantsCompose) → WillCompose

-- Goal: ¬WillCompose → ¬CanCompose
-- From R3 we can derive only ¬WillCompose → ¬(CanCompose ∧ WantsCompose),
-- which does not suffice to conclude ¬CanCompose without additional premises.
-- Therefore, the statement cannot be derived from the given axioms.
