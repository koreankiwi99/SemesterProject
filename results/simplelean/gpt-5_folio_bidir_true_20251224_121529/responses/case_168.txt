axiom obj : Type
axiom Heinrich : obj

axiom Politician : obj → Prop
axiom PrussianParliamentMember : obj → Prop
axiom NaziReichstagMember : obj → Prop

axiom H1 : Politician Heinrich
axiom H2 : PrussianParliamentMember Heinrich
axiom H3 : NaziReichstagMember Heinrich

-- The claim to test:
-- ∀ x, Politician x → ¬ NaziReichstagMember x

-- Counterexample exists: Heinrich is both a politician and a member of the Nazi Reichstag.
theorem counterexample_exists : ∃ x : obj, Politician x ∧ NaziReichstagMember x := by
  exact Exists.intro Heinrich (And.intro H1 H3)

-- Therefore, the claim is false:
theorem not_no_politicians_in_nazi_reichstag :
  ¬ (∀ x : obj, Politician x → ¬ NaziReichstagMember x) := by
  intro h
  have hH : Politician Heinrich → ¬ NaziReichstagMember Heinrich := h Heinrich
  have hnot : ¬ NaziReichstagMember Heinrich := hH H1
  exact hnot H3
