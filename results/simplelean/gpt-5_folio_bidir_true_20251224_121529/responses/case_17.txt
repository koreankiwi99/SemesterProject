-- All rabbits that can be spotted near the campus are cute.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Rabbit x → NearCampus x → Cute x
-- Some turtles can be spotted near the campus.
axiom A2 : ∃ x : obj, Turtle x ∧ NearCampus x
-- The only animals that can be spotted near the campus are rabbits and squirrels.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, NearCampus x → (Rabbit x ∨ Squirrel x)
-- If something is skittish, then it is not calm.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Skittish x → ¬ Calm x
-- All the squirrels that can be spotted near the campus are skittish.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Squirrel x → NearCampus x → Skittish x
-- Rockie can be spotted near the campus, and it is calm.
axiom A6 : NearCampus Rockie
axiom A7 : Calm Rockie

-- We can show Rockie is not a squirrel (since Rockie is calm and any spotted squirrel is skittish, hence not calm).
theorem not_squirrel_Rockie : ¬ Squirrel Rockie := by
  intro hsq
  have hsk : Skittish Rockie := A5 Rockie hsq A6
  have hnc : ¬ Calm Rockie := A4 Rockie hsk
  exact hnc A7

-- However, from the given information, we cannot derive ¬ Turtle Rockie.
-- There is no premise relating turtles to calmness or excluding overlap with rabbits/squirrels.
-- Thus, we cannot prove that Rockie is not a turtle.
