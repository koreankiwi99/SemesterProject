axiom obj : Type
axiom LastSummerOlympics : obj
axiom InTokyo : obj → Prop
-- Given: The last summer Olympic games was in Tokyo.
axiom T_last : InTokyo LastSummerOlympics

-- The query claims: The last summer Olympic games were not in Tokyo, i.e., ¬ InTokyo LastSummerOlympics.
-- This does not follow from the premises (it contradicts T_last), so it cannot be proved.
-- However, we can show its negation holds:
theorem not_notTokyo : ¬ ¬ InTokyo LastSummerOlympics := by
  intro h
  exact h T_last
