axiom obj : Type
axiom Susan : obj
axiom John : obj
axiom LGA : obj

axiom FlyTo : obj → obj → Prop
axiom FlyFrom : obj → obj → Prop

-- Susan flies to LGA airport.
axiom T1 : FlyTo Susan LGA
-- The departure and arrival cannot be at the same airport.
axiom R1 : ∀ p a, FlyTo p a → ¬ FlyFrom p a
-- John flies from LGA airport.
axiom T2 : FlyFrom John LGA

-- From the constraints, we can derive that Susan does not fly from LGA.
theorem susan_not_from_LGA : ¬ FlyFrom Susan LGA := by
  exact R1 Susan LGA T1

-- Cannot prove FlyFrom Susan LGA from given axioms (in fact, its negation holds).
