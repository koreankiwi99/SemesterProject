-- Susan flies to LGA airport.
axiom T1 : To Susan LGA

-- The departure and arrival cannot be at the same airport.
-- (For any person p and airport a, not both From p a and To p a.)
axiom R1 : ∀ p a, From p a → ¬ To p a

-- John flies from LGA airport.
axiom T2 : From John LGA

-- From the constraints, we can derive that John does not fly to LGA.
theorem not_to_john : ¬ To John LGA := by
  exact R1 John LGA T2

-- We cannot prove To John LGA from the given axioms (indeed, its negation holds).
-- theorem goal : To John LGA := sorry  -- Not provable
