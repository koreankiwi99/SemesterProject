-- Rules
axiom R0 : ∀ x : obj, Podcast x → ¬ Novel x
axiom R1 : ∀ p c : obj, BornIn p c ∧ AmericanCity c → American p
axiom R2 : ∀ b p : obj, Novel b ∧ WrittenBy b p → NovelWriter p

axiom T3 : WrittenBy FamilyHistory DaniShapiro
axiom T4 : Novel FamilyHistory

axiom T7 : AmericanCity Boston

-- We cannot derive BornIn DaniShapiro Boston from the given axioms and facts.
-- The implication available (R1) only goes from BornIn + AmericanCity to American,
-- not from American to BornIn a specific city.
-- Therefore, "Dani Shapiro was born in Boston" cannot be proven.
