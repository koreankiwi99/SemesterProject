-- Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.
axiom A1 : ∃ x : obj, ProPlayer x ∧ ¬ American x
-- All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, ProPlayer x → CanJumpShots x
-- If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, CanJumpShots x → LeapStraight x
-- If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, LeapStraight x → ActivateLegMuscles x
-- Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.
axiom A5 : ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri

-- From being a professional player, one activates leg muscles.
theorem pro_implies_activate : ∀ x : obj, ProPlayer x → ActivateLegMuscles x := by
  intro x
  intro hx
  have hj : CanJumpShots x := A2 x hx
  have hl : LeapStraight x := A3 x hj
  have ha : ActivateLegMuscles x := A4 x hl
  exact ha

-- Hence, Yuri is not a professional basketball player.
theorem not_pro_yuri : ¬ ProPlayer Yuri := by
  intro hy
  have ha : ActivateLegMuscles Yuri := pro_implies_activate Yuri hy
  exact A5 ha

-- Cannot prove American Yuri from given axioms
