axiom obj : Type

axiom Yuri : obj

axiom Professional : obj → Prop
axiom American : obj → Prop
axiom JumpShot : obj → Prop

axiom ActivateLeg : obj → Prop

-- Premises
axiom exists_nonAmerican_pro : ∃ x : obj, Professional x ∧ ¬ American x
axiom pro_implies_jump : ∀ x : obj, Professional x → JumpShot x
axiom jump_implies_leap : ∀ x : obj, JumpShot x → LeapStraight x
axiom leap_implies_leg : ∀ x : obj, LeapStraight x → ActivateLeg x
axiom y_not_leg : ¬ ActivateLeg Yuri

-- Derived: Every professional activates leg muscles
theorem pro_to_leg : ∀ x : obj, Professional x → ActivateLeg x := by
  intro x
  intro px
  have j : JumpShot x := pro_implies_jump x px
  have l : LeapStraight x := jump_implies_leap x j
  exact leap_implies_leg x l

-- Yuri is not a professional basketball player
theorem not_pro_y : ¬ Professional Yuri := by
  intro py
  have m : ActivateLeg Yuri := pro_to_leg Yuri py
  exact y_not_leg m

-- Yuri does not leap straight into the air
theorem not_leap_y : ¬ LeapStraight Yuri := by
  intro ly
  have m : ActivateLeg Yuri := leap_implies_leg Yuri ly
  exact y_not_leg m

-- The queried statement is actually false under the premises:
-- If Yuri does not leap straight into the air, then Yuri is an American professional basketball player.
-- We show its negation holds.
theorem negate_claim : ¬ ((¬ LeapStraight Yuri) → (American Yuri ∧ Professional Yuri)) := by
  intro h
  have ay_py : American Yuri ∧ Professional Yuri := h not_leap_y
  have py : Professional Yuri := ay_py.right
  exact not_pro_y py

-- Therefore, we cannot prove the given implication; it contradicts the premises.
