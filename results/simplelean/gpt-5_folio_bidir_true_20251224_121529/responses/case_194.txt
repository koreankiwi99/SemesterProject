-- The winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic was Steinhauer.
axiom W1 : Winner Steinhauer
-- Steinhauer participated in the 1992 du Maurier Classic.
axiom P1 : Participated Steinhauer
-- The six-way tie was on the leaderboard (members of the tie are on the leaderboard).
axiom T_on_LB : ∀ x : obj, InSixWayTie x → Leaderboard x
-- One person in the six-way tie was from Belgium.
axiom Exists_Belgian_In_Tie : ∃ x : obj, InSixWayTie x ∧ FromBelgium x
-- Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic.
axiom D_belgium : FromBelgium Descampe
axiom D_leaderboard : Leaderboard Descampe
-- All people on the leaderboard participated in the 1992 du Maurier Classic.
axiom LB_participated : ∀ x : obj, Leaderboard x → Participated x

-- Goal: InSixWayTie Descampe
-- From the existence of some Belgian in the tie and that Descampe is Belgian and on the leaderboard,
-- it does not follow that Descampe is the Belgian in the tie (there could be another Belgian).
-- Hence we cannot derive InSixWayTie Descampe from the given axioms.
