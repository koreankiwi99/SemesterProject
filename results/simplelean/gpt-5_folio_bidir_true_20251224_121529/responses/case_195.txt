axiom Likes : obj → Prop  -- "Liked by Jane"

-- Jane does not like any animals that bark.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Bark x) → ¬ Likes x

-- All dogs are animals that bark.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Dog x → (Animal x ∧ Bark x)

-- Jane likes all animals that jump.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Jump x) → Likes x

-- If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Legs x) → Jump x

-- If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Terricolous x) → Legs x

-- KiKi is an animal.
axiom A6 : Animal KiKi

-- If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
axiom A7 : (¬ Jump KiKi ∧ ¬ Legs KiKi) → (Terricolous KiKi ∨ Legs KiKi)

-- Cannot prove Terricolous KiKi from the given axioms.
