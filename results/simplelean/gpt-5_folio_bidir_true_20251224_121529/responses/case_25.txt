axiom obj : Type
axiom Beijing : obj

axiom LocatedInNorthernChina : obj → Prop
axiom LocatedInSouthernChina : obj → Prop

-- From the context:
axiom T1 : LocatedInNorthernChina Beijing

-- We are asked to conclude: LocatedInSouthernChina Beijing.
-- However, there is no axiom relating Northern and Southern (e.g., disjointness),
-- so we cannot derive LocatedInSouthernChina Beijing or its negation from the given information.
-- Hence, the truth of "Beijing is located in southern China" is not provable from the premises.
