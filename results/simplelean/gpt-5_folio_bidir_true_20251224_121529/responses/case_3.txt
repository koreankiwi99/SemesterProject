-- All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ ScheduleMeeting x → AppearsInCompanyToday x
-- Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Person, LunchInCompany x → ScheduleMeeting x
-- Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x → (LunchInCompany x ∨ LunchAtHome x)
-- If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : Person, LunchAtHome x → RemoteFromHome x
-- All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountry x → RemoteFromHome x
-- No managers work remotely from home.
axiom R6 : ∀ x : Person, Manager x → ¬ RemoteFromHome x
-- James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom R7 : AppearsInCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Assume James is an employee (so lunch disjunction applies to him).
axiom EJ : Employee James

-- From being a manager, James must have lunch in the company (cannot lunch at home due to no-remote).

-- Note: From the premises we cannot derive Manager James or ¬Manager James, so we cannot prove LunchInCompany James.
-- Therefore, the statement "James has lunch in the company" is not provable from the given information.
