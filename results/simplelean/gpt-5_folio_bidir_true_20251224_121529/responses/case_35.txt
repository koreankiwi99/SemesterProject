-- From the facts, there exists a professional wrestling stable that includes Ivy Nile
-- and has a feud with Imperium (namely, Diamond Mine).

  exact And.intro DM_is_stable (And.intro DM_includes_IN Imperium_feuds_DM)

-- Therefore, we cannot prove:
-- ¬ ∃ s, WrestlingStable s ∧ Includes s IvyNile ∧ Feud Imperium s
-- since the above theorem provides a counterexample.
-- Hence the queried statement is not derivable from the premises.
