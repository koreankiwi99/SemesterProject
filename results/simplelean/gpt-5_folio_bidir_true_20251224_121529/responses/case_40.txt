-- All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, ZahaStyle x ∧ Adored x → Interesting x
-- No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Brutalist x ∧ Adored x → ¬ Interesting x
-- Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Adored x → ZahaStyle x ∨ KellyStyle x
-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, KellyStyle x ∧ Adored x → Evocative x
-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, KellyStyle x ∧ Adored x → Dreamy x
-- If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x ∧ Adored x ∧ Interesting x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- Target statement (informal): ∃ x, DesignByMax x ∧ Evocative x ∧ Dreamy x
-- There is no existence assumption about any design by Max or any adored item,
-- so we cannot derive the existence of a design by Max that is both evocative and dreamy.
