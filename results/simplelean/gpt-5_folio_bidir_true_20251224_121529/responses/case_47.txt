axiom Person : Type
axiom Season : Type

axiom Spring : Season
axiom Summer : Season
axiom Fall : Season
axiom Winter : Season

-- There are exactly four seasons
axiom Seasons_exhaustive : ∀ s : Season, s = Spring ∨ s = Summer ∨ s = Fall ∨ s = Winter

-- Favorite season as a function (each person has exactly one favorite season)
axiom Fav : Person → Season

-- Individuals
axiom Emma : Person
axiom Mia : Person
axiom James : Person

-- Predicates
axiom Student : Person → Prop
axiom WantsLongVacation : Person → Prop

-- Rule: All students who want a long vacation have summer as their favorite season
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, Student x ∧ WantsLongVacation x → Fav x = Summer

-- Facts given
axiom EmmaFavSummer : Fav Emma = Summer
axiom MiaFavNotSameAsEmma : Fav Mia ≠ Fav Emma
axiom JamesWantsLongVacation : WantsLongVacation James

-- Consequence: Mia's favorite season is not Summer
theorem Mia_not_summer : Fav Mia ≠ Summer :=
  by
    intro h
    have hEq : Fav Mia = Fav Emma := h.trans (Eq.symm EmmaFavSummer)
    exact MiaFavNotSameAsEmma hEq

-- Cannot prove Fav Mia = Spring from given axioms
-- theorem Mia_spring : Fav Mia = Spring := by
--   sorry
