axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ SchedulesWithCustomers x → GoToCompanyBuildingToday x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, LunchInBuilding x → SchedulesWithCustomers x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → LunchInBuilding x ∨ LunchAtHome x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → RemoteFromHome x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → RemoteFromHome x
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬ RemoteFromHome x
axiom A7 : WillAppearInCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- A small consequence we can prove: if James works remotely from home, then he is not a manager.
theorem remote_not_manager : RemoteFromHome James → ¬ Manager James := by
  intro hRemote
  intro hMgr
  have h := A6 James hMgr
  exact h hRemote

-- Target statements (for reference):
-- 1) (Manager James ∨ InOtherCountries James) → ¬ (LunchAtHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James)
-- 2) (LunchAtHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James) → (¬ Manager James ∧ ¬ InOtherCountries James)
-- These do not follow from the given axioms without additional assumptions (e.g., that James is an employee, or links between appearing in company and going to the building).
