axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates
axiom VirusOccurs : obj → Prop        -- Monkeypox virus occurs in a being
axiom HasMonkeypox : obj → Prop       -- being gets Monkeypox
axiom Animal : obj → Prop
axiom Mammal : obj → Prop
axiom Human : obj → Prop

axiom Fever : obj → Prop
axiom Headache : obj → Prop
axiom MusclePains : obj → Prop
axiom Tired : obj → Prop

axiom Flu : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
-- When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, VirusOccurs x → HasMonkeypox x

-- Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals. (existential claim)
axiom R2 : ∃ x : obj, Animal x ∧ VirusOccurs x

-- Humans are mammals; mammals are animals.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Human x → Mammal x
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Mammal x → Animal x

-- Symptoms of Monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle pains, and tiredness.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, HasMonkeypox x → Fever x ∧ Headache x ∧ MusclePains x ∧ Tired x

-- People feel tired when they get the flu.
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Flu x → Tired x

-- Target statement: ∀ x, ¬ Flu x (No one gets the flu)
-- This does not follow from the given axioms; there is no contradiction or rule preventing Flu.
-- Therefore, it cannot be proven from the context.
