-- All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Growth x → BoughtRapid x
-- If a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, BoughtRapid x → ¬ SuitableRet x
-- Some stocks are growth stocks.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, Stock x ∧ Growth x
-- All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Mature x → SuitableRet x
-- KO is a mature stock.
axiom T_KO : Mature KO

-- From the premises, KO cannot be a growth stock.
theorem not_growth_KO : ¬ Growth KO := by
  intro hG
  have hB : BoughtRapid KO := A1 KO hG
  have hNotS : ¬ SuitableRet KO := A2 KO hB
  have hS : SuitableRet KO := A4 KO T_KO
  exact hNotS hS

-- Cannot prove Stock KO ∧ Growth KO from the given axioms.
