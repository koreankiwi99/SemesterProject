-- Axioms from the context
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, BakedSweet x → ¬ Spicy x                 -- No baked sweets are spicy
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Cupcake x → BakedSweet x                 -- All cupcakes are baked sweets
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, MalaHotpot x → Spicy x                   -- All mala hotpots are spicy
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, FromBakedByMelissa x → Cupcake x         -- All products from Baked by Melissa are cupcakes
axiom A5 : Spicy DriedThaiChilies ∨ MalaHotpot DriedThaiChilies ∨ ¬ BakedSweet DriedThaiChilies
  -- Dried Thai chilies are spicy or mala hotpots or not baked sweets

-- The queried conclusion would be: Cupcake DriedThaiChilies ∧ FromBakedByMelissa DriedThaiChilies
-- We show its negation follows from the axioms, hence the conclusion cannot be proved.
