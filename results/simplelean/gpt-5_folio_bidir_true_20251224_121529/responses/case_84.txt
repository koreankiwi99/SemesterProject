-- If a restaurant is listed, then it has not received many negative reviews.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Listed x → ¬ ManyNegReviews x
-- All restaurants with rating > 4 are listed.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, RatingGT4 x → Listed x
-- Some restaurants do not provide take-out and receive many negative reviews.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, ¬ TakeOut x ∧ ManyNegReviews x
-- All restaurants popular among local residents have rating > 4.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Popular x → RatingGT4 x
-- The Hamden Plaza Subway store has rating > 4 or is popular.
axiom A5 : RatingGT4 Hamden ∨ Popular Hamden
