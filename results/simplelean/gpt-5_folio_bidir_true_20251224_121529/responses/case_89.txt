axiom Harry : obj
axiom Walden : obj

axiom T1 : Reads Harry Walden
axiom R1 : ∀ p b, Reads p b → GainsKnowledge p
axiom R2 : ∀ p, GainsKnowledge p → Smarter p

-- From the premises we can derive that Harry gained knowledge and is smarter.
theorem harry_gained : GainsKnowledge Harry := R1 Harry Walden T1
theorem harry_smarter : Smarter Harry := R2 Harry harry_gained

-- But we cannot derive that every smarter person has gained knowledge.
-- That is, we cannot prove: ∀ p, Smarter p → GainsKnowledge p
