axiom MT : obj

-- A natural language processing task can be categorized as either generation or understanding.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, NLP x → (Gen x ∨ Und x)
-- If the output of a task is a text sequence, then it is a generation task.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, OutputText x → Gen x
-- Machine translation is a natural language processing task.
axiom A3 : NLP MT
-- The output of machine translation is a text sequence.
axiom A4 : OutputText MT
-- Generation and understanding are exclusive (from "either ... or ...").
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Gen x → ¬ Und x

-- From A2 and A4, MT is a generation task; by A5, it is not an understanding task.
