axiom Harry : obj

-- Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → (Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x)

-- All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Backbone x) → ReproByMFM x

-- All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, (Vertebrate x ∧ Animal x) → Backbone x

-- All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Bee x → ¬ ReproByMFM x

-- All queen bees are bees.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, QueenBee x → Bee x

-- Harry is a bee.
axiom A6 : Bee Harry

-- Goal: prove QueenBee Harry
-- From the given premises, we only know Harry is a bee and that bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
-- There is no premise implying that a bee is a queen bee or that Harry is a queen bee.
-- Therefore, we cannot derive QueenBee Harry.
-- theorem harry_is_queen_bee : QueenBee Harry := ?impossible
