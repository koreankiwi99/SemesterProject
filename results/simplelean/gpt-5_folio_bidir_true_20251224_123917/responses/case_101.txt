-- Axioms from the context
-- People who have siblings who were born together spend a lot of time with their siblings.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, SibsBornTogether x → SpendTimeWithSibs x
-- If people have siblings who were born together, then they were born in a multiple birth.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, SibsBornTogether x → MultipleBirth x
-- If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who were born together.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, ComplainOften x → SibsBornTogether x
-- If people live at home, then they do not live with strangers.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, LiveAtHome x → ¬ LiveWithStrangers x
-- If people spend a lot of time with their siblings, then they often live at home.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, SpendTimeWithSibs x → LiveAtHome x

-- Luke either is a baby born in a multiple birth and lives with strangers,
-- or is not a baby born in a multiple birth and does not live with strangers.
axiom A6 : (Baby Luke ∧ MultipleBirth Luke ∧ LiveWithStrangers Luke) ∨ (¬(Baby Luke ∧ MultipleBirth Luke) ∧ ¬ LiveWithStrangers Luke)

-- Goal: SpendTimeWithSibs Luke
-- From the given axioms, there is no way to derive SibsBornTogether Luke or SpendTimeWithSibs Luke for Luke.
-- The disjunction A6 does not entail SibsBornTogether Luke nor SpendTimeWithSibs Luke.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove SpendTimeWithSibs Luke.
