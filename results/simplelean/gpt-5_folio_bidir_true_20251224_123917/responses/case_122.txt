-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, TransportsMultiplePassengers x → ¬ OneSeater x
-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, TeslaModel3 x → TransportsMultiplePassengers x
-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x
-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x
-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
axiom A5 : (¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar) → ((¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar) ∨ SingleSeatElectricCar JohnCar)

-- From the given axioms, there is no information that implies SoloEV JohnCar.
-- Hence we cannot prove that John's car is a Solo EV.
