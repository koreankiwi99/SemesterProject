-- 1. All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MakePlans x → Engaged x
-- 2. All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
-- 3. Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
-- 4. Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : obj, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- 5. If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and does not make wedding plans.
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬ InviteFriends John) ∧ (¬ MakePlans John)
-- 6. If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- From these premises, we cannot derive ¬ LargerFamily John.
-- The available rules do not connect InviteFriends to MakePlans/Engaged,
-- so assuming LargerFamily John only yields InviteFriends John (or a contradiction in the WellAttended branch),
-- which does not yield a contradiction overall.
