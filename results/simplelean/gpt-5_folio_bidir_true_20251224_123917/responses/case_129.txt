-- All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MakePlans x → Engaged x
-- All people who invite others to come to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
-- Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to come to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
-- Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : obj, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- If John is engaged, then John does not (invite friends to their ceremony and make wedding plans).
axiom A5 : Engaged John → ¬ (InviteFriends John ∧ MakePlans John)
-- If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- From these premises, there is no way to derive Engaged John.
-- In particular, we have no premise asserting John has a larger family, 
-- nor any premise connecting InviteFriends to InviteOthers/MakePlans for John.
-- Thus we cannot prove Engaged John.
-- theorems attempting to prove Engaged John are not derivable from the given axioms.
