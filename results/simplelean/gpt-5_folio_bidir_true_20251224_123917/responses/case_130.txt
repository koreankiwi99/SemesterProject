-- 1. All people who make wedding plans are engaged.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MakePlans x → Engaged x
-- 2. All people who invite others to their ceremony make wedding plans.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, InviteOthers x → MakePlans x
-- 3. Anyone who has a well-attended wedding invites others to their ceremony.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, WellAttended x → InviteOthers x
-- 4. Some people that have well-attended weddings have larger families.
axiom A4 : ∃ x : obj, WellAttended x ∧ LargerFamily x
-- 5. If John is engaged, then John does not invite friends to their ceremony and does not make wedding plans.
axiom A5 : Engaged John → (¬InviteFriends John ∧ ¬MakePlans John)
-- 6. If John has a larger family, then either John has a well-attended wedding or invites friends to their ceremony.
axiom A6 : LargerFamily John → (WellAttended John ∨ InviteFriends John)

-- Derivable consequences:
theorem notMakePlansJohn : ¬MakePlans John := by
  intro hM
  have hEng : Engaged John := A1 John hM
  have hConj : ¬InviteFriends John ∧ ¬MakePlans John := A5 hEng
  have hNotM : ¬MakePlans John := And.right hConj
  exact hNotM hM

theorem notInviteOthersJohn : ¬InviteOthers John := by
  intro hI
  have hM : MakePlans John := A2 John hI
  exact notMakePlansJohn hM

theorem notWellAttendedJohn : ¬WellAttended John := by
  intro hW
  have hI : InviteOthers John := A3 John hW
  exact notInviteOthersJohn hI

-- Cannot prove ¬LargerFamily John from given axioms, so cannot prove the full conjunction
-- theorem goal : ¬LargerFamily John ∧ ¬InviteOthers John := ?
