axiom obj : Type
axiom Heinrich_Schmidt : obj
axiom Politician : obj → Prop
axiom Member_Prussian_State_Parliament : obj → Prop
axiom Member_Nazi_Reichstag : obj → Prop

axiom H1 : Politician Heinrich_Schmidt
axiom H2 : Member_Prussian_State_Parliament Heinrich_Schmidt
axiom H3 : Member_Nazi_Reichstag Heinrich_Schmidt

-- The statement to evaluate would be: ∀ x, Politician x → ¬ Member_Nazi_Reichstag x
-- This cannot be proven, since Heinrich_Schmidt is a counterexample (both a Politician and a Member_Nazi_Reichstag).
