-- Premises
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Deadly x → LowSurvival x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, SevereCancer x → Deadly x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, BileDuctCancer x → SevereCancer x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Cholangiocarcinoma x → BileDuctCancer x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, MildFlu x → LowSurvival x
axiom A6 : ¬ (BileDuctCancer Colorectal ∧ LowSurvival Colorectal)

-- From the premises, BileDuctCancer Colorectal leads to a contradiction
theorem not_bdc_colorectal : ¬ BileDuctCancer Colorectal := by
  intro hBDC
  have hSev : SevereCancer Colorectal := A3 Colorectal hBDC
  have hDead : Deadly Colorectal := A2 Colorectal hSev
  have hLow : LowSurvival Colorectal := A1 Colorectal hDead
  exact A6 (And.intro hBDC hLow)

-- Hence, Cholangiocarcinoma Colorectal is also impossible
theorem not_cholang_colorectal : ¬ Cholangiocarcinoma Colorectal := by
  intro hCh
  have hBDC : BileDuctCancer Colorectal := A4 Colorectal hCh
  exact not_bdc_colorectal hBDC

-- Target statement (one plausible formalization of the natural language):
-- (Cholangiocarcinoma ∧ (MildFlu ∨ BileDuctCancer)) ∨ (Cholangiocarcinoma ∧ MildFlu ∧ BileDuctCancer)
def Target : Prop :=
  (Cholangiocarcinoma Colorectal ∧ (MildFlu Colorectal ∨ BileDuctCancer Colorectal)) ∨
  (Cholangiocarcinoma Colorectal ∧ MildFlu Colorectal ∧ BileDuctCancer Colorectal)

-- From the premises we can actually refute Target
theorem target_false : ¬ Target := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl h1 =>
    exact not_cholang_colorectal h1.left
  | inr h2 =>
    exact not_cholang_colorectal h2.left

-- Therefore, the target statement does not follow from the premises.
-- Cannot prove Target from given axioms.
