-- No one nice to animals is also mean to animals.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, NiceToAnimals x → ¬ MeanToAnimals x
-- Some grumpy people are mean to animals.
axiom E1 : ∃ x : obj, Grumpy x ∧ MeanToAnimals x
-- All animal lovers are nice to animals.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, AnimalLover x → NiceToAnimals x
-- All pet owners love animals.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, PetOwner x → AnimalLover x
-- Tom is a pet owner.
axiom T1 : PetOwner Tom

-- From the premises we can derive that Tom is nice to animals.
theorem nice_Tom : NiceToAnimals Tom := by
  have h1 : AnimalLover Tom := R3 Tom T1
  exact R2 Tom h1

-- From niceness we also get that Tom is not mean to animals.
theorem not_mean_Tom : ¬ MeanToAnimals Tom := by
  apply R1 Tom
  exact nice_Tom

-- However, there is no information linking Tom to being grumpy.
-- The premise "Some grumpy people are mean to animals" is existential and
-- does not specify Tom. Thus, we cannot prove Grumpy Tom from the given axioms.
