theorem prem_true : Prem := by

-- The stated consequent is false because it requires ¬ AnimalLover Tom, but Tom is an animal lover.
theorem not_conc : ¬ Conc := by
  unfold Conc

-- Hence, the implication in the statement is refutable from the premises.

-- Therefore, we cannot prove: Prem → Conc
-- the following target theorem is unprovable from the given axioms:
