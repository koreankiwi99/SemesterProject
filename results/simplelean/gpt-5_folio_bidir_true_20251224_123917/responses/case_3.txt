-- All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ SchedulesWithCustomers x → GoesToCompanyToday x
-- Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, LunchInCompany x → SchedulesWithCustomers x
-- Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → (LunchInCompany x ∨ LunchAtHome x)
-- If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → RemoteFromHome x
-- All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → RemoteFromHome x
-- No managers work remotely from home.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬ RemoteFromHome x
-- James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom A7 : AppearsInCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Goal: LunchInCompany James
-- There is insufficient information to derive LunchInCompany James from the given axioms.
-- In particular, we have no facts that make James an employee, a manager, appearing today,
-- or otherwise constrain his lunch location.
-- Hence we cannot prove LunchInCompany James.
