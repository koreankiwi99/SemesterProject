-- All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Zaha x ∧ MaxAdores x → Interesting x
-- No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Brutalist x ∧ MaxAdores x → ¬ Interesting x
-- Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, MaxAdores x → (Zaha x ∨ Kelly x)
-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Kelly x ∧ MaxAdores x → Evocative x
-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Kelly x ∧ MaxAdores x → Dreamy x
-- If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x ∧ MaxAdores x ∧ Interesting x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- Goal to evaluate: ∀ x, DesignByMax x → (Evocative x ∨ Dreamy x)
-- This does not follow from the given premises because none of the premises allow concluding
-- Evocative x or Dreamy x for designs by Max that he does not adore.
-- We lack any premise relating DesignByMax x to MaxAdores x.
-- Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given axioms.
