-- If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then it has not received many negative reviews.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Listed x → ¬ ManyNegative x
-- All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, RatingGT4 x → Listed x
-- Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, ¬ TakeOut x ∧ ManyNegative x
-- All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Popular x → RatingGT4 x
-- The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.
axiom A5 : RatingGT4 H ∨ Popular H

-- Statement to evaluate:
-- If the Hamden Plaza Subway store provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews,
-- then its rating is greater than 4 and it does not provide take-out service.
