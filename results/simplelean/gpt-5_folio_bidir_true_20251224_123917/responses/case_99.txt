-- Animals are either invertebrates or vertebrates.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → (Invertebrate x ∨ Vertebrate x)

-- All animals with backbones reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → Backbone x → ReproMF x

-- All vertebrate animals have a backbone.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → Vertebrate x → Backbone x

-- All bees do not reproduce by male-and-female mating.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Bee x → ¬ ReproMF x

-- All queen bees are bees.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, QueenBee x → Bee x

-- Harry is a bee.
axiom A6 : Bee Harry

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive that Harry is an animal,
-- which is needed to use A1 (the animal dichotomy) and relate backbone/reproduction facts to Harry.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove Invertebrate Harry ∨ QueenBee Harry.
-- A missing premise would be: ∀ x, Bee x → Animal x.
-- Without it, the goal is not derivable.
-- theorem goal : Invertebrate Harry ∨ QueenBee Harry := by
