We formalize the given information.

Entities:
- Places: Barutin Cove, Snow Island, Greenwich Island, Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, Barutin (a Bulgarian settlement)

Predicates:
- In x y: place x is located in place y
- Cove x: x is a cove
- NamedAfter x y: x is named after y
- InBulgaria y: y is a place in Bulgaria

Axioms encode the textual context. We add transitivity of "located in".
We then show a derived fact that Barutin Cove is in the South Shetland Islands.
We cannot derive that it is in Antarctica from the given (since we only have Antarctica ∈ SouthShetland, not SouthShetland ∈ Antarctica), nor can we refute existence of some other cove in Antarctica named after a Bulgarian place.

Target statement (not proved):
∃ x, Cove x ∧ (∃ y, InBulgaria y ∧ NamedAfter x y) ∧ In x Antarctica

We cannot derive In BarutinCove Antarctica (we would need In SouthShetlandIslands Antarctica,
but we only have the reverse In Antarctica SouthShetlandIslands). We also have no information
precluding the existence of some other cove in Antarctica named after a Bulgarian place.
Hence, from the given axioms, the truth value is not derivable.

We formalize the given information.

Predicates:
- LocatedIn x y: place x is located in place y
- IsCove x: x is a cove
- NamedAfter x y: x is named after y
- InBulgaria y: y is a place in Bulgaria

We encode the textual context as axioms and add transitivity of "located in".
We can derive that Barutin Cove is in the South Shetland Islands, but we cannot derive
that it is in Antarctica (the given direction is Antarctica ∈ South Shetland Islands).
Thus we cannot prove or refute the existential claim about a cove in Antarctica named
after a Bulgarian place.
