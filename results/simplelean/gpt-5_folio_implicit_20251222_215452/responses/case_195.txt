Target statement: KiKi is terricolous.
We attempt a proof; we can derive useful implications but cannot conclude Terricolous KiKi.
-/
theorem kiki_terricolous : Terricolous KiKi := by
  -- From terricolous to legs (using KiKi is an animal)
  have terri_to_legs : Terricolous KiKi → Legs KiKi := by
    intro t
    exact h5 KiKi ⟨h6, t⟩
  -- From legs to jumps (using KiKi is an animal)
  have legs_to_jumps : Legs KiKi → Jumps KiKi := by
    intro l
    exact h4 KiKi ⟨h6, l⟩
  -- These implications are not enough to conclude Terricolous KiKi from the given premises.
  -- Hence the goal cannot be derived from the assumptions.
  sorry

/-
We also cannot derive the negation ¬ Terricolous KiKi from the given premises.
-/
theorem not_kiki_terricolous : ¬ Terricolous KiKi := by
  -- No available premises yield a contradiction from assuming Terricolous KiKi.
  -- Hence the negation also cannot be derived.

We encode the problem as a context of predicates and constants with the axioms,
and then exhibit two concrete models: one where KiKi is not terricolous and one
where KiKi is terricolous. This shows the statement is not entailed by the
axioms (uncertain).

We show the statement "KiKi is terricolous" is not entailed by the axioms by
exhibiting two concrete models of the axioms: one where KiKi is not terricolous,
and one where KiKi is terricolous.
