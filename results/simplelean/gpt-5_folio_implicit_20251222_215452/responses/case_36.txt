Observation:
From the given axioms, we have:
- If someone is a Composer, then they write some MusicPiece (composers_write).
- Beethoven wrote Symphony9, and Symphony9 is a MusicPiece.
However, there is no axiom stating that everyone who writes a MusicPiece is a Composer.
Thus, we cannot derive Composer Beethoven from the provided axioms.
Likewise, we have no information allowing us to derive ¬ Composer Beethoven.
Therefore, the truth value of Target is undetermined from the given information.
