Translation of the natural language context into a first-order signature with axioms,
and an analysis of the query statement "No one gets the flu."

We show the statement is not determined by the given axioms by building:
- A model where NoOneGetsFlu is true.
- A model where NoOneGetsFlu is false.
This demonstrates the information is insufficient to prove or refute the statement.

We formalize the given context in a structure `Model` with predicates and axioms
as fields, and analyze the statement "No one gets the flu" by constructing two
models: one where it holds and one where it fails.
