-- If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
axiom A1 : ∀ x y : obj, Man x → Man y → Taller x y → CanBlock x y

-- Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
axiom A2a : Man Michael
axiom A2b : ∀ y : obj, InMClass y → Taller Michael y

-- If x is taller than y and y is taller than z, then x is taller than z.
axiom A3 : ∀ x y z : obj, Taller x y → Taller y z → Taller x z

-- Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
axiom A4a : Man Peter
axiom A4b : Taller Peter Michael

-- Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
axiom A5 : ∀ p : obj, ¬ JumpsWhenShooting p → CanBlock Michael p

-- Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
axiom A6 : ¬ CanBlock Michael Windy

-- Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.
axiom A7 : ∀ s : obj, Shooter s ∧ JumpsWhenShooting s → GreatShooter s

-- From the given information, we cannot derive CanBlock Peter Windy or its negation.
-- In particular, we lack any relation between Peter and Windy's heights, and we do not know Windy is a man.
-- Therefore, the statement "Peter can block Windy's shooting" is not provable nor refutable from the premises.
