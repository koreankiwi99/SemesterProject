axiom obj : Type

axiom CanTransportMultiplePassengers : obj → Prop
axiom OneSeater : obj → Prop
axiom TeslaModel3 : obj → Prop
axiom SingleSeatElectricCar : obj → Prop
axiom SoloEV : obj → Prop

-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, CanTransportMultiplePassengers x → ¬ OneSeater x
-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, TeslaModel3 x → CanTransportMultiplePassengers x
-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x
-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x
-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
axiom R5 : ¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar → (¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar ∨ SingleSeatElectricCar JohnCar)

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive SoloEV JohnCar or its negation.
-- No theorem can be proved or refuted with the provided information.
