-- Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.

-- All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
axiom pro_jump : ∀ x : obj, Pro x → JumpShots x
-- If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
axiom jump_leap : ∀ x : obj, JumpShots x → LeapStraight x
-- If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles.
axiom leap_activate : ∀ x : obj, LeapStraight x → ActivateLegMuscles x
-- Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.
axiom yuri_not_activate : ¬ ActivateLegMuscles Yuri

-- Deductions we can make (do not settle Yuri's nationality)
theorem yuri_not_leap : ¬ LeapStraight Yuri :=
  fun hleap => yuri_not_activate (leap_activate Yuri hleap)

theorem yuri_not_jump : ¬ JumpShots Yuri :=
  fun hjump => yuri_not_leap (jump_leap Yuri hjump)

theorem yuri_not_pro : ¬ Pro Yuri :=
  fun hpro => yuri_not_jump (pro_jump Yuri hpro)

-- Cannot prove American Yuri or ¬ American Yuri from the given axioms
