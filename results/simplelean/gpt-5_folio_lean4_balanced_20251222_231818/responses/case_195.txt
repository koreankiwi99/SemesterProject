-- Jane does not like any animals that bark.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Bark x) → ¬ LikesJane x
-- All dogs are animals that bark.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Dog x → (Animal x ∧ Bark x)
-- Jane likes all animals that jump.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Jumps x) → LikesJane x
-- If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Legs x) → Jumps x
-- If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, (Animal x ∧ Terricolous x) → Legs x
-- KiKi is an animal.
axiom A6 : Animal KiKi
-- If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
axiom A7 : (¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ Legs KiKi) → (Terricolous KiKi ∨ Legs KiKi)

-- A useful derived fact: if KiKi does not jump, then KiKi is terricolous.
