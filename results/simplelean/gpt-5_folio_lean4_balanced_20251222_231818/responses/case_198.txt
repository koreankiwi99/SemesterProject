axiom obj : Type
axiom Ailton : obj
axiom Nautico : obj
axiom PlaysFor : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Brazilian : obj → Prop

-- From the context:
axiom H1 : PlaysFor Ailton Nautico
axiom H2 : Brazilian Ailton

-- The statement "No one playing for Nautico is Brazilian" is:
-- ∀ x, PlaysFor x Nautico → ¬ Brazilian x
-- We prove its negation.
