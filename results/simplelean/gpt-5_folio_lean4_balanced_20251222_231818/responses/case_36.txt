axiom obj : Type

axiom VMS : obj

axiom MusicPiece : obj → Prop

axiom Writes : obj → obj → Prop

axiom Leads : obj → obj → Prop
axiom Conductor : obj → Prop

-- Facts from the context
axiom F1 : MusicPiece Symphony9
-- "Composers write music pieces." (modeled as: composers write music pieces)
axiom F2 : ∀ x : obj, Composer x → ∀ y : obj, MusicPiece y → Writes x y
axiom F3 : Writes Beethoven Symphony9
axiom F4 : Premiered VMS Symphony9
axiom F5 : Orchestra VMS
axiom F6 : Leads Beethoven VMS
-- "Orchestras are led by conductors." (leaders of orchestras are conductors)
axiom F7 : ∀ o p : obj, Orchestra o → Leads p o → Conductor p

-- Goal would be: Composer Beethoven
-- From these premises, we cannot derive Composer Beethoven nor its negation.
-- The writing of a music piece does not imply being a composer under F2's direction.
