-- All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ Schedules x → InCompanyToday x
-- Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, LunchInCompany x → Schedules x
-- Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x → (LunchInCompany x ∨ LunchAtHome x)
-- If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → Remote x
-- All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, Employee x ∧ Abroad x → Remote x
-- No managers work remotely from home.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : Person, Manager x → ¬ Remote x
-- James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom A7 : InCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Goal: ¬ LunchInCompany James
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive ¬ LunchInCompany James or its negation.
-- There is no information that James is an employee, which is needed to connect lunch location to appearance/remote status.
-- Hence the statement is not derivable.
