axiom Dreamy : obj → Prop
axiom MaxDesign : obj → Prop

-- All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Zaha x ∧ Adored x → Interesting x
-- No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Brutalist x ∧ Adored x → ¬ Interesting x
-- Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Adored x → Zaha x ∨ Kelly x
-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Kelly x ∧ Adored x → Evocative x
-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Kelly x ∧ Adored x → Dreamy x
-- If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then it is a brutalist building and evocative.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, MaxDesign x ∧ Adored x ∧ Interesting x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- Target claim from the question (interpreted as existential):
-- "A design by Max is evocative and dreamy."
-- i.e., there exists some design by Max that is both evocative and dreamy.
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive existence of any design by Max,
-- nor can we refute the existence of a Max design that is both evocative and dreamy.
-- Hence, we cannot prove this statement or its negation from the premises alone.
-- theorem max_design_evocative_and_dreamy : ∃ x : obj, MaxDesign x ∧ Evocative x ∧ Dreamy x := by
--   admit

-- Moreover, we also cannot prove ¬ (∃ x, MaxDesign x ∧ Evocative x ∧ Dreamy x) from the premises.
