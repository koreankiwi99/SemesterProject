-- Predicates
axiom Adored : obj → Prop
axiom ZahaStyle : obj → Prop
axiom KellyStyle : obj → Prop
axiom Brutalist : obj → Prop
axiom Interesting : obj → Prop
axiom Evocative : obj → Prop
axiom Dreamy : obj → Prop
axiom Style : obj → Prop
axiom DesignByMax : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
-- All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, ZahaStyle x ∧ Adored x → Interesting x

-- No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Brutalist x ∧ Adored x → ¬ Interesting x

-- Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Style x ∧ Adored x → ZahaStyle x ∨ KellyStyle x

-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, KellyStyle x ∧ Adored x → Evocative x

-- All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, KellyStyle x ∧ Adored x → Dreamy x

-- If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x ∧ Adored x ∧ Interesting x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- Goal: A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy.
-- Formal target: ∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x → Evocative x ∨ Dreamy x
-- From the given premises, there is no link that every design by Max is adored, or is a Kelly/Zaha style,
-- or has interesting geometries. Hence we cannot derive the goal nor its negation.
-- Therefore, the truth value is uncertain given the premises.
