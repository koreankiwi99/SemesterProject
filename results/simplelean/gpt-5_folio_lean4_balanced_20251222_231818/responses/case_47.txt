axiom Person : Type
axiom Emma : Person
axiom Mia : Person
axiom James : Person

inductive Season where
| Spring : Season
| Summer : Season
| Fall : Season
| Winter : Season

axiom fav : Person → Season
axiom WantsLongVacation : Person → Prop

-- All students who want to have a long vacation have summer as their favorite season.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, WantsLongVacation x → fav x = Season.Summer
-- Emma's favorite season is summer.
axiom T_EmmaFav : fav Emma = Season.Summer
-- Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's.
axiom T_MiaDiff : fav Mia ≠ fav Emma
-- James wants to have a long vacation.
axiom T_JamesWants : WantsLongVacation James

-- Goal: Mia's favorite season is spring.
-- From T_MiaDiff and T_EmmaFav we can derive fav Mia ≠ Season.Summer,
-- but we have no information to conclude it is specifically Spring (could be Fall or Winter).
-- Therefore, we cannot prove fav Mia = Season.Spring or its negation from the given axioms.
