axiom obj : Type
axiom James : obj

-- Predicates
axiom Employee : obj → Prop
axiom Manager : obj → Prop
axiom InOtherCountries : obj → Prop
axiom LunchHome : obj → Prop
axiom LunchBuilding : obj → Prop
axiom SchedulesMeetingWithCustomers : obj → Prop
axiom GoToCompanyBuildingToday : obj → Prop
axiom RemoteFromHome : obj → Prop
axiom AppearInCompanyToday : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ SchedulesMeetingWithCustomers x → GoToCompanyBuildingToday x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, LunchBuilding x → SchedulesMeetingWithCustomers x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → (LunchBuilding x ∨ LunchHome x)
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ LunchHome x → RemoteFromHome x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → RemoteFromHome x
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬ RemoteFromHome x
axiom A7 : AppearInCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Target statement (paraphrased):
-- (Manager James ∨ InOtherCountries James) → ¬ (LunchHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James)
-- ∧
-- (LunchHome James ∨ RemoteFromHome James) → (¬ Manager James ∧ ¬ InOtherCountries James)
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive this statement nor its negation,
-- since we have no information that James is an Employee, which is required
-- to link LunchHome or InOtherCountries to RemoteFromHome, and Manager → ¬RemoteFromHome
-- does not imply ¬LunchHome without Employee.
-- Therefore, the truth of the target statement is undecidable from the premises.
