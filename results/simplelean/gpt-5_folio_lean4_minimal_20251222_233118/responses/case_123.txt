-- If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, MultiPassenger x → ¬ OneSeater x

-- All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, TeslaModel3 x → MultiPassenger x

-- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, SingleSeatElectricCar x → OneSeater x

-- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → SingleSeatElectricCar x

-- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.
axiom A5 : (¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar) → ((¬ TeslaModel3 JohnCar) ∨ SingleSeatElectricCar JohnCar)

-- A useful derived fact: any Solo EV cannot be a Tesla Model 3 (since Solo EV ⇒ one-seater and Tesla Model 3 ⇒ not one-seater).
theorem soloEV_implies_not_TM3 : ∀ x : obj, SoloEV x → ¬ TeslaModel3 x := by
  intro x
  intro hSolo
  intro hTM3
  have hSSE : SingleSeatElectricCar x := A4 x hSolo
  have hOne : OneSeater x := A3 x hSSE
  have hMulti : MultiPassenger x := A2 x hTM3
  have hNotOne : ¬ OneSeater x := A1 x hMulti
  exact hNotOne hOne

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive ¬ SoloEV JohnCar, nor can we derive SoloEV JohnCar.
-- Hence the truth of "John's car is not a Solo EV" is not determined by the premises.
