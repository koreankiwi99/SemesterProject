-- All hydrocarbons are organic compounds.

-- All alkanes are hydrocarbons.

-- All organic compounds are chemical compounds.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Organic x → Chemical x
-- All organic compounds contain carbon.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Organic x → ContainsCarbon x
-- No chemical compounds contain only one element.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Chemical x → ¬ OneElement x
-- The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither.
