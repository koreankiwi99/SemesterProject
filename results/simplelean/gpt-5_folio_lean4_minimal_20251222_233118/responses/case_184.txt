-- Goal: Dani Shapiro is a novel writer.
-- To apply A3 with b = FamilyHistory and p = DaniShapiro, we would need:
--   (1) Book FamilyHistory
--   (2) Novel FamilyHistory          [we have this: F4]
--   (3) Person DaniShapiro
--   (4) WrittenBy FamilyHistory DaniShapiro  [we have this: F3]
-- The facts (1) and (3) are not derivable from the given axioms.
-- Hence we cannot prove NovelWriter DaniShapiro nor its negation from the provided information.
