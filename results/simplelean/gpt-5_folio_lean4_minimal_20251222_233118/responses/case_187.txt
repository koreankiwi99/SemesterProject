-- Some professional basketball players are not American nationals.

-- All professional basketball players can do jump shots.
axiom all_pro_can_jump : ∀ x : obj, ProPlayer x → CanJumpShots x

-- If someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air.
axiom jump_implies_leap : ∀ x : obj, CanJumpShots x → LeapsStraight x

-- If someone leaps straight into the air, they activate their leg muscles.
axiom leap_implies_activate : ∀ x : obj, LeapsStraight x → ActivatesLegMuscles x

-- Yuri does not activate his leg muscles.
axiom yuri_not_activate : ¬ ActivatesLegMuscles Yuri

-- From the chain of implications and Yuri's lack of activation, we can show Yuri is not a pro player.

  intro hpro
  have hjump : CanJumpShots Yuri := all_pro_can_jump Yuri hpro
  have hleap : LeapsStraight Yuri := jump_implies_leap Yuri hjump
  have hact : ActivatesLegMuscles Yuri := leap_implies_activate Yuri hleap
  exact yuri_not_activate hact

-- Cannot prove American Yuri or ¬ American Yuri from the given axioms.
