-- Axioms from the context
-- Jane does not like any animals that bark.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → Bark x → ¬ Likes Jane x

-- All dogs are animals that bark.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Dog x → Animal x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Dog x → Bark x

-- Jane likes all animals that jump.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → Jumps x → Likes Jane x

-- If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → HasLegs x → Jumps x

-- If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x → Terricolous x → HasLegs x

-- KiKi is an animal.
axiom A7 : Animal KiKi

-- If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
axiom A8 : (¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ HasLegs KiKi) → (Terricolous KiKi ∨ HasLegs KiKi)

-- Goal: Is KiKi a barking dog? i.e., Dog KiKi ∧ Bark KiKi
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive Dog KiKi (no premise links KiKi to being a dog).
-- We also cannot derive Bark KiKi independently (only dogs are stated to bark).
-- Nor can we derive the negation ¬(Dog KiKi ∧ Bark KiKi) from the given information.
-- Therefore, the statement is not provable nor is its negation.
