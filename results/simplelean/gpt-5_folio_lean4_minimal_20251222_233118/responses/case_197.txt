-- Jane does not like any animals that bark.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x ∧ Bark x → ¬ Likes Jane x
-- All dogs are animals that bark.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Dog x → Animal x ∧ Bark x
-- Jane likes all animals that jump.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x ∧ Jumps x → Likes Jane x
-- If an animal has legs, then it jumps.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x ∧ Legs x → Jumps x
-- If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Animal x ∧ Terricolous x → Legs x
-- KiKi is an animal.
axiom A6 : Animal KiKi
-- If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.
axiom A7 : (¬ Jumps KiKi ∧ ¬ Legs KiKi) → (Terricolous KiKi ∨ Legs KiKi)

-- A small consequence: it's not the case that KiKi both doesn't jump and doesn't have legs.

-- Target (not derivable from given axioms): ¬ Bark KiKi ∧ ¬ Dog KiKi
-- We cannot prove either ¬ Bark KiKi or ¬ Dog KiKi from the provided information.
-- Likewise, we also cannot prove Bark KiKi or Dog KiKi.
