-- Context axioms
axiom A1 : MusicPiece Symphony9
-- "Composers write music pieces" (modeled as: composers write any music piece)
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Composer x → ∀ y : obj, MusicPiece y → Wrote x y
axiom A3 : Wrote Beethoven Symphony9
axiom A4 : Premiered ViennaMusicSociety Symphony9
axiom A5 : Orchestra ViennaMusicSociety
axiom A6 : Leads Beethoven ViennaMusicSociety
-- "Orchestras are led by conductors"
axiom A7 : ∀ o : obj, Orchestra o → ∀ p : obj, Leads p o → Conductor p

-- We can derive that Beethoven is a conductor
theorem beethoven_conductor : Conductor Beethoven :=
  A7 ViennaMusicSociety A5 Beethoven A6

-- However, from the given axioms, we cannot derive Composer Beethoven
-- nor its negation.
-- No theorem for Composer Beethoven can be proved or refuted here.
