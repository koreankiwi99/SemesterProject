-- Predicates
axiom Employee : obj → Prop
axiom Manager : obj → Prop
axiom SchedulesWithCustomers : obj → Prop
axiom LunchInCompany : obj → Prop
axiom LunchAtHome : obj → Prop
axiom RemoteFromHome : obj → Prop
axiom InOtherCountries : obj → Prop
axiom AtCompanyToday : obj → Prop

-- Axioms from the context
-- All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will go to the company building today.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ SchedulesWithCustomers x → AtCompanyToday x

-- Everyone who has lunch in the company building schedules meetings with their customers.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, LunchInCompany x → SchedulesWithCustomers x

-- Employees have lunch either in the company building or at home. (interpreted as inclusive or)
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x → (LunchInCompany x ∨ LunchAtHome x)

-- If an employee has lunch at home, they are working remotely from home.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ LunchAtHome x → RemoteFromHome x

-- All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Employee x ∧ InOtherCountries x → RemoteFromHome x

-- No managers work remotely from home.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, Manager x → ¬ RemoteFromHome x

-- James will appear in the company today iff he is a manager.
axiom A7 : AtCompanyToday James ↔ Manager James

-- Goal in question: ¬ LunchInCompany James
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive ¬ LunchInCompany James or LunchInCompany James.
-- No axiom states James is an employee, nor any link that forbids lunch in company based on A7 and A6.
-- Thus the statement is not derivable, and neither is its negation.
