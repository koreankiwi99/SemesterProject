axiom Person : Type
axiom Season : Type

axiom Spring : Season
axiom Summer : Season
axiom Fall : Season
axiom Winter : Season

axiom Emma : Person
axiom Mia : Person
axiom James : Person

axiom Favorite : Person → Season
axiom Student : Person → Prop
axiom WantsLongVacation : Person → Prop

-- All students who want a long vacation have summer as their favorite season
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, Student x → WantsLongVacation x → Favorite x = Summer

-- Emma's favorite season is summer
axiom E1 : Favorite Emma = Summer

-- Mia's favorite season is not the same as Emma's
axiom E2 : Favorite Mia ≠ Favorite Emma

-- James wants to have a long vacation
axiom E3 : WantsLongVacation James

-- From the given information, we cannot conclude that James is a student.
-- Therefore, we cannot derive Favorite James = Summer using R1.
-- We also cannot derive ¬ (Favorite James = Summer) from the given axioms.

-- Hence, the statement "James's favorite season is summer" is not provable nor disprovable here.
