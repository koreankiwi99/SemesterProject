axiom LanguageFamily : (obj → Prop) → Prop

-- All Romance languages are Indo-European.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Romance x → IndoEuropean x

-- Romance languages are a language family.
axiom A2 : LanguageFamily Romance

-- All languages within a language family are related to each other.
axiom A3 : ∀ F : obj → Prop, LanguageFamily F → ∀ x y : obj, F x → F y → Related x y

-- French and Spanish are Romance languages.
axiom A4 : Romance French
axiom A5 : Romance Spanish

-- German is related to Spanish.
axiom A6 : Related German Spanish

-- Basque is not related to any other language.
axiom A7 : ∀ y : obj, y ≠ Basque → ¬ Related Basque y

-- Goal: Romance German
-- From the given axioms, we can derive that any two Romance languages are related,
-- but being related to a Romance language (German related to Spanish) does not imply being Romance.
-- Hence we cannot prove Romance German or its negation from the given information.
-- Example derivable fact: Related Spanish French (from A3, A2, A5, A4)
theorem related_spanish_french : Related Spanish French :=
  A3 Romance A2 Spanish French A5 A4

-- Cannot prove Romance German or ¬ Romance German from the given axioms.
