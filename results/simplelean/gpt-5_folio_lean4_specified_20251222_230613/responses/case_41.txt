axiom Evocative : obj → Prop
axiom Dreamy : obj → Prop

-- Premises from the textual context
-- 1. All of Zaha Hadid's design styles that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, ZahaStyle x ∧ Adores x → Interesting x

-- 2. No brutalist buildings that Max adores have interesting geometries.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Brutalist x ∧ Adores x → ¬ Interesting x

-- 3. Every style that Max adores is either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Style x ∧ Adores x → ZahaStyle x ∨ KellyStyle x

-- 4. All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are evocative.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, KellyStyle x ∧ Adores x → Evocative x

-- 5. All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles that Max adores are dreamy.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, KellyStyle x ∧ Adores x → Dreamy x

-- 6. If a design by Max that he adores has interesting geometries, then the design is a brutalist building and evocative.
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x ∧ Adores x ∧ Interesting x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- Claim (question): A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy.
-- We formalize this as: ∀ x, DesignByMax x → Evocative x ∨ Dreamy x
theorem max_design_evocative_or_dreamy : ∀ x : obj, DesignByMax x → Evocative x ∨ Dreamy x := by
  -- From the given premises, this statement cannot be derived.
  -- There is no information connecting all designs by Max to being evocative or dreamy
  -- unless they are Kelly styles (which is about styles) or have interesting geometries (which only yields evocative under additional assumptions).
  -- Hence we cannot prove the statement from the premises.
