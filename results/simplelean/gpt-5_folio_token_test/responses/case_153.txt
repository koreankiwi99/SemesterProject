-- All hydrocarbons are organic compounds.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Hydrocarbon x → Organic x
-- All alkanes are hydrocarbons.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Alkane x → Hydrocarbon x
-- All organic compounds are chemical compounds.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Organic x → Chemical x
-- All organic compounds contain carbon.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Organic x → ContainsCarbon x
-- No chemical compounds contain only one element.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Chemical x → ¬ OnlyOneElement x
-- The mixture either both is a chemical compound and contains only one element, or neither.
-- Encoded as an equivalence.
axiom A6 : Chemical Mixture ↔ OnlyOneElement Mixture
