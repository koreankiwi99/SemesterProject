-- All aliens are extraterrestrials.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Alien x → Extraterrestrial x
-- If someone is from Mars, then they are an alien.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, FromMars x → Alien x
-- No extraterrestrials are human.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Extraterrestrial x → ¬ Human x
-- All highly intelligent beings from Earth are humans.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, HighlyIntelligent x ∧ FromEarth x → Human x
-- Marvin is a highly intelligent being.
axiom T5 : HighlyIntelligent Marvin
-- Marvin is either from Earth and from Mars, or he is from neither.
axiom T6 : (FromEarth Marvin ∧ FromMars Marvin) ∨ (¬FromEarth Marvin ∧ ¬FromMars Marvin)
-- If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial.
