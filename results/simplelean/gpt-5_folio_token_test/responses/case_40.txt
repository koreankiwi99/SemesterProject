axiom obj : Type

-- Predicates for categories/designers/properties
axiom Zaha : obj → Prop                -- Zaha Hadid's design style
axiom Kelly : obj → Prop               -- Kelly Wearstler's design style
axiom Brutalist : obj → Prop
axiom Interesting : obj → Prop
axiom Evocative : obj → Prop
axiom Dreamy : obj → Prop
axiom Adores : obj → Prop              -- Max adores this object
axiom ByMax : obj → Prop               -- This object is a design by Max

-- Axioms from the context
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Zaha x ∧ Adores x → Interesting x
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Brutalist x ∧ Adores x → ¬ Interesting x
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, Adores x → Zaha x ∨ Kelly x
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Kelly x ∧ Adores x → Evocative x
axiom A5 : ∀ x : obj, Kelly x ∧ Adores x → Dreamy x
axiom A6 : ∀ x : obj, ByMax x ∧ Adores x ∧ Interesting x → Brutalist x ∧ Evocative x

-- Target statement: ∃ x, ByMax x ∧ Evocative x ∧ Dreamy x
-- From the given axioms, there is no existence assumption about any ByMax object
-- or any adored object, so we cannot derive existence of such a design.
-- Likewise, we cannot derive its negation (that no ByMax object is both evocative and dreamy),
-- since nothing prohibits a non-adored design by Max from being evocative and dreamy.

-- Therefore, we cannot prove the statement nor its negation from the given axioms.
