-- When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox.
-- We formalize "may get" as a simple implication.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, MonkeypoxVirusOccurs x → Monkeypox x

-- Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals (there exists at least one).
axiom R2 : ∃ x : obj, Animal x ∧ MonkeypoxVirusOccurs x

-- Humans are mammals. Mammals are animals.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Human x → Mammal x
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Mammal x → Animal x

-- Symptoms of Monkeypox include tiredness.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Monkeypox x → Tired x

-- People feel tired when they get the flu.
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Person x → Flu x → Tired x

-- Target statement: "No one gets the flu." i.e., ∀ x, Person x → ¬ Flu x
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive this, nor can we derive that someone gets the flu.
-- Hence, the truth value is undetermined from the context.
