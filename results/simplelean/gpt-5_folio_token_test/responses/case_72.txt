-- All growth stocks are bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Growth x → Bought x
-- If a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, Bought x → ¬ Suitable x
-- Some stocks are growth stocks.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, Stock x ∧ Growth x
-- All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Mature x → Suitable x
-- KO is a mature stock.
axiom A5 : Mature KO
