-- 1. If a restaurant is listed in Yelp’s recommendations, then it has not received many negative reviews.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : obj, Listed x → ¬ ManyNegReviews x

-- 2. All restaurants with a rating greater than four are listed in Yelp’s recommendations.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, RatingGT4 x → Listed x

-- 3. Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.
axiom A3 : ∃ x : obj, ¬ TakeOut x ∧ ManyNegReviews x

-- 4. All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than four.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : obj, Popular x → RatingGT4 x

-- 5. The Hamden Plaza Subway store has a rating greater than four, or it is popular among local residents.
axiom A5 : RatingGT4 HamdenPlazaStore ∨ Popular HamdenPlazaStore

-- We can derive that the Hamden Plaza store has not received many negative reviews,
-- but this does not entail anything about its take-out service.
theorem hamden_not_many_neg : ¬ ManyNegReviews HamdenPlazaStore :=
by
  cases A5 with
  | inl hRating => exact A1 HamdenPlazaStore (A2 HamdenPlazaStore hRating)
  | inr hPop => exact A1 HamdenPlazaStore (A2 HamdenPlazaStore (A4 HamdenPlazaStore hPop))

-- From the given axioms, we cannot prove ¬TakeOut HamdenPlazaStore or TakeOut HamdenPlazaStore.
