axiom obj : Type
axiom Restaurant : obj

axiom UsesFresh : obj → Prop
axiom TastesAmazing : obj → Prop
axiom PositiveReviews : obj → Prop
axiom LongLines : obj → Prop

-- Facts and rules from the context
axiom T1 : UsesFresh Restaurant
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, UsesFresh x → TastesAmazing x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, TastesAmazing x → PositiveReviews x

-- We can derive that positive reviews spread for the restaurant
theorem reviews_spread : PositiveReviews Restaurant := by
  apply R2 Restaurant
  apply R1 Restaurant
  exact T1

-- There is no given rule linking PositiveReviews (or TastesAmazing) to LongLines,
-- so we cannot prove LongLines Restaurant or its negation from the provided axioms.
