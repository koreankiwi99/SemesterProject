axiom obj : Type
axiom Mark : obj

axiom Athlete : obj → Prop
axiom ProperTraining : obj → Prop
axiom HealthyDiet : obj → Prop
axiom Skilled : obj → Prop
axiom Strong : obj → Prop
axiom Dedicated : obj → Prop

-- Proper training enhances skills
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, ProperTraining x → Skilled x
-- Healthy nutrition increases strength
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, HealthyDiet x → Strong x
-- Athletes are lacking in skill or deficient in strength
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Athlete x → (¬Skilled x ∨ ¬Strong x)
-- Being dedicated leads one to train properly
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Dedicated x → ProperTraining x

-- Fact: Mark eats a healthy diet
axiom HMark : HealthyDiet Mark

theorem mark_strong : Strong Mark := by
  exact R2 Mark HMark

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive Dedicated Mark or ¬Dedicated Mark
-- (we would need Mark to be an Athlete to use R3, which is not given).
