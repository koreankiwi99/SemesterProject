-- If the car has gas, then they can drive long distances.

-- If they see the sights, then they take the scenic route.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : person, SeeSights x → ScenicRoute x
-- Either the car has gas, or they are not taking the scenic route, or both gas and not scenic.
axiom D1 : HasGas Mike ∨ ¬ScenicRoute Mike ∨ (HasGas Mike ∧ ¬ScenicRoute Mike)
-- If someone loves road trips, they take the scenic route to see the sights.
axiom C1 : ∀ x : person, LovesRoadTrips x → (ScenicRoute x ∧ SeeSights x)

-- From the assumptions, if Mike cannot drive long distances, then he does not love road trips.
