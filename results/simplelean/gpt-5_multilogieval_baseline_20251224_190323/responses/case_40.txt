-- If someone starts a new workout routine, they will be motivated to keep it up.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, Started x → Motivated x
-- If the gym closes for renovations, then they can't follow their routine.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Person, GymClosed → CantFollow x
-- Either James started a new workout, or the gym was closed (or both).
axiom R3 : Started James ∨ GymClosed
-- If they couldn't follow their routine, they would feel frustrated.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : Person, CantFollow x → Frustrated x
-- If they felt frustrated, they might indulge in some unhealthy snacks.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : Person, Frustrated x → MightIndulge x

-- James was not motivated to workout.
axiom NotMotJames : ¬ Motivated James

-- From the premises, we can show James might indulge (but not necessarily that he did).

  have hFru : Frustrated James := R4 James hCF

-- We cannot derive Indulge James from MightIndulge James, and we have no information to prove ¬ Indulge James.
-- Hence, neither Indulge James nor its negation is provable from the given axioms.
