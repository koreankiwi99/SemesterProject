-- If someone plants a garden, they will need to water and care for the plants.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, PlantsGarden x → (NeedWater x ∧ NeedCare x)
-- If there is a drought, there will be a ban on watering gardens.
axiom R2 : Drought → WateringBan
-- Either Mark plants a garden or there is a drought (or both).
axiom R3 : PlantsGarden Mark ∨ Drought
-- If there is a watering ban, the plants will not get enough water.
axiom R4 : WateringBan → NotEnoughWater
-- If the plants don't get watered, the garden will fail to thrive (for anyone).
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, NotEnoughWater → GardenFail x

-- Mark did not need to care for garden plants.
axiom H1 : ¬ NeedCare Mark
