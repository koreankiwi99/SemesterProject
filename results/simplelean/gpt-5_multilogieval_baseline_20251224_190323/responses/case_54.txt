axiom ScoresEarly : Prop
axiom PumpedUp : Prop
axiom CheerLoudly : Prop
axiom PlayRival : Prop
axiom Booing : Prop

axiom early_imp_pumped : ScoresEarly → PumpedUp
axiom pumped_imp_cheer : PumpedUp → CheerLoudly
axiom early_or_rival : ScoresEarly ∨ PlayRival
axiom pumped_imp_boo : PumpedUp → Booing

-- From the question:
axiom not_cheer : ¬ CheerLoudly

-- Consequences:
theorem not_pumped : ¬ PumpedUp := fun hp => not_cheer (pumped_imp_cheer hp)
theorem not_early : ¬ ScoresEarly := fun hs => not_pumped (early_imp_pumped hs)
theorem rival_true : PlayRival :=
  Or.elim early_or_rival
    (fun hs => False.elim (not_early hs))
    (fun hr => hr)

-- We cannot derive Booing or ¬Booing from the given axioms.
