-- If the movie gets good reviews, then a lot of people will go see it.
axiom R1 : GoodReviews → ManyPeople

-- If someone buys advance tickets, then they plan to see that movie.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Person, BuysAdvance x → PlansSee x

-- Either the movie got good reviews, or not many people went to see it,
-- or it got good reviews but attendance was still low.
axiom D1 : GoodReviews ∨ ¬ManyPeople ∨ (GoodReviews ∧ LowAttendance)

-- If a big star is in the movie, then it likely got good reviews (modeled as: got good reviews).
axiom R3 : BigStar → GoodReviews

-- Either there is a big star in it, or it is a sequel, or both.
axiom D2 : BigStar ∨ Sequel

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive LowAttendance → Sequel nor its negation.
-- No theorem provided as it is not derivable from the current axioms.
