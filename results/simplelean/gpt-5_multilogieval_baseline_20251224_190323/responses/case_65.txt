axiom HighQualityWood : Prop
axiom PreciseJoints : Prop
axiom Sturdy : Prop
axiom LongLasting : Prop

-- Context rule: If the wood is high quality, then if joints are precise, the product is sturdy and long-lasting.
axiom Rule : HighQualityWood → (PreciseJoints → (Sturdy ∧ LongLasting))

-- Facts from the question:
axiom joints_precise : PreciseJoints
axiom not_sturdy : ¬ Sturdy
axiom not_long_lasting : ¬ LongLasting

-- Conclusion: The wood was not high quality.
theorem wood_not_high_quality : ¬ HighQualityWood := by
  intro hq
  have hImp : PreciseJoints → (Sturdy ∧ LongLasting) := Rule hq
  have hGood : Sturdy ∧ LongLasting := hImp joints_precise
  have hSturdy : Sturdy := And.left hGood
