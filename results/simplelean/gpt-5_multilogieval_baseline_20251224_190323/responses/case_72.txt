-- If it is close to dinnertime, then they should start cooking.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, Close x → StartCooking x
-- If they go shopping, then they can make dinner.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, GoShopping x → CanMakeDinner x
-- Either it is close to dinnertime, or they won't make dinner.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, Close x ∨ ¬ MakeDinner x
-- If the fridge is empty, then they must go shopping.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, FridgeEmpty x → GoShopping x
-- If there are no ingredients in the pantry, then the fridge is empty.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, PantryEmpty x → FridgeEmpty x

-- Goal: StartCooking Sam → PantryEmpty Sam
-- From the given axioms, there is no way to derive PantryEmpty from StartCooking,
-- nor to derive its negation, since we have no links from StartCooking to (not) PantryEmpty.
-- Hence, the statement cannot be proved or disproved with the provided information.
