axiom obj : Type
axiom Lauren : obj

-- Predicates
axiom Develops : obj → Prop        -- develops compelling characters
axiom Crafts : obj → Prop          -- crafts an intriguing plot
axiom Connects : obj → Prop        -- book connects with readers

-- Rule: if someone develops compelling characters, then if they craft an intriguing plot, their book will connect with readers
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Develops x → (Crafts x → Connects x)

-- Facts about Lauren
axiom L1 : Crafts Lauren
axiom L2 : ¬ Connects Lauren

-- From the rule and Lauren's facts, conclude that Lauren did not develop compelling characters
theorem lauren_not_develops : ¬ Develops Lauren :=

  intro hDev
  have hConn : Connects Lauren := R1 Lauren hDev L1
