-- If someone worked out hard, they are sore the next day.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, WorkedHard x → Sore x
-- If someone takes a hot shower, their muscles relax.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, HotShower x → Relaxed x
-- If the weather is cold, everyone takes a hot shower.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, Cold → HotShower x
-- If it rains, then the weather is cold.
axiom A4 : Rain → Cold
-- There exists someone such that either they worked out hard or their muscles did not relax.
axiom A5 : ∃ x : Person, WorkedHard x ∨ ¬ Relaxed x

-- From rain we can derive that John's muscles relax.
theorem rain_implies_relaxed_john : Rain → Relaxed John := by
  intro hR
  have hC : Cold := A4 hR
  have hH : HotShower John := (A3 John) hC
  exact (A2 John) hH

-- Question: If John's muscles are not sore today, did it rain?
-- Target would be: ¬ Sore John → Rain
-- From the given axioms, there is no link from ¬Sore John to Rain or ¬Rain.
-- Hence we cannot prove (¬ Sore John → Rain) nor its negation from the assumptions.
-- theorem rain_from_not_sore : ¬ Sore John → Rain := by
--   -- Cannot be derived from given axioms.
