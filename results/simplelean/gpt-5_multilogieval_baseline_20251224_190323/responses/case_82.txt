axiom Person : Type
axiom James : Person

-- Predicates about people
axiom WonBakingContest : Person → Prop
axiom CelebratedWithFriendsAndFamily : Person → Prop
axiom BakedPeachPie : Person → Prop

-- Global propositions about the world/house/market
axiom FarmersMarketHasRipeJuicyPeaches : Prop
axiom PeachesInSeason : Prop
axiom HouseSmellsAmazing : Prop
axiom HouseFeelsHomeyAndCozy : Prop

-- Rules from the context
-- If the farmer's market has ripe, juicy peaches, someone will bake a peach pie.
axiom R_market_bake : FarmersMarketHasRipeJuicyPeaches → ∃ p : Person, BakedPeachPie p

-- If someone won a baking contest, they'll celebrate with friends and family.
axiom R_won_celebrate : ∀ p : Person, WonBakingContest p → CelebratedWithFriendsAndFamily p

-- Either peaches are in season, or someone won a contest (or both).
axiom R_season_or_winner : PeachesInSeason ∨ ∃ p : Person, WonBakingContest p

-- If someone bakes a pie, the house will smell amazing.
axiom R_bake_smell : ∀ p : Person, BakedPeachPie p → HouseSmellsAmazing

-- If the house smells amazing, it feels like a homey, cozy place to relax.
axiom R_smell_homey : HouseSmellsAmazing → HouseFeelsHomeyAndCozy

-- Some derivable consequences (do not solve the main question but show available reasoning)

-- From market peaches we can derive the house is homey and cozy.
theorem homey_from_market : FarmersMarketHasRipeJuicyPeaches → HouseFeelsHomeyAndCozy :=
by
  intro hMarket
  obtain ⟨p, hBake⟩ := R_market_bake hMarket
  have hSmell : HouseSmellsAmazing := R_bake_smell p hBake
  exact R_smell_homey hSmell

-- Contrapositive instance: if James did not celebrate, then James did not win.
theorem not_won_if_not_celebrated : ¬ CelebratedWithFriendsAndFamily James → ¬ WonBakingContest James :=
by
  intro hNotCeleb
  intro hWon
  apply hNotCeleb
  exact R_won_celebrate James hWon

-- Goal (from the question):
-- ¬ CelebratedWithFriendsAndFamily James → HouseFeelsHomeyAndCozy
-- From the given axioms, this cannot be derived, nor can its negation be derived.
-- We lack any bridge from PeachesInSeason or (∃ winner) to FarmersMarketHasRipeJuicyPeaches,
-- and thus to a baked pie and a homey, cozy house.
-- Hence the statement remains unprovable from the provided context.
