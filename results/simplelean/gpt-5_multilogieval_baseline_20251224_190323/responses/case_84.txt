-- If they practiced new melodies daily, they expanded their repertoire.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, PracticedNewMelodiesDaily x → ExpandedRepertoire x
-- Expanding the repertoire gives more material.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, ExpandedRepertoire x → HasMoreMaterial x
-- Having more material yields enough songs for an album.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, HasMoreMaterial x → EnoughSongsForAlbum x
-- Enough songs for an album lets them compose an album.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, EnoughSongsForAlbum x → ComposedAlbum x

-- Either the musician practiced new melodies or they jammed with friends (or both).
axiom A1 : PracticedNewMelodiesDaily Musician ∨ JammedWithFriends Musician

-- If someone jammed with friends, they gained inspiration from collaboration.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : obj, JammedWithFriends x → InspiredFromCollaboration x
-- If they felt inspired, their creativity flourished.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : obj, InspiredFromCollaboration x → CreativityFlourished x

-- Derived: practicing new melodies leads to composing an album.

-- Target (cannot be proved from given axioms):
-- (¬ ReleasedAlbumThisYear Sarah) → CreativityFlourished Sarah
-- There is no connection given between releasing an album and the other predicates,
-- and we have no facts relating Sarah to practicing or jamming.
-- Likewise, we cannot prove its negation from the given information.
