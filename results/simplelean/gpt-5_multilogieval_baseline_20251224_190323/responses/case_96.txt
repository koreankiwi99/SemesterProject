-- If someone studies hard for an exam, they will feel confident going into the test.
axiom R1 : ∀ p : Person, ∀ e : Exam, StudiedHard p e → Confident p e
-- If there is severe weather in the forecast, schools may cancel class that day. (modeled as a possibility)
axiom R2 : SevereWeather → CancelPossible
-- Either Alex studied diligently for his biology exam, or class was not canceled due to the weather.
axiom R3 : StudiedHard Alex Biology ∨ ¬ClassCanceled
-- If a student feels confident about the material, they will likely do well on the exam.
axiom R4 : ∀ p : Person, ∀ e : Exam, Confident p e → DoWell p e
-- If a student performs well on an exam, they will be satisfied with their hard work.
axiom R5 : ∀ p : Person, ∀ e : Exam, DoWell p e → Satisfied p e

-- From studying hard for biology, Alex would be satisfied with biology (not history).
theorem alex_bio_satisfied_from_studying : StudiedHard Alex Biology → Satisfied Alex Biology :=
  fun h => R5 Alex Biology (R4 Alex Biology (R1 Alex Biology h))

-- Cannot derive SevereWeather → Satisfied Alex History, nor its negation, from the given axioms.
