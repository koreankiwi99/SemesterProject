axiom obj : Type
axiom Sam : obj

axiom Impressed : obj → Prop
axiom ExtraWork : obj → Prop
axiom Experience : obj → Prop
axiom Promotion : obj → Prop
axiom LeadNewTeam : obj → Prop

-- Rules from the context
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Impressed x → Promotion x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, ExtraWork x → Experience x
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Experience x → LeadNewTeam x

-- Disjunction about this employee (Sam)
axiom D1 : Impressed Sam ∨ ExtraWork Sam

-- Given in the question
axiom NP : ¬Promotion Sam

-- From NP and R1, Sam did not impress the manager
theorem notImpressedSam : ¬Impressed Sam := fun h => NP (R1 Sam h)

-- From the disjunction and notImpressed, Sam must have taken extra work
theorem extraWorkSam : ExtraWork Sam := by
  cases D1 with
  | inl hi =>
      exact False.elim (notImpressedSam hi)
  | inr he =>
      exact he

-- Therefore Sam gained experience
theorem experienceSam : Experience Sam := R2 Sam extraWorkSam

-- Therefore Sam was assigned to lead a new team
theorem leadSam : LeadNewTeam Sam := R3 Sam experienceSam

-- Cannot prove ¬LeadNewTeam Sam from given axioms (indeed, we proved LeadNewTeam Sam)
