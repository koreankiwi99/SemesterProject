axiom obj : Type
axiom Mark : obj

axiom WorkHard : obj → Prop
axiom GetPromotion : obj → Prop
axiom ImpressBosses : obj → Prop
axiom GainInfluence : obj → Prop
axiom Motivated : obj → Prop

-- Contextual rules
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, WorkHard x → GetPromotion x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, ImpressBosses x → GainInfluence x
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Motivated x → WorkHard x

-- Either some employee did not get a promotion, or some did not gain influence
axiom E1 : (∃ x : obj, ¬GetPromotion x) ∨ (∃ x : obj, ¬GainInfluence x)

-- Given: Mark impresses his bosses
axiom T_mark_impresses : ImpressBosses Mark

-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive ¬Motivated Mark
-- There is no connection from ImpressBosses to Motivated, and
-- the existential/disjunctive shortfalls do not target Mark.
