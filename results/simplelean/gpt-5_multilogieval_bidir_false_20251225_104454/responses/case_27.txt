axiom person : Type
axiom John : person

axiom CloseToLunch : Prop
axiom HungryCoworkers : person → Prop
axiom PreparedWell : person → Prop
axiom ReadyForMeeting : person → Prop
axiom Diligent : person → Prop

-- If it is close to lunchtime, then a person's coworkers are hungry
axiom R1 : ∀ x : person, CloseToLunch → HungryCoworkers x

-- If a person prepared well for the presentation, then they are ready for the meeting
axiom R2 : ∀ x : person, PreparedWell x → ReadyForMeeting x

-- Either it is close to lunchtime, or John is not ready, or both
axiom R3 : CloseToLunch ∨ ¬ReadyForMeeting John ∨ (CloseToLunch ∧ ¬ReadyForMeeting John)

-- Everyone understands: if someone is diligent, they prepare well
axiom R4 : ∀ x : person, Diligent x → PreparedWell x

-- Goal to negate: (¬HungryCoworkers John) → Diligent John
-- We would need to prove ¬((¬HungryCoworkers John) → Diligent John),
-- i.e., (¬HungryCoworkers John) ∧ ¬Diligent John, which is not derivable from the axioms.
-- Cannot prove ¬((¬HungryCoworkers John) → Diligent John) from given axioms
