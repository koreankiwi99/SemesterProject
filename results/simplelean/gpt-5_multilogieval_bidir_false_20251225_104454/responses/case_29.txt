axiom obj : Type
axiom Ty : obj

axiom SuspectsIdentityTheft : obj → Prop
axiom SuspectsFraud : obj → Prop
axiom CheckedCreditReport : obj → Prop
axiom ContactedBank : obj → Prop

-- If someone suspects identity theft, they should check their credit report.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, SuspectsIdentityTheft x → CheckedCreditReport x
-- If fraud is suspected, they should contact their bank.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, SuspectsFraud x → ContactedBank x

-- Either Ty did not verify his credit report or did not get in touch with his bank.
axiom E1 : ¬CheckedCreditReport Ty ∨ ¬ContactedBank Ty

-- From these premises, we cannot derive ¬SuspectsIdentityTheft Ty.
-- The disjunction E1 might hold because ¬ContactedBank Ty, which does not contradict SuspectsIdentityTheft Ty.
-- Therefore, ¬SuspectsIdentityTheft Ty is not provable from the given axioms.
