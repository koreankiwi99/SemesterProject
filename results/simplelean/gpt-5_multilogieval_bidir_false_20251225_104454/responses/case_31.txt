-- If someone suspects their partner is cheating, they should talk about it.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Suspects x → Talk x
-- Infidelity concerns warrant re-evaluating the relationship.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Suspects x → Reassess x

-- Either Priya did not talk to her partner, or she did not reassess the relationship.
axiom premise : ¬Talk Priya ∨ ¬Reassess Priya
