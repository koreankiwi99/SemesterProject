axiom FindsHacked : Person → Prop
axiom ResetPassword : Person → Prop
axiom DetectUnauthorizedAccess : Person → Prop
axiom NotifyBank : Person → Prop

-- If a person finds their account is hacked, they need to reset their password immediately.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, FindsHacked x → ResetPassword x
-- One should notify their bank if they detect unauthorized access.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Person, DetectUnauthorizedAccess x → NotifyBank x

-- Given statement: Either Lucy did not change her password or did not inform her bank.
axiom E1 : ¬ResetPassword Lucy ∨ ¬NotifyBank Lucy

-- From E1 we can derive that Lucy did not do both actions together.
theorem not_both_actions : ¬(ResetPassword Lucy ∧ NotifyBank Lucy) :=
  by
    intro h
    have hr : ResetPassword Lucy := h.left
    have hi : NotifyBank Lucy := h.right
    cases E1
    case inl nr => exact nr hr
    case inr ni => exact ni hi

-- Cannot prove ¬Hacked Lucy from given axioms
