axiom Person : Type
axiom Jake : Person

axiom Nice : Prop                     -- the weather is nice
axiom Relax : Person → Prop           -- can relax outside
axiom ReadBooks : Person → Prop       -- reads books
axiom PackedEnough : Person → Prop    -- packed enough
axiom Prepared : Person → Prop        -- is prepared

-- If the weather is nice, then one can relax outside.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : Person, Nice → Relax x
-- If someone reads books, then they packed enough.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : Person, ReadBooks x → PackedEnough x
-- Either the weather is nice, or they did not pack enough, or both.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : Person, Nice ∨ ¬PackedEnough x ∨ (Nice ∧ ¬PackedEnough x)
-- If someone is prepared, then they read books.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : Person, Prepared x → ReadBooks x

-- From the assumption (¬Relax Jake → Prepared Jake), we can derive ¬¬Relax Jake,
-- but this does not yield a contradiction with the given axioms, so we cannot prove the negation
-- of the queried implication from the premises.
