-- If the subway is running on schedule, then someone will take it to work (the subway).
axiom R1 : SubwayOnSchedule → ∃ x : obj, TakesSubway x
-- If the bus has room, then someone can catch a ride downtown.
axiom R2 : BusHasRoom → ∃ x : obj, TookBusDowntown x
-- Whether it's the subway or the bus, someone's commute will be smooth sailing.
axiom R3a : ∀ x : obj, TakesSubway x → SmoothCommute x
axiom R3b : ∀ x : obj, TookBusDowntown x → SmoothCommute x
-- If someone takes the subway, they'll get to work on time.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, TakesSubway x → OnTime x

-- Given statement: James did not take the bus downtown.
axiom J1 : ¬TookBusDowntown James

-- Cannot prove ¬OnTime James from the given axioms.
