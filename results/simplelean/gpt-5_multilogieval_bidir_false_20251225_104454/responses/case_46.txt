axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Volunteers x → Helps x

-- From the premises we can actually prove the implication holds:

  intro hA
  have hPH : ProvideHome Casey := R2 Casey hA
  have hV : Volunteers Casey := by
    have disj := R4 Casey

        exact False.elim (notPH hPH)
      | inr both =>
        exact False.elim (both.right hPH)
  have hH : Helps Casey := R1 Casey hV
  exact R3 Casey hH

-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation ¬(Adopts Casey → FeelsFulfillment Casey) from the given axioms.
