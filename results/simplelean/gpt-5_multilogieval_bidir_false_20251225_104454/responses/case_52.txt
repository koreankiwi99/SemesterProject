-- If the forecast predicts rain, then people will bring an umbrella when they go out.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, RainForecast → (GoOut x → BringUmbrella x)
-- If there is a big game on TV, then friends will get together to watch it.
axiom R2 : BigGame → FriendsGather
-- Either rain is forecasted, or friends did not get together to watch the game, or both rain is forecasted and friends did not get together to watch.
axiom D1 : RainForecast ∨ ¬FriendsGather ∨ (RainForecast ∧ ¬FriendsGather)
-- If the TV viewership is high, then there is a big game on tv.
axiom R3 : HighViewership → BigGame
-- Either the TV viewership is high, or they all decide to go play out, or maybe both are true.
axiom D2 : HighViewership ∨ GoPlay ∨ (HighViewership ∧ GoPlay)

-- James did not bring an umbrella.
axiom H_notUmb : ¬BringUmbrella James
-- If they all decide to go play out, then James goes out (he and his friends go out to play implies James goes out).
axiom GP_implies_J_out : GoPlay → GoOut James

-- From the above, we can rule out the combination RainForecast ∧ GoPlay
theorem not_rain_and_go_play : ¬(RainForecast ∧ GoPlay) := by
  intro h
  have hR : RainForecast := And.left h
  have hGP : GoPlay := And.right h
  have hJOut : GoOut James := GP_implies_J_out hGP
  have hUmb : BringUmbrella James := (R1 James hR) hJOut
  exact H_notUmb hUmb

-- However, from the given axioms, we cannot derive ¬GoPlay.
-- In particular, D2 allows GoPlay as one disjunct without forcing a contradiction.
-- Therefore we cannot prove the negation of the statement "he and his friends go out to play".
