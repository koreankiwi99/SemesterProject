axiom obj : Type
axiom Mary : obj

axiom PracticedOften : obj → Prop
axiom TechniqueImproved : obj → Prop
axiom ArtworkHighQuality : obj → Prop
axiom TookArtClass : obj → Prop
axiom LearnedNewMethods : obj → Prop

-- If someone practices often, their technique improves
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, PracticedOften x → TechniqueImproved x
-- If technique improves, artwork stands out as high quality
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, TechniqueImproved x → ArtworkHighQuality x
-- Either Mary practiced often or she took an art class (or both)
axiom R3 : PracticedOften Mary ∨ TookArtClass Mary
-- If someone takes an art class, they learn new methods and mediums
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, TookArtClass x → LearnedNewMethods x

-- Given: Mary's artwork did not stand out as high quality
axiom Mary_not_high_quality : ¬ArtworkHighQuality Mary

-- From the premises, we can actually prove that Mary learned new methods and mediums
theorem mary_learned : LearnedNewMethods Mary := by
  have h_not_practice : ¬PracticedOften Mary := by
    intro hP
    have hTech : TechniqueImproved Mary := R1 Mary hP
    have hHQ : ArtworkHighQuality Mary := R2 Mary hTech
    exact Mary_not_high_quality hHQ
  have hClass : TookArtClass Mary := by
    cases R3 with
    | inl hP => exact False.elim (h_not_practice hP)
    | inr hC => exact hC
  exact R4 Mary hClass

-- Cannot prove ¬LearnedNewMethods Mary from given axioms (indeed, the opposite is derivable)
