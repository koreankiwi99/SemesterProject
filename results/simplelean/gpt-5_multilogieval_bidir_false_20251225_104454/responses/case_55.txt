axiom obj : Type
axiom Movie : obj

-- Predicates about the movie
axiom GoodReviews : obj → Prop
axiom ManyPeopleWillGo : obj → Prop
axiom LowAttendance : obj → Prop
axiom BigStar : obj → Prop
axiom Sequel : obj → Prop

-- Predicates about people (included for completeness, though not used)
axiom BuysAdvanceTickets : obj → Prop
axiom PlansToSee : obj → obj → Prop

-- If the movie gets good reviews, then a lot of people will go see it.
axiom R1 : GoodReviews Movie → ManyPeopleWillGo Movie

-- Either the movie got good reviews, or not many people went to see it,
-- or it got good reviews but attendance was still low.
axiom R2 : GoodReviews Movie ∨ LowAttendance Movie ∨ (GoodReviews Movie ∧ LowAttendance Movie)

-- If a big star is in the movie, then it likely got good reviews.
axiom R3 : BigStar Movie → GoodReviews Movie

-- Either there is a big star in it, or it is a sequel, or both are true.
axiom R4 : BigStar Movie ∨ Sequel Movie ∨ (BigStar Movie ∧ Sequel Movie)

-- If someone buys advance tickets, then they plan to see that movie.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, BuysAdvanceTickets x → PlansToSee x Movie

-- Goal: Try to prove ¬(LowAttendance Movie → Sequel Movie)
-- From the given axioms, we cannot derive LowAttendance Movie
-- nor can we derive ¬Sequel Movie. Hence we cannot prove the negation
-- of the implication.
-- Cannot prove ¬(LowAttendance Movie → Sequel Movie) from given axioms
