axiom Rain : Prop
axiom Game : Prop
axiom PoolOpen : Prop
axiom Swim : Prop
axiom Enjoy : Prop
axiom Smiles : Prop

-- Premises
axiom R1 : ¬Rain → Game
axiom R2 : PoolOpen → Swim
axiom R3 : ¬Rain ∨ PoolOpen
axiom R4 : Game → Enjoy
axiom R5 : Enjoy → Smiles

-- From the disjunction, we can derive Swim ∨ Smiles
theorem swim_or_smiles : Swim ∨ Smiles := by
  cases R3 with
  | inl hNotRain =>
      have hGame : Game := R1 hNotRain
      have hEnjoy : Enjoy := R4 hGame
      have hSmiles : Smiles := R5 hEnjoy
      exact Or.inr hSmiles
  | inr hPoolOpen =>
      have hSwim : Swim := R2 hPoolOpen
      exact Or.inl hSwim

-- Hence, (¬Swim) → Smiles holds
theorem smiles_if_no_swim : (¬Swim) → Smiles := by
  intro hNoSwim
  have h := swim_or_smiles
  cases h with
  | inl hSwim =>
      have hFalse : False := hNoSwim hSwim
      exact False.elim hFalse
  | inr hSmiles => exact hSmiles

-- Therefore, we cannot prove ¬((¬Swim) → Smiles) from the given axioms.
