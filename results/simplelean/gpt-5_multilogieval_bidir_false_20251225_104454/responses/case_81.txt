-- If someone practiced the basic chords every day, they would develop muscle memory.
axiom A1 : ∀ x : Person, PracticeDaily x → DevelopMuscleMemory x
-- If they developed muscle memory, they would be able to play simple songs.
axiom A2 : ∀ x : Person, DevelopMuscleMemory x → CanPlaySimpleSongs x
-- Therefore, if someone practiced the basic chords daily, they could learn to play simple songs.
theorem practice_implies_simple : ∀ x : Person, PracticeDaily x → CanPlaySimpleSongs x := by
  intro x hx
  have hm : DevelopMuscleMemory x := A1 x hx
  exact A2 x hm

-- Either someone was practicing the basic chords daily, or they were focused on learning music theory, or both.
axiom A3 : ∀ x : Person, PracticeDaily x ∨ FocusOnTheory x

-- If someone learned music theory, then they gained knowledge about song structure.
axiom A4 : ∀ x : Person, LearnedTheory x → KnowledgeSongStructure x
-- Gaining this knowledge about song structure enabled them to analyze and understand how songs are composed.
axiom A5 : ∀ x : Person, KnowledgeSongStructure x → AnalyzeUnderstandComposition x

-- We are asked: If Amy cannot play any songs yet, does she have knowledge about song structure?
-- To answer "No", we would need to prove ¬KnowledgeSongStructure Amy (possibly from the assumption CannotPlayAnySongsYet Amy),
-- or at least ¬(CannotPlayAnySongsYet Amy → KnowledgeSongStructure Amy).
-- From the given axioms, there is no link from "cannot play any songs yet" to lack of knowledge,
-- and no implication from focusing on theory to having learned theory.
-- Hence, we cannot derive the negation of the statement from the premises.
-- Cannot prove ¬KnowledgeSongStructure Amy nor ¬(CannotPlayAnySongsYet Amy → KnowledgeSongStructure Amy) from given axioms.
