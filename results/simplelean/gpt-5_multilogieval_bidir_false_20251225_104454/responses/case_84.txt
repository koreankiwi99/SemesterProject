-- If someone practiced new melodies daily, they expanded their repertoire.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, PracticedNewMelodiesDaily x → ExpandedRepertoire x
-- If someone had more material, they could produce enough songs for an album.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, HadMoreMaterial x → EnoughSongsForAlbum x
-- So if someone practiced new melodies daily, they could compose an album.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, PracticedNewMelodiesDaily x → ComposedAlbum x

-- Either the musician practiced new melodies or they jammed with friends (or both).
axiom T1 : PracticedNewMelodiesDaily Musician ∨ JammedWithFriends Musician

-- If someone jammed with friends, they gained inspiration from collaboration.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, JammedWithFriends x → InspiredFromCollaboration x
-- If someone felt inspired, their creativity flourished.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, InspiredFromCollaboration x → CreativityFlourished x

-- Target statement to negate would be: (¬ReleasedAlbumThisYear Sarah → CreativityFlourished Sarah)
-- Its negation is: ¬(¬ReleasedAlbumThisYear Sarah → CreativityFlourished Sarah),
-- which is equivalent to (¬ReleasedAlbumThisYear Sarah) ∧ ¬CreativityFlourished Sarah.
-- From the given axioms, we have no information about Sarah's releasing an album
-- or Sarah's creativity; nor any link from composing to releasing.
-- Therefore, we cannot derive the negation of the target statement.
-- Cannot prove ¬(¬ReleasedAlbumThisYear Sarah → CreativityFlourished Sarah) from given axioms.
