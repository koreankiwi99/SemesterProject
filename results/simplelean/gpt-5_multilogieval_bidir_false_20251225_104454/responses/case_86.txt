-- If someone studies hard, they get good grades.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, StudiesHard x → GoodGrades x
-- If there is a snowstorm, then school is canceled.
axiom R2 : Snowstorm → SchoolCanceled
-- Either Priya studied hard, or school was not called off.
axiom R3 : StudiesHard Priya ∨ ¬SchoolCanceled
-- If a student gets good grades, their parents are proud.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, GoodGrades x → ParentsProud x
-- When parents are proud, they take their kids out for ice cream.
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, ParentsProud x → IceCream x

-- From the premises, we can prove: if there was a snowstorm, Priya's parents took her out for ice cream.

-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation ¬(Snowstorm → IceCream Priya).
