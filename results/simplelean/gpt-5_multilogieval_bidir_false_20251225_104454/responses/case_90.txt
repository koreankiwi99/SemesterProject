axiom Winning : Prop
axiom Loud : Prop
axiom Rivalry : Prop
axiom Invested : Prop
axiom Electric : Prop
axiom Unforgettable : Prop

axiom R1 : Winning → Loud
axiom R2 : Rivalry → Invested
axiom R3 : Winning ∨ Rivalry
axiom R4 : Loud → Electric
axiom R5 : Electric → Unforgettable

-- From the premises, we can actually prove the statement:
theorem electric_if_not_invested : (¬Invested) → Electric := by
  intro hNotI
  -- From ¬Invested and Rivalry → Invested, get ¬Rivalry
  have hNotR : ¬Rivalry := by
    intro hR
    exact hNotI (R2 hR)
  -- From Winning ∨ Rivalry and ¬Rivalry, deduce Winning
  have hW : Winning := by
    cases R3 with
    | inl hw => exact hw
    | inr hR => exact False.elim (hNotR hR)
  -- Then Loud and hence Electric
  exact R4 (R1 hW)

-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation of the statement.
