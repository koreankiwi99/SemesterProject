axiom PracticeHard : Prop
axiom Prepared : Prop
axiom Injured : Prop
axiom CanPlay : Prop
axiom Win : Prop
axiom Celebrate : Prop

axiom R1 : PracticeHard → Prepared
axiom R2 : Injured → ¬CanPlay
axiom R3 : PracticeHard ∨ ¬Injured
axiom R4 : Prepared → Win
axiom R5 : Win → Celebrate

-- From the premises we can actually derive: If the star player is injured, the team will celebrate.
theorem injured_implies_celebrate : Injured → Celebrate := by
  intro hI
  cases R3 with
  | inl hP =>
    have hPrep : Prepared := R1 hP
    have hWin : Win := R4 hPrep
    exact R5 hWin
  | inr hNotI =>
    have hFalse : False := hNotI hI
    exact False.elim hFalse

-- Therefore, we cannot prove the negation ¬(Injured → Celebrate) from the given premises.
