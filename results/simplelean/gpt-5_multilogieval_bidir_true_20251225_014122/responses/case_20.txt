axiom Influence : obj → Prop
axiom Motivated : obj → Prop

-- If someone works hard, they get promotions.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, WorkHard x → Promotion x
-- If someone impresses their bosses, they gain influence.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Impress x → Influence x
-- Either someone did not get a promotion, or someone did not gain influence.
axiom R3 : (∃ x : obj, ¬ Promotion x) ∨ (∃ x : obj, ¬ Influence x)
-- If someone is motivated, they work hard.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Motivated x → WorkHard x

-- Given: Mark impresses his bosses.
axiom T1 : Impress Mark

-- We can derive that Mark gains influence.
theorem mark_influence : Influence Mark := R2 Mark T1

-- There is no given rule to derive Motivated Mark from Impress or Influence.
-- Hence, we cannot prove Motivated Mark from the provided axioms.
