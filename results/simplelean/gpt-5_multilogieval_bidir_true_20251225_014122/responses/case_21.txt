axiom obj : Type
axiom Linda : obj

axiom Cold : obj → Prop
axiom Chill : obj → Prop
axiom Layers : obj → Prop     -- "adding layers"
axiom Heat : obj → Prop       -- "adjusting the thermostat" (turn up the heat)

-- If someone is cold, they should put on more layers.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Cold x → Layers x
-- If someone feels a chill, they should turn up the heat.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Chill x → Heat x

-- Given: Linda is either not adding layers or not adjusting the thermostat.
axiom H : ¬ Layers Linda ∨ ¬ Heat Linda

-- From the given, we can only derive that Linda is not cold or not feeling a chill.
theorem not_cold_or_not_chill : ¬ Cold Linda ∨ ¬ Chill Linda :=
by
  have c1 : ¬ Layers Linda → ¬ Cold Linda :=
    fun nLayers => fun hCold => nLayers (R1 Linda hCold)
  have c2 : ¬ Heat Linda → ¬ Chill Linda :=
    fun nHeat => fun hChill => nHeat (R2 Linda hChill)
  cases H with
  | inl nLayers =>
      apply Or.inl
      exact c1 nLayers
  | inr nHeat =>
      apply Or.inr
      exact c2 nHeat

-- Cannot prove Cold Linda from the given axioms and assumption H.
