-- If a city experiences a drought, authorities should implement water restrictions.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Drought x → WaterLimits x
-- Drought conditions require rationing water usage.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Drought x → Rationing x

-- Statement to evaluate: Either the city did not enforce water limits, or it did not ration water usage.
axiom Hdisj : ¬ WaterLimits City ∨ ¬ Rationing City

-- From the disjunction and the implications of drought, we can derive that the city is not undergoing a drought.
theorem not_drought_city : ¬ Drought City := by
  intro hD
  apply Or.elim Hdisj
  · intro hNotWL
    have hWL : WaterLimits City := R1 City hD
    exact hNotWL hWL
  · intro hNotR
    have hR : Rationing City := R2 City hD
    exact hNotR hR

-- Therefore, Drought City cannot be proven; in fact, we have proved its negation.
