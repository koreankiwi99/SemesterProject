axiom obj : Type
axiom Mark : obj

axiom WakesEarly : obj → Prop
axiom Energized : obj → Prop
axiom PlansWell : obj → Prop
axiom Productive : obj → Prop
axiom SelfDisciplined : obj → Prop

-- From the context:
-- If someone wakes up early, they feel energized.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, WakesEarly x → Energized x
-- If someone plans their day, they are productive.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, PlansWell x → Productive x
-- If someone has self-discipline, they wake up early.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, SelfDisciplined x → WakesEarly x

-- Given statement: Mark plans his day well.
axiom T1 : PlansWell Mark

-- We can derive that Mark is productive.
theorem mark_productive : Productive Mark := by
  exact R2 Mark T1

-- However, there is no rule that allows concluding SelfDisciplined from PlansWell.
-- Thus, we cannot derive SelfDisciplined Mark from the given axioms.
