axiom obj : Type
axiom T : obj  -- the team

-- Predicates
axiom LostImportant : obj → Prop
axiom LostBig : obj → Prop
axiom Disappointed : obj → Prop
axiom Demoralized : obj → Prop

-- Premises from context
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, LostImportant x → Disappointed x
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, LostBig x → Demoralized x

-- Statement to evaluate says players are neither disappointed nor demoralized
axiom H1 : ¬ Disappointed T
axiom H2 : ¬ Demoralized T

-- "Significant" modeled as important or big

-- From the given negations, we can show the team did NOT lose a significant game
