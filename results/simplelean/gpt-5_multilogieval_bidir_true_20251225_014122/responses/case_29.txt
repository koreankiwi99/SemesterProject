axiom FraudSuspected : obj → Prop
axiom CheckCredit : obj → Prop
axiom ContactBank : obj → Prop

-- If someone suspects identity theft, they should check their credit report.
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, SuspectsIDTheft x → CheckCredit x
-- If fraud is suspected, they should contact their bank.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, FraudSuspected x → ContactBank x

-- Given: Either Ty did not verify his credit report or did not get in touch with his bank.
axiom H : ¬ CheckCredit Ty ∨ ¬ ContactBank Ty

-- From these assumptions, we cannot derive SuspectsIDTheft Ty.
-- The implications only go from suspicion to action, and the provided disjunction
-- is about the negation of actions, which at best can imply the negation of the corresponding suspicions.
-- Hence, SuspectsIDTheft Ty is not provable from the given premises.
