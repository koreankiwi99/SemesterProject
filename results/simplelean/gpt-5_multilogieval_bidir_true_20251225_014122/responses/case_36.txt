axiom Person : Type
axiom Computer : Type
axiom Mary : Person
axiom MaryPC : Computer
axiom Uses : Person → Computer → Prop
axiom UsesMary : Uses Mary MaryPC

axiom HavingProblems : Person → Prop
axiom Restarted : Person → Prop
axiom InstalledLatest : Person → Prop
axiom Issues : Computer → Prop

-- Context rules
axiom R1 : ∀ p : Person, HavingProblems p → Restarted p
axiom R2 : ∀ c : Computer, Issues c → ∀ p : Person, Uses p c → InstalledLatest p

-- Given statement to evaluate
axiom disj : ¬ Restarted Mary ∨ ¬ InstalledLatest Mary

-- Goal would be: HavingProblems Mary
-- From the given premises, we cannot derive HavingProblems Mary.
-- The rules only state what should happen if there are problems/issues,
-- but the disjunction about Mary not performing an action does not imply she had problems.
-- Therefore, we cannot prove HavingProblems Mary.
