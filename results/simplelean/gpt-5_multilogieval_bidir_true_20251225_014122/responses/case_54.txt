axiom S P C R B : Prop
-- S: team scores early
-- P: crowd is pumped up
-- C: crowd starts cheering loudly
-- R: they play their rival team
-- B: there is a lot of booing

axiom h1 : S → P          -- If the team scores early, the crowd gets pumped up.
axiom h2 : P → C          -- If the crowd gets pumped up, they start cheering loudly.
axiom h3 : S ∨ R          -- Either the team scores early or they play their rival.
axiom h4 : P → B          -- If the crowd is pumped up, there will be a lot of booing.
axiom notC : ¬ C          -- The crowd did not start cheering loudly.

-- Consequences we can derive:
theorem notP : ¬ P := fun p => notC (h2 p)
theorem notS : ¬ S := fun s => notC (h2 (h1 s))

-- From these premises and notC we cannot derive B.

axiom S : Prop  -- team scores early
axiom P : Prop  -- crowd is pumped up
axiom C : Prop  -- crowd starts cheering loudly
axiom R : Prop  -- they play their rival team
axiom B : Prop  -- there is a lot of booing

axiom h1 : S → P          -- If the team scores early, the crowd gets pumped up.
axiom h2 : P → C          -- If the crowd gets pumped up, they start cheering loudly.
axiom h3 : S ∨ R          -- Either the team scores early or they play their rival (or both).
axiom h4 : P → B          -- If the crowd is pumped up, there will be a lot of booing.
axiom notC : ¬ C          -- The crowd did not start cheering loudly.

theorem notP : ¬ P := by
  intro p
  exact notC (h2 p)

theorem notS : ¬ S := by
  intro s
  exact notC (h2 (h1 s))

theorem haveR : R := by
  cases h3 with
  | inl s => exact False.elim (notS s)
  | inr r => exact r

-- From these premises (notably only h4 links booing to P) and notP, we cannot derive B.
