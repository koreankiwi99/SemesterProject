axiom City : Type
axiom Dallas : City

axiom HeavyRain : City → Prop
axiom ExcessiveRain : City → Prop
axiom ReservoirOverflow : City → Prop
axiom Flooding : City → Prop

-- Contextual rules:
axiom R1 : ∀ c : City, ExcessiveRain c → ReservoirOverflow c
axiom R2 : ∀ c : City, ReservoirOverflow c → Flooding c

-- Statement to evaluate provides: There is heavy rainfall in Dallas.
axiom HR_Dallas : HeavyRain Dallas

-- We cannot derive Flooding Dallas from HeavyRain Dallas without a premise linking HeavyRain to ExcessiveRain.
-- No theorem proving Flooding Dallas can be completed from the given axioms.
