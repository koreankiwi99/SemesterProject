-- If the wood is of high quality, then if the joints are precise, the product is sturdy and long-lasting
axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, HighQuality x → (Precise x → (Sturdy x ∧ LongLasting x))

-- Facts about this particular bookshelf
axiom T_precise : Precise Bookshelf
axiom T_not_sturdy : ¬ Sturdy Bookshelf
axiom T_not_long : ¬ LongLasting Bookshelf

-- From the rule and facts, we can derive that the wood was NOT high quality
theorem not_high_quality : ¬ HighQuality Bookshelf := by
  intro hq
  have h := R1 Bookshelf hq
  have h2 := h T_precise
  have hs : Sturdy Bookshelf := And.left h2
  exact T_not_sturdy hs

-- Cannot prove HighQuality Bookshelf from given axioms; in fact we proved its negation.
