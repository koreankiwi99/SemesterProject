axiom obj : Type
axiom Lebron : obj

axiom TrainsHard : obj → Prop
axiom Focused : obj → Prop
axiom BestPerformance : obj → Prop

-- Context rule: If a player trains hard, then if they are focused, they perform to the best of their ability.
axiom Rule : ∀ x : obj, TrainsHard x → Focused x → BestPerformance x

-- Given statements about Lebron
axiom Focused_Lebron : Focused Lebron
axiom NotBest_Lebron : ¬ BestPerformance Lebron

-- From the context and given facts we can derive that Lebron did NOT train hard.
theorem not_trains_hard_Lebron : ¬ TrainsHard Lebron := by
  intro hTH
  have hBest : BestPerformance Lebron := Rule Lebron hTH Focused_Lebron
  exact NotBest_Lebron hBest

-- We cannot prove TrainsHard Lebron from the given premises.
-- In fact, we proved its negation above.
