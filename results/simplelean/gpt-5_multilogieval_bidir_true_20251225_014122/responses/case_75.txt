axiom obj : Type
axiom LizCar : obj

axiom PreventiveMaintenance : obj → Prop
axiom QualityParts : obj → Prop
axiom LongServiceLife : obj → Prop

-- Mechanics' rule: if preventive maintenance is done, then if quality parts are used, the car will have a long service life.
axiom rule : ∀ c : obj, PreventiveMaintenance c → (QualityParts c → LongServiceLife c)

-- Given facts about Liz's car
axiom Liz_QP : QualityParts LizCar
axiom Liz_notLong : ¬ LongServiceLife LizCar

-- From the rule and the facts, we can derive that preventive maintenance was NOT done on Liz's car.
theorem Liz_notPM : ¬ PreventiveMaintenance LizCar := by
  intro pm
  have h : QualityParts LizCar → LongServiceLife LizCar := rule LizCar pm
  have long : LongServiceLife LizCar := h Liz_QP
  exact Liz_notLong long

-- Cannot prove PreventiveMaintenance LizCar from the given axioms; in fact, we proved its negation.
