-- If it is the weekend coming up, then Alex will relax.
axiom R1 : Weekend → Relax Alex
-- If someone finishes their tasks, then they have a clear mind.
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, FinishTasks x → ClearMind x
-- If someone is organized, then they finish their tasks.
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Organized x → FinishTasks x
-- If someone made a to-do list, then they are organized.
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, ToDoList x → Organized x
-- Either the weekend is coming, or Alex does not have a clear mind.
axiom D1 : Weekend ∨ ¬ ClearMind Alex

-- From "Alex does not relax", we can derive "Alex did not make a to-do list".
