==================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---
The reasoning involves translating the given context into logical propositions and proving the implication: if Lauren does not run races faster, then she focuses on flexibility to prevent injury.

### Propositions:
- `T`: Trained hard weekly (at sprinting)
- `S`: Did sprint workouts several times a week
- `I`: Speed improved
- `R`: Run races faster
- `E`: Stretched regularly after runs
- `V`: Took recovery seriously
- `F`: Focused on muscle flexibility to prevent injury

### Axioms from Context:
1. `S → I` (Sprint workouts improve speed)
2. `I → R` (Improved speed allows faster races)
3. `T → R` (Training hard weekly improves race times)
4. `T ∨ E` (Trained hard or stretched or both)
5. `E → V` (Stretching means taking recovery seriously)
6. `V → F` (Taking recovery seriously focuses on flexibility)

### Question:
Prove `¬R → F` (If not running races faster, then focusing on flexibility).

### Proof:
- Assume `¬R` (Lauren does not run races faster).
- From axiom 3 (`T → R`), by contraposition: `¬R → ¬T`. Thus, `¬T`.
- From axiom 4 (`T ∨ E`) and `¬T`, we get `E` (disjunctive syllogism).
- From axiom 5 (`E → V`), `E` implies `V`.
- From axiom 6 (`V → F`), `V` implies `F`.
- Therefore, `¬R → F` holds.

### Lean Formalization:
<lean>
axiom T : Prop
axiom S : Prop
axiom I : Prop
axiom R : Prop
axiom E : Prop
axiom V : Prop
axiom F : Prop

axiom A1 : S → I
axiom A2 : I → R
axiom A3 : T → R
axiom A4 : T ∨ E
axiom A5 : E → V
axiom A6 : V → F

theorem q : ¬R → F :=
  fun hnr : ¬R =>
  have nt : ¬T := mt A3 hnr  -- ¬R → ¬T by contraposition of A3
  have e : E := or_elim A4 (fun t => False.elim (nt t)) id  -- From T∨E and ¬T, get E
  have v : V := A5 e         -- E → V
  show F from A6 v           -- V → F
</lean>

The theorem is proven in Lean, confirming the implication.

ANSWER: Yes

--- Iteration 2 ---
The corrected Lean code uses pattern matching to handle the disjunction `T ∨ E` instead of `or_elim`. The proof shows that if Lauren does not run races faster (`¬R`), she must focus on flexibility to prevent injury (`F`), using the given axioms.

<lean>
axiom T : Prop  -- Trained hard weekly
axiom S : Prop  -- Did sprint workouts several times a week
axiom I : Prop  -- Speed improved
axiom R : Prop  -- Run races faster
axiom E : Prop  -- Stretched regularly after runs
axiom V : Prop  -- Took recovery seriously
axiom F : Prop  -- Focused on muscle flexibility to prevent injury

axiom A1 : S → I  -- Sprint workouts improve speed
axiom A2 : I → R  -- Improved speed allows faster races
axiom A3 : T → R  -- Training hard weekly improves race times
axiom A4 : T ∨ E  -- Trained hard or stretched (or both)
axiom A5 : E → V  -- Stretching means taking recovery seriously
axiom A6 : V → F  -- Taking recovery seriously focuses on flexibility

theorem q : ¬R → F :=
  fun hnr : ¬R =>  -- Assume Lauren does not run races faster
  have nt : ¬T := fun t => hnr (A3 t)  -- Contraposition: ¬R implies ¬T
  have e : E :=  -- Derive E from T ∨ E and ¬T
    match A4 with
    | Or.inl t => False.elim (nt t)  -- T case leads to contradiction
    | Or.inr e => e                 -- E case directly provides proof
  end
  have v : V := A5 e  -- E implies V
  show F from A6 v    -- V implies F
</lean>

The proof is valid:  
1. `¬R` implies `¬T` (by contraposition of `A3`).  
2. `T ∨ E` and `¬T` imply `E` (disjunctive syllogism via pattern matching).  
3. `E` implies `V` (by `A5`).  
4. `V` implies `F` (by `A6`).  

Thus, `¬R → F` holds.

ANSWER: Yes

--- Iteration 3 ---
The corrected Lean code removes the erroneous `end` keyword and properly structures the `match` expression. The proof demonstrates that if Lauren does not run races faster (`¬R`), she must focus on flexibility (`F`) based on the given axioms.

<lean>
axiom T : Prop  -- Trained hard weekly
axiom S : Prop  -- Did sprint workouts several times a week
axiom I : Prop  -- Speed improved
axiom R : Prop  -- Run races faster
axiom E : Prop  -- Stretched regularly after runs
axiom V : Prop  -- Took recovery seriously
axiom F : Prop  -- Focused on muscle flexibility to prevent injury

axiom A1 : S → I  -- Sprint workouts improve speed
axiom A2 : I → R  -- Improved speed allows faster races
axiom A3 : T → R  -- Training hard weekly improves race times
axiom A4 : T ∨ E  -- Trained hard or stretched (or both)
axiom A5 : E → V  -- Stretching means taking recovery seriously
axiom A6 : V → F  -- Taking recovery seriously focuses on flexibility

theorem q : ¬R → F :=
  fun hnr : ¬R =>  -- Assume Lauren does not run races faster
  have nt : ¬T := fun t => hnr (A3 t)  -- ¬R implies ¬T (contraposition of A3)
  have e : E :=  -- Derive E from T ∨ E and ¬T
    match A4 with
    | Or.inl t => False.elim (nt t)  -- T case contradicts nt
    | Or.inr e => e                 -- E case directly gives E
  have v : V := A5 e  -- E implies V
  A6 v  -- V implies F
</lean>

**Proof explanation:**  
1. Assume `¬R` (Lauren doesn't run races faster).  
2. `A3` (T → R) implies `¬T` by contraposition.  
3. `A4` (T ∨ E) with `¬T` forces `E` (disjunctive syllogism via pattern matching).  
4. `A5` (E → V) gives `V`.  
5. `A6` (V → F) concludes `F`.  

The theorem `¬R → F` is successfully proven.
