--- Iteration 1 ---
The reasoning involves several implications and a disjunction. We define propositions:
- `W`: Weather report predicts rain.
- `U`: Nick takes an umbrella.
- `M`: It's March Madness season.
- `H`: Alex hosts a basketball watching party.
- `N`: Living room gets very noisy.
- `C`: Neighbors complain about noise.

Given:
1. If `W` then `U` (`W → U`).
2. If `M` then `H` (`M → H`).
3. Either `W` or not `H` (`W ∨ ¬H`).
4. If `U` and `M`, then `N` (`U ∧ M → N`).
5. If `N` then `C` (`N → C`).

We need to prove: If `M` then `C` (`M → C`).

Proof:
- Assume `M` (March Madness season).
- From (2), `M → H`, so `H` (Alex hosts a party).
- From (3), `W ∨ ¬H`. Since `H` is true, `¬H` is false, so `W` must be true (weather report predicts rain).
- From (1), `W → U`, so `U` (Nick takes an umbrella).
- Now, `U` and `M` are both true, so by (4), `U ∧ M → N`, thus `N` (living room gets noisy).
- From (5), `N → C`, so `C` (neighbors complain).

Therefore, `M → C` holds.
