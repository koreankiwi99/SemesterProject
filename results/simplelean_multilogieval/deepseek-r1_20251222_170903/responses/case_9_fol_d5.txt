==================================================

--- Iteration 1 ---
The reasoning from the context can be formalized in Lean by defining propositions and proving the required theorem. The question asks whether John's soil quality is high (i.e., soil quality improves) if his garden does not attract bees and butterflies. The proof shows that under the given hypotheses, the absence of bees and butterflies implies John used organic fertilizers, which in turn implies improved soil quality.

<lean>
variable (aw : Prop) -- adequate water
variable (bb : Prop) -- bloom brightly
variable (abb : Prop) -- attract bees and butterflies
variable (of : Prop) -- use organic fertilizers
variable (si : Prop) -- soil improves

theorem answer_affirmative
  (H1 : aw → bb)                  -- Watering adequately makes plants bloom
  (H2 : bb → abb)                 -- Blooming attracts bees/butterflies
  (H3 : aw ∨ of)                  -- Either adequate water or organic fertilizers
  (H4 : of → si)                  -- Organic fertilizers improve soil
  : ¬abb → si                     -- If no bees/butterflies, then soil improves
:= by
  intro no_bees                   -- Assume ¬abb
  have no_aw : ¬aw := by          -- Prove ¬aw
    intro water_adequate
    apply no_bees                 -- Contradiction: aw → abb (by H1 and H2)
    exact H2 (H1 water_adequate)
  cases H3 with                   -- Case split on aw ∨ of
  | inl water => contradiction    -- aw case contradicts no_aw
  | inr fertilizer =>             -- of case implies si via H4
    exact H4 fertilizer
</lean>

This proof demonstrates that given:
1. Adequate watering causes blooming, and blooming attracts bees/butterflies
2. John either waters adequately, uses organic fertilizers, or both
3. Organic fertilizers improve soil quality

then the absence of bees/butterflies implies John did not water adequately (by the first two implications), forcing the "organic fertilizers" case from the disjunction, which directly implies improved soil quality.
