We formalize the scenario with persons, exams, and predicates.
We include the causal chain: studying hard → confident → did well → satisfied.
We encode the given disjunction about Alex and biology, and leave the vague "may cancel" unmodeled as it provides no usable implication.
We attempt to derive the target: SevereWeather → Satisfied Alex History. This cannot be derived from the given premises because nothing connects severe weather or studying biology to satisfaction on the history exam.

We cannot derive Target from the premises above:
- The chain study → confident → well → satisfied applies only to the same exam studied.
- The given disjunction mentions studying for Biology or no cancellation, which does not inform History.
- Severe weather provides no link to performance or satisfaction on the History exam.

Hence, Target remains unproven from these premises.

We encode the given disjunction about Alex and biology, and do not encode "may cancel" as it provides no usable implication.
We show some derived consequences but cannot derive the target: SevereWeather → Satisfied Alex History.
